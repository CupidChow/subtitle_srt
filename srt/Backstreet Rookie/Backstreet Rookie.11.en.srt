-What else?
-What else?

635
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,590
What else...

636
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,330
Let's work hard and make this
a successful convenience store. Okay?

637
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,030
Let's do this.

638
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,170
Okay!

639
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,970
I was going to let this slide.

640
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,510
But when I was in the military,
I was a drill sergeant. I taught rules.

641
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,910
Straighten it.

642
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,780
-My gosh, you're so petty.
-Let me teach you.

643
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,510
I'm not being petty.
I don't do this to anyone.

644
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,910
You're getting special treatment.

645
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,510
Just like this. Put your thumb
next to your index finger.

646
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,080
All right.

647
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,290
Lower your shoulders.

648
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,760
There.

649
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,300
Why are you giving me special treatment?

650
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,930
Well, because you're...

651
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,640
Because you're a special employee.

652
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,050
That's how you salute, okay?

653
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,780
This is mine, so I'm going to eat it.

654
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:47,560
My gosh, he thinks I'm special,
so he got me a matching shirt?

655
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,700
I can't believe we have matching shirts.

656
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,770
I should wear this every day.

657
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,540
My goodness.

658
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,010
Well, if you think about it,

659
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,480
she really is a special person.

660
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:12,150
She's a special person
who brings me watermelon.

661
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,960
Being a special person is the same thing
as being a special employee.

662
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,160
[Mr. Choi.]

663
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,900
[I really love this shirt. It's the best!]

664
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,270
[But it's really hot.]

665
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,830
Sir.

666
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,860
Goodness. Here.

667
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,240
I'm sorry for asking you to come
so early in the morning.

668
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,170
But must I do that thing
for the convenience store brand?

669
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,780
Ji-wook, it's too late to reject it now.

670
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,410
We already told the head office
that you're going to do it.

671
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,980
We already discussed this yesterday.

672
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,820
I don't want to do it in Gangnam.
Can't we do it somewhere else?

673
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,350
What?

674
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,920
The Shinseong-dong branch in Jongno-gu?

675
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,190
Why there?

676
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,260
His friend works there.

677
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,560
The best employee and promotion queen?

678
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,930
That place isn't fit for the event.

679
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,570
I also said the same thing,
but Ji-wook can be very stubborn.

680
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,810
Still, we can't do it there.
Please convince him.

681
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,080
I'm sure you want to keep working with us.

682
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,220
No, let's try doing it
at the branch in Shinseong-dong.

683
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,590
Director Yoo.

684
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,920
Kang Ji-wook is the most important part
of our event.

685
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,920
The location shouldn't matter.

686
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:00,560
We should let him do it where he wants
in order to get better content.

687
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,300
I'll let you know after we check
with our Shinseong-dong branch.

688
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,330
Please relay the message to Mr. Kang.

689
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,340
Okay, I'll be off then.

690
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,440
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

691
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,410
That was unnecessary.

692
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,650
There's no reason to avoid him.
We're trying to do business.

693
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:24,890
Don't worry. This is my first project
after getting promoted.

694
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,890
I just want to do a good job.

695
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,920
Okay. I wish you good luck.

696
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,900
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

697
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,170
Let's take a photo
to commemorate our matching uniforms.

698
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,070
Why just take 1 photo?
Go ahead and take 2.

699
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,210
-Open your vest first.
-What...

700
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,410
-Our shirts need to show.
-Do they need to show?

701
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,710
Ready? In 1, 2, 3.

702
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,320
You're horrible at taking selfies. Look.

703
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,290
This is what you need to do.
You need to hold it far away.

704
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,990
Welcome...

705
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,970
I'm Yoo Yeon-joo, the PR director.

706
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:16,040
I'm here to discuss something
with the manager here.

707
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,940
What is it about?

708
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,950
-We're planning--
-I should throw out the expired goods.

709
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,590
We're planning--

710
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,260
Saet-byul, everything down there
needs to be thrown away.

711
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,660
Check the expiration dates.

712
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,000
Sorry about that. What is it about?

713
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,800
A couple who broke up
meets again for work.

714
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,700
If this was a drama,
they'd get back together.

715
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:53,210
They pretend like they're okay,
but they actually long for each other.

716
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,940
Do you find this amusing?

717
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:59,680
I love watching soap operas.
I like the ones that air every morning.

718
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,920
I see.

719
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,720
There's even a part-timer,
so this is a perfect love triangle.

720
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,220
She's no longer a part-timer.
She's an employee now.

721
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,990
My gosh, Dae-hyun is unbelievable.

722
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,830
He must've used his power
to win her heart.

723
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,960
That cunning punk.

724
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,640
You make it sound so fun.

725
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,840
I know this is a very last-minute offer.

726
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,970
If you don't want to do it,
you're free to refuse.

727
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:32,010
It'll benefit our convenience store,
so there's no reason for me to refuse.

728
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,010
Does that mean you're going to do it?

729
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,750
But I don't think
I should decide this on my own.

730
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,860
I'll discuss it with Ms. Jung Saet-byul,
our official store manager.

731
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,130
Once we make a decision,
I'll call the head office.

732
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,930
Bye, then.

733
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,180
Saet-byul.

734
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,350
Hey, official store manager.

735
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,620
Yes?

736
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,820
Can we discuss something?

737
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,730
Let me throw this away first.

738
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,200
I know you heard everything.

739
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,960
[Expired]

740
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,930
Come over here.

741
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,400
Come here.

742
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,840
Aphrodite!

743
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:35,840
What took you so long
to appear in my life?

744
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,480
Fire Volcano is here.

745
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,320
♫ Let's be a man ♫

746
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:51,630
♫ And dress up in a suit ♫

747
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,970
Okay. Hello, Aphrodite.

748
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,740
I look so pretty.

749
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,310
♫ Today ♫

750
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,750
♫ I feel great ♫

751
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,280
My gosh, why does this keep happening?

752
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,990
This isn't that bad.

753
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,590
Hello, I'm Aphrodite... My gosh.

754
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,660
Why does it sound so awkward?

755
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,060
Aphrodite.

756
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,860
I wasn't even this nervous

757
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,070
when I got kicked out of school
and when I returned to school.

758
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,370
Aphrodite.

759
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,700
Gosh, this won't do.

760
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,140
And to finish off my look,
I need my handbag.

761
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,450
But wait. Aphrodite.

762
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,980
How are we going to recognize each other?

763
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,090
Let's bring a rose.

764
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,390
Great. You can bring a red rose

765
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,190
since you're so passionate.

766
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:04,260
Then you can bring a blue rose
since you're so cool.

767
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,430
-Okay.
-Okay.

768
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,070
A blue rose.

769
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,170
Let's not forget that. Here.

770
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,440
Who am I going to meet today?

771
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:20,710
Who? Aphrodite!

772
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:25,350
♫ I'm off to meet her ♫

773
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,960
Ms. Jung, here's your coffee.

774
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,840
Saet-byul, why are you so down?
This isn't like you. You're always bright.

775
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,810
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

776
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,510
You were going to accept the offer anyway,
weren't you?

777
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,220
What do you mean?

778
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,220
Earlier, I was excited
because it felt like

779
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,760
you really cared about me.

780
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,430
But now that I think about it,

781
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:08,100
I feel like you used me
to make her feel rejected.

782
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,530
I feel like you did that
to make her feel bad.

783
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,930
I didn't know you'd think of it like that.

784
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,470
I don't think we should do this.
I'll call her and say we won't do it.

785
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,400
No, wait!

786
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:22,510
Were you really
going to follow my decision?

787
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:25,110
-Yes.
-Why?

788
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,520
Why do you think? They only asked us
because of Kang Ji-wook.

789
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,150
And he chose this place because of you,
so your decision mattered the most to me.

790
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:34,890
Is that so?

791
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,060
Will you be okay?

792
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,900
Why? Are you worried
I might not be over her?

793
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,000
Don't worry. I'm totally over her now

794
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,640
thanks to someone I know.

795
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,070
Me?

796
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,670
Thank you, Saet-byul,

797
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,710
for coming to the beach that day.

798
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,890
Gosh, I wouldn't have agreed to do it
if I was still a part-timer.

799
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,220
But now that I'm a regular employee,

800
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,160
I can no longer refuse
since it'll benefit our store.

801
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,960
So are we going to do it?

802
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,700
Should we not? Should we do it?

803
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,500
If we're really going to do this,
let's really do our best.

804
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,200
Let's show everyone

805
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,570
what a great place
this Shinseong-dong branch is.

806
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:26,810
Of course.

807
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,220
-Flower.
-What?

808
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,740
My goodness, exactly.

809
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,670
She's a fan of your work?
Are you sure it's a girl?

810
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,510
You called your friends and pretended

811
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,680
to be a girl to tease them.
Don't you remember that?

812
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,650
I'll call you back a little later.
Hey, honey!

813
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,260
Gosh, he had me so startled.

814
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:43,320
My gosh, come on.
What's that annoying woman doing here?

815
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,350
Darn it.

816
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,890
My gosh, seriously?

817
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,760
Why would he show his face to people?
Does he have no conscience?

818
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,330
Is she a bottle of ketchup or something?

819
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:57,630
She's so annoying.

820
00:48:58,930 --> 00:48:59,970
Darn it.

821
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,810
No way.

822
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,680
No, it can't be.

823
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,750
I'm totally imagining things right now.

824
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:49,750
You can fall for anyone
but that monkey, Geum-bi.

[I'm Fire Volcano, the webtoon artist
that draws "Her Reggae Boy".]

829
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,200
I have a bad feeling about this.

830
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,790
Tell me I'm wrong.

831
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,830
This can't be.

832
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:37,660
This has to be a dream.

833
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,970
This is a nightmare.

00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,670
How dare you touch me, you jerk!

836
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,920
Why did it have to be you?

837
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,160
This is the worst!

838
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,370
Let me go, you thief.

839
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,700
Dae-hyun, are you cleaning?

840
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,870
Hey, Dae-hyun.

841
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,610
-Oh, gosh. What are you doing?
-Mom.

842
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,910
My goodness, what are you doing?
Let me go already.

843
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,410
-Why? Don't you like it?
-Let me go.

844
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,980
No, just let me go.

845
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,380
I get nervous
when something good happens, okay?

846
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,220
There's no need to get nervous.

847
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:11,860
What? Why did Dae-soon go
grocery shopping with you?

848
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,500
This thief came with me and made me
pay for everything like meat and japchae

849
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,600
so she could cook a birthday feast
for her husband.

850
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,900
What are you talking about?
I paid for the bean sprouts.

851
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,300
My gosh, fine. That was my mistake.

852
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:24,700
Thank you for the bean sprouts.

853
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,370
She only paid for the bean sprouts.

854
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,340
-That wench.
-I paid for the bean sprouts.

855
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,410
-I told you that so many times.
-Hey, guys.

856
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,980
-Hi.
-Hey.

857
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,780
You guys look great in your uniform.

858
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,590
-Right? Don't we look nice?
-Yes, you do.

859
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,620
Dae-hyun, where's mine?

860
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,620
-I even paid for the bean sprouts.
-Shut it.

861
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,930
Did you hear about
the shoot we're having in two days?

862
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,090
What? What are you talking about?

863
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,130
They're going to shoot a promotional video
at our store.

864
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:51,630
Kang Ji-wook is going to come.

865
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,830
-What?
-Kang Ji-wook, the actor?

866
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,000
-My goodness.
-Are you serious?

867
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,440
My gosh, really?

868
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,270
Didn't you tell them?

869
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:03,280
The head office wants to shoot
a promotional video here.

870
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,580
My gosh, is that going to make our store
famous again?

871
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:07,910
Why didn't you tell us?

872
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,020
-This is great.
-Yes, it is.

873
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,720
The person in charge is the PR director.

874
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,190
Yes?

875
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,260
Her name is Yoo Yeon-joo.

876
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,230
Is it the same person we know?

877
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,930
-Yes.
-Oh, her?

878
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,140
Let's go.

879
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:36,310
-You should have...
-Come on. Let's go.

880
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:42,280
Then will I finally get to meet Yeon-joo?

881
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,780
No, don't come.

882
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,150
Don't ever come to the shoot. Don't come.

883
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,490
You little punk.

884
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,290
I know I've been easy on you lately,
but you're starting to get on my nerves.

885
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:52,790
What? What did I do?

886
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,530
-Gosh, my meat.
-What?

887
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,900
My meat.

888
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,800
My meat is with Dad.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

889
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,540
Dad! Give me my japchae and meat!

890
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:04,670
-Dae-soon, don't come.
-The meat!

891
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:06,710
Don't come.

892
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,480
I didn't say anything because I didn't
want to tell my sister that I broke up.

893
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:19,990
Saet-byul.

894
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,360
During the shoot, should we cook the menu

895
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,820
that we invented together?

896
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:24,860
That sounds great.

897
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,990
Everyone will get shocked
at how good it tastes.

898
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,900
Then I'll to tell Mr. Kwon.

899
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,530
Okay. Yes, sir.

900
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,670
My goodness.

901
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:33,900
You did it right this time.

902
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,070
Great job.

903
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:12,140
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

904
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,640
You know you need to do way better
at the showcase, right?

905
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:16,540
-Yes.
-Yes.

906
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:19,080
Do your best, Fancy Girls!

907
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,150
-Okay, we'll do our best.
-Okay, we'll do our best.

908
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,820
-Eun-byul, come with me.
-Pardon?

909
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,990
Okay.

910
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,030
Puppy! My gosh!

911
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:33,360
You remember me.

912
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,300
Of course. Saet-byul told me.

913
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,960
You used to be so little.

914
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,270
When did you become so big?

915
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,230
You look older than Saet-byul.

916
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,640
I hate it when people say that.

917
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,770
I'm joking.

918
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:46,970
Good luck on your showcase.

919
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,580
I came to cheer for you. Good luck.

920
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,580
Good luck! Thank you, Ji-wook.

921
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,180
I'm meeting Saet-byul tomorrow.
Do you have anything to say?

922
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,520
No, I don't.
Tell her I have nothing to say.

923
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:57,380
Okay.

924
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:04,320
Saet-byul, it's me. Before I say anything,
you should thank me first.

925
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,060
Thank you for what?

926
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,790
I just met Eun-byul.

927
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:11,300
Gosh, thank you. Is she doing well?

928
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,670
I don't think you need to worry.
Are you ready for tomorrow's shoot?

929
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:16,770
Do you really have to do the shoot here?

930
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,470
You have no idea
how hard I'm working to clean the place.

931
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,710
Hey, I'm doing it against my will.

932
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,210
It'd be nice to have a friend next to me.
Don't you think?

933
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:27,380
Fine. I'll let it slide then.

934
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,920
-I have more news regarding Eun-byul.
-What's that?

935
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,060
I'll tell you tomorrow
if you're good to me.

936
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,060
-Hey, Puppy.
-See you tomorrow.

937
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:46,470
Why would I be good to you?
I should be good to Mr. Choi.

938
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:02,220
Hey, you should be cleaning.

939
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:24,700
-Hey, hurry up.
-They're here.

940
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,340
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

941
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,550
Hello, Director Yoo.

942
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:36,380
-Is everything going well?
-We're all doing our best.

943
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,550
Just a second.

944
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,890
Dae-hyun, come out here. Hurry.

945
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:46,960
Hello.

946
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,960
Mr. Choi, are you doing well?

947
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,230
Yes. Hello, sir.

948
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:57,570
Well... Long time no see.

949
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,570
Thank you for letting us
do the shoot here.

950
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,580
Or maybe I should thank
Ms. Employee of the Month.

951
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,310
I should thank you too.

952
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,720
Thanks to you,
I became a regular employee here.

953
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,750
-Thanks to me?
-I was able to focus on the store

954
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,160
after you made me lose my promotion job.

955
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:18,290
If that didn't happen,
I'd still be running around

956
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,460
trying to get a part-time job.
Right, Mr. Choi?

957
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,900
Let's hear the briefing.

958
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:29,840
Okay, sir. Kang Ji-wook will be
working at the Shingseong-dong branch...

959
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,740
-Hello.
-Kang Ji-wook is here.

960
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,870
-Hello.
-Hello.

961
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,670
-He's here.
-Hello.

962
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:39,150
My gosh, you look great today.
I guess you really are a celebrity.

963
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,020
-Will I be wearing that too?
-What?

964
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,220
This?

965
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,290
What...

966
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,830
-Here you go, Ji-wook.
-Did you get one for me?

967
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,300
Actually, I ordered two for myself

968
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,400
since we sweat a lot during the summer.

969
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,240
Thank you for this.

970
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,680
My goodness, it looks much better on you.

971
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,880
Mr. Choi, I'll do my best
for the next 25 hours.

972
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,080
Me too.

973
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:19,890
I also have a mission.

974
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:23,990
What? What mission?
No one told me about a mission.

975
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,530
It's just something personal.

976
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:27,730
Oh, it's personal?

977
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:30,300
I'm not sure
if I'll be able to help you with that.

978
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,200
Ji-wook, take this.

979
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,670
Thank you.

980
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,270
Good luck, Ji-wook.

981
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:39,770
I'll do my best.

982
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:44,680
What kind of mission does he have?

983
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,850
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

984
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,950
What do you think?
We're wearing matching shirts.

985
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:57,290
It's a uniform.
Use the right term for it, okay?

986
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,430
By the way,
what's the news regarding Eun-byul?

987
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:01,690
I don't know. Don't ask.

988
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,830
What are you talking about?
You're the one who told me...

989
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:08,130
What's wrong with you?
Come on. Tell me what it is.

990
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,840
Eun-byul and the other trainees
are having a showcase tomorrow.

991
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,540
"A showcase"? What's that?

992
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:17,980
It's when the agency gathers reporters
to promote the rookies.

993
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:21,480
Hey, that means
she's going to make a debut.

994
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:23,050
Isn't that what it means?

995
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,050
Gosh, this is so exciting.
My goodness, I'm already sweating.

996
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,860
She'll do well.
I'll keep taking care of her.

997
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:31,620
Once the showcase is over,
there will be articles about them,

998
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:33,060
and they'll be on social media.

999
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,830
You're Eun-byul's guardian angel.
Protect her well.

1000
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,000
"Eun-byul's guardian angel"? Me?

1001
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:45,810
Of course. You're the only person
who can help her.

1002
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,010
Take good care of her.

1003
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:50,680
She's my sister
which means she's your sister too.

1004
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:55,210
Hey, get down here for a moment.
Let's do our best today.

1005
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,180
-Okay.
-And tomorrow.

1006
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,120
Got it.

1007
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,650
How do I look today?

1008
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,830
It looks nice.

1009
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,900
[Store Manager Kang Ji-wook]

1010
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,610
Mr. Choi and Ms. Yoo
seem a bit awkward with each other.

1011
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,580
I guess you don't know.

1012
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:27,550
They broke up.

1013
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:29,820
Really? Why?

1014
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,720
Who cares?
What matters is that they broke up.

1015
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:36,420
Why are you so happy?

1016
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:38,930
Of course, I'm happy.

1017
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:41,860
It means I finally have a chance with him.
I've been waiting for ages...

1018
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:42,960
Hey, look.

1019
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:44,800
Mr. Choi.

1020
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,770
Good luck.

1021
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,240
Good luck.

1022
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,680
Hey, I should go tell him about Eun-byul.

1023
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:58,410
Hey, Mr. Choi!

1024
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,650
Mr. Choi!

1025
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:03,550
Saet-byul, didn't I teach you
how to do a proper salute? What's this?

1026
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,050
-Wait. There's something more important.
-What?

1027
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,590
Eun-byul is making a debut tomorrow.
She's having a showcase or something.

1028
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,590
My gosh, that's great.
Then is your sister a celebrity now?

1029
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,130
That makes you a celebrity's sister.

1030
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:17,100
Congratulations.
Hey, shouldn't we have a party?

1031
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,830
Let's do that after she makes a debut.
Let's throw a huge party.

1032
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,130
-A huge party.
-Yes.

1033
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,940
What should we eat?

1034
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,240
-Tripe, of course.
-Again?

1035
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,310
That's the only place we can go.

1036
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:38,280
If you eat too much tripe,
you might turn into one yourself.

1037
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,760
-Let's eat something nice.
-Tripe is really good.

1038
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:45,930
-Dae-hyun.
-Yes?

1039
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:47,390
Can we get rid of the waste paper?

1040
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,560
No, you can't.
I'll move that somewhere else.

1041
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:52,100
-I'll go with you.
-See you later.

1042
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,170
-Sir, let's go.
-Look over there.

1043
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,670
-Amazing.
-It's him.

1044
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,010
-Let me help.
-Seong-tae, it's okay.

1045
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,140
-Go ahead. I'll do it.
-Okay. Good luck.

1046
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,210
Okay, thanks.

1047
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,510
Let me help.

1048
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,210
That's okay, Ji-wook. I can do it alone.

1049
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,550
No, let me help.

1050
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,950
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

1051
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:13,890
I wouldn't have asked to do the shoot here
if I knew you had broken up with Ms. Yoo.

1052
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,160
Then no one would've
had to feel uncomfortable today.

1053
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:21,330
It's okay, Ji-wook.
I don't feel uncomfortable anymore.

1054
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,900
That's nonsense.

1055
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:26,600
It looks like you're using Saet-byul
to get over your ex-girlfriend.

1056
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:29,300
-And that makes me feel uncomfortable.
-What?

1057
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:32,000
You're provoking Ms. Yoo by acting like
you're close with Saet-byul.

1058
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:34,540
That's not very mature of you.

1059
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:39,380
Ji-wook, I think
there's a misunderstanding.

1060
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:41,250
If you're not planning
to date her seriously,

1061
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:43,180
please don't do anything to confuse her.

1062
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,790
I'm not saying this to you impulsively.

1063
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,560
Ji-wook.

1064
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,460
Why are you saying this to me?

1065
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,630
Because I like Saet-byul.

1066
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:09,210
What were you guys talking about?

1067
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,010
-Ji-wook told me--
-Did something happen?

1068
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,750
No, everything's fine.
The shoot is going to start soon.

1069
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:18,250
Let's go, Mr. Choi. Come on.
