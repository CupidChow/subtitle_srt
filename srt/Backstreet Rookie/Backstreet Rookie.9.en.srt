-Yeon-joo.
-Hey, Dae-hyun.

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,600
I'm sorry.
I fell asleep at the convenience store.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,130
My cell phone was on silent,
so I didn't know you called.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,700
Let's go outside and talk.

What are you talking about?
We're not done drinking our coffee.

11

No, Mom. We'll just talk outside.

12

Just a second.

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,710
Thank you for the coffee.
I'll see you next time.

14

My gosh, you came all the way here.
Why don't you stay for a bit longer?

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,250
Ma'am, I bought some hotteok.

Nice, Saet-byul!

17

You bought hotteok? How did you know
that I love hotteok?

These are for you.

Perfect. Let's eat these together

No, Mom. We need to go out and talk.

Don't be like that. Join us.

It's fine, really.

23

See? She says she's fine.
That means she has time.

Come and sit here.

Why did you have to come right now?
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

-Come here.
-Okay, Mom.

You've never met her, right?

35
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,140
This is Jung Saet-byul, the part-timer
at our convenience store.

36
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:46,870
Sorry?

Saet-byul is very polite
and great at work.

40
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:56,509
I love her like my own daughter.

-Like your own daughter?
-Yes.

If our store succeeds
and we open 2nd and 3rd branches,

I'd trust her with them.

44

No, I actually don't work--

That's how much we trust you.

Why do you keep kicking me
under the table like that?

47

She's like my daughter,
and that's why she's living at my house.

She lives here?

49
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,220
No, it's not that. I got scammed.

-Let's not talk about that.

that Saet-byul quit,

65

Is she upset
because of that useless manager?

She's too kind. She gets attached easily.

Why did you even allow him
to open a branch?

116
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,190
You should've cut him off from her
from the beginning.

122
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,880
Jung Saet-byul,

123
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,310
how did you end up like this?

124
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,990
-Sir.
-Yes?

125
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,830
What are you doing,
awake this late at night?

126
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,360
I forgot to take off the heads
for these bean sprouts,

127
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,700
so I woke up to get it done.

128
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,100
My wife wants bean sprout soup
in the morning.

129
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,140
I'll help you out.

130
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,070
It's okay. I'm almost done.

131
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,610
I think you're really amazing.

132
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,310
You're a great husband.

133
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,820
No, I'm not.

134
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,150
All my life, I could never get a job,

135
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,950
so I couldn't bring back any money
for the family.

136
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,990
The only thing I can do for my family
is to cook for them

137
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,860
and do all the chores.

138
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,270
My wife works hard every day
to sell insurance,

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,470
and Dae-hyun can't sleep well,
trying to manage his store.

140
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,870
It breaks my heart.

141
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,380
It must be nice to have a family
that worries and looks out for you

142
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,920
like you guys do.

143
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,160
Mrs. Gong also thinks of you
and Mr. Choi a lot.

144
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,130
Gosh. She thinks of me?

145
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,000
Of course. She probably looks out
for you more than you do for her.

146
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,500
-You guys are so loud.
-Ma'am!

147
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,070
My goodness, that hurts.

148
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,470
-Are you okay?
-That hurts.

149
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,540
It's so late at night.

150
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,840
What are you two doing at this hour?

151
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,680
We're preparing these bean sprouts
for you.

152
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,150
You told me that you wanted
bean sprout soup yesterday.

153
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,020
That wasn't yesterday.
It was the day before.

154
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,790
I told you that
I had bean sprout soup yesterday.

155
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,560
You told me that? Are you sure?

156
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,930
You're still so young.
How are you already forgetting things?

157
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm worried for you.

158
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,070
I'm seriously worried for you.

159
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,730
You're so naive too.

160
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,270
Wait, this is broken.

161
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,810
What's wrong with this doorknob?
Never mind, I got it.

162
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,210
That's her looking out for me, right?

163
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,950
Saet-byul, finish this up for me.

164
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,580
-Yes, I'll do it.
-Okay.

165
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,950
-Goodnight.
-Bye.

166
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,550
-Goodnight.
-Thanks.

167
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,590
That was dangerous.
Where should I put this?

168
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,490
I'll just put it here.

169
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,280
[Thank you for everything.
I hope that you'll always stay healthy.]

170
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,140
Seong-tae, is Yeon-joo at work?

171
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,940
Ms. Yoo didn't come today.

172
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,470
Director Cho came and left right away.

173
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,210
Things are looking odd.

174
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,080
Really? Okay.

175
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,760
Thank you.

176
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,440
Hello, I'm Choi Dae-hyun.

177
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,650
You're talking as if this is
our first time meeting.

178
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,380
Yes, this is our first time.

179
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,720
As Yeon-joo's boyfriend, at least.

180
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,690
What brings you here?

181
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,390
I'm here to see Yeon-joo.

182
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,130
Then why are you not calling her

183
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,730
and sitting here with me instead?

184
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,630
There has been a misunderstanding
between us recently.

185
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,140
I'll of course try my best to sort it out,

186
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,210
but I believe that it's her choice
whether to accept that or not.

187
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,980
And?

188
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,820
If you could just leave her
to make her own decision,

189
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,050
that will be greatly appreciated.

190
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,630
You're telling me to stay out of this?

191
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,700
I guess I could do that.

192
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,500
Thank you.

193
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,470
I'll come visit you another time.

194
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,510
I'll get going now.

195
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,060
Call Secretary Park!

196
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,960
Yes, ma'am.

197
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,260
-Mrs. Gong.
-Yes?

198
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,230
How have your sales been this month?

199
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,330
Oh, that. I have nothing.

200

[2016's Sales Queen Lee Yu-jin,
2018's Sales Queen Choi Won-sun]

201
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,200
I have a wish,

202
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,840
and that is to see you wear a crown

203
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,010
and be hung on this wall.

204
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,410
You're the only one who wasn't named
a Sales Queen among all the people

205
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,950
who have been working here for so long.

206
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,620
-I'm sorry.
-Take it.

207
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,960
Yes, this is Gong Boon-hee
of Precious Life Insurance.

208
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,560
Yes.

209
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,630
An annuity?

210
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,430
Yes, I'll come and see you.

211
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,300
Thank you.

212
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,170
Who is it?

213
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,370
It's someone from Pyeongchang-dong.

214
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,470
She wants to meet with me.

215
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,480
-Pyeongchang-dong?
-Yes.

216
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,920
What? You're looking to hire someone?

217
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,190
For 3,000 dollars per month
with insurance and a permanent contract?

218
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,390
Even if the job just requires driving,

219
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,960
I can't find someone right away.

220
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,330
I certainly can't find anyone
to interview today.

221
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,540
You can't just expect people
to pop out of nowhere.

222
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,910
-Here I am!
-My goodness!

223
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,280
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

224
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,180
but I hear that you're looking for someone
to hire?

225
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,550
Yes, sir.

226
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,660
But they'd like an interview today.

227
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,260
Is that right?

228
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,830
I just happen to have time.

229
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,430
You can go for an interview today?
Right now?

230
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Yes.

231
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,000
-Sure, then.
-Okay.

232
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,740
10-1?

233
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,780
This house looks enormous.

234
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,020
[10-1, Pyeongchang 8-gil]

235
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,920
Goodness.

236
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,560
Hello, ma'am.

237
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,300
I'm Insurance Planner Gong Boon-hee
of Precious Life Insurance.

238
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,560
-Have a seat.
-Yes, ma'am.

239
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,600
-Do you like tea?
-Yes, I do.

240
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,170
-That's hot.
-Oh, no.

241
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,240
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

242
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,220
By the way, how did you find me?

243
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,920
I asked for a recommendation

244
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,250
for someone who's realistic,

245
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,560
smart to understand, and diligent.

246
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,390
I don't mean to show off,

247
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,530
but I've been awarded three times
for my long service at--

248
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,430
Don't people use the annuity
for an inheritance?

249
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,570
I hear that I'm supposed to pay
10,000 dollars per month.

250
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,300
The tax laws have changed,

251
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,140
so it's not that good of a deal now.

252
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,940
I see.

253
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,480
You're very honest.

254
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:41,520
My gosh. Well, someone did introduce me
to you as a diligent worker. I must be.

255
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,450
It seems I've gotten quite lucky.

256
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,290
If I sign up to a policy with a hefty sum,

257
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,990
I'll be able to rely on the insurance too.

258
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,800
Pardon?

259
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,730
I was going to sign up to an annuity with
a monthly investment of 10,000 dollars.

260
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,170
I want one for my husband too.

261
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,640
You'll be investing 20,000 dollars
every month?

262
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,770
What is it? Is that not allowed?

263
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,450
Of course, not. My gosh.

264
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,920
Okay.

265
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,720
All right.

266
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,700
Would you like some coffee?

267
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,900
Should I? It's hot today too.

268
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,270
-Iced Americano?
-Sounds great.

269
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,370
Hold on.

270
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,940
Wait, let's see.

271
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,380
My goodness.

272
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,810
I can't right now. I'll come back.

273
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,980
Come back soon.

274
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,180
Hey, can't you come here faster, Dae-soon?

275
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,520
I need to be somewhere right now.

276
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,190
I'm here. What do you need?

277
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,690
-My gosh.
-Gosh. What is it?

278
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,330
Here. I told you
I had to be somewhere now.

279
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,300
What is it this time? Are you
meeting up with your friends again?

280
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,400
It's a totally different matter.
Let's talk later. Bye.

281
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,970
Gosh, I'm so exhausted.

282
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,240
Gosh.

283
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,620
[Don't even think about it.
Your mother is watching.]

284
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,990
Gosh, are you kidding me? Where's
the fun in taking over the counter, then?

285
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,660
Gosh. Darn it.

286
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,760
I have a daughter.
She even studied abroad.

287
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,200
She's a team leader at a conglomerate.

288
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,460
My gosh. Your daughter must be so smart.

289
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,370
But I'm not happy with her boyfriend.

290
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,540
He graduated from a university
in the rural area

291
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,700
and has a low-paying job.

292
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,610
Besides, he comes from a poor family too.

293
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,840
He says he's running a business,

294
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,040
but that's just a fancy name for it.
It's a small corner shop.

295
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,080
Oh, no. Why is she dating a guy like that?
She's out of his league.

296
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
That's my point.

297
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,050
You have to stop her.

298
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,120
It looks like she can't see things clearly
as she's head over heels for him.

299
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,630
I wasn't sure if I should
step in my daughter's business.

300
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,590
Oh, no. Don't say that, ma'am.

301
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,330
If your child's judgment is clouded,
you must take control

302
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,130
and show her the right path.

303
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,170
And that guy might be dating her
for her status.

304
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,310
People of similar backgrounds must date
to avoid any drama later on.

305
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,740
My gosh. You are precise.

306
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,310
My goodness, "precise"?

307
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,410
People must know their places.

308
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,280
Similar people ought
to be with each other.

309
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,650
He shouldn't try to turn his life around
with the help of his girlfriend.

310
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,420
No way. You can't let that be.

311
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,830
You're so bold with your words.
I'm happy that we see eye to eye.

312
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,800
Prepare the contract for me.

313
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,070
My gosh, ma'am. Thank you.

314
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,100
I'd love to recommend you
to my acquaintances.

315
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:53,010
Gosh, if you could do that for me,
I would be indebted to you.

316
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,780
Oh, my. I took up
so much of your time, didn't I?

317
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,150
I'll get going now. All right.

318
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,720
Thank you so much.

319
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,430
Bye.

320

I have a hard time
bearing with stuff like this.

But you guys are older than me,

who's more suitable for your age.

Calm down.

767
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,820
and has a hard time controlling himself.

768
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,160
Once he gets angry,
he gets out of control.

769
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,700
My gosh, he's about to burst already.

770
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,060
Look at him. His body is fuming right now.
Gosh, this is bad.

771
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,100
What are you glaring at? Get out of bed.

772

Honey.

How about we pay you 300 dollars
for what happened?

776
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:36,380
That's too little!

How about 1,000 dollars?

Let's settle with 1,000 dollars.

Yes, think of what he had to go through.

780
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,450
1,000 dollars. We won't settle with less.

-First, let me discuss it with him.

00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,430
I'm scared.

786
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,340
Isn't this enough?

787
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,670
Should I ask for less? Should I?

788
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,870
1,000 dollars is good enough.

789
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,010
So stay in character until we're done.

790
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,410
-Okay?
-Okay, okay.

791
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,650
-1,000 dollars.
-1,000 dollars.

792
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:15,250
What?

793
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,920
If you go back on your word,

794
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,920
you'll be dead.

795
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,250
-Let's go.
-Okay.

796
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,920
If we had met in the past,

797
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,830
-I would've beaten you up already.
-Gosh, he's scary.

798
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,330
-Come on.
-My gosh.

799
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,100
Goodbye.

800
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,470
Mr. Choi.

801
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,470
-Mr. Choi.
-Hey.

802
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,780
I got the guy to settle for 1,000 dollars.

803
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,580
What? "1,000 dollars"?

804
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,950
Seriously? "1,000 dollars"?
My gosh, you deducted a huge amount.

805
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,420
How did you do that?

806
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:55,390
I just got him a pretty flower
and asked him to show some mercy.

807
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,490
My gosh, you bought him...

808
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,730
-Wait a minute.
-Didn't I do a good job?

809
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,560
Why did you go there?

810
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,770
Why in the world would you buy him flowers

811
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,800
and ask him to cut the price?

812
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,700
What did you do wrong?
You didn't do anything wrong.

813
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:12,170
-You didn't.
-Well, no. But...

814
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,440
Then what are you going to do?
Are you going to fight with him?

815
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:17,380
It's better to just pay him and settle.

816
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,750
Saet-byul,
we can't just pay him and settle.

817
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:22,620
He's a habitual offender.
He'll do the same thing again.

818
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,580
Then another store
will go through the same thing.

819
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:25,690
Am I wrong?

820
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:27,520
Well...

821
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,160
Why are you scolding me?

822
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,830
I helped you out

823
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:34,060
because I know you have
a lot on your mind because of Ms. Yoo.

824
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,100
I thought I did a good job.

825
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,960
I'm not scolding you.

826
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:39,330
I'm just...

827
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:42,400
Forget about that.
That has nothing to with work.

828
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,870
Do you think I don't know
how to leave my personal life out of work?

829
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,240
I'm Choi Dae-hyun, you know.

830
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,740
Okay, fine. Good for you.

831
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,480
Do you have another idea?

832
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:57,220
I'm going to get punished
only for what I did wrong.

833
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,690
But instead,

834
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,790
that person is going to hate it.

835
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,560
What's that?

836
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,990
Tell me.

837
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,330
You don't need to know.

838
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,800
I'm not going to pay him 1,000 dollars.

839
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,700
It's not because
I think it's a waste of money.

840
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,600
You're unbelievable.

841
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,470
You could've at least thanked me.

842
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,710
-Thank you, Saet-byul.
-Forget it.

843
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:24,410
Gosh, she's upset at me.

844
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,110
Good job, Saet-byul!

845
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,720
My gosh, she's upset at me.

846
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:58,450
What's this?

847
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,310
-It's just some money.
-Why?

848
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:04,050
I don't want you going around
looking shabby.

849
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,800
[Yeon-joo, please call me.]

850
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,100
[Yeon-joo, will you please pick up?]

851
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,740
Hello, Mr. Choi.

852
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,680
Ji-wook, long time no see.

853
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,150
Where's Saet-byul?
Shouldn't she be working right now?

854
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,380
I guess she hasn't told you.

855
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,550
She quit.

856
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,020
What?

857
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,120
-She quit the part-time job?
-Yes.

858
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,960
Do you know where she lives?

859
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,730
I guess she hasn't told you this either.

860
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,200
She got scammed
and got kicked out of her house.

861
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,840
She got scammed?

862
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,970
Then where does she live?

863
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,210
Well...

864
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,080
Mr. Choi.

865
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,650
You're so indifferent to Saet-byul.

866
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,250
What?

867
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,250
You should at least show her some interest

868
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,260
considering how much she cares about you.

869
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,270
Why is he so angry at me?

870
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,900
Puppy.

871
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,540
What are you doing here?
Why is your phone turned off?

872
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,240
My phone died.

873
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:08,840
How did you know I was here?

874
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,910
Because unlike you,

875
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,650
I care about you a lot.

876
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,190
Stop worrying about Eun-byul
and start worrying about yourself.

877
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,290
There's nothing to worry about.

878
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,830
Let's go to my place.

879
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:27,890
What?

880
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,330
I don't want my friend to be homeless
and jobless at the same time.

881
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,170
Come on.

882
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,300
-Hey.
-Let's go.

883
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:40,710
Hey.

884
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,000
Come in.

885
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,600
Puppy, do you live here all by yourself?

886
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,670
Yes.

887
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,080
My gosh, you've become very successful.

888
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,040
Feel free to make yourself at home.

889
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,580
Hey, isn't that N Seoul Tower?

890
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,850
My gosh, the view is amazing.

891
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,620
Aren't you hungry?

892
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,660
I'm starving. I didn't eat dinner.

893
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,560
-Wait here for a moment.
-Okay.

894
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,230
Here.

895
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,240
The noodles taste nice.
I like the texture.

896
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:47,870
I'm a pro at making instant noodles.

897
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,710
Don't you have rice?

898
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,940
I'm microwaving it.

899
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,050
You even know how to cook rice.

900
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:59,420
Look what I got.

901
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,590
What is it?

902
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:02,960
Make a guess.

903
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,420
Just tell me.

904
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:08,600
The team manager at Eun-byul's agency
sent me her choreography video.

905
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:13,370
Really? Let me see that. Hurry.

906
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,210
Is that really Eun-byul?

907
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,420
My gosh.

908
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,490
Do I look okay?

909
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,820
My gosh, who are you?

910
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:39,590
I'm a guy who can't do the dishes
because I need to go to work.

911
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,760
Oh, I see. I'll leave them right here.
You can do the dishes after work.

912
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,470
I'll do the dishes for you today.

913
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,540
Make sure to wear gloves.
You might have to do it more often.

914
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,670
I'm off now.

915
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:59,950
My goodness,
I can't believe he's going to work.

916
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,720
-Mom.
-Get in the car.

917
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,970
-Take her to work.
-Okay, ma'am.

918
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,880
My name is Choi Yong-pil.

919
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,750
From now on, I'll make sure
you have a comfortable ride to work.

920
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:37,820
No, don't mind me. I'll just go on my own.

921
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,850
Why? It's better to have
a comfortable ride.

922
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:43,260
The traffic in Seoul can get really bad.

923
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:47,160
Don't tire yourself out every morning.
I'll give you a comfortable ride instead.

924
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:51,060
I used to be the driver
of Squad 74 at Division 7.

925
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:54,230
And I don't smell like mold
because I live in a two-story house.

926
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,870
Can I please have a quiet ride?

927
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,710
Oh, okay. Sure.

928
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:31,040
Thank you.

929
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,910
[GS Retail]

930
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,880
What? This is the head office
of Dae-hyun's convenience store.

931
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,310
My gosh, what a bunch of coincidences.

932
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:43,820
Bye.

933
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,610
Sir, it's me. Where are we
going to promote the hangover drink today?

934
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:09,510
You see, something came up.

935
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,980
So I won't be doing the job for a while.

936
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,880
Did something happen?

937
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,280
No, it's nothing serious.

938
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:19,920
Anyway, I'll call you again.

939
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,120
Okay. Bye.

940
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,530
I guess I should just sleep in.

941
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:36,800
Well...

942
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,340
I did what you asked.

943
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,520
[Can you come to the convenience store?]

944
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,130
Gosh, I should get dressed.

945
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,930
-Mr. Choi.
-Hey, Saet-byul.

946
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
What's up?

947
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:10,870
He's from the district hygiene office.

948
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,940
What?

949
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:14,940
Did the guy report you?

950
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:17,640
No, I asked them to send someone
for an inspection.

951
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,550
-What?
-Once the inspection is done,

952
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,750
they're going to call the victim.

953
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,780
And if he has legitimate evidence,

954
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:27,620
they'll send me a notice
to pay a fine for what happened.

955
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,790
If I pay within the time limit,
I could even get a discount.

956
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,790
And I even called the cops.

957
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,960
I asked them to check
if he does this regularly.

958
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,730
Is this your way of getting back at him?

959
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,870
Yes. Honesty is the best solution.

960
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,870
It's my fault for selling something
that had expired.

961
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:47,440
But it's also bad to use that
to his advantage to make money.

962
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:53,150
Then why did you ask me to come?

963
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:56,850
Because this is how I want you
to deal with things from now on.

964
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,850
Don't use violence,

965
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:01,190
and don't just beg for forgiveness either.

966
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,530
I'm not impressed by this at all.

967
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,270
-What?
-You're just showing off.

968
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:15,130
-You think I'm showing off?
-You're flaunting.

969
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,340
What? I'm flaunting?

970
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,840
Hey, wait. Saet-byul!

971
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,540
Good for you!

972
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:27,280

Yeon-joo.

980
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:19,800
You see,

981
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:23,300
I missed the chance to tell my mom
that Saet-byul quit her job.

982
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,510
And let me tell you why
she stayed at our place.

983
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,310
She recently got scammed
and was staying at the dry sauna.

984
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,810
And one day, my mom saw her there

985
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,420
and brought her home.

986
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:42,390
She didn't know Saet-byul quit,
so she just offered to help her...

You don't like noodles in your soup.

You should meet someone that suits you.

01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:14,320
I don't think I'm that person.
