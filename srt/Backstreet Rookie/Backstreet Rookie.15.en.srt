Saet-byul,

00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,090
I would like to be

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,130
someone special to you, too.

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,470
Will you accept my red tulips?

9
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,790
Mr. Choi,

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,460
I'll answer that

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,960
later.

12
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,270
I'm not dreaming to become someone
as great as you are,

13
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,600
but I want to achieve something
on my own, too.

14
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,840
I'll answer you when I pass the GED.

15
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:33,460
Sure. You've waited for me all along,

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,190

17
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,330
Saet-byul, don't you ever feel
like you've achieved nothing.

18
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,470
You're responsible, loyal,
a great fighter...

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,509
And you're diligent.

20
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,080
That's why the head office

21
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,410
is naming you as the assistant manager
of the store.

22

-Maybe I've watched too many dramas.

Jang-mi, how did you get here?

41
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,030
I thought of how you said that you run
a convenience store in Shinseong-dong.

42
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,170
I also have to ask you a favor

How can I?

48

ever since leaving Korea.

50

what Boon-hee is doing.

Saet-byul, how do you know about her?

Mrs. Gong told me about her

and how she never wants to see her again.

100

He has been avoiding me lately.
Did he do something wrong?

115
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,030
No, nothing. What are you up to?

116
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,840
I heard that taking a foot bath is

117
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,540
the best thing to do to get
foot-swelling go away.

118
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,440
You could just buy a foot bath machine.

119
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,380
A foot bath machine? We're still paying
the installments for Dad's massage chair!

120
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,650
Foot baths easily cost 200,000 won.
We can't afford one.

121
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,920
Actually, I think what you've got is
quite decent. It even massages.

122
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,190
Massage? It doesn't.

123
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,720
Of course it does, Mom.

124
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,090
See? Give me your foot. Like this.

125
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,870
I'll massage your shoulders.

-You're so tense up here.

What a luxurious day I'm having today.

128
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,440
Is this my lucky day or something?

129
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,710
I couldn't decide on what to get you
with my first pay as an advisor,

130
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,250
but now I know. I'll get you a foot bath.

131
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,180
-Really?
-Yes. Some shoes as well.

132
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,020
No, you can't buy me shoes.

133
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,090
I might run away if you do.

134
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,520
I'll buy you shoes when I get my first pay
as the assistant manager.

135
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,660
What? You're going to be
an assistant manager?

136
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,460
I've handed the ownership of the store
to the headquarters.

137
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,690
They offered to promote Saet-byul
as the assistant manager.

138
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Really? That happened?

to take a bigger cut,

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,550
See? I told you
I cook great instant noodles.

640
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,550
You have my approval.

641
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,790
Tomorrow, I'll buy you
something even more delicious.

642
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,330
Saet-byul, now that
I'm about to hand over my store,

643
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,900
it feels a little weird.

644
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,940
We wouldn't have met
if I didn't run the store.

645
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,310
And without you,
the store wouldn't have done so well.

646
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,140
So to sum it up, you and I were

647
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:32,550
able to do that
thanks to the convenience store.

648
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,680
Grapes.

649
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,490
My gosh, you're so childish. Strawberry!

650
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,060
No, don't say that!
Let's just go with grapes.

651
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,600
-Come on inside.
-You need to take your shoes off.

652
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,160
-Okay.
-Careful.

653
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,360
Mrs. Gong.

654
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,330
This is our house, Yeon-joo.

655
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,600
-Come inside. Let's drink some more.
-What's going on? Hey, Mom.

656
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,570
-What...
-Hey, Dae-hyun.

657
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,440
I called her for something,
and we ended up drinking together.

658
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,480
-Can you take this?
-Oh, okay.

659
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,310
My goodness. Come here, my son.

660
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,550
Dae-hyun, you're such a kind son.

661
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,990
You're the best.

662
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,390
Mom, why did you drink so much?

663
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:17,830
I was in a good mood today,
so I had a few drinks.

664
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,800
My son made my dream come true.

665
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,270
Your salary is over 100,000 won,
and you're an executive at a big firm.

666
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:28,640
♫ You have no idea how happy I am ♫

667
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,210
♫ You have no idea how happy I am ♫

668
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,010
Dae-hyun, listen to me.

669
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,240
I don't need a husband.

670
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,880
And I don't need any friends.

671
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,310
All I need is you.

672
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,550
All I need is my son, okay?

673
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,950
-Mom, are you okay?
-Why wouldn't I be okay?

674
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,060
Dae-hyun, I came home
in a really nice car.

675
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,990
Yeon-joo, gave me a ride. Hey, Yeon-joo.

676
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,000
Yes, I'm right here.

677
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:58,730
My goodness gracious.
Yeon-joo, thank you so much.

678
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:05,070
Yeon-joo, thank you so much
for drinking with me today.

679
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,680
No, I should be the one to thank you.
You should call me often from now on.

680
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,010
Okay, sure.

681
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,050
Dae-hyun, I owe her a lot.
She did so much for me today.

682
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,280
Now, you should go and take her home.

683
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,320
Escort her to her house. Hurry.

684
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,560
Ma'am, I'll be off now.

685
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,430
Yeon-joo. Goodbye, Yeon-joo.

686
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,030
-I'll see you again.
-Okay.

687
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,190
Bye.

688
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,200
Okay, bye.

689
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,540
Ma'am, you should lie down.

690
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,780
-There you go.
-Okay.

691
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,680
Ma'am, it's time for me to work
at the convenience store.

692
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,180
You should teach Mr. Choi a big lesson
once he comes home.

693
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,620
Okay. Yeon-joo.

694
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,590
Yeon-joo, thank you so much.

695
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,900
I hope you do your best
to help Dae-hyun out.

696
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,930
I never got to live the life I wanted.

697
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:08,900
But I want Dae-hyun to live differently.

698
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,510
That's my dream.

699
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,080
Okay, Yeon-joo? Please do me a favor.

700
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,250
Thank you. Thank you, Yeon-joo.

701
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,740
-Dae-hyun.
-Yes?

702
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,010
About yesterday...

703
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,950
Well...

704
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,790
Yeon-joo told me

705
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,890
that she wants to apologize,
but apparently, you won't let her.

706
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,530
I'm sure Yeon-joo worked really hard

707
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,400
to make the company
take over our convenience store.

708
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,830
She also took good care of me yesterday.

709
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,640
You should meet up with her

710
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,570
and let her apologize.

711
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,480
And thank her for what she did.

712
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,880
-Mom.
-It's best to get that kind of stuff done

713
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,010
as fast as possible.

714
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,010
You should meet her today
if you have time.

715
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,850
I have dinner plans today.

716
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,690
I'm totally fine.
You should listen to your mother.

717
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,530
He promised to treat me to a nice meal
to cheer me on

718
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,830
saying he feels a bit sad
to let go of the store.

719
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,130
Saet-byul.

720
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,370
It's okay.

721
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,740
Yes, do as I tell you.

722
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,140
You should meet her today, Dae-hyun.

723
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,210
-Mr. Choi.
-Hey.

724
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,810
-Here.
-What's this?

725
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,980
You should give this to Mrs. Gong.

726
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:05,850
They're white tulips,
and they symbolize "Forgiveness".

727
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,360
-Saet-byul, thank you.
-No problem.

728
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,560
But I don't know
if the flowers will be enough.

729
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,000
Don't worry.

730
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,400
I have something even better up my sleeve.

731
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,870
"Something even better"? What's that?

732

[Cashier's check]

733
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,380
I met Jang-mi so I could get this money.

734
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,610
I had no ulterior motive.

735
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:38,190
I told her I run a convenience store,
and that's how she came that day.

736
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,490
You told me you didn't want to see her.

737
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,190
That's why I told her
that I don't know you. That's all.

738
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:48,100
I'm serious. Please believe me.

-I don't want to hear it.

No, I'm more grateful
for what you did for my mother yesterday.

780
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:06,190
I'd like to sincerely apologize
for how rude my mother was to you

781
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,260
in the past.

782

I've always wanted to apologize for that.

Didn't you tell me
it was a misunderstanding back then?

784
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,340
As I talked to your mother last night,

785

I got to find out
that she's a great person.

I don't want to avoid it

Now that you're being honest about it,
I'll accept your apology.

Did you eat something nice with Yeon-joo?

What did you eat with her?

839

We had meat.

You bought her beef, right?

841
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,520
Yeon-joo is very classy,
so it's better to buy her beef.

-From now on, keep that in mind.
-Gosh, forget it.

that Yeon-joo is very considerate
and warm-hearted.

845

I did what you asked.
I accepted her apology and thanked her.

846

So that's enough.

847

It seems like Yeon-joo thinks of you
very differently now.

Why can't I talk about her?

855

What do you mean?
I broke up with her. It's over.

about what happened in the past?

How could I ever forget that?

859

How could I forget the incident
that helped me become the insurance queen?

860

Why would you remember it like that?

Then how do you want me to remember it?

862

Do you think she was the first person
to treat me like that?

to good relationships.

Should I get back with her?

Is that what you want?

867
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,660
Yes. If that happens,
I'd ask for nothing more.

868

I'll even dance to celebrate.

I'm not telling you to get back with her
for no reason.

I could tell that she really wants
to get back with you yesterday.

874

That's why I said all those stuff.

957
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:45,050
I still can't believe
he yelled at me like that.

958
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,920
I mean, it's not like

959
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:52,530
I have a rich husband.

960
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,500
And...

961
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,610
And it's not like I have
a lot of money saved up.

962
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:09,380
The only person I can rely on

963
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,250
is my son, Dae-hyun.

964
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,790
Ma'am, don't worry too much.

965
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,400
I'm sure he's regretting it right now.

966
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,680
Saet-byul, are you sure
this sausage stew will do?

967
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,650
Why didn't you pick something better?
I wanted to buy you something delicious.

968
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,790
What are you talking about?
I love sausage stew.

969
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,590
It looks so delicious.

970
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:01,890
-My gosh, you... I can't believe this.
-What's wrong?

971
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,730
You just... Gosh, you really know
how to eat your sausage stew.

972
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,740
-What?
-I'm talking about the instant noodles.

973
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,570
Instant noodles are a must
when you eat sausage stew.

974
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,070
Who doesn't add instant noodles?

975
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:16,140
-Some people don't.
-Are you serious?

976
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,680
Yes. It gives me the creeps.

977
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,780
-That's a big mistake.
-I know, right?

978
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,120
It's like cooking kimchi stew
without kimchi.

979
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,920
It's like doenjang stew without doenjang.

980
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,420
And gochujang stew without gochujang.

981
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:29,490
Yes, exactly.
It's like sundae soup with no sundae.

982
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,830
How was work today?

983
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,330
It's still the same store,
so it was pretty much the same.

984
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,630
I'm relieved to hear that.

985
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:43,670
Saet-byul, the instant noodles
are starting to cook,

986
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:47,440
and it's kind of getting me excited.
What do you think I should do?

987
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,780
-It's time to take them out.
-Exactly.

988
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,260
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

989
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:13,970
You should apologize to your mother.

990
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,910
You shouldn't have
yelled at her like that yesterday.

991
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,650
Saet-byul, I always listen to my mother.

992
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:30,650
But last night was different.

993
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:35,590
Don't be like that.
You're usually not like this.

994
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,190
Saet-byul,
about what my mom said yesterday...

995
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:43,460
Don't take it to heart, okay?

996
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,970
Let's eat.

997
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:02,350
[Mr. Choi, I don't want you to change.]

998
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,720
[I want you to remain as a kind son.]

999
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:08,690
[And I want you to continue
to do your best with work.]

1000
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,460
[If you were your normal self,
you wouldn't have fought with your mom.]

1001
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:14,790
[You would've just said "Okay, Mom"
and ended the conversation.]

1002
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,260
Eat up, Saet-byul.

1003
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:21,170
[If it weren't for me...]

1004
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:23,770
[If I wasn't around...]

1005
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,670
[Because that's the kind of person
you normally are.]

1006
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:31,510
Hurry up and eat.
I might finish everything.

1007
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:56,800
[I will never be able to find a room
that's as cozy and warm]

1008
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:58,570
[as this one.]

1009
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,840
[Mrs. Gong, thank you.]

1010
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:32,540
[You're such a great person.]

1011
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,110
[And I don't want to be the one
who makes you feel scared.]

1012
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,780
[And sir, thank you so much
for everything.]

1013
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:14,380
[Mr. Choi, when you told me
that you like me,]

1014
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:17,320
[I felt happy and anxious
at the same time]

1015
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,590
[because deep down inside,]

1016
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:23,290
[I knew that things might end this way.]

1017
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:28,230
[Although it didn't last long,
I will never forget]

1018
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,500
[how happy you made me feel.]

1019
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,370
[Thank you, Mr. Choi.]
