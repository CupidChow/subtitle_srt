Why is she asking me about such nonsense?

What is it?

233
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,240
Do wild roses stab you in the heart
or make you cry your eyes out?

234

What does it symbolize?

00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,580
Ask the Grim Reaper.

236

-Okay. Why does it hurt so much?
-Goodness.

240

-Gosh.

pay me back for my investment.

The coffee will taste amazing today
because I cleaned the coffee machine.

797
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,510
Get ready to get tons of customers.

798
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,550
The AC filter seemed really dirty.

799
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,120
Saet-byul!

800
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,850
Okay, fine. I was suspicious of you.

801
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,190
How could I not be suspicious

802
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,650
after I noticed that the cash went missing
on your first day?

803
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,960
It's partly your fault.
Why did you turn off your phone?

804
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,360
It ran out of battery.

805
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:06,460
Then what about the address?

806
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,590
I don't write neatly.

807
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,100
Who writes six like a zero?

808
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,400
I do.

809
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,170
Good for you.

810
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:17,400
Shouldn't you apologize
instead of getting angry at me?

811
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,010
I'm sorry.

812
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,380
That was pretty quick.

813
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,050
I tend to put things into action
very quickly.

814
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,920
You want me to stop
giving you the silent treatment?

815
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,050
Of course.

816
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:36,020
Okay, then I'll let it go
if you organize the storage room

817
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:38,360
and fill up the refrigerators
with all the beverages. Deal?

818
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,390
Saet-byul, are you kidding me?

819
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:45,170
I love doing that. I'll do it.

820
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:48,440
Do you want me to help?

821
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,040
-No.
-Why not?

822

Dae-hyun.

825
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,920
Hello.

826
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,860
You should've called.
What if we didn't cross paths?

827
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,860
Then I would've waited
until you passed by.

828
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,290
Yeon-joo, let's have lunch together.
I'm starving.

829
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,630
-"Lunch"?
-Yes.

830
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,370
Ms. Yoo, we'll be waiting for you there.

831
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,630
Enjoy your lunch. Bye.

832
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,370
I'm sorry. I have a lunch meeting.

833
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:29,410
It's okay. I'm fine.
You should go to the meeting.

834
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,480
The fact that I got to see you
is already enough for me.

835
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,750
But I think I'll have time tonight.

836
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:35,750
"Tonight"?

837
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,490
Why don't we meet tonight
at Kosirado Hotel?

838
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,090
A hotel?

839
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,330
See you later.

840
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,170
Oh, my gosh.

841
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:18,320
Hey, Saet-byul. You have no idea
how much I waited for you to come. Hurry.

842
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,330
Mr. Choi.

843
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,570
Mr. Choi, did you put on perfume
to impress me?

844
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:28,230
I love this scent.

845
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,400
-No.
-Don't lie to me.

846
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:34,440
I promise. My girlfriend got this for me.
She told me to wear it on our date.

847
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:37,440
I sprayed it on my wrists and my neck.

848
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:42,320
You have a girlfriend?

849
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,020
Of course I have a girlfriend.

850
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,320
But why do you sound so angry about it?

851
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:52,490
Don't tell me... My gosh, are you jealous?

852
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,860
No, I just feel bad for your girlfriend.

853
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:58,460
Why do you feel bad for her?

854
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:00,700
Because you'll have to see me
every day now.

855
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:04,100
And in the end, you'll fall for me
and get sick of your girlfriend.

856
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:09,780
Don't forget to tell her
that I'm sorry in advance.

857
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,310
My gosh,
you have a really serious condition.

858
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:15,220
Aren't you a bit too young
to have dementia?

859
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,250
Saet-byul, get to your senses.
You can do this.

860
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,850
Stay focused and work hard, okay?
I'll see you then.

861
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,290
-Bye.
-Okay. Just know that I'm watching you.

862
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:39,470
[That day,
I shouldn't have told Saet-byul]

863
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,410
[about Yeon-joo.]

864
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:58,060
[Yeon-joo, I'll show you]

865
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,660
[what kind man I am today.]

866
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:09,840
This is where you wanted
to have fun with me tonight?

867
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:12,170
Yes, it's open 24 hours.

868
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,340
So this is what you wanted to do
to get covered in sweat?

869
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,650
-You wanted to work out.
-That's right.

870
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,850
What's going on? What were you imagining?

871
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,790
-Dae-hyun.
-Yes?

872
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,360
-Get to your senses.
-Okay.

873
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,630
You seemed really tired
when I saw you earlier.

874
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:36,760
You can't do anything without stamina.
You even hired a nighttime part-timer.

875
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:39,500
You should get some good sleep at night
and work out from time to time.

876
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,940
Let's warm up before we start working out.

877

-Are you okay?
-Of course, Yeon-joo.

878
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,890
[Can I go to the bathroom?]

879
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,860
[Why are you asking me? Just go.]

880
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,960
[Because I don't want you
to get suspicious.]

881
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,490
[I won't ask you anymore
if you promise not to get suspicious.]

882
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:13,100
[What are you doing, Mr. Choi?
I'm working.]

883
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,870
[Are you ignoring me because you're busy?
Why are you busy?]

884
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,800
[A customer just bought
a pack of cigarettes.]

885
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,170
[He gave me 5 dollars in cash,
so I gave him back 50 cents.]

886
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:21,610
[Here's a photo to prove it.]

887
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,150
My gosh.

888
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,580
Who are you texting?

889
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,090
The part-timer.

890
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:36,920
Hey, Dal-sik.

891
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:40,530
Dae-hyun, do you remember
our field trip in middle school?

892
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:42,530
It was at Mount Songni.

893
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,630
We had to sleep at a youth hostel,

894
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,670
but we stayed up all night
because people were so loud there.

895
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:49,140
Yes, but what about that?

896
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,640
I'm experiencing the same thing.

897
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,740
Your part-timer invited her friends
to the convenience store

898
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:57,710
and are having a darn party
beneath the parasol.

899
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:02,620
I feel like I'm at a mud festival
at Daecheon Beach.

900
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,680
What?

901
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,760
Saet-byul, why do you keep bringing one?

902
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,460
Beer doesn't taste good when it gets warm.

903
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,490
The manager filled up the fridge,
so don't worry.

904
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,530
Your manager does that?

905
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,930
Then who else would do it? I made him
organize the storage room and clean.

906
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,670
You really are something.

907
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,740
Or do you think
this place has good feng shui?

908
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,850
Should I ask my dad
to just buy this building?

909
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,750
My gosh, let's drink to that.

910
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:44,190
-Do you have anything with broth?
-Something warm.

911
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,290
Go and get what you want.

912
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:50,530
This place is your fridge.
Take care of your fridge.

913
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,130
Saet-byul, you brat.
I'm starting to really like you.

914
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,770
Is this what you were talking about?

915
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:02,980
No, I was talking about the new one.

916
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:08,010
-Is this it?
-Yes, that's it.

917
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:13,120
What the...
My gosh, I can't believe that girl.

918
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:22,260
-What? Wait a minute. They're...
-This is nice.

919
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:23,830
Try to quit if you can.

920
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,540
I... I remember those girls.

921
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,640
Yes, you got it right.

922
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:35,040
Are they serious right now? My gosh, okay.

923
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:38,910
Is she trying to suck me dry?
She's unbelievable.

924
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:43,480
I'll put an end to you girls today.

925
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,650
You darn parasites.

926
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,650
Let me get you guys some more beer.

927
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,190
Will that be enough?

928
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:54,160
You should drink some hard liquor
since it's going to be your last supper.

929
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,740
Mr. Choi?
