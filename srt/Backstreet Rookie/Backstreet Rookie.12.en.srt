[Backstreet Rookie]

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,990
It looks like you're using Saet-byul
to get over your ex-girlfriend.

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,430
And that makes me feel uncomfortable.

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,800
What?

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,660
If you're not planning
to date her seriously,

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,600
please don't do anything to confuse her.

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,900
I'm not saying this to you impulsively.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,470
Ji-wook.

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,340
Why are you saying this to me?

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,650
Because I like Saet-byul.

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,420
What were you guys talking about?

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,120
-Ji-wook told me--
-Did something happen?

No, everything's fine.
The shoot is going to start soon.

Let's go, Mr. Choi. Come on.

00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,170
We're here.

Oh, Ji-wook. Hurry. Come here.
Let's fix your makeup.

-Mr. Choi, here.
-We're going to shoot it like this.

23
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,110
-Hold this and smile.
-Okay.

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,980
-We'll start the shooting.
-Sure.

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,190
What's he dolling up for?
Like that's going to make a difference?

26
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,060
-Come on, he's a celebrity, Mr. Choi.
-Thank you. You're handsome too.

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,160
Oh, come on. It's embarrassing me.

28

Gosh, what's so special
about putting makeup on?

29
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,970
He's just a human being after all.

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,600
I'll show them who's the pretty boy.

Hello, I'm Choi Dae-hyun.

32
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,880
He's the star who caught a thief
at the convenience store.

33
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,950
Mr. Kang will be a store manager
for the next 25 hours. Let's begin!

34
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,920
Go Star25!

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Ji-wook just touched my phone!

42
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,600
I'm not going to change my phone.

-I can't help today.

-I'm sorry.

Darn it. I can't tell
who the store manager is, right?

49
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,320
I'm sorry, I'll give you a new one.

Really? Should I take
the store manager spot here?

53

-Yes!
-Yes! That sounds great!

-Sure.

-An herb tonic.

but how could you make such a mistake?

Mr. Choi, did you put makeup on?

69

No. Goodness, no way.

78
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,340
-Hey, what's your problem?
-What are you talking about?

79
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:43,310
If you're here to work, just work.
Why did you have to humiliate Mr. Choi?

80
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,820
Are you seriously going to become
a store manager? You're not, right?

81
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,820
It's for the show. I can't just work.
It wouldn't be entertaining.

82
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,920
Do you feel inferior to Mr. Choi?

83
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,520
Because he's better looking than you?

84
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,790
You think I'm uglier than him?

85
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,230
Of course.

86
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,430
Look in the mirror and check for yourself.
You're no match to Mr. Choi.

Hey!

88

Mr. Choi gets nervous
when he's in front of the camera.

89
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,240
He's different from guys like you
who live in front of cameras.

90
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,740
Why are you talking so much in favor
of Mr. Choi?

91
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,680
That's right,
I'm talking on behalf of Mr. Choi.

92
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,410
Mr. Choi is soon turning 30.

93
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,020
He's different from us. Have you seen
the wrinkles on his forehead?

94
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,820
That's why he has bangs.
Do you understand?

95
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,060
I hope you can be considerate.

96

Mr. Kwon might forget.

131
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,010
So you'd better check it now.

Did you wait for me?

145
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,810
Yes, I wanted to go to
the convenience store with you.

146
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:11,980
Why?

147

I'm worried that
Dae-hyun might make a mistake.

148
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,450
We should go and show him support.

149

Forget it. What if we bump into Yeon-joo?

150

So what? It's our convenience store too.

Let's go to the tripe restaurant
and take a peek.

It's a special recipe.

-The Shinseong-noodles.
-We call it the Shinseong-noodles.

162
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,560
I'll show you how to make it from now on.

163
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,460
Put this in cold spicy noodles.

164
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,930
-I'll take a bite.
-Sure.

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,740
It's really good.

167
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,800
-It is really good.
-Right.

168
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,440
This is really

169
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,910
-a mind-blowing recipe, right?
-Cut!

170

My gosh.

-Hey.
-Yes?

173
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,150
Why would you mention
another tripe restaurant

174
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,820
when this is to promote
the convenience store?

175
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,990
I just wanted to share a tip
to my customers.

176
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,160
Exactly.
We have products made with tripe too.

177
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,290
Yes, we do. It's 6,000 won.

178
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,330
Which is why people would prefer
buying it at a tripe restaurant.

179
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,300
Can't you think for those who supply
tripe products to convenience stores?

180
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,640
Okay, refrigerated tripe products do sell.

181
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,100
But I'm talking about demand here.

182
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,540
To be honest, I think we should thank
the tripe restaurant owners

183
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,780
who provide tripe at 1,500 won.

184
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,710
I believe it will benefit
our convenience stores in the end

185
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,520
if we could improve our local economy
by helping out each other.

186
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,790
Can't you think of selling
at least one more item off the shelves?

all over this holy Shinseong-noodles.

I thought you were even cooler.

Of course, I'm cool too.

See? He's looking for Mr. Choi
as soon as he walked in.

-What?
-Mr. Choi.

You should've just accepted the apology.

265

Why did you have to be so modest

266
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,950
and cave in like that?

267

I just apologized and ended things there.

Hello.

that when you're available?

No. I got too nervous to watch.

You fool. Why did you trip?

Yes, you beat me up so many times
when I was young.

even after getting a nosebleed,
