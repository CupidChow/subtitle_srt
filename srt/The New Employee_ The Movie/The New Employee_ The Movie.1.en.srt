starting your work at nine, not turning your computer on at nine.

If he says it's urgent, you should take care of it right away.

42

He doesn't like people who are sloppy or slow.

He's a flawless perfectionist

44
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:06,856
so he doesn't like others making mistakes either.

Mr. Seung Hyeon. Do you have a favorite or memorable ad?

46

I like the recent Mirae Motors and Galaxy Phone ads.

47
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:21,623
The department head made both.

48
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:26,256
The best thing is, he has a rule of not making ads for loan corporations and companies that abuse their power.

49
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:31,290
There's a rumor that he brings in more than half of the company's profit.

50
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,656
He's more than capable of being a manager,

51
00:05:33,656 --> 00:05:38,156
but he says he doesn't want more responsibility, so he's still a department head.

52

Just watch out for him and you won't have any issues.

Isn't the Strategic Planning Team a better fit?

77
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:43,864
Yeah, I studied for quite long.

Not only do they send me stuff to do when it's time to go home,

82
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:12,192
but they make me revise a hundred times and end up choosing the original draft.

Do you think I can last, when someone as experienced as you is struggling?

84

Out of all things, you had to be assigned to Department Head Kim's team.

85
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:24,459
All he does is work, so he's very picky.

86
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:29,459
At least you'll learn a lot from him. And it could be to your advantage in the year-end recruitment.

87

I think all the SNU alums who worked for Department Head Kim got in.

88
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:37,326
I don't think he likes SNU.

89
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:42,092
Department Head Kim is also a SNU graduate. He majored in media and communication, like me.

He went to our school?

91

93
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:54,559
If I had done that during the interviews, I would have been rejected.

00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:51,342
Hi.

174
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:57,409
- Let's drink.
- Give me some.

175
00:15:57,409 --> 00:15:59,209
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

176
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,742
- Cheers!
- Yes!

177
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,885
Hey, Jeong Yeon, do you remember my first love, Jong Seok?

178
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,610
- Who?
- My first love.

179
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,102
- He looks just like Jong Seok.
- I do?

180
00:16:14,102 --> 00:16:17,827
- Oh, come on.
- He's a spitting image of him.

181
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:20,775
- He sort of resembles him.
- He does, right?

182
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:22,007
This has no taste.

183
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:24,517
Which year are you in?

184
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,942
What are you going to do after graduation?

185
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:36,942
I will...

186
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:40,376
Come to grad school if you're interested.

187
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:43,942
I finished my master's degree

188
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:48,876
and am supposed to help my professor with his research before starting my PhD program.

189
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:54,342
If I had a hubae like you,

190
00:16:54,342 --> 00:16:58,642
I think I could endure this agonizing PhD program.

191
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:03,504
You're going to come, right?

192
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:16,124
Why was Na Yu Seong there?

193
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,967
Are you okay?

194
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,776
I know he was your everything during college.

195
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:31,642
You even went to grad school because of that bastard.

196
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:34,609
Don't swear.

197
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:37,942
True. He's not even worthy of my curses!

198
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:40,276
It's time you forget about him and meet a good person.

199
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:44,442
I want you to meet and date a good person.

200
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:49,442
How can someone as cute and lovely as you be single?

201
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:57,372
Courtesy of Na Yu Seong.

202
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:59,405
From Hyeong Yu Seong?

203
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:02,472
That's not like him.

204
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:05,205
Thank you.

205
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:08,472
- Department Head Kim, the Marketing Team—
- I got the call.

206
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:12,372
I took care of it, so don't worry. You can focus on your work.

207
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:15,205
Okay, thank you.

208
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:19,705
I want you to meet and date a good person.

209
00:18:25,992 --> 00:18:27,052
(J Card)

210
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:28,682
(It fuses the brand's pursuit into a "story.")

211
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:30,292
(Exciting content that you cannot forget.)

212
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:36,805
- How far along are you?
- I'm nearly done.

213
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:38,112
Where should I take it to?

214
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:40,202
The third floor meeting room.

215
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:51,482
What do you think?

216
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:53,383
Pardon?

217
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:57,083
I think there are some issues.

218
00:18:58,632 --> 00:19:00,799
Honestly...

219
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:03,139
Honestly?

220
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:05,811
In my opinion, this is not interesting marketing.

221
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:11,239
"Korea's Number One Card, J Card" is too boring.

222
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:16,605
Many people still use J Card, but most young people don't,

223
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:20,005
including me and my friends.

224
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:23,522
Their image is too old.

225
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:26,888
And most importantly, the card isn't pretty.

226
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:31,288
For the future of J Card, we need to win over Generation MZ.

227
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:34,822
I don't think we should rely on marketing using stars.

228
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:40,122
If anything, they should be a little bold and cast non-celebrities who are unique.

229
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:44,755
There should be restaurants, cafés, movie theaters, and exhibitions that Generation MZ likes.

230
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:50,355
And hip brand stores and models that fit in those places can appear.

231
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:56,322
The newly opened J Hotel could be the final scene with people in their twenties having fun.

232
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:59,488
Something like, "My first card."

233
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:03,687
Why did you decide to intern for an ad company again?

234
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:08,245
I love ads. I have been really interested in ads since my undergrad.

235
00:20:08,245 --> 00:20:10,437
You seem like the strategic planning type.

236
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:11,987
No, I'm not.

237
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:14,506
Stop saying things for the sake of it.

238
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,368
Let's go. It's almost time.

239
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:18,118
Okay, then I'll take these.

240
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:22,634
Just carry the stuff you need to the meeting, like your notes or something.

241
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:24,319
Pardon?

242
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,552
You should attend this meeting as well.

243
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,187
Why is Seung Hyeon here?

244
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:42,487
I told him to. Sit here.

245
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:52,154
You're an intern, right?

246
00:20:52,154 --> 00:20:55,254
Can you grab a laptop charger from my office?

247
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,230
Yes. Where is your office?

248
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:01,120
Stay put.

249
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,129
Hey, Jong Chan. Did you pull an all-nighter again?

250
00:21:12,403 --> 00:21:15,403
Why are the people in your team so rude?

251
00:21:15,403 --> 00:21:17,843
What? What are you talking about?

252
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:22,236
If your new employee doesn't have the time to get his charger, then hire your own intern.

253
00:21:22,236 --> 00:21:27,369
You did this before, too. Why do you keep pushing our intern around?

254
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,570
I wasn't aware of that.

255
00:21:31,842 --> 00:21:36,702
I'm sorry. I'll talk to him.

256
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:38,702
It's okay.

257
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:52,457
Since the slogan is, "Korea's Number One Card," we're thinking of selecting the best celebrity

258
00:21:52,457 --> 00:21:55,990
to expand the brand image as being number one.

259
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,924
Also, as the number one card...

260
00:21:58,924 --> 00:22:02,157
We will focus on the three big perks:

261
00:22:02,157 --> 00:22:04,933
shopping discount, gas discount, and flight mileage,

262
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:09,192
which all can be done with a single J Card.

263
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:12,040
We believe these three benefits will help appeal to consumers naturally.

264
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,280
In this way, we can instill various perceptions of the product in the consumer.

265
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:25,124
Isn't that too boring? There's no difference from the previous one.

266
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:29,441
Don't you know how important this ad is?

267
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:31,907
Nice catch.

268
00:22:31,907 --> 00:22:36,207
Kim Jong Chan, you will not go ahead with this, will you?

269
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:41,741
Let us know if you have any good ideas. I will take responsibility and convince the client.

270
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:44,174
I don't have any,

271
00:22:44,174 --> 00:22:48,241
but he has a very good idea, CEO.

272
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,874
He's an intern.

273
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:54,107
I asked him on the spot, but he knew exactly what was wrong with this project.

274
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:57,074
I think you can trust him to handle it.

275
00:22:57,874 --> 00:23:01,941
Is that so? By when can you propose a new plan?

276
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:03,874
Can you do it by Friday this week?

277
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:06,341
Yes.

278
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:12,474
I will share the storyboards as soon as they are ready.

279
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:23,141
I trust you'll take responsibility and do a good job.

280
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:26,141
You know that our contract with J Card will expire soon, right?

281
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:30,074
We need to extend our contract next year.

282
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:31,607
Yes.

283
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:49,007
Seung Hyeon, hold on.

284
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:55,541
Calm down your excitement.

285
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,641
This is the best thing about our company.

286
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:03,041
Even an intern can have his own project.

287
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:08,707
It's also the worst thing about our company. People at the top get all the credit.

288
00:24:08,707 --> 00:24:14,041
Your idea will look like it's mine or even the CEO's or the company's.

289
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:19,107
And your participation in the project doesn't guarantee a permanent position.

290
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:21,241
It doesn't matter.

291
00:24:21,241 --> 00:24:26,507
I'm just worried I'll make a mistake and trouble you.

292
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:29,941
If you do, I'll take responsibility for it.

293
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:35,207
And do you think I'll let something like that happen?

294
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:37,941
Thank you.

295
00:24:38,704 --> 00:24:42,141
I look forward to working with you on this project.

296
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:44,141
Department Head Kim.

297
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:49,741
Why did you choose me?

298
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,341
Because it's you, Seung Hyeon.

299
00:24:58,474 --> 00:25:03,041
Somehow I think we can work well together.

300
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,074
Ji Yeon, who am I?

301
00:25:05,074 --> 00:25:10,474
You? You're gay, an alum of SNU, cute but never dated.

302
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:13,607
Hey! Not stuff like that!

303
00:25:13,607 --> 00:25:18,104
He said, "Because it's you, Seung Hyeon."

304
00:25:18,104 --> 00:25:20,074
He discounted all other reasons.

305
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:22,207
Did he confess his feelings to you?

306
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:27,274
Not really, but it feels like it.

307
00:25:27,274 --> 00:25:30,033
Who is it?

308
00:25:31,132 --> 00:25:34,710
We need to grill the meat.

309
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:40,107
Excuse me.

310
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:43,710
Department Head Kim, please pour me a drink.

311
00:25:48,391 --> 00:25:50,924
Your glass is empty.

312
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:57,924
Let's say cheers.

313
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:00,258
Cheers!

314
00:26:09,191 --> 00:26:13,491
- Don't you drink?
- No, I do.

315
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:18,824
Hey, you can't drink like that at work.

316
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:23,458
All right, cheers!

317
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:34,491
Have some more beef.

318
00:26:36,751 --> 00:26:39,191
Thank you.

319
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:43,658
Department Head Kim, did you just drink on his behalf?

320
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:48,882
Then you should drink another glass!

321
00:26:48,882 --> 00:26:51,149
Come on!

322
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:55,579
My glass is empty. Please pour me a drink too.

323
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:58,949
It's not the first time Ji Yeon has done this.

324
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,416
Cheers!

325
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:12,980
- Why are you taking that away?
- Really.

326
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,282
- Just let me be.
- Slow down.

327
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:17,849
- I'm just happy.
- Are you okay?

328
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:20,116
Of course, I'm okay.

329
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,316
Are you two dating?

330
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:27,016
Excuse me?

331
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,482
Are you two dating?

332
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:43,849
You seem very close, very touchy with each other.

333
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:45,149
Not at all.

334
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:48,016
Not at all. We can't date.

335
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:50,216
Because we're the famous

336
00:27:50,216 --> 00:27:53,216
Rainbow Rice Cakes!

337
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:57,182
Don't listen to her. It's nothing.

338
00:27:57,182 --> 00:28:00,482
Okay, it seems like you're not dating.

339
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:04,482
Department Head Kim, let me tell you about Seung Hyeon, this poor thing.

340
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:09,416
He has never dated anyone and is still a virgin!

341
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,049
What are you talking about?

342
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:14,616
Poor Seung Hyeon.

343
00:28:15,449 --> 00:28:18,116
It's okay, it's okay.

344
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:21,049
But that is your charm.

345
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:23,816
I'm sorry. We'll get going.

346
00:28:23,816 --> 00:28:28,182
Let's go together. I'll call a driver, so wait a minute.

347
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,509
We could have taken a taxi...

348
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:43,216
It's on my way, so no worries.

349
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:47,331
I heard that you live near work.

350
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:54,716
Seung Hyeon, are you okay?

351
00:28:56,049 --> 00:29:00,403
Sorry. I'm just hot from drinking.

352
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:11,016
Wow. The night view is so pretty.

353
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,649
You must like night views.

354
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:15,939
I do. I like them a lot.

355
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,382
Did Ji Yeon get in safely?

356
00:29:38,382 --> 00:29:44,049
Yes, I practically pushed her in.

357
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,082
Where is the driver?

358
00:29:46,082 --> 00:29:49,616
He went to the restroom. Wait in the car.

359
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:54,849
No, it's okay. I can get home on my own. Thank you for today.

360
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:58,316
I'll take you home. Don't worry about it and get in the car.

361
00:29:58,316 --> 00:30:01,716
I'm really okay...

362
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:41,475
I'm sorry.

363
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:44,310
No, I'm sorry.

364
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:50,879
Don't give it any thought. It was a mistake.

365
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:57,138
A mistake?

366
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:37,544
You remember everything we discussed yesterday, right?

367
00:31:37,544 --> 00:31:40,444
Yes.

368
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:46,594
We're a bit pressed for time, but we have the big picture, so it won't be difficult.

369
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:49,261
I'll make a draft based on your idea

370
00:31:49,261 --> 00:31:53,494
and when I hand the files to you, please organize them for internal use.

371
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,661
Okay, I will.

372
00:31:55,661 --> 00:31:57,527
Like you said at first,

373
00:31:57,527 --> 00:32:02,361
I plan on using the newly opened J Hotel's outdoor pool.

374
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:14,094
Did you get in safely yesterday?

375
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:19,994
Yes. Thank you for dropping me off.

376
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:31,301
This project will look good on your résumé.

377
00:32:32,878 --> 00:32:35,944
Yes, I'm here to improve my résumé.

378
00:32:36,702 --> 00:32:40,135
I know you don't like me much either.

379
00:32:40,135 --> 00:32:44,902
And like you said, I don't know much about ads.

380
00:32:44,902 --> 00:32:49,235
I don't even know what I like or what I am good at.

381
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:52,068
I want to find what they are.

382
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:54,068
I want to do my best,

383
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:58,202
but I want to figure out what I should do my best at.

384
00:32:58,202 --> 00:33:04,035
I just do my best without thinking. I know I'm not fit for an ad company.

385
00:33:04,802 --> 00:33:06,302
You are a good fit.

386
00:33:06,302 --> 00:33:08,035
Excuse me?

387
00:33:08,035 --> 00:33:10,168
I think you misunderstood.

388
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:12,368
I said you'd be a better fit for Strategic Planning

389
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:16,835
because you seemed to like it and be good at it.

390
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:22,935
Most people think those who make ads are weird and crazy,

391
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:25,035
but I think differently.

392
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:29,468
Rather than someone flashy, someone who can single-mindedly hold on to something and dig into it

393
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:33,368
holds the power to think from a new perspective.

394
00:33:33,368 --> 00:33:36,735
You're a good fit for our company.

395
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:40,868
So have some confidence in yourself.

396
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:46,335
How can someone who does not believe in themselves make an ad to persuade others?

397
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:49,635
Thank you.

398
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:07,668
So he got drunk, gave you a peck,

399
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:12,668
and caressed your head the next day, even though he said it was a mistake before?

400
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:18,302
What do you think? Is this flirting?

401
00:34:18,302 --> 00:34:22,102
He's a player. He knows how to pull at your heartstrings.

402
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:25,102
He gives a peck, then caresses the head.

403
00:34:25,102 --> 00:34:28,268
He's good.

404
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:34,535
But we don't know for sure, so wait and see.

405
00:34:34,535 --> 00:34:39,735
I don't think he's a regular player.

406
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:44,168
And next time, don't let it be just a peck.

407
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:46,568
Kiss.

408
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:50,468
Kang Hae, you seem so experienced.

409
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,535
Actually,

410
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:00,868
it's all in here.

411
00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:07,149
Hi.

412
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:08,942
Hi.

413
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:12,600
A peck, then caressing the head?

414
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,367
Is this the start of something?

415
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:25,968
- Team Leader Choi!
- You startled me, Section Head Lee!

416
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:28,747
- Salute!
- Salute!

417
00:35:28,747 --> 00:35:31,168
Isn't the Marketing Team really busy these days?

418
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:34,968
Not as much as the Planning Team.

419
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:40,768
There was a rumor that you won't be a team leader anymore.

420
00:35:40,768 --> 00:35:43,502
Is it true that you will be a general manager?

421
00:35:43,502 --> 00:35:45,668
Be quiet.

422
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:50,335
By the way, about Department Head Kim... Something's fishy over there.

423
00:35:50,335 --> 00:35:52,135
- Kim Jong Chan? Why?
- Yes.

424
00:35:52,135 --> 00:35:56,402
He keeps siding with this intern. It looks like he is making a clique.

425
00:35:57,702 --> 00:36:02,935
Do you know what's even more surprising? There's a rumor that Director Kim told him to do so.

426
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:06,668
Director Kim always looks after Department Head Kim because they're both SNU Communication alums.

427
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:11,202
That's not news. And what could he do with an intern?

428
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,968
That intern was Professor Park's student at SNU.

429
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:17,435
Everyone knows that Director Kim and Professor Park are very close.

430
00:36:17,435 --> 00:36:19,802
Director Kim might be...

431
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:26,402
trying to form his own clique because time is running out.

432
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,426
Seung Hyeon.

433
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:37,193
Does the Marketing Team have anything on you? Why are they calling you?

434
00:36:37,193 --> 00:36:40,058
Are you really going to go?

435
00:36:40,058 --> 00:36:45,350
There's nothing I can do. Even Team Leader Choi says I should go. I'll go and see what it's about.

436
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,539
I heard they can get pretty rough.

437
00:36:49,189 --> 00:36:52,456
Let's just inform Department Head Kim.

438
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:58,631
Department Head Kim worked all day. He just went out for a bit for an appointment.

439
00:36:58,631 --> 00:37:02,164
He's busy. I don't want to bother him with this stuff.

440
00:37:02,164 --> 00:37:03,931
Hey!

441
00:37:07,264 --> 00:37:10,998
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

442
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,798
Whatever, you take care of it.

443
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:27,489
I know you're my client, but do I have to drink with you too?

444
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:32,689
Not as a client, but as a friend. Here, drink.

445
00:37:33,722 --> 00:37:37,156
No, I have to get back to the office.

446
00:37:43,322 --> 00:37:44,722
Hey.

447
00:37:46,622 --> 00:37:50,156
Do you think falling in love is a big deal?

448
00:37:50,156 --> 00:37:53,856
When you eat and talk together

449
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:56,256
and smile when your eyes meet.

450
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:01,656
When he keeps on chatting,

451
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:05,189
and it looks so cute.

452
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:11,922
When everything lights up, and you don't see anything else but him.

453
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:16,889
When he looks like an angel, and it feels like heaven with him.

454
00:38:18,689 --> 00:38:20,889
You don't know what this feels like, right?

455
00:38:21,722 --> 00:38:25,556
You know nothing, you workaholic.

456
00:38:27,122 --> 00:38:29,422
Just worry about yourself.

457
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:37,539
(Seo Ji Yeon)

458
00:38:38,922 --> 00:38:41,689
- Yes.
- I'm sorry for calling you so late.

459
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:42,859
What is it?

460
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:44,649
The thing is...

461
00:38:50,822 --> 00:38:53,456
I'll head over now, so don't worry.

462
00:38:55,089 --> 00:38:57,722
Hey, where are you going?

463
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:11,524
Seung Hyeon!

464
00:39:11,524 --> 00:39:13,524
Department Head Kim!

465
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:18,470
It's Department Head Kim.

466
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:23,876
Do you want to sing, too?

467
00:39:28,724 --> 00:39:30,090
What is going on?

468
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:34,124
We just wanted to be friends.

469
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:39,124
Yes, be friends.

470
00:39:39,124 --> 00:39:45,390
Department Head Kim, my hyeongs bought me drinks

471
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:50,357
and I sang.

472
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:56,274
I didn't know you were coming.

473
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,241
Are you going to stay here?

474
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:07,180
We have a lot of work to do.

475
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:20,090
Department Head Kim, do we have to go to work now?

476
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,207
It's late, so go home. I'll take you home.

477
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:30,430
But how did you know I'm here?

478
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,141
I just...

479
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:39,307
Did you come because you were worried?

480
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:43,741
Or because you wanted to save me or drink on my behalf?

481
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,241
- It's not like that.
- Come on.

482
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:47,064
I think you came to drink on my behalf.

483
00:40:47,064 --> 00:40:49,304
I said it's not like that.

484
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,174
Department Head Kim...

485
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:05,810
Do you know that it's really hard to pretend that everything is normal?

486
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,991
You look like something happened to you last night.

487
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:08,624
Pardon? Nothing happened to me.

488
00:42:08,624 --> 00:42:11,091
You look like you are hiding something.

489
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:13,157
I'm not hiding anything.

490
00:42:13,157 --> 00:42:16,891
Did you kiss?

491
00:42:16,891 --> 00:42:18,224
It's not like that.

492
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:21,491
I was right! Did you guys decide to date? Or...

493
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:26,514
did you just kiss and leave things undefined?

494
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,721
How did you know that?

495
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,426
Wait.

496
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:37,122
It's all in here. Even your expression.

497
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:39,413
We kissed.

498
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:42,206
But I'm still unsure.

499
00:42:43,057 --> 00:42:45,591
Does he like me as well?

500
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:49,691
You have to clearly define your relationship in these cases.

501
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:50,991
How?

502
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:54,224
You should ask if you two are a couple now.

503
00:42:54,224 --> 00:42:58,091
I'm worried that only I like him.

504
00:42:58,091 --> 00:43:03,057
I wish I could ask on your behalf. Does he work here?

505
00:43:03,057 --> 00:43:05,878
No. Never!

506
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:10,170
I was just asking, but I guess he does, based on your strong reaction.

507
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,303
I told you he doesn't.

508
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:16,451
Who the hell is he? Who was your first kiss?

509
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:18,818
Is he in Planning Team 1? Team 2?

510
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,550
Hello.

511
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:32,570
There's a female director who worked on the Mirae Motors ad with me. She's in her twenties and her work is sensational.

512
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,713
I think she would be a good fit.

513
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,772
This is the newly opened outdoor pool at J Hotel. We could have two models on the sunbed

514
00:43:46,772 --> 00:43:52,440
and end with people in their twenties having a good time.

515
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:04,713
(AR Communications)

516
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,140
Seung Hyeon.

517
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,380
Yes?

518
00:44:13,382 --> 00:44:18,782
I'm going to ask you to do a few things over the phone. You can do those and then leave at six.

519
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:19,875
Okay.

520
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,675
Department Head...?

521
00:44:52,345 --> 00:44:54,482
Hello.

522
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:58,582
- If the Marketing Team looks for me, tell them to contact me directly.
- Okay.

523
00:44:58,582 --> 00:45:02,162
If the Production Team calls, tell them to proceed according to the proposal.

524
00:45:02,162 --> 00:45:04,495
Okay, I will.

525
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,690
And...

526
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,948
Yes?

527
00:45:10,682 --> 00:45:13,899
Hello? Department Head Kim?

528
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,882
What are your plans for tonight?

529
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:20,748
Not much. What else can I help you with?

530
00:45:20,748 --> 00:45:22,348
Then after you get off work,

531
00:45:22,348 --> 00:45:25,482
"After getting off work..."

532
00:45:25,482 --> 00:45:26,680
let's go to the movies.

533
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,540
"go to the movi..."

534
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,882
What?

535
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,930
Why aren't you calling me back?

536
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,940
Let's break up. I think dating you has made me lonelier.

537
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,150
I think dating you has made me lonelier.

538
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:54,081
You should just get married to your job.

539
00:45:55,683 --> 00:45:57,756
Do you like working that much?

540
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,590
Department Head Kim.

541
00:46:22,373 --> 00:46:26,639
I was surprised to hear that Department Head Kim reserved the entire place.

542
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:29,406
I see you have company today.

543
00:46:29,406 --> 00:46:32,130
- Bon appétit.
- Thank you.

544
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,240
This is their signature menu.

545
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,306
Try it.

546
00:46:52,306 --> 00:46:53,939
Okay.

547
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,739
Here.

548
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,300
(Now... On More Step)

549
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,360
(OTT | Music Webtoons)

550
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:22,673
It looks like the rhythm is faster than the original draft.

551
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,873
I don't think you ever get off work.

552
00:47:30,173 --> 00:47:33,773
Sorry, it's a habit. Watch comfortably.

553
00:47:34,573 --> 00:47:36,039
Okay.

554
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:49,606
I won't do anything funny, so relax.

555
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:59,139
You look like you want me to do something funny.

556
00:47:59,139 --> 00:48:01,539
Department Head Kim.

557
00:48:08,606 --> 00:48:10,839
About having dinner together,

558
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,006
going to the movies,

559
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,006
and holding hands like this.

560
00:48:18,873 --> 00:48:20,720
Don't put too much thought into it.

561
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,370
I think it will be good to get to know each other.

562
00:48:25,306 --> 00:48:30,406
I feel the same way as you.

563
00:48:40,336 --> 00:48:46,139
When everything lights up, and you don't see anything else but him.

564
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:12,088
Gosh, your story is driving me crazy!

565
00:49:12,088 --> 00:49:13,822
You're making me cry. Why am I so happy?

566
00:49:13,822 --> 00:49:15,888
I totally understand how you feel.

567
00:49:15,888 --> 00:49:20,955
He went through so much heartache in the past.

568
00:49:20,955 --> 00:49:24,088
I'm so jealous. This is great news.

569
00:49:24,088 --> 00:49:25,470
Thank you, Kang Hae.

570
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,950
You better be happy.

571
00:49:26,955 --> 00:49:31,055
Thanks, but I still can't believe it myself.

572
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:34,154
If I were you, I would stay up all night.

573
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:37,454
It's not as easy as I thought.

574
00:49:37,454 --> 00:49:39,854
I got a good night text yesterday.

575
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:43,021
I almost stayed up all night thinking about what to reply.

576
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:48,821
That's how it is. That lovey-dovey early awkward stage is the best.

577
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:51,321
Ji Yeon, you seem so experienced.

578
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:55,222
Love is difficult because each experience is a new one.

579
00:49:55,222 --> 00:49:58,922
I'm not sure what this is yet.

580
00:49:58,922 --> 00:50:02,088
What if I'm so lonely

581
00:50:02,088 --> 00:50:05,922
that I'm tricking myself into thinking I'm in love?

582
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:09,555
Love and dating come in much more varied forms than the ones you can think of.

583
00:50:09,555 --> 00:50:14,055
You can't be too quick to discern what's real or not. They could all be true love.

584
00:50:14,055 --> 00:50:16,488
You don't disappoint.

585
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:18,522
You're amazing.

586
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,588
Actually,

587
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:24,350
it's all in here.

588
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,055
I also read this, but I haven't found anything like that yet.

589
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:32,288
It was in episode 357, which was uploaded yesterday.

590
00:50:32,288 --> 00:50:36,588
I didn't see it yet. Do you mind if I take a quick look?

591
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:44,550
But who is it?

592
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:49,675
I'll tell you later. I have to be considerate of him as well.

593
00:50:51,788 --> 00:50:54,888
Sorry, it was thoughtless of me to ask.

594
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,522
I am excited,

595
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:05,822
anxious, having fun,

596
00:51:05,822 --> 00:51:08,455
and sad.

597
00:51:08,455 --> 00:51:11,030
Is this supposed to be love?

598
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:21,805
What is true love?

599
00:51:21,805 --> 00:51:24,639
I'm just careful because we work together.

600
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,105
And we work in the same field.

601
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:31,939
I vowed to never do something like this again.

602
00:51:33,072 --> 00:51:36,239
But he's so tall and handsome.

603
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:40,672
Hey, you must be blind with love. There's nobody like that at work.

604
00:51:40,672 --> 00:51:44,372
Unless it's Department Head Kim Jong Chan—

605
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:52,788
Is there anything about recruitment from the higher ups?

606
00:51:52,788 --> 00:51:58,322
They want an open recruitment and said we should hire high school graduates too.

607
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:04,222
But the ones that last are the ones with good qualifications.

608
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:08,988
It's the trend nowadays, and we can use it for PR as well. It's not a bad plan.

609
00:52:08,988 --> 00:52:14,322
Even if we hire only one high school graduate, it's good for the company's image

610
00:52:14,322 --> 00:52:16,988
to show that we offer opportunities.

611
00:52:16,988 --> 00:52:20,755
Please give extra attention to the recruitment process.

612
00:52:20,755 --> 00:52:24,988
Make sure it doesn't smear the company's image.

613
00:52:24,988 --> 00:52:30,755
And please look for experienced people too.

614
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:36,555
Aren't there any more Kim Jong Chans out there?

615
00:52:36,555 --> 00:52:39,788
There's a lot of talk about him these days.

616
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,155
Why? Is he leaving the company?

617
00:52:43,155 --> 00:52:44,955
No, I don't know about that,

618
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:50,455
but I think he upset quite a few people trying to form a clique.

619
00:52:50,455 --> 00:52:53,855
Director Kim, is that true?

620
00:52:53,855 --> 00:52:56,222
The Kim Jong Chan I know wouldn't do that.

621
00:52:56,222 --> 00:52:58,588
I'm certain it's a false rumor.

622
00:52:58,588 --> 00:53:01,655
This is not the first time that things got exaggerated at work.

623
00:53:01,655 --> 00:53:03,922
Nice catch.

624
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:10,988
But to have that kind of rumor suddenly spreading

625
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:14,122
is also a failure on his part.

626
00:53:14,122 --> 00:53:16,088
He failed to conduct himself properly!

627
00:53:16,088 --> 00:53:20,588
You're right. We can't let him get away with this.

628
00:53:20,588 --> 00:53:24,722
He also keeps us on our toes because we never know when he will leave the company.

629
00:53:24,722 --> 00:53:30,288
How can we rely on one person to bring in half of the company's profit?

630
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,188
Make sure he gets a promotion this time.

631
00:53:35,188 --> 00:53:39,622
- Make him a team leader this time.
- Okay.

632
00:53:39,622 --> 00:53:43,222
Coddling him only makes the problem worse.

633
00:53:43,222 --> 00:53:45,788
He keeps saying he doesn't want to. What can we do?

634
00:53:45,788 --> 00:53:48,722
You have to think of something.

635
00:53:48,722 --> 00:53:54,488
If we end up losing him, are you going to take responsibility for the company's loss?

636
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,810
I'll talk to him.

637
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,230
(J Card)

638
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:03,670
First times become a memory for everyone.

639
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:07,503
Whether it's a good or bad memory,

640
00:54:07,503 --> 00:54:12,337
they become precious moments over time.

641
00:54:12,337 --> 00:54:15,437
But the top position is not enduring.

642
00:54:15,437 --> 00:54:19,785
Because people always wait for the new best thing.

643
00:54:19,785 --> 00:54:23,163
The key copy of "My First Card, J Card"

644
00:54:23,163 --> 00:54:26,721
will be a memorable and relevant one,

645
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:32,621
even when someone in their twenties ages into their thirties and forties.

646
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,137
Great job.

647
00:54:41,137 --> 00:54:43,170
I'm just...

648
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:48,837
He came up with today's idea. He's our intern and an emerging ad creator.

649
00:54:48,837 --> 00:54:51,470
You can expect great things from him.

650
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:53,620
You're an intern?

651
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:58,054
CEO, the intern came up with the idea today.

652
00:54:58,054 --> 00:54:59,920
Say hello.

653
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,920
Hello. I'm Wu Seung Hyeon. I'm an intern at AR Planning.

654
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,287
An intern? You did great today.

655
00:55:06,287 --> 00:55:08,187
Thank you.

656
00:55:10,454 --> 00:55:12,854
You're Mr. Sold Out!

657
00:55:14,987 --> 00:55:20,054
Yes, I'm Lee Gyeong Jae, CEO of J Card, and Mr. Sold Out.

00:55:24,787 --> 00:55:30,920
Sorry, it's just that you're so famous.

660
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,154
Am I famous?

661
00:55:32,154 --> 00:55:35,320
He sometimes drops by unexpectedly and surprises us.

662
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,520
He's very casual and is addicted to Instagram now.

663
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,054
Yes, I'm totally addicted to it.

664
00:55:42,054 --> 00:55:44,387
Are you on Instagram?

665
00:55:44,387 --> 00:55:45,520
Yes, Sir.

666
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,554
Is that so?

667
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:50,487
Then let's all get those likes.

668
00:55:50,487 --> 00:55:53,087
All right. Come on.

669
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,854
Gather around.

670
00:55:54,854 --> 00:55:59,380
One, two, three.

671
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:08,920
Are you that happy?

672
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:14,787
Yes. I'm grateful just for the fact that you used my idea.

673
00:56:14,787 --> 00:56:19,754
But presenting at J Card felt like a dream.

674
00:56:19,754 --> 00:56:22,287
You look like you're about to jump up and down.

675
00:56:22,287 --> 00:56:24,180
Can I?

676
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:31,054
Do you want to have celebratory drinks at my place?

677
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,950
Have a seat.

(Advertiser of the Year, Kim Jong Chan)

679
00:57:11,087 --> 00:57:14,087
What a great place you live in.

680
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:24,010
You're lucky to live in such a big house with Department Head Kim.

681
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:31,954
Gosh, it's cold. I should play a game of screen golf.

682
00:57:31,954 --> 00:57:34,320
Wait, leave it on for a moment.

683
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:40,287
Relax when you swing.

684
00:57:40,287 --> 00:57:42,420
The model has changed.

685
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,767
This is a parody skit.

686
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:49,387
Gosh, it's cold. I should play a game of screen golf.

687
00:57:49,387 --> 00:57:50,890
Not great, huh?

688
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:54,054
I think it's funny.

689
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,060
Not the ad.

690
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,787
I meant me.

691
00:57:58,787 --> 00:58:01,580
I keep talking about work.

692
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:08,150
It's okay. Work is your priority.

693
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:12,087
I want to understand things

694
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,447
that are important to you.

695
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:23,187
I thought you were scary and cold at first,

696
00:58:23,187 --> 00:58:26,087
but I think you're very caring.

697
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:37,320
If you keep looking at me like that...

698
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,990
Wait.

699
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,820
Let's do this once we get closer.

700
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:07,754
How do I get closer to you?

701
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,970
By being more caring?

702
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:19,030
Shall I take a shower and come back?

703
01:00:52,586 --> 01:00:55,336
(I'm going to get some food. Make yourself at home.)

704
01:01:24,885 --> 01:01:26,655
What are your plans for today?

705
01:01:27,585 --> 01:01:28,888
Pardon?

706
01:01:28,888 --> 01:01:30,888
Do you want to go somewhere with me?

707
01:01:35,822 --> 01:01:37,855
What would be a good gift?

708
01:01:37,855 --> 01:01:39,355
What?

709
01:01:41,488 --> 01:01:44,555
I don't need one.

710
01:01:44,555 --> 01:01:48,240
Something that's not too much.

711
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,570
What about a fountain pen?

712
01:01:50,575 --> 01:01:51,922
I think that's great.

713
01:01:51,922 --> 01:01:57,245
It will last long and be a reminder of you every time they use it.

714
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,885
Great minds think alike.

715
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:04,655
I'm a regular at this shop in front of our school.

716
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:06,050
Really? Great, you pick one.

717
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:09,122
Great, you pick one.

718
01:02:09,122 --> 01:02:10,522
Me?

719
01:02:10,522 --> 01:02:12,255
Yes.

720
01:02:18,205 --> 01:02:19,605
When is your birthday?

721
01:02:19,605 --> 01:02:21,672
It just passed.

722
01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:24,172
- What about you?
- It's next month.

723
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,439
Here's the one you were talking about.

724
01:02:27,439 --> 01:02:28,950
I'd like this one, please.

725
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,530
Okay.

726
01:02:32,905 --> 01:02:34,539
Here you go.

727
01:02:43,572 --> 01:02:46,939
Can I get initials engraved on it?

728
01:02:46,939 --> 01:02:49,172
Of course.

729
01:02:49,172 --> 01:02:52,705
Please write it down here.

730
01:02:59,005 --> 01:03:02,305
It must be a gift for your lover.

731
01:03:02,305 --> 01:03:05,539
Yes, it's a birthday gift.

732
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:13,939
Just a moment.

733
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:23,939
I will go now.

734
01:03:23,939 --> 01:03:27,805
Why? You helped me pick this out.

735
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:30,272
Let's go have that cream pasta you like.

736
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:32,939
I'm not feeling well.

737
01:03:32,939 --> 01:03:34,872
Is it bad?

738
01:03:36,205 --> 01:03:38,172
But, Hyeong,

739
01:03:39,632 --> 01:03:42,432
didn't you say you broke up?

740
01:03:43,772 --> 01:03:45,972
I did break up with him.

741
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:49,460
But I just met someone else who's really great,

742
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,780
so I confessed my feelings to him.

743
01:03:53,572 --> 01:03:55,772
I'm going to quit the club...

744
01:03:55,772 --> 01:03:57,339
What?

745
01:04:00,205 --> 01:04:03,872
I thought he felt the same way about me.

746
01:04:04,832 --> 01:04:07,872
Since he broke up with his past lover,

747
01:04:07,872 --> 01:04:11,539
I thought I might have a chance with him.

748
01:04:11,539 --> 01:04:17,339
You know he's famous for being caring at first, then brushing you off.

749
01:04:17,339 --> 01:04:19,139
I helped him

750
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:23,972
pick out a gift for his new boyfriend today.

751
01:04:26,202 --> 01:04:28,739
I thought it was mine

752
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:33,505
and followed him all the way.

753
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:39,702
He looked so excited

754
01:04:39,702 --> 01:04:42,062
to get his lover the fountain pen

755
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:45,772
engraved with his initials.

756
01:04:47,602 --> 01:04:50,072
Why are you crying?

757
01:04:52,672 --> 01:04:55,639
I even pretended

758
01:04:55,639 --> 01:05:00,472
to like cream pasta because he likes it.

759
01:05:00,472 --> 01:05:02,190
What?

760
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:06,000
But you hate cream pasta,

761
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,872
you idiot! Why?

762
01:05:48,891 --> 01:05:51,769
I don't feel well, so I'm going home.

763
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:53,684
Sorry.

764
01:06:34,645 --> 01:06:36,579
Department Head Kim.

765
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:54,723
How am I supposed to interpret it if you leave like that after spending the night together?

766
01:06:55,953 --> 01:06:57,753
I'm sorry.

767
01:06:58,386 --> 01:07:01,920
I was caught off guard and didn't have the courage to ask.

768
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,287
What exactly is it?

769
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,853
Department Head Kim...

770
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:11,487
What was your relationship with Hyeong Yu Seong?

771
01:07:13,037 --> 01:07:15,590
We dated for a bit.

772
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:18,330
Of course, I have no feelings for him anymore.

773
01:07:18,953 --> 01:07:21,340
You know how small the dating pool is in our world.

774
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:24,480
It's normal to stay friends with your ex.

775
01:07:25,987 --> 01:07:31,487
I understand why you're upset about it, but I can't change the past.

776
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,653
What do you want me to do? If you are uncomfortable, I'll keep my distance from Yu Seong—

777
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:40,110
I was the one who picked out that fountain pen.

778
01:07:40,787 --> 01:07:43,440
I actually forgot who gave it to me.

779
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,720
If something that trivial bothers you, I'll throw it away.

780
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,278
I used to like Hyeong Yu Seong.

781
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,299
Did the two of you date?

782
01:07:52,299 --> 01:07:53,965
No.

783
01:07:55,487 --> 01:07:58,220
It was unrequited.

784
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:02,787
I fell for him at first sight and liked him for a long time.

785
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:06,080
Those feelings surmounted everything else throughout my college life.

786
01:08:06,887 --> 01:08:08,770
He is...

787
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:13,921
part of every memory from back then.

788
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:16,687
I decided

789
01:08:16,687 --> 01:08:21,312
to stop my unrequited feelings after helping him buy your gift.

790
01:08:22,562 --> 01:08:24,820
I finally got over him, but the next person I meet is—

791
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:26,453
So?

792
01:08:27,153 --> 01:08:30,353
Are you saying that you tried to get over your pathetic crush,

793
01:08:30,353 --> 01:08:34,037
but you're disgusted because your new love interest has shadows of that past?

794
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:37,010
So what's your conclusion?

795
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:40,620
Are you saying that you can't be with me because I remind you of him?

796
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:44,587
For how long will you stay buried in the past? Forever?

797
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:46,920
Do you console yourself by saying that your first love was pure?

798
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,687
Do you have to put it that way?

799
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:54,020
It's not that simple for me.

800
01:08:55,187 --> 01:08:58,287
- Well done.
- Thank you for your effort.

801
01:08:58,287 --> 01:09:02,560
If we can't understand each other, we should stop.

802
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,427
Do whatever you want.

803
01:09:16,207 --> 01:09:19,691
Seung Hyeon, did you reserve the accommodations for our workshop?

804
01:09:19,691 --> 01:09:22,391
I did a few days ago.

805
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:28,124
I just got a text saying that it was canceled due to insufficient payment.

806
01:09:28,124 --> 01:09:29,757
What?

807
01:09:29,757 --> 01:09:32,607
Did you use Section Head Jang's company card?

808
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:37,074
It's nearing its limit, so I told you to use a different card.

809
01:09:37,074 --> 01:09:40,844
I paid half with Section Head Jang's company card,

810
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:44,644
and he said he will pay the rest with a different card.

811
01:09:46,408 --> 01:09:48,260
This is driving me nuts.

812
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,930
What do we do? The workshop is in two days.

813
01:09:54,157 --> 01:09:58,024
There's a new place that only recently opened and not a lot of people know of. Let's go there as they should have a spot available.

814
01:09:58,024 --> 01:09:59,791
Really? Where is it?

815
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:03,391
It's the Hanok Residence that was used for the film promotion.

816
01:10:03,391 --> 01:10:06,657
We went there for the shoot and it was quite nice.

817
01:10:06,657 --> 01:10:08,344
Oh, that place!

818
01:10:08,344 --> 01:10:11,391
But can we make a reservation on such short notice?

819
01:10:11,391 --> 01:10:15,157
We'll have to ask. How much is our budget?

820
01:10:21,404 --> 01:10:24,624
Gosh, it's so annoying.

821
01:10:24,624 --> 01:10:26,457
Department Head Kim.

822
01:10:28,879 --> 01:10:32,115
Thank you so much.

823
01:10:32,115 --> 01:10:34,772
This may sound like an excuse

824
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:38,749
for all the mistakes I've been making,

825
01:10:38,749 --> 01:10:43,182
but I think they all happened on that one day.

826
01:10:43,182 --> 01:10:46,149
I promise it won't happen again.

827
01:10:48,115 --> 01:10:50,815
And also...

828
01:10:53,512 --> 01:10:55,780
It's nothing.

829
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,480
Thank you.

830
01:10:59,182 --> 01:11:00,949
Okay then.

831
01:11:07,084 --> 01:11:10,004
I hate these kinds of emotional quarrels.

832
01:11:12,177 --> 01:11:14,452
Why can't people be cool about this?

833
01:11:15,551 --> 01:11:18,149
I used to like Hyeong Yu Seong.

834
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:25,814
I shouldn't get hung up over someone who keeps talking about Yu Seong.

835
01:11:30,932 --> 01:11:32,563
I know.

836
01:11:35,445 --> 01:11:41,478
I could be more understanding since it's his first relationship.

837
01:11:57,326 --> 01:11:59,493
(Wu Seung Hyeon)

838
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:20,730
(I hate these kinds of emotional quarrels.)

839
01:12:42,368 --> 01:12:46,095
(eeeekkkkddddd)

840
01:12:58,445 --> 01:13:01,852
Dating other people does not matter.

841
01:13:01,852 --> 01:13:05,077
It doesn't matter who he dated in the past either.

842
01:13:05,077 --> 01:13:06,842
A relationship is led by two people.

843
01:13:06,842 --> 01:13:12,626
You two are dating for the first time, so it's important to get to know each other.

844
01:13:12,626 --> 01:13:17,080
I don't know how to tell him.

845
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,178
I keep avoiding it.

846
01:13:20,843 --> 01:13:23,028
Just remember one thing.

847
01:13:23,028 --> 01:13:26,675
Are you okay with losing him over something like this?

848
01:13:43,907 --> 01:13:50,397
(Jong Chan: eeeekkkkddddd)

849
01:13:50,397 --> 01:13:55,617
Cheers.

850
01:14:06,513 --> 01:14:10,638
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

851
01:14:10,638 --> 01:14:13,820
Cheers!

852
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:17,070
Don't say anything. I didn't eat it.

853
01:14:21,741 --> 01:14:22,811
Are you talking about the beef?

854
01:14:22,811 --> 01:14:24,621
It's really tasty.

855
01:14:24,621 --> 01:14:27,311
You have to eat it like this.

856
01:14:27,311 --> 01:14:30,448
Seung Hyeon, you seem distracted these days.

857
01:14:30,448 --> 01:14:34,881
I know the other work seems trivial compared to the J Card project,

858
01:14:34,881 --> 01:14:38,981
but someone has to do it. If not the youngest, then who else?

859
01:14:38,981 --> 01:14:40,481
It's not like that, Sir.

860
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:43,714
Even if you think it's trivial labor, think carefully.

861
01:14:43,714 --> 01:14:46,881
It may not look like it, but everyone is watching you.

862
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:51,414
I'm sorry. I'll get it together.

863
01:14:51,414 --> 01:14:57,314
Gosh, Team Leader Choi. An intern can make mistakes.

864
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:02,182
Seung Hyeon, have a drink.

865
01:15:02,182 --> 01:15:04,784
Are we out of drinks?

866
01:15:05,614 --> 01:15:09,148
Seung Hyeon, I'm sorry, but please go get some drinks.

867
01:15:09,148 --> 01:15:12,548
I'll go right away. Do you need anything else?

868
01:15:12,548 --> 01:15:17,143
No, just buy us drinks. Sorry.

869
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:32,014
Department Head Kim, is something bothering you?

870
01:15:32,711 --> 01:15:34,281
No.

871
01:15:48,948 --> 01:15:50,748
Department Head Kim.

872
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:55,748
I still can't understand you.

873
01:15:56,914 --> 01:16:01,587
You used to like Yu Seong, and I used to date him.

874
01:16:03,148 --> 01:16:06,014
And that bothers you.

875
01:16:06,014 --> 01:16:08,481

01:32:38,901 --> 01:32:40,330
Okay.

1054
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,960
I understand.

1055
01:32:49,431 --> 01:32:52,411
Something came up, you'll have to go home alone.

1056
01:32:52,411 --> 01:32:54,431
I'll call you after.

1057
01:33:04,451 --> 01:33:06,500
I have an urgent meeting, so I'll head out first.

1058
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:09,050
Everyone can leave when it's time and there are no issues.

1059
01:33:09,051 --> 01:33:11,351
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

1061
01:33:27,232 --> 01:33:29,610
(Hello, thank you for your interest in AR Planning's recruitment.)

1062
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:32,727
(Unfortunately, we are not able to hire you this time.)

1063

(Thank you for your interest, and we wish you the best for your future endeavors.)

1064

1065
01:33:39,016 --> 01:33:42,766
"It's great you made it that far."

1066
01:33:42,766 --> 01:33:46,969
"But deep down, didn't you know it would be difficult?"

1067
01:33:50,296 --> 01:33:53,336
I guess I expected too much.

1068
01:33:54,466 --> 01:33:57,003
They took me in as an intern,

1069
01:34:00,166 --> 01:34:03,136
so I thought I could become a full-time employee as well.

1070
01:34:06,563 --> 01:34:10,930
But as a high school graduate, this is as far as I can come.

1073
01:34:53,962 --> 01:34:57,697
I don't know how much I should tell you.

1074
01:34:58,956 --> 01:35:01,560
I was surprised by the result as well.

1075
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:06,442
He came in third for the aptitude test and received full points for his presentation and English interview.

1076
01:35:06,442 --> 01:35:09,232
But he failed the competency interview.

1077
01:35:09,232 --> 01:35:15,105
You need an A average, but Seung Hyeon received a C here.

1078
01:35:16,897 --> 01:35:18,243
Who gave him a C?

1079
01:35:18,243 --> 01:35:19,875
Team Leader Park.

1080
01:35:19,875 --> 01:35:25,809
He's a B University alum, like Team Leader Choi of the Model Planning Team.

1081
01:35:25,809 --> 01:35:28,909
I think Department Head Kim is trying to start something in the company with that kid beside him.

1082
01:35:30,647 --> 01:35:32,545
Is there nothing we can do?

1083
01:35:33,233 --> 01:35:39,273
I understand how you feel, but no rules were broken, so there's nothing we can do.

1084
01:35:39,273 --> 01:35:42,179
We can't do anything about the results. They are already out.

1085
01:35:43,619 --> 01:35:47,981
That's why I told you to humor the higher-ups sometimes.

1086
01:35:47,981 --> 01:35:50,510
This is a company.

1087
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:52,770
Do you think an organization exists for nothing?

1088
01:35:52,778 --> 01:35:58,131
It seems they got scared because you're so inflexible.

1089
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:03,870
So did he not get in because of me?

1090
01:36:03,870 --> 01:36:08,386
I told you to become the team leader several times.

1091
01:36:08,386 --> 01:36:11,229
That intern isn't the issue right now.

1092

1093
01:36:16,781 --> 01:36:18,918
I have something to tell you.

1094
01:36:23,553 --> 01:36:27,646
I can't change something that has been officially announced.

1095
01:36:27,646 --> 01:36:31,568
Although I'm the CEO, there are things that are beyond my control.

1096
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:44,401
Seung Hyeon is working hard until the very end.

1097
01:36:46,571 --> 01:36:51,337
After giving it some thought, I realized it's not my fault.

1098
01:36:51,337 --> 01:36:53,839
Hiring a high school graduate was a ploy for the company to earn points.

1099
01:36:53,839 --> 01:36:57,986
It was all just a show from the get-go.

1100
01:37:01,936 --> 01:37:04,342
Are you really going to end it like this?

1101
01:37:07,269 --> 01:37:10,939
If what you're saying is right,

1102
01:37:10,939 --> 01:37:13,839
then there's nothing we can do.

1103
01:37:13,839 --> 01:37:18,105
I'm someone that's not needed at this company.

1104
01:37:20,526 --> 01:37:26,066
It'll definitely be tough to change an organization that is rigid.

1105
01:37:26,066 --> 01:37:29,886
But we can easily change.

01:38:01,279 --> 01:38:02,919
CEO.

1110

If you're going to talk about that again, please go. This isn't like you, Jong Chan.

CEO.

1112
01:38:23,303 --> 01:38:29,506
Did you hear that Department Head Kim went to see the CEO several times? Apparently, it got very heated.

1113
01:38:44,379 --> 01:38:47,152
You don't have to do that for me.

1114
01:38:47,152 --> 01:38:50,386
That doesn't help me.

1115
01:38:50,386 --> 01:38:56,119
The important question was whether I was needed here.

1116
01:38:56,119 --> 01:38:58,452
But I was rejected.

1117
01:38:59,849 --> 01:39:02,986
I'm not doing this as your boyfriend.

1118
01:39:02,986 --> 01:39:06,586
I think this company really needs you.

1119
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:11,486
Thank you for saying that.

1120
01:39:19,192 --> 01:39:21,400
You did nothing wrong.

1121
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,710
You did so well.

1122
01:39:28,739 --> 01:39:33,172
This isn't fair, and I'm going to fix it.

1123
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:36,758
I think that's it for me.

1124
01:39:38,149 --> 01:39:40,758
Thank you for all your help.

1125
01:39:42,107 --> 01:39:44,518
I'll head out by myself today.

1126
01:40:35,036 --> 01:40:37,903
As you know, I'm not great with words,

1127
01:40:37,903 --> 01:40:41,936
so I can't fully express how I feel about you.

1128
01:40:41,936 --> 01:40:45,469
But call me anytime. I'll be waiting.

1129
01:40:58,911 --> 01:41:04,086
When did you film these? The composition and quality are amazing.

1130
01:41:04,086 --> 01:41:09,086
I received an award for my short film in high school.

1131
01:41:09,086 --> 01:41:11,703
I already knew that.

1132
01:41:11,703 --> 01:41:16,503
I shot some for the vlog, but filming is also a habit.

1133
01:41:16,503 --> 01:41:20,869
I switched to advertising and gave up film-making.

1134
01:41:20,869 --> 01:41:23,603
But I can't stop doing what I love.

1135
01:41:26,266 --> 01:41:30,403
I made some storyboards based on our discussion.

What should we do about this blank part?

1138
01:41:40,403 --> 01:41:43,236
We can't go back to the office.

1139
01:41:43,236 --> 01:41:46,769
I think we need more footage of you.

1140
01:41:48,466 --> 01:41:51,550
Why don't you draw something to fill up the empty spaces?

1141
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:53,869
I'll do the rest.

1142
01:41:53,869 --> 01:41:57,903
I also majored in animation in high school.

1143
01:41:57,903 --> 01:42:00,795

I don't have a fancy degree. I only have a high school diploma.

1157
01:42:39,769 --> 01:42:42,969
I joined pretty late as an intern, but I have colleagues.

1158
01:42:42,969 --> 01:42:46,836
I'm a high school grad, so I'm not affiliated to anywhere.

That's why we work harder.

1160
01:42:50,303 --> 01:42:53,969
We work faster and harder than others.

1161
01:42:53,969 --> 01:42:58,236
Working together, I learned that I'm capable of doing something.

1162

We will not despair.

1167

We are still young.

1168

Hey, isn't he that intern from before?

1189
01:44:34,369 --> 01:44:37,536
Yes, the one who came up with the idea for the ad.

- It was great.
- Indeed.

01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:26,007
Hyeong. I have something to say—

1220
01:47:26,007 --> 01:47:29,290
Wait, me first.

1221
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:31,540
Here.

1222
01:47:33,312 --> 01:47:35,612
What's going on?

1223
01:47:36,248 --> 01:47:38,318
(Two days ago)

1224
01:47:40,107 --> 01:47:41,407
What's going on?

1225
01:47:41,407 --> 01:47:44,673
How did interns like them fail the interview?

1226
01:47:44,673 --> 01:47:49,073
I'll check the recruitment system to find out the problem.

1227
01:47:49,073 --> 01:47:51,560
The problem is these two.

1228
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,840
The final results are already out,

1229
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:59,040
so changing the results will throw shade on our recruitment process.

1230
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,207
Is there nothing we can do?

1231
01:48:01,207 --> 01:48:03,840
Even CEO Lee of J Card posted a comment.

1232
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:07,940
What if they back out of the contract?

1233
01:48:13,607 --> 01:48:15,473
CEO.

1234
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,140
Have a seat.

1235
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:20,750
You need to come up with an idea.

1236
01:48:20,750 --> 01:48:22,973
Thank you for everything.

1237
01:48:22,973 --> 01:48:24,773
What do you mean?

1239
01:48:29,273 --> 01:48:33,407
Are you messing with me, you little punk? Hey!

1240
01:48:33,407 --> 01:48:34,920
Get out of my way! Mr. Jong Chan.

1242
01:48:37,251 --> 01:48:41,176
I, Kim Jong Chan, would like to make an offer to Wu Seung Hyeon, the most passionate man when it comes to ads,

1243
01:48:41,176 --> 01:48:45,534
as the head of JS Planning, a start-up company.

1244
01:48:45,534 --> 01:48:48,300
I know you'd like to go somewhere better,

1245
01:48:49,126 --> 01:48:52,822
but please be JS Planning's first employee.

1246
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:59,324
I'm sorry this is all I can do.

1247
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:03,417
Do you know what?

1248
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:08,921
You make me want to be a better person.

1249
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:12,480
It'll be hard building something from scratch.

1250
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,879
But if you believe in me...

1251
01:49:14,879 --> 01:49:19,473
No, I think you'll be great.

1252
01:49:19,473 --> 01:49:23,541
CEO Kim, I look forward to working together.

1253
01:49:36,508 --> 01:49:39,541
Why did you run all the way here?

1254
01:49:40,808 --> 01:49:45,228
I promised to face my troubles, but shut down again.

1255
01:49:45,228 --> 01:49:47,068
I'm sorry.

1256
01:49:48,241 --> 01:49:53,708
You're the one who made me realize what I like and what I'm good at.

1257
01:49:53,708 --> 01:49:57,208
Thank you and...

1258

I lo... I-lov...

1259
01:50:09,308 --> 01:50:11,508
Do you love me?

1260
01:50:11,508 --> 01:50:14,775
That wasn't romantic at all.

1261
01:50:14,775 --> 01:50:16,541
I'm not good at this kind of stuff.

1262

Let's try again. Come on.

1263
01:50:21,608 --> 01:50:23,508
