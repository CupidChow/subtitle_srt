Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,040
Episode 15

4
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,700
Understood.

5
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,060
Are all the gears working?

6
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,980
Yes.

7
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,580
Don't worry, Mr. Jiao.

8
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,780
This time we will definitely pass through.

9
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,700
I checked everything.

10
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,700
I'm running out of patience

11
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,300
If there is another accident,

12
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,580
you will

13
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,540
end up like him.

14
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,900
This is my last resort.

15
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,820
Increase the dose of medicine.

16
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,020
If he can wake up this time,

17
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,100
the dose can let him survive for another week.

18
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,300
If he can't wake up...

19
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,780
Girl, just keep walking without any fear.

20
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,780
Keep walking.

21
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,459
Never look back.

22
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,140
Panzi…

23
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,780
Mr. Third Junior.

24
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,380
I'm coming to pick you up.

25
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,900
Wu Xie.

26
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,460
Come with us.

27
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,380
Ning.

28
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,420
Panzi.

29
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,780
Just leave.

30
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,380
Wu Xie.

31
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:20,900
He woke up!

32
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,540
Naive.

33
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,340
Mr. Third Junior!

34
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,500
He woke up!

35
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,940
Fatty.

36
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:51,260
You're making a lot of noises.

37
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,940
How much longer can I live?

38
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,620
Tell me.

39
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,180
A week, at best.

40
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,820
A week.

41
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,660
Guys,

42
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,540
thank you for your help during the past period of time.

43
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,140
Thank you.

44
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,260
Fatty.

45
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,580
Where is Uncle Erbai?

46
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,820
I want to see him one last time.

47
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,420
What happened?

48
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,460
Sure.

49
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,900
What's going on?

50
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,900
What happened to Uncle Erbai?

51
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,700
Uncle Erbai.

52
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,540
I didn't expect that the first time I did as you told me,

53
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,420
things would end up like this.

54
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,300
Be careful. It's still a bit hot.

55
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,340
I know that

56
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,060
you did a lot for me for the past years.

57
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,220
I have always been

58
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,900
a troublemaker for you seniors to worry about.

59
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,060
But just because that you were there,

60
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,500
I could

61
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,660
be rest assured

62
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,660
and act boldly during my journey.

63
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,100
Because deep down I always believed that

64
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,220
no matter what happened,

65
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,940
you,

66
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,020
Uncle Sanxing,

67
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,180
Kylin,

68
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,900
and Fatty,

69
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,700
you guys would always be by my side.

70
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,700
But I didn't expect...

71
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,580
I didn't expect things to become like this.

72
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,540
I really didn't see it coming.

73
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,060
Come on.

74
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,820
What is it, Uncle Erbai?

75
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,260
Mr. Erbai tried his best

76
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,940
but he still couldn't find out who the spy is.

77
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,100
This person is very cunning.

78
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,660
Even Mr. Erbai

79
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,180
couldn't track him down.

80
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,140
Uncle Erbai.

81
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,660
I will take care from here.

82
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,260
I believe that

83
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,620
the spy will definitely show himself

84
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,940
when I make the deal with Mr. Jiao.

85
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,460
I will try to leave you a message.

86
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,740
If you see a chance,

87
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,100
you must kill him for me.

88
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,340
Uncle Erbai.

89
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,860
Be patient.

90
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,140
Leave

91
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,620
the spy thing to me.

92
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,460
I will find him.

93
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,820
Actually, for so many years

94
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,540
we had many opportunities that

95
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,900
we could have

96
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,140
chatted face to face.

97
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,300
But I always avoided you

98
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,020
because I was afraid you might ask me to pay you back.

99
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,900
Along the way,

100
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,380
you have done enough for me.

101
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,660
Thank you, Uncle Erbai.

102
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,540
I will walk alone

103
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,260
for the rest of my journey.

104
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,980
Don't worry.

105
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,540
I'll ask Erjing to take you back.

106
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,820
After you go back, just focus on recovering from your injury.

107
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,300
You will get better.

108
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,260
I'm sure of that.

109
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,660
Uncle Erbai.

110
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,300
Trust me.

111
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,660
Have faith in me, just this once.

112
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,580
Goodbye, Uncle Erbai.

113
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,540
Mr. Third Junior.

114
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,460
Have some porridge.

115
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,540
Thank you.

116
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,100
I'm fine.

117
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,140
I'm fine.

118
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,260
Mr. Third Junior.

119
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,340
There's something Your uncle Erbai wouldn't let me tell you.

120
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,540
But now I am desperate.

121
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,260
Before he and I came here,

122
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,420
we found another access.

123
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,700
But it's too dangerous.

124
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,940
That's why we chose to

125
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,460
focus on the entrance to Thunder City at Spring of Roar.

126
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,940
Where is that access?

127
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,340
Look.

128
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,060
This is Tianlin Building we're at now.

129
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,140
Isn't there a mountain next to it?

130
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,340
You'll enter a forest area from behind the mountain.

131
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,380
Walk for three days in it,

132
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,700
and you'll see a cliff.

133
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,620
Below this cliff

134
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,620
is the exit of Spring of Roar.

135
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,380
When you go down from here,

136
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,940
you might be able to find Thunder City from another direction.

137
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,300
Goodbye.

138
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,740
How can I get off the cliff?

139
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,620
With a parachute.

140
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,220
But

141
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
none of the people we sent there to try

142
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,460
came back alive.

143
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,100
Mr. Erbai felt that this way was too risky,

144
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,060
so later on,

145
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,820
we gave up this option.

146
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,820
Mr. Third Junior.

147
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,620
Mr. Erbai still has some unused parachute bags.

148
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,940
It's up to you whether to go or not.

149
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,340
Take me to get the bags.

150
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,420
You don't want to

151
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,060
bring me to the party?

152
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,260
But for the adventure this time…

153
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,460
it is nearly impossible to return alive, right?

154
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,380
I can't remember

155
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,140
how many times you have said this.

156
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,060
You said so every time.

157
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,780
You didn't get bored of it?

158
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,860
Besides,

159
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,740
what's the point if an adventure is not dangerous?

160
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,660
I thought you know very well that

161
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,700
the reason why we could have a narrow escape in every adventure

162
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,140
was that I was there.

163
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,780
We won't be so lucky every time.

164
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,580
I should be dead by now.

165
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,820
If I go down there

166
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,340
and can find Kylin and Glasses,

167
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,460
then it's like a good bargain for us.

168
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,540
But you guys are not me.

169
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,180
You still have a lot of time ahead of you.

170
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,540
You have a long life to enjoy.

171
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,020
There's no need to go on a suicide mission with me.

172
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,540
What are you talking about?

173
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,060
So you are Kylin's only friend?

174
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,420
For the past ten years,

175
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,060
it was just the two of you who have been fighting side by side?

176
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,220
I'm so jealous!

177
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,620
Was I ever absent for even a minute?

178
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,700
We are called The Trio.

179
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,100
If only two angles go down underground,

180
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,020
leaving one angle on the ground,

181
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,260
you are not afraid that you two can't stand still?

182
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
I'm jealous too.

183
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,500
The four of us have become sworn brothers and sister.

184
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,180
Although I am not willing to admit it,

185
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,700
I am like the fourth member of your Trio.

186
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,940
I am obliged to find our big brother.

187
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
You finally admit it.

188
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,100
I know you're a smart girl.

189
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,100
I will go with you too.

190
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,780
Since I decided to come with you guys at the beginning,

191
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,140
I won't leave until we finish the task

192
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,540
even if it's dangerous.

193
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,100
Me, too!

194
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,260
Are you guys still going?

195
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,740
Stop dawdling!

196
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,140
I need to go find Chief.

197
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,900
Look at how cocky he is.

198
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,380
Erjing said that

199
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,620
Uncle Erbai organized a unit to go down there several times.

200
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,340
But none of the people who went down came back.

201
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,860
I guess the thick fog is highly poisonous.

202
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,820
And finding the landing point is very important.

203
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,980
With such a heavy fog,

204
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,700
once you hit the cliff

205
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,980
and retract the parachute, you will fall to the ground and die immediately.

206
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,420
Here it comes again. You're so pessimistic.

207
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,420
Close your eyes and jump.

208
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,380
That's it!

209
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,980
I tested it just now.

210
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,900
It is southeast wind with grade 3 to 4.

211
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,860
The gorge on the east side has a bigger rift valley.

212
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,420
Let's land there.

213
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,180
That gorge is so deep that it seems bottomless.

214
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,300
And the wind changes unpredictably now.

215
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,100
If we carry a parachute

216
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
and just jump like this,

217
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,140
we are very likely to deviate from the original preset point.

218
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,660
And everyone will get separated easily.

219
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,100
So now there is only one way to do it.

220
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,020
After we jump,

221
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,620
the later you shoot out the parachute, the better.

222
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,940
Shoot it out when we get close to the ground.

223
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,180
So that we'll get closer to the preset landing spot.

224
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,660
But if we do that,

225
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,540
the risk will be greater, too.

226
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,180
Say no more.

227
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
No matter what you choose to do, we will be by your side.

228
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,460
Bai always gives good speech!

229
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,180
A bunch of fools.

230
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,020
Wish this bunch of fools are blessed.

231
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,100
Are you guys alright?

232
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,580
These gas masks don't work!

233
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,300
What should we do?

234
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,940
The poisonous fog is fierce.

235
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,260
We need to transfer

236
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,860
to a safer place now!

237
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,420
Got it.

238
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,060
Let's go.

239
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,180
Are you okay?

240
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,860
Bai.

241
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,780
Bai.

242
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,300
Go.

243
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,260
Naive.

244
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,980
You finally woke up.

245
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,980
Look who this handsome guy is.

246
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,500
So in the end,

247
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,580
it was still you who came to save my ass.

248
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,820
Of course.

249
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,580
Kylin will definitely come for us.

250
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,780
I forgot to hug you.

251
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,340
I miss you so much, Kylin.

252
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:00,860
We'll never separate again.

253
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,820
I'm hugging you now.

254
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,660
That's enough. Fatty.

255
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:04,900
Kylin.

256
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,020
Let me introduce her to you.

257
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,860
This is the girl I never mentioned to you.

258
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,500
The fourth member of our squad now, Bai.

259
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:09,980
Bai.

260
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,220
This is our big brother whom I always mentioned to you.

261
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,100
Kylin.

262
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,740
Thank you, Kylin.

263
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,020
The four of us finally got together!

264
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,460
Kylin.

265
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,460
I still have some more introduction to do.

266
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,460
These two new friends are the bodyguards of Bai.

267
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,300
That's not true!

268
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,100
Look at that guy

269
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,780
with a thick bowl haircut.

270
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,580
This is Jia Kezi.

271
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,620
This one who

272
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,900
has the similar hair style like me is not as handsome as me.

273
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,220
His name is Li Jiale.

274
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,660
That's a lot to take in, right?

275
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,340
Let's hug again.

276
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,780
I haven't had enough.

277
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,460
Mr. Jiao.

278
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,820
I brought you out of the water.

279
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,460
Is the exit in front of us?

280
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,860
Go further.

281
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,260
It's a dead end.

282
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,060
There is a mark.

283
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,940
This is a mark of the Zhang family.

284
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,620
It means there is a door here.

285
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,700
But there is danger behind the door.

286
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,860
I believe you.

287
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,540
What is the smell?

288
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,940
Yes, this is the exit.

289
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,660
But the fog outside is poisonous.

290
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,140
If it's just some poisonous fog,

291
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,100
he wouldn't have

292
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,940
left such a mark here.

293
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,580
Based on what I know about the Zhang family,

294
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,060
there must be something extremely dangerous behind the door.

295
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,180
Third.

296
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,220
Go in there and take a look.

297
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,020
Third.

298
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,060
Remember.

299
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,100
Tread lightly.

300
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,500
In case of danger,

301
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,020
shake the rope

302
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,220
and we will pull you out.

303
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,620
Pull the rope!

304
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,260
What…

305
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,300
What's going on?

306
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,100
So scary!

307
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,580
The rope broke!

308
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,820
Where's he?

309
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,460
How could this happen?

310
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,300
Where's he?

311
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,660
After we entered the cave, I have felt better.

312
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,900
I can breathe smoothly, too.

313
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,980
Fortunately, we weren't exposed to the poisonous fog for a long time.

314
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,780
The key is we got lucky.

315
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,420
You all have to thank Kylin.

316
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,460
If it weren't for him who

317
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,700
dragged them back one by one with his great strength,

318
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,340
everyone would have been killed by the fog.

319
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,700
How did you escape from Spring of Roar?

320
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,340
The cave we stayed had very thin wall.

321
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,740
Kylin and I tried to find the current by the sound.

322
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,140
Finally, we found

323
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,940
a passage the Japanese invaders dug during the war

324
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,260
which led to here.

325
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,780
But we didn't expect that

326
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,660
this place was even more dangerous than the cave before.

327
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,340
When we first came here,

328
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,260
it was raining.

329
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,060
It was actually fun when it was raining.

330
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,860
But then the rain stopped and

331
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,180
the poisonous fog began to appear.

332
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,980
We realized things became a bit dangerous for us.

333
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:57,980
So

334
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,460
we have been hiding here since then.

335
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,100
There is a neurotoxin in the fog.

336
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,700
It will cause suffocation and breathlessness

337
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,260
when you first inhale it.

338
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,980
If the toxin goes deeper in your system,

339
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,660
it will affect the nerve center to

340
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,460
cause confusion of mind, and delirium in the end.

341
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,860
My blood has a certain resistance to it.

342
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,700
But I still can't be exposed to the fog for too long.

343
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:24,970
That means we are

344
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,300
trapped here.

345
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,660
That's true.

346
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,180
But at least

347
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,490
we saw you guys

348
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,490
and we are very happy.

349
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,660
It's empty underneath.

350
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,450
Many military provisions

351
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,930
are buried beneath.

352
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,010
My guess is that the Japanese invaders

353
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,530
tried to develop gas bombs with the poisonous fog in this valley.

354
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,100
There are hundreds of

355
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,140
small shelters like this one in this valley.

356
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,660
Let me explain to you.

357
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,300
Come here.

358
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,930
This is where we are.

359
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,500
At intervals

360
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,820
there is a small shelter.

361
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,660
What Kylin and I did was

362
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,940
moving to the next shelter

363
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,420
when it rained.

364
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,500
But this approach has a disadvantage.

365
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,700
You don't know when it will rain.

366
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,900
Fortunately, we brought enough food with us.

367
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,620
We got pilot biscuits, water and whatnot which can

368
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,900
at least support us to survive for about two weeks.

369
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,460
If you guys didn't come,

370
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,380
we would really be trapped here.

371
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,020
Because apart from the poisonous fog,

372
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,700
there is another terrible thing here.

373
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,540
There is a bell here.

374
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,140
After you go in there,

375
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,700
at intervals

376
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,260
shake the bell calmly to prove your safety.

377
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,580
In case of danger,

378
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,020
shake the bell quickly.

379
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,180
And we will save you.

380
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,140
Why do you want to do it again?

381
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,260
That thing that would attack people

382
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,660
will drag the body away.

383
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,020
A rope can't tie the body to it.

384
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,460
But I can follow the sound of the bell to find it.

385
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,660
But I have to sacrifice one of your men.

386
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,460
One person from both sides. Fair enough.

387
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,700
Wait for a bit longer.

388
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,620
Third!

389
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,540
Third!

390
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,180
Third!

391
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,740
Such a loser.

392
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,420
What did you see?

393
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,660
Monster, there is a monster!

394
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,180
Monster!

395
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:25,660
Are you alright?

396
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,980
Shoot at the direction of the bell sound!
