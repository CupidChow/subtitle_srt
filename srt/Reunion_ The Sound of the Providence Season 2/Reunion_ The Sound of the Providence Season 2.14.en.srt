00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,280
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,310
Episode 14

4
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,360
These are gas bombs.

5
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,230
This

6
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,680
should be a Japanese invaders' base

7
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,270
for storing gas bombs.

8
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,000
Everyone, be careful.

9
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,800
Look at this.

10
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,680
Give me one of these

11
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,040
Give me one of these.

12
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,080
Okay.

13
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,680
This is yours.

14
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,440
Me, too.

15
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,190
Don't crowd!

16
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,230
Guns.

17
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,190
A lot of guns.

18
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,310
The weaponry is new.

19
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,079
Why did we have to prepare guns since we could get so many guns for free here?

20
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,079
This model is too old.

21
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,800
Does it still work?

22
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,320
Take everything you can.

23
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,160
Okay.

24
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,030
Let's take some, too.

25
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,470
Take everything with us.

26
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,190
This is the exit of Spring of Roar.

27
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,630
Looks like we need to dive underwater to go in there.

28
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:32,720
Hong.

29
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,600
Mr. Jiao.

30
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,600
Go in the water.

31
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,470
Get him a set of gear.

32
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,550
Yes, sir.

33
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,670
Wait.

34
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,070
I hear something.

35
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,760
Wu Xie.

36
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,920
You can't run away.

37
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They are still alive!

38
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,880
In the deepest part of the rift.

39
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,880
Really?

40
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,040
How can we go down there?

41
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,790
Bai,

42
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,000
when I hit the trap above,

43
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,159
I found a hole above us

44
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,270
which should lead to the bottom.

45
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,070
Come with me.

46
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:55,670
Hurry up!

47
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,880
Where is it?

48
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,390
Over here.

49
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,350
Come on.

50
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,840
Jiang Zisuan, come on!

51
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,840
No. We can't get through by diving.

52
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,080
It's too deep with many forks.

53
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,440
We need to carry

54
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,200
a lot of oxygen tanks with us to relay

55
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,320
since we need to dive for four hours straight.

56
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,590
This is impossible.

57
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,200
The location at the angle below the moon

58
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,080
is where you are looking for.

59
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,640
Should we have to wait until the tide ebbs?

60
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,550
No.

61
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,080
It's too dangerous to go into the water now.

62
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,550
You have to go down there

63
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,760
even if you have to die.

64
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,790
Even someone like Zhang Qiling died in the water.

65
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,670
Ordinary people will never make it.

66
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,400
Mr. Jiao.

67
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,840
Are you sure?

68
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm sure.

69
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,520
Did you see any dead bodies in water?

70
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,710
No.

71
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,150
The space underwater is too big.

72
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,230
We need to have

73
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,110
a detailed road map.

74
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,000
Mr. Jiao.

75
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,760
If we get lost

76
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,590
when we're diving in the cave,

77
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
all of us will die.

78
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,550
I know.

79
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,400
Get ready.

80
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,400
Why did you want to save me?

81
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,400
You think by doing this,

82
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,200
you can repay your debt to my sister.

83
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,320
Then you won't be scourged by your conscience, right?

84
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,080
I can never repay my debt to her.

85
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,960
Although her death was an accident,

86
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,030
I was also to blame for it.

87
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,670
Actually everyone's fate

88
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,080
is their own choice.

89
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,440
It applies to me,

90
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,470
and to you, too.

91
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,350
Over the past years

92
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,590
I've been trying every means to make myself stronger.

93
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,710
Because this is the only way

94
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,910
I can reduce the possibility of

95
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,350
seeing someone in my life die in front of me.

96
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,760
So that's what you live for.

97
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,760
Do you know what I live for then?

98
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,350
The sole purpose of my life is to kill you.

99
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,030
Why did you save me?

100
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,440
What kind of person are you?

101
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,840
Jiang Zisuan.

102
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,280
Actually all you need to do is wait a bit longer.

103
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,910
I can't live for long anyway.

104
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,280
By then you'll get your revenge.

105
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,110
But I still have

106
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,880
a very important task to do.

107
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,910
So I can't die yet.

108
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
Not today.

109
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,470
That's how you turned around and left, right?

110
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,880
You went on with your own task

111
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,030
and left my sister there to die.

112
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,590
Right?

113
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,350
Let's go!

114
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,840
Do your people know how to modify bombs?

115
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,320
My people can turn them into mines.

116
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,150
Give them something extra.

117
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,550
Mr. Third Junior!

118
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,320
Wu Xie!

119
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,150
Mr. Third Junior!

120
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,670
Kezi.

121
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,030
Kezi.

122
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:32,000
Help him up.

123
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,760
Kezi, wake up.

124
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,760
Kezi.

125
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:37,710
Kezi.

126
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,440
Kezi.

127
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's go.

128
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,150
Stand up.

129
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,110
This way.

130
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,440
Let's go.

131
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,350
Mr. Third Junior.

132
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,670
How are you feeling?

133
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,880
Mr. Third Junior.

134
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,840
Your trachea is blocked by extravasated blood.

135
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,550
You have to cough up the blood.

136
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,200
Let me help you up.

137
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,640
Lie down here.

138
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,310
Come on.

139
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,880
Lean against the rock.

140
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,470
Are you feeling better?

141
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,590
You freaked me out.

142
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,640
Much better.

143
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,920
Go.

144
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,760
Have you come in?

145
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,950
What are you doing? Keep up.

146
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,710
I want to see you in three minutes.

147
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,470
Did you hear me?

148
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,560
Go this way.

149
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,000
Okay.

150
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,230
How are you feeling?

151
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,590
Do you want to take a break?

152
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,950
No. I'm fine.

153
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,640
Let's go.

154
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,070
Wait.

155
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,430
Don't forget to wear a swimsuit.

156
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,590
Oh, come on!

157
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,640
Jiang Zisuan didn't keep up.

158
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,040
Maybe he stepped on a gas bomb?

159
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,640
I have given him his chance.

160
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,110
Let's go.

161
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,280
Yes sir!

162
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,640
Okay!

163
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,350
Go,

164
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,680
go,

165
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,950
go!

166
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,470
Are you alright?

167
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Take a break.

168
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,280
I'm fine.

169
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,880
The terrain here is getting wider and wider.

170
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,000
Maybe we're not far from the exit?

171
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,000
What are you doing?

172
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,110
The signal here is getting stronger.

173
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,590
Be careful.

174
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,230
I am with Mr. Third Junior.

175
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,400
Come meet us quickly.

176
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,040
I contacted…

177
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,640
What's going on?

178
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,280
I…

179
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,800
I stepped on something.

180
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,000
Don't move.

181
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,350
Don't come over.

182
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,640
Don't come closer.

183
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,560
You stepped on a bomb with a pressure sensor.

184
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,310
Leave me alone. Just go!

185
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,230
Jiang Zisuan will catch up in a while.

186
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,520
What are you doing? Leave.

187
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,280
Leave me alone.

188
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,040
Shut up.

189
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,350
Leave me alone. Just go!

190
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,800
Leave me alone. Just go!

191
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,710
Don't move.

192
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,920
Why?

193
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,280
I'm going to count to three,

194
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,400
let go of your foot on the count of three.

195
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,190
One,

196
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,230
two,

197
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,830
three.

198
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,280
Leave!

199
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,000
No!

200
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,680
Just go.

201
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,680
No.

202
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,830
You think death is funny?

203
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,400
Are you out of your mind?

204
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,230
I'm out of my mind!

205
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,920
Get lost!

206
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,000
-Piss off. -No.

207
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,680
I won't leave no matter how you scold me.

208
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,160
Leave now!

209
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,190
Sorry.

210
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,470
Jiang Zisuan is coming.

211
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,430
Bai.

212
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,160
Just listen to me.

213
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,560
I can remove

214
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,070
this bomb.

215
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,800
But I need you to stall Jiang Zisuan for me.

216
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,070
Do you hear me?

217
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,110
Try to buy time as much as you can.

218
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,760
Believe me.

219
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,400
Go now.

220
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,760
I believe you.

221
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,470
Believe me.

222
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,640
It's me.

223
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,310
Are you okay?

224
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,710
Mr. Third Junior, you'll be fine.

225
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,590
Mr. Third Junior.

226
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,230
Do not move.

227
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,470
Tread lightly.

228
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,230
Come with me.

229
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,400
Are you okay?

230
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,350
I'm fine.

231
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,000
-Wu Xie! -Mr. Third Junior!

232
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,560
What happened?

233
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,000
I stepped on a bomb.

234
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,880
I am going to explore the way.

235
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
Be careful.

236
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,680
Kezi. You'll come with me.

237
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,560
No problem.

238
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,310
Huo Daofu.

239
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,470
How much longer can I still hang in there?

240
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,070
You are too weak now.

241
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,470
You won't last long.

242
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,310
We have to get out of here as soon as possible.

243
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,070
I found an exit.

244
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,920
And I also found a mark.

245
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,470
Let's go.

246
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,190
Let's go.

247
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,560
This way.

248
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,920
What does this mark mean?

249
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,110
This was left by Kylin.

250
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,160
We should go this way.

251
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,350
Go.

252
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,830
Be careful.

253
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,350
There are a lot of equipment here.

254
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,640
Should be left by Mr. Jiao's people.

255
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,520
Do not move.

256
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,590
Mr. Jiao

257
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,710
set another trap here.

258
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,430
This place has been heavily mined.

259
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,070
Everyone, be careful.

260
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,160
Watch your step.

261
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,880
Let's find the exit

262
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,040
and catch up with Kylin and others.

263
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,710
Okay.

264
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,470
Come on.

265
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,470
There is another mark.

266
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,880
Over there.

267
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,520
Are you okay?

268
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,520
Yes.

269
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,880
This isn't left by Kylin.

270
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:45,800
What is it?

271
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,760
It's a mark by lipstick.

272
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,590
Lipstick?

273
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,310
It was left by Sanye.

274
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,880
But who did Sanye leave this mark for?

275
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,590
Jiang Zisuan.

276
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,430
It seems that Mr. Jiao not only wanted to blow us up.

277
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,000
He also wanted to abandon

278
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,400
a pawn of his, Jiang Zisuan.

279
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,280
There is a way ahead.

280
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,470
Come on.

281
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,280
Let's go.

282
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,560
I'm fine.

283
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,400
Get out of the way!

284
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,590
Wu Xie!

285
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,920
Show yourself.

286
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,430
Let's settle our score once and for all today.

287
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,590
Jiang Zisuan.

288
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,560
It's a gas bomb.

289
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:00,920
Come here.

290
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,800
I'm begging you.

291
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,560
Wu Xie.

292
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,000
Wu Xie.

293
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,350
Wu Xie!

294
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,430
Come out.

295
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:27,950
Don't go.

296
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,280
Wu Xie.

297
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,350
Come out.

298
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,230
Then let's die together.

299
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,430
Die together.

300
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,920
Die together.

301
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,590
Die together!

302
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,710
Hurry up, Mr. Third Junior!

303
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,640
Don't watch anymore. Let's go.

304
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,430
Faster!

305
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,190
Let's go. Come on!

306
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:01,880
Wu Xie!

307
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,110
Come on.

308
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,560
Hang in there.

309
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,710
Wu Xie, hang in there.

310
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,190
We'll be back to the entrance soon.

311
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:15,950
Let's go.

312
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,680
Why is the entrance blocked?

313
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,800
Erjing!

314
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,400
Fatty!

315
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,680
Jiang Zisuan, that bastard!

316
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:43,830
He blew up the entrance

317
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
trying to separate me and Naive.

318
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,190
You wish!

319
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,310
The Trio will never separate.

320
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,400
Force it open!

321
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,160
Fatty!

322
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,040
Stop yelling.

323
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,150
They can't hear us.

324
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,000
They are already digging the entrance.

325
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,430
But at this speed,

326
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,360
we'll be dead

327
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,230
when they finally dig it through.

328
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,470
The poisonous gas will come up any minute.

329
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,190
Huo Daofu.

330
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,000
Do you have any other potent medicine?

331
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,280
Give me something.

332
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,120
It's no use whatever medicine you take now.

333
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,870
If we can't get out of here soon,

334
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
I can't save your life.

335
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,360
Jia Kezi.

336
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,950
You and Li Jiale stay here.

337
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,000
Try to get in touch with Fatty.

338
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,390
Bai.

339
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,470
Come with me.

340
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,910
When I just arrived at Spring of Roar,

341
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,800
I dived in the water to survey the site.

342
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,870
There is a hole underwater

343
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,280
which may lead to outside.

344
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,600
But the hole is too small for me to get through.

345
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,150
But you should be able to do it.

346
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,390
I got it.

347
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,470
I'll swim out to inform Fatty and others.

348
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,040
You must stay alive and wait for us to save you.

349
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,230
Okay.

350
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,600
Be safe.

351
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,120
I know you'll be fine.

352
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,040
Dig! Move the debris!

353
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,560
Move it quickly.

354
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,000
Okay.

355
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:08,800
Wu Xie.

356
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,870
Wu Xie!

357
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,360
Wu Xie, don't fall asleep.

358
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,560
How's it going?

359
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,080
Hurry up!

360
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,520
Naive.

361
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,520
Hang in there and wait for us!

362
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,800
Fatty is coming!

363
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,910
I'm coming for you!

364
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:11,870
Fatty!

365
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,800
Come on, Fatty!

366
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,600
Bai?

367
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,470
How did you come out?

368
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,600
The gas bombs inside exploded.

369
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,520
We must immediately break open the entrance.

370
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,430
There's poisonous gas!

371
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,430
We need at least six or seven hours

372
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,000
to dig through.

373
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,360
That'll be too late.

374
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,000
Fatty, think of something, please.

375
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,000
I know, I know.

376
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,080
Give me some time.

377
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,560
Blast a hole!

378
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,630
We can't!

379
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:33,800
If you blow up this place,

380
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,430
the blast may cause the cave down there to collapse completely.

381
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,800
I said we can, and I know we can.

382
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,870
There is no other way.

383
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,280
We can't use this entrance anymore.

384
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,080
We must blast another entrance.

385
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,630
Hurry up!

386
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,040
Liu Sang.

387
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,870
Listen and tell me

388
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,280
where the thinnest rock is.

389
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:51,910
Come on!

390
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,390
3.45 meters.

391
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:58,630
Here.

392
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,870
4.62 meters.

393
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,870
4.62.

394
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,950
Over here. Hurry!

395
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:07,910
Here.

396
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,120
2.52 meters.

397
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,870
Then this is it.

398
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,710
No. Listen again.

399
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,150
-No. -4.15 meters.

400
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,840
Just right here.

401
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,630
Blast it open!

402
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,360
Wu Xie!

403
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,840
Fatty.

404
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,120
Huo Daofu.

405
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,710
Tell them to take cover.

406
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,190
Fatty is going to blow an entrance open.

407
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,120
Stand up.

408
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,080
You two, stay away from the entrance.

409
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,870
They're going to blast it!

410
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:40,840
Got it!

411
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:41,630
Go.

412
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,190
Three,

413
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,430
two,

414
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:03,630
one!

415
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,950
Seal the entrance quickly!

416
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,390
Don't let the poisonous gas leak.

417
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,560
Huo Daofu!

418
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,320
He took the medicine, but the effective time has expired.

419
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,840
It's too late.

420
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,040
Send him to that room, now!

421
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,120
Hurry up!

422
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,190
Mr. Third Junior!

423
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,120
-Wu Xie! -Naive!

424
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:20,760
Faster!

425
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,950
Naive, stay with me!

426
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,800
Let's go. Move!

427
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,710
This is the person injured by the gas bomb just now.

428
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,800
Jiao.

429
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,080
He's seriously injured.

430
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,950
I don't think he can make it.

431
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,320
I'll let you decide what to do.

432
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,520
He came here for you.

433
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,000
Understood.
