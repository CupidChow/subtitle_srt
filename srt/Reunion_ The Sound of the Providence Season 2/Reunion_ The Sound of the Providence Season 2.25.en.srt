Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,160
Episode 25

4
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,380
Handle them with care.

5
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,100
Okay.

6
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,540
Got it, boss.

7
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,580
This feels so good.

8
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,340
Chubby!

9
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,540
What are you doing?

10
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,700
Sweeping the floor

11
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,100
You call this sweeping the floor?

12
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:46,620
Who would sweep the floor like this?

13
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,340
You never paid attention to how Wang Meng

14
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,700
swept the floor?

15
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,220
Give it to me.

16
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,900
You should at least have seen

17
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,820
how fish swim even if you haven't enjoyed fish.

18
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,379
You…

19
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,300
No matter what job you're doing,

20
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,020
you have to love all aspects of it.

21
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,379
You have to have passions for it.

22
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,180
Look!

23
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,540
Feel it?

24
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,420
Wang Meng…

25
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,100
But Mr. Third Junior,

26
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,100
Wang Meng hasn't come to the shop for several days.

27
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,700
Even when he comes, he will go in the room to play games right away.

28
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,780
So what?

29
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,020
So what Wang Meng plays video games

30
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,220
or Minesweeper game for a while?

31
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,700
He always works so hard.

32
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,380
He can't relax for a while?

33
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,980
Besides, Wang Meng…

34
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,940
I have sent him out there to

35
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
do a more important job. He's our buyer now.

36
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,700
Isn't his work challenging?

37
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,860
The more I say it,

38
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,780
the more I feel that Wang Meng has been working so hard.

39
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,540
I need to give him a pay rise.

40
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,500
He's doing work worthy of five thousand yuan

41
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,220
with a salary of just 500 yuan.

42
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,300
That's so not fair.

43
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,700
I am going to give him a pay rise now.

44
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,700
Where is the salary sheet?

45
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,700
In the room at the back.

46
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,740
Give him a pay rise.

47
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,020
Chubby.

48
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,540
You just need to be

49
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,580
as hard-working as Wang Meng.

50
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,060
One day

51
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,020
you will be a good employee like him.

52
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,300
Thank you, boss!

53
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,780
Go get it!

54
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,260
Is Mr. Third Junior still there?

55
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:16,900
Yes.

56
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,100
They said he's making preparations.

57
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,180
His shop's business is pretty good.

58
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,020
But Wang Meng is not in the shop recently.

59
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,860
He is still in the shop?

60
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,460
Isn't he supposed to investigate

61
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,660
what happened with his friends now?

62
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,660
Those people are in very bad condition now.

63
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,620
It is said that someone else has already looked into this matter.

64
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,569
He is making sufficient preparations on his own.

65
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,370
He seems to have a big plan that he wants to carry out.

66
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,860
Bro!

67
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,980
What's going on?

68
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,580
What happened?

69
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,500
Are you okay?

70
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,220
Hurry up!

71
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,540
He's still alive.

72
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,820
But he is too weak now.

73
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,060
Leave one person to stay and take care of him.

74
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,020
The rest of us will go first.

75
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,540
Okay.

76
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,020
Fatty.

77
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,740
What is it?

78
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,380
Look.

79
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,500
Ganyin section.

80
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,300
Done.

81
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,540
Let's go.

82
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,060
This way.

83
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,900
Got it.

84
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,440
<i>Ganyin section</i>

85
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,220
From the topographic map of this section of unredeemable goods,

86
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,940
we have almost reached their destination.

87
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,900
It looks exactly the same as Ganyang section.

88
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,660
Ganyin section.

89
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,900
Ganyang section.

90
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,180
Is it equivalent to a men's and ladies' room?

91
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:41,940
Bai.

92
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,500
I haven't seen you smile for a long time.

93
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,460
You're so beautiful when you smile.

94
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,500
The structure here is

95
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,260
exactly the same as Ganyang section.

96
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,740
These bronze coffins

97
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,380
were salvaged from the water.

98
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,900
Look at this article serial number.

99
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,500
They're the same as the one we saw.

100
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,540
Be careful.

101
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,740
Don't touch anything.

102
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,660
Come and take a look.

103
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,740
There's one coffin missing here.

104
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,820
It should be the coffin that appeared in Ganyang section.

105
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,900
Forget-it.

106
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:25,860
Let's go.

107
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,620
This way.

108
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,380
Forget-it.

109
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,140
Forget-it!

110
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,420
Come here.

111
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:04,820
Go.

112
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,180
What is the smell?

113
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,060
We have arrived.

114
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,260
This is the Place of Rebirth shown on the map.

115
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,140
What a pungent smell.

116
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,220
Be careful.

117
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,860
Got it.

118
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,180
It's actually a lab.

119
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,020
Can the so-called Place of Rebirth

120
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,340
be a lab to develop the antidote to the toxin?

121
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,140
There are more than one smell.

122
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,020
Everyone, be alert.

123
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,060
What is this for?

124
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,980
Looks like some kind of equipment to

125
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,380
soak something with potion in it.

126
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,580
Suansuan.

127
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,420
Come here.

128
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,100
"Soaking in the potion for 49 days

129
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,860
can eliminate toxins from the body."

130
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,980
Folk remedies always cure serious illness.

131
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,700
Soak…

132
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,180
Look.

133
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,540
These potions are newly made.

134
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,900
Is Jiang Yuan making the antidote here?

135
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,620
Come here now!

136
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,540
The smell of this ore is the same as the potion.

137
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,460
What's going on?

138
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,260
What is he doing?

139
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,340
Can he bear the rank smell?

140
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,940
He keeps poisoning people and studying the antidote at the same time,

141
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,900
which means that he has a plan.

142
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,660
But the most important thing is that

143
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,980
he was poisoned by the toxins in the bronze fragment but still stays alive to this day.

144
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,300
Maybe this antidote really works.

145
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,820
Then let's

146
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,620
take some of this antidote back.

147
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,940
Then we can cure…

148
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:35,940
Sang?

149
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,500
Liu Sang!

150
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,660
Liu Sang! Liu Sang!

151
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:38,900
Save Sang!

152
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,780
Fatty, go!

153
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,500
-The red button is the switch. -Sang!

154
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,940
Sang.

155
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:53,860
Electricity leakage.

156
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,820
Push up!

157
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,340
Come on. Push harder.

158
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,980
Harder!

159
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,660
Smash it!

160
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,020
Smash it down!

161
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,860
Sang.

162
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,340
Liu Sang!

163
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:25,900
Hurry up!

164
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,180
Sang.

165
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,700
Be careful.

166
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,420
Come on.

167
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,100
Hurry up!

168
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,260
Hurry up!

169
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,060
Mr. Third Junior, hurry up!

170
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,020
Go, now!

171
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,260
Come on!

172
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:05,940
Naive.

173
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,300
Bai.

174
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,260
You guys go without me.

175
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,020
Bai.

176
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,780
Naive.

177
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,700
Mr. Third Junior,

178
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,100
you can't go in there.

179
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,300
Mr. Third Junior!

180
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,740
Let go of me!

181
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,820
-You can't go in. -Let go!

182
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,500
Bai.

183
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,580
Mr. Third Junior.

184
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,180
Let go!

185
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,610
It'll only create more dangers if you go in there!

186
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,740
Mr. Third Junior!

187
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,260
Mr. Third Junior!

188
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:38,060
Bai.

189
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,580
Mr. Third Junior.

190
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,860
You can't go in.

191
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,780
Mr. Third Junior.

192
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,820
Mr. Third Junior!

193
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,460
You can't go in!

194
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,460
Kylin.

195
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,540
You always come at the perfect timing.

196
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,740
Let's go.

197
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,420
Go. Come on!

198
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,700
Let's go! Come on!

199
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,900
Go in there.

200
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,780
Come on! Come on!

201
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,900
Go in.

202
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,580
Come in.

203
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,940
Where's Jiang Yuan?

204
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,220
He entered a secret door.

205
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,660
I guess he has run away.

206
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,740
He'd better pray he won't be caught by me.

207
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,820
If he falls in my hands,

208
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,980
he will wish he'd be dead.

209
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,140
Liu Sang, Liu Sang!

210
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,060
Liu Sang.

211
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,980
Liu Sang.

212
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,900
Liu Sang.

213
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,900
He is seriously poisoned.

214
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,140
The fire burned everything up.

215
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,700
There's no antidote anymore.

216
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,060
How can we cure Sang?

217
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,100
The toxin has gone deep in his system.

218
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,620
Since there's no ready-made antidote,

219
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,420
let's try ore steaming therapy.

220
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,940
Folk remedies always cure serious illness.

221
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:20,980
Make a fire.

222
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,220
Come on.

223
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,660
According to the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon,

224
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,140
the cause of one's sickness or toxins can

225
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,740
be cured with a steaming remedy since

226
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,940
with sweating, it can detoxify the toxins.

227
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,500
Desperate time calls for desperate measures.

228
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,740
Try the steaming remedy.

229
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,220
Come on.

230
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,020
Let's put Sang on the grill.

231
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,220
Come on.

232
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,060
Fatty, be serious.

233
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,460
This remedy doesn't look so reliable.

234
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,580
It didn't show effect.

235
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,940
Maybe it's not strong enough.

236
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,020
Some more.

237
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,780
Look! Come on!

238
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,780
He responds to it!

239
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,660
Kanjian, what are you doing?

240
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,380
Put it away!

241
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,820
Is he okay?

242
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,580
Why is he twitching?

243
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,900
He's alright.

244
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,380
Get up.

245
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,420
Are you fully recovered?

246
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,220
Are all your body parts still functioning?

247
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,020
The pigmentation on his skin is much less now.

248
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,060
Looks like the remedy works.

249
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,620
Although I am not sure about the principle yet,

250
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,580
there is no other way right now.

251
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,660
Try it on other poisoned patients.

252
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,940
We found a way.

253
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,620
I told you that you won't die.

254
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,740
But it's not because you got lucky.

255
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,260
We saved your life together.

256
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,300
I would never have expected that

257
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,180
our trip which led to

258
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,420
such a shabby lab

259
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,780
actually works.

260
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,620
Ore steam therapy.

261
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,660
Let me try it, too.

262
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,300
I…

263
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:19,660
Fatty.

264
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,620
I am also sick!

265
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,540
Do you have a problem with that?

266
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,180
Liu Sang, come down first.

267
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,940
It seems that the toxin

268
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,540
has been drawn out from his body.

269
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,780
It seems to be working for the time being.

270
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,620
But the specific principle behind it is still unclear.

271
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,020
After we get out of here,

272
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,260
let's take the ore for further inspections.

273
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,140
Let's

274
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,100
notify the staff on the ground

275
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,300
so that they can save the poisoned people's lives.

276
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,420
Bai.

277
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,020
Contact Director Tong

278
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,580
saying that we found a cure and

279
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,780
I hope they can fully cooperate with us.

280
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,500
Okay.

281
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,700
Mr. Third Junior.

282
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,060
Mr. Third Junior.

283
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,140
Bro, I fell.

284
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,860
Come over and pull me up.

285
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,860
I can still fight.

286
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,340
But I need you to help me.

287
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,580
What are you doing?

288
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,100
Uncle Erjing?

289
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,980
Why didn't you make a sound when you came in here?

290
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,100
You scared me.

291
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,140
I've been calling you outside for a long time.

292
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,380
Sorry.

293
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,420
I was wearing headphones. I was playing...

294
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,980
I was studying.

295
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,260
I brought you some Early-spring Longjing Tea.

296
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,300
Thank you.

297
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,420
The heat. Turn off the heat!

298
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,780
This thing must be broken.

299
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,060
Didn't you tell me that

300
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,620
you wanted to start implementing a plan?

301
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,100
Why haven't you done anything yet?

302
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,620
A plan?

303
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,540
That's right.

304
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,340
I, we are now implementing the plan.

305
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,980
But I am preparing the gears and equipment we need now.

306
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,500
After I get all the things we want,

307
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,860
I'll leave.

308
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,180
Where's Fatty?

309
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,140
I heard there is already a team

310
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,460
that has gone to Warehouse 11.

311
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,780
Fatty and others have gone there to

312
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,980
negotiate with them in advance.

313
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,260
Now these things are handled by Bai.

314
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,060
My job is staying in Wushanju

315
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,380
doing something simple and

316
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,980
confusing the spy.

317
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,060
Uncle Erjing,

318
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,620
let me tell you this.

319
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,540
Now Wushanju is sieged by

320
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,740
our people.

321
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,380
They're all lying in wait.

322
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,620
As long as the spy shows up here,

323
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,220
we will catch him.

324
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,540
You're good.

325
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,140
So you are cooking presenting a bold front to conceal a weak defense?

326
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,100
Awesome, right?

327
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,180
Our strategy is not bad, right?

328
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,100
Not bad at all.

329
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,300
I just came to see what you need on behalf of Mr. Erbai.

330
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,540
Since everything is going well, I gotta go.

331
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,300
OK, Let me see you out.

332
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,140
No, it's okay.

333
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,100
-I'll leave you alone. -Wait.

334
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,460
Uncle Erjing, wait a minute.

335
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,460
I made two dishes today.

336
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,580
I haven't got the time to see Uncle Erbai recently.

337
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,780
Can you take the food back to him?

338
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,820
Just say that I miss him so much.

339
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,580
Okay.

340
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,660
Sure.

341
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,140
-These two dishes are not burnt. -Bye.

342
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,700
He scared me to death.

343
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,260
Mr. Erbai.

344
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,940
Do you want to try some?

345
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,660
This is shredded pork with green pepper

346
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,340
your nephew's imposter specially made for you.

347
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,860
Wu Xie

348
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,220
has been on adventures out there in the world so many years.

349
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,780
Yet he actually thought that disguise could fool me.

350
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,380
It's ridiculous.

351
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,300
But it's good news to me.

352
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,220
Wu Xie asked Wang Meng to disguise to be him.

353
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,900
Since he wants to play the game this way,

354
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,740
I will

355
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,420
play along with him.

356
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,020
At an opportune time,

357
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,060
I will expose his identity in front of people in our cycle

358
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,860
saying that Wu Xie already died.

359
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,580
The one coming back from Thunder City

360
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,820
is an imposter.

361
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,140
The friends around him are all spies.

362
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,540
Everything that happened

363
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,900
is their conspiracy with their evil intent.

364
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,180
And then

365
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,340
I'll get rid of them all

366
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,220
as your representative.

367
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,060
In this way, I will become the benefactor of the Wu family.

368
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,140
All my problems

369
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,980
will be solved.

370
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,220
Mr. Erbai,

371
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,820
what do you think of my plan?

372
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,060
Come on.

373
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,180
Let's make a toast

374
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,380
for our upcoming show.

375
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,740
Can we really grill a person like this?

376
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,300
Can he stand it?

377
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,460
I'm healed!

378
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,180
I'm healed!

379
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,220
I'm healed!

380
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,660
Manager Tong.

381
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,220
I'm healed!

382
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,020
You are!

383
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,260
I'm healed.

384
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,340
Come on.

385
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,540
Get him his clothes.

386
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,140
I'm healed!

387
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,420
I'm healed!

388
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,540
That's amazing.

389
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,220
This is great.

390
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:48,580
Yes!

391
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,180
Yes!

392
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,780
Fatty, you are amazing.

393
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,980
You just saved his life.

394
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,820
Dude, you're a senior.

395
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,060
Act prudently.

396
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,180
Everyone, let me discuss it with the management.

397
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:58,980
I'll be right back.

398
00:30:59,180 --> 00:30:59,660
Thank you.

399
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,020
Thank you all.

400
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,340
Since Wu Sanxing entered Warehouse 11,

401
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,540
he volunteered to enter the section of unredeemable goods

402
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,780
because he wanted to get someone out.

403
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,780
Who was that person?

404
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,820
Why would that person who was rescued by him

405
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,980
want to enter the section of unredeemable goods in the first place?

406
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,900
There must be a big goal behind it.

407
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,460
Right?

408
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,460
The simplest theory is that

409
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,540
something in the section of unredeemable goods

410
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,740
is very tempting to some people outside.

411
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,100
As long as that thing is still in there,

412
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,140
someone will always want to kill us.

413
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,700
If

414
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,020
something in the section of unredeemable goods

415
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,660
caused everything that happened to us,

416
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,700
what do you think it is?

417
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,140
Bai, let me ask you this.

418
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,100
What do you think is the most bizarre urban legend

419
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,220
in Warehouse 11?

420
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,940
Isn't it Zhang Fo Ye's tomb?

421
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,260
No.

422
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,860
Among our older generation,

423
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,980
there is a legend that when they were building

424
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,180
Warehouse 11 back then,

425
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,100
one day the ground collapsed

426
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,980
and people found an underground cavity

427
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,380
under the ground.

428
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,660
Inside was an imperial temple of an ancient kingdom.

429
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,140
Uncle Ma.

430
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,140
What?

431
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,300
Don't talk nonsense.

432
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,740
There is a temple under this section of unredeemable goods?

433
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,380
I said it was a legend. I didn't say I saw it.

434
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,620
Uncle Ma, carry on.

435
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,740
I only heard people

436
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,260
telling legends about this ancient temple.

437
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,100
But no one had ever seen it.

438
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,740
So gradually, no one mentioned

439
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,620
this legend again.

440
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,340
What I heard was that

441
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,340
this imperial temple

442
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,620
belonged to

443
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,780
a kingdom at the heyday of bronze civilization.

444
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,940
What is its name again?

445
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,300
South…

446
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,300
Luoyun Kingdom of the South Sea. Yes.

447
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,580
Luoyun Kingdom of the South Sea.

448
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,500
I heard that

449
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,660
it was the altar of this kingdom.

450
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,780
Since we just assumed that

451
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,580
something in the section of unredeemable goods

452
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,300
is very tempting to some people outside,

453
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,300
it can only be the imperial temple of this ancient kingdom.

454
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,540
Because the legend also said that

455
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,780
there are treasures of South Sea King in the temple.

456
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,460
Is there any more specific information about this temple

457
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,340
mentioned in this legend?

458
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,460
No.

459
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,820
That's all I know.

460
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,780
From all the things Wu Xie told me,

461
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,060
I realized long ago that

462
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,980
the section of unredeemable goods, the South Sea King's tomb,

463
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,380
the Dumb Village

464
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
and the Tianlin Building

465
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,500
all share a very similar topography.

466
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:57,740
If this legend Uncle Ma just said

467
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,860
is actually true,

468
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,900
then the thing related to South Sea King

469
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,180
under the section of unredeemable goods

470
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,420
is that temple.

471
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,460
I always felt that there was still an important piece missing

472
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,220
in the whole puzzle.

473
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,540
But now I figure it out.

474
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,380
The person

475
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,860
who Wu Xie's Uncle Sanxing got out from here

476
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,180
got down to the section of unredeemable goods

477
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,860
not just for listening to thunder,

478
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,660
but for the treasures in South Sea Kingdom's imperial temple.

479
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,580
Well, I guess this person

480
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:30,010
did come down listening to thunder.

481
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,450
After he got down, he couldn't get out.

482
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,260
Someone forced Uncle Sanxing to get him out.

483
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,740
This South Sea Kingdom's imperial temple

484
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,340
must also be related to the thunder listening thing.

485
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,930
South Sea King had battles everywhere

486
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,180
with the help of that artifact.

487
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,060
So everywhere he went,

488
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,260
he would definitely build a place to listen to thunder

489
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,780
so that he could activate the artifact.

490
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,620
The imperial temple was also a place to listen to thunder.

491
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,450
So South Sea King had been in this area.

492
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,900
When we were in Thunder City,

493
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,660
we saw that Mr. Jiao

494
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,060
didn't find any treasure in it.

495
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,260
Besides,

496
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,900
we could tell from the photos Uncle Sanxing left for Wu Xie that

497
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,060
the only place we haven't been

498
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,300
is this South Sea Kingdom's imperial temple.

499
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,260
In this case,

500
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,100
we have to find this South Sea Kingdom's imperial temple.

501
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:22,980
Okay.

502
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,460
Wish you success.

503
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,380
Thank you, everyone.

504
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,340
Thank you very much.

505
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,500
Manager Tong.

506
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:36,940
Bai.

507
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,500
Special strategy is required in this special period of time.

508
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,220
I will need to ask you guys to

509
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,220
stay some more time in Warehouse 11.

510
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,620
Many of our staff haven't recovered yet.

511
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,540
So we still need your help.

512
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,260
We still can't go out?

513
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,340
What about the rule of Warehouse 11?

514
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,260
Fatty.

515
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,820
If you keep saying nonsense,

516
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,460
I…I will honor you as

517
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,420
Warehouse 11's distinguished guest.

518
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,180
You will be well entertained here.

519
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,740
Say no more.

520
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,100
They have rules and morality.

521
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,700
Okay.

522
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,700
Sorry, Manager Tong.

523
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,420
You just hurry up to investigate your staff.

524
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,340
I have to go down again.

525
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,940
I need to find Jiang Yuan.

526
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,500
I have so many questions for him.

527
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,940
If my guess is right,

528
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,980
what the spy wants is in the section of unredeemable goods.

529
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,380
I guess he will show up soon.

530
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,500
Jiang Yuan must know more than I do.

531
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,860
I'm going to find him.

532
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,380
Okay.

533
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:35,900
I am coming too.

534
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,700
Me, too.

535
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,780
Take me with you.

536
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,620
You can't leave me to "barbecue" here alone.

537
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,620
Others may not have to stay.

538
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,180
But you have to stay.

539
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,300
You need to detoxify us all.

540
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,620
Me? forget it.

541
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,300
Ok, it's settled then.

542
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,380
The three of us will go to find Jiang Yuan.

543
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,300
The rest will stay on the ground to help them.

544
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:56,940
Okay.

545
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,060
Then it's settled.

546
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,940
Ever since Xiangyang stepped into Wushanju carrying the case,

547
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,940
the spy's conspiracy targeting me,

548
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,500
or rather, our Wu family,

549
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,260
has achieved the perfervid period.

550
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,220
I asked many friends who study medicine.

551
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,820
They found that the symptoms caused by the bronze fragments

552
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,500
look like some kind of complicated

553
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,940
metal compound poisoning.

554
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,820
Lead mercury poisoning, for example.

555
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,860
It would make those ancient emperors who longed for immortality

556
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,060
feel like they were in a fairyland.

557
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,980
This toxin

558
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,180
also attacks human's central nervous system

559
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,060
to make people see illusions and hear imaginary sounds.

560
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,300
The suffering symptoms

561
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,420
may stay with the patients for decades,

562
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,900
or even a lifetime.

563
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,980
And there is a danger of complications at any time.

564
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,460
Friends around me were poisoned one after another.

565
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,860
He knew that I would try to help them.

566
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,380
He tried to

567
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,180
force me to go in Warehouse 11 with it.

568
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,420
I am not sure the reason

569
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,100
behind the explosion of the bronze coffin

570
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,500
and the suicide of Hong,

571
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,820
but I can be sure that

572
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,860
Jiang Yuan,

573
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,780
this pawn that has been hidden for a long time,

574
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,660
was activated when

575
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,100
we went down to the section of unredeemable goods.

576
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,780
Jiang Yuan killed so many people.

577
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,540
This game he's playing

578
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,780
is definitely not just to get rid of the Wu family.

579
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,140
He has a wish that he wants it to come true.

580
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,300
And this wish

581
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,220
is related to the thunder hearing.

582
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,140
It's also related to the section of unredeemable goods

583
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,780
and South Sea Kingdom's imperial temple underneath it.

584
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,820
This mystery

585
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,380
is getting clearer and clearer now.

586
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,500
Since that person lured me to the section of unredeemable goods,

587
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,460
very well then.

588
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,900
I'll wait for you here.

589
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,500
I'll be waiting for you at South Sea Kingdom's imperial temple.

590
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,820
No one is here. He is not here.

591
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,540
Everything is burned down.

592
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,540
Look.

593
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,020
Over here.

594
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,140
Time has activated again.

595
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,980
You shall be willing to risk any danger to do your duty.

596
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,380
With what happened to Wu Erbai,

597
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,260
the Wu family will never turn the table again.

598
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,900
The day our plan is completed

599
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,860
is the day you will see the sun again.

600
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,340
This should be

601
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,660
how Jiang Yuan and the spy outside contacted with each other.

602
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,020
These are from Thunder City.

603
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,580
Thunder City?

604
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,140
How did they get those thing in here?

605
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,740
The only way is smuggling them in from underwater.

606
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,340
Should be those bottles.

607
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,020
These things come from Thunder City,

608
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,220
which means at that time

609
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,940
there was another team in Thunder City.

610
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,700
There was.

611
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,700
At that time, there was another team in Thunder City.

612
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,500
They buried those explosives under the ground.

613
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,340
Me and Bai were almost caught by them.

614
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,020
Fortunately, Jiang Zisuan saved us.

615
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,380
I already knew who you really are.

616
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,340
Stop acting.

617
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,500
I already knew

618
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,580
that you already knew who I am.

619
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,740
I already knew that

620
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,780
you already knew

621
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,220
I already knew who you are.

622
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,060
Then good for you.

623
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,900
In fact, all the information we know

624
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,700
have made me feel uneasy.

625
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,180
Then I saw this information,

626
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,860
and I am more certain that I must

627
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,340
overlook some details.

628
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,660
But I can't think of

629
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,820
what exactly it is right now.

630
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,180
I have a bad feeling about this.
