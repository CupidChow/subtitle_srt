Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,400
Episode 20

4
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,220
We must get out of here immediately.

5
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,500
Jiang Zisuan?

6
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,100
Who are these people?

7
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,260
Who are they?

8
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,660
Not Mr. Jiao's people.

9
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,460
Not Mr. Jiao's people?

10
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,740
So another party has joined the treasure hunt.

11
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,460
They must be after Thunder City.

12
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,180
They'll be in danger!

13
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,660
You are right not to go.

14
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,060
If you go find Wu Xie now,

15
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,140
I'll find out his position by tracking you.

16
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,500
Naive, did you hear...

17
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,379
Don't move.

18
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,780
This pistol is quite old.

19
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,100
I can't guarantee

20
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,420
if it will discharge accidentally.

21
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,580
Speak.

22
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,020
Tell me

23
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,340
everything you know.

24
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,860
Then I'll let you go.

25
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,980
After we tell you,

26
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,940
we won't survive either.

27
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,020
Glasses!

28
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,260
Bastard!

29
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,660
Who is next?

30
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,700
Speak.

31
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,620
The Providence responded to us!

32
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,420
Naive!

33
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,460
Are you alright?

34
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,780
Come up and let's talk.

35
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,460
Naive!

36
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,060
How are you?

37
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,089
Where are Kylin and Glasses?

38
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,660
They went to fight the Wang family's people.

39
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,209
If it weren't for Kylin

40
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,209
who lost so much blood to save us,

41
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,940
he wouldn't have been cornered by these bastards.

42
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,460
You are shameless!

43
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,660
So many of you bully a sick man.

44
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,940
Let's do a face-off!

45
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,780
Untie me and let's fight!

46
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,500
Come get me!

47
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,300
Fatty!

48
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,500
Fatty!

49
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,980
Both of us are very resilient

50
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,820
so we have arrived at the destination.

51
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,340
Tell me.

52
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,660
What's down there?

53
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,540
South Sea King's treasures?

54
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,740
I didn't see anything all the way here.

55
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,780
The treasures must be under the water, right?

56
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,420
The things

57
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,860
I experienced down there

58
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,900
are beyond words.

59
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,620
If they're so easy to

60
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,380
express with words,

61
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,540
the ancient people would have written it down.

62
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,620
You are right.

63
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,540
So I have to experience it myself.

64
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,340
How to use this thing?

65
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,740
Tell me now!

66
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,380
My Uncle Sanxing edited and put all the messages in cypher

67
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,380
into the sounds of thunder.

68
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,340
Just find the corresponding tape

69
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,900
and play it in the sound transmission room

70
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,500
while knocking on the corresponding bronze pillars,

71
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,580
then you can activate the artifact.

72
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,700
What does this mean?

73
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,780
Fine me the corresponding tape!

74
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,180
I want fortune.

75
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,700
The fortune mentioned in the legend

76
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,780
may not be the same thing

77
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,700
like what you imagined.

78
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,420
What is this tape?

79
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,580
Fortune.

80
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,180
Everybody, move!

81
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,140
Let's go!

82
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:55,900
Yes, sir!

83
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,380
Yes, sir!

84
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,300
Go.

85
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,500
Sir, we're ready when you are.

86
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,540
Are you ready?

87
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,020
Yes!

88
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,260
Do it!

89
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,340
What are they doing?

90
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,820
They are setting up bombs.

91
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,700
Are they going to blow this place up?

92
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,300
This team is quiet and low-profile.

93
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,540
They came here well-prepared.

94
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,500
They want to kill everyone here!

95
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,180
No.

96
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,940
We have to find a way to stop them.

97
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,300
Exposing yourself now will only get you killed.

98
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,020
We must notify the people inside.

99
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,460
Only by getting help from inside can we can get out of here.

100
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,820
He is badly injured.

101
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,140
He will die if we leave him alone here.

102
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,420
Someone has to stay to stand guard for him.

103
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,380
Let me do it.

104
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,300
After all, the thing between Me and Wu Xie

105
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,860
is just a personal grudge.

106
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,940
If he falls into the hands of our common enemy now,

107
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,340
all of us will be killed.

108
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,460
My task is to go in there and send a message to Mr. Jiao.

109
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,500
But I don't know the route.

110
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,700
I remembered the map by heart.

111
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,740
So now only you can go in there to send the message.

112
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,260
This is the only way everyone can survive.

113
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,740
The clock is ticking.

114
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,300
Wait for me to come back.

115
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,740
A wise man has eyes in his head.

116
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,420
while the fool

117
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,380
walks in the darkness.

118
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,540
How did it go for you?

119
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,740
Are you happy with what you got?

120
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,660
Disappointed, huh?

121
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,540
No.

122
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,220
I heard it.

123
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,020
I really heard the thunder.

124
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,380
I'm sure that fortune is here.

125
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,820
Fortune is here!

126
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,980
You are still deceiving yourself.

127
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,900
You are crazy.

128
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,740
There's no fortune here at all.

129
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,580
I will kill you now!

130
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,820
There's nothing here.

131
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,740
Didn't you already know it

132
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,620
when you were in the Golden Water Coffin?

133
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,380
Is it really worth it

134
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,260
doing the things you've done just for fortune?

135
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,860
Yes.

136
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,060
This is what I want.

137
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,660
This is what I am after.

138
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,900
Do you have a problem with that?

139
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,020
Dajun?

140
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,780
Dajun?

141
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:16,940
Dajun!

142
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,340
Cover your ears.

143
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,580
Come back!

144
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,500
All of you, come back here!

145
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,340
Tian Youjin.

146
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,140
The legendary artifact is nothing but

147
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,380
a device.

148
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,220
The so-called function of reversing all regrets

149
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,540
is just a kind of placebo to your heart.

150
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,340
Those tapes,

151
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,700
the behavior of listening to thunder,

152
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,940
even the whole Thunder City

153
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,420
are nothingness.

154
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,780
You pursued it for your lifetime

155
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,180
but you get nothing.

156
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,580
Your illness is cured.

157
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,100
Can this place really reverse all regrets?

158
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,860
I want to see my sister.

159
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,420
Make my sister come back alive.

160
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,020
I beg you!

161
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,060
Please!

162
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,900
Hurry up.

163
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,020
Is everything okay?

164
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,180
Go!

165
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,060
I wanted to persuade you to move on.

166
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,860
But I know you won't listen.

167
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,300
It's up to you to decide

168
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,500
whether you want to get away from what's been haunting you.

169
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,420
Damn.

170
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,820
You are healed?

171
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,740
South Sea King didn't fool us then!

172
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,620
This trip is totally worth it.

173
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,740
I hit the mark by a fluke,

174
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,940
Maybe I get lucky.

175
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,420
Let's go and help Kylin.

176
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,740
Go.

177
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,860
These bastards escaped so fast.

178
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,300
They must be terrified of me.

179
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,100
Look, when I showed up,

180
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,860
these people were scared that

181
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,780
they pissed off!

182
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,820
Come on!

183
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,500
You Wang family are just some impostors.

184
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,620
Come on!

185
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,580
When I wanted to have some workout,

186
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,940
you just ran away?

187
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,540
So, you're cured.

188
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,420
I am.

189
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,300
We the Trio

190
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,180
can't go without any of its three angles.

191
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,220
I'm hungry.

192
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,220
I didn't want to kill you.

193
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,380
It wasn't me!

194
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,380
Mr. Jiao asked me to do it.

195
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,380
Don't blame it on me!

196
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,700
Ning...

197
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,020
Ning.

198
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,500
Don't go.

199
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,660
Ning.

200
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,580
I miss you so much.

201
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,820
When are you coming back?

202
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,460
Sis.

203
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,500
Come back.

204
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,540
I miss you so much.

205
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,620
Ning.

206
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,700
Ning.

207
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,740
Is that you?

208
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,660
It's me.

209
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,340
I am back.

210
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,060
Ning,

211
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,340
during these years you were gone,

212
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,020
I had a hard time.

213
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,580
I always kept it in mind that

214
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,980
I have to avenge you.

215
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,820
In order to fulfill this wish,

216
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,020
I was willing to do everything.

217
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,660
I killed a lot of people.

218
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,060
In the end, I became

219
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,500
a demon.

220
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,860
You won't blame me for it, right?

221
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,460
The last thing I want to see in you

222
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,060
is what you have become now.

223
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,300
You live humbly

224
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,820
for your petty hatred.

225
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,860
My brother in my mind is

226
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,140
an outgoing,

227
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,100
optimistic

228
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,860
and carefree big boy.

229
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,900
That's my brother.

230
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,660
Ning...

231
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,500
Listen.

232
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,620
It's the sound of the wind.

233
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,580
I see a kite flying in the sky.

234
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,980
I see the scene

235
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,860
when we flew a kite together

236
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,460
when we were kids.

237
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,380
The sun shines on your clothes.

238
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,700
So lovely.

239
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,460
The wing is so strong and

240
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,620
the kite flies so high.

241
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,700
Ning.

242
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,340
My...

243
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,300
My biggest wish is

244
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,620
to have

245
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,700
you stay by my side,

246
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,380
forever.

247
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,860
Your task has been completed.

248
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,740
None of them would expect that you are working for me.

249
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,380
When we were in the Dumb Village,

250
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,820
I recognized Mr. Jiao was Tian Youjin.

251
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,380
Tian Youjin,

252
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,500
Wu Erbai,

253
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,580
and Wu Xie.

254
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,740
I knew they would eventually lead me to Thunder City.

255
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,420
Tian Youjin has worked hard for his purpose for so many years.

256
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,700
But he was ensnared by your pretty face.

257
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,340
He wouldn't think that

258
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,460
you were a spy I placed beside him.

259
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,220
He and Wu Erbai are smart.

260
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,220
But they trust their own judgment too much.

261
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,700
So they deserve to be used by me.

262
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,300
You did very well.

263
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,460
But you fell in love with him.

264
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,300
No.

265
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,620
What's going on?

266
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,540
I left you marks along the way.

267
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,940
But I did not expect that

268
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,500
both Wu Xie and Jiang Zisuan followed to come here.

269
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,180
I didn't expect that Wu Xie's disease would be cured miraculously

270
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,020
after he got out from the Golden Water Coffin.

271
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,420
Then Jiang Zisuan and Jiao also followed.

272
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,060
But...

273
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,140
Can this place really

274
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,380
reverse all the regrets?

275
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,900
Do you have any regrets?

276
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,900
Wu Xie got lucky so

277
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,180
he got what he wanted with the power of the artifact.

278
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,260
I am going to take everything here away with me.

279
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,580
Take down the artifact.

280
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,740
What are you doing?

281
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,020
I knew it from the beginning that

282
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,780
there are no treasures in Thunder City.

283
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,660
South Sea King was cautious by nature.

284
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,660
He hid the artifact here

285
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,860
while he

286
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,660
hid all his treasures

287
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,420
at a place no one can think of.

288
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,620
Only I

289
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,220
know where that place is.

290
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,380
But if I want to get the treasures

291
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,380
I'll need this artifact

292
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,220
or I can't activate the mechanism.

293
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,220
That's why I came here.

294
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,060
Although I met twists and turns,

295
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,580
I got what I wanted in the end.

296
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,340
Now I am going to launch

297
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,180
my real plan.
