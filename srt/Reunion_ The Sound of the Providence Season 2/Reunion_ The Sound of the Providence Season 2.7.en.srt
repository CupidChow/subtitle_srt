Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,140
Episode 7

4
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,990
Don't cry.

5
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,510
I'm still alive and kicking.

6
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:23,590
Mr. Third Junior

7
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,629
You got such a serious illness.

8
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,379
Why are you hiding it from me?

9
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,190
I didn't hide it from you on purpose.

10
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,510
I didn't plan to tell everyone

11
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,270
from the very beginning

12
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,910
But have you ever thought about

13
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,230
everyone around you wants to know how you're doing,

14
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,150
especially the one who loves you.

15
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,270
You are still too young.

16
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,310
You can't tell the difference between love and worship.

17
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,430
I hope you can grow up and

18
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,670
don't act on impulse.

19
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,670
Right now Xue and his gang

20
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,830
are watching every move of our Wu family.

21
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,270
They've put surveillance on me.

22
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,510
If you don't believe it,

23
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,950
go outside to take a look now.

24
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:26,030
Xue's people are everywhere out there.

25
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,629
So right now anyone who gets close to me

26
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,750
will be in trouble.

27
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,300
I don't want you to get involved.

28
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,629
I'm not afraid of troubles.

29
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,900
Is there anything that I can be of help?

30
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,430
Just tell me.

31
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,390
Bai, thank you.

32
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,150
If I need help,

33
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,310
I will definitely go to you.

34
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,390
I'll come to see you later today.

35
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,430
Rest in bed.

36
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,550
Okay.

37
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,670
Fatty, Fatty!

38
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,110
Hurry up! I need to go to the bathroom.

39
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,110
You feel the call of nature suddenly?

40
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,030
Okay.

41
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,950
Sit on this and I'll push you there.

42
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,270
I need to pee so bad.

43
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,590
You should have let Bai take you to the bathroom.

44
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,630
Of course I couldn't tell her that!

45
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,709
Bai did ask me just now

46
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,380
that what she could do to help me.

47
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,430
I was too embarrassed to say that I needed to go to the bathroom.

48
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,950
Will we be like this when we are old?

49
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,230
When we're pushing eighties…

50
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,590
Can you hurry up? I can't hold back anymore!

51
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,350
I know, I know.

52
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,190
Hold it back!

53
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,110
You must hold it back.

54
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,230
Go, go!

55
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,870
Can you stop joggling it?

56
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,190
Speed or stability? Pick one.

57
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,230
Steady and fast. Hurry up!

58
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,950
Go, go, go!

59
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,150
Mute.

60
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,709
When will the tide ebb?

61
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,510
Should be today.

62
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,510
What time today?

63
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,190
Soon.

64
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,670
You said so every time.

65
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:19,950
Mute.

66
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,350
Mute. This is bad.

67
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,910
Don't speak.

68
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,270
Take a deep breath.

69
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,150
Are you alright?

70
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,030
I'm fine.

71
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,990
What is this place? There are holes everywhere.

72
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:03,270
Glasses.

73
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,700
Look around. Be alert.

74
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:21,790
Mute.

75
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,030
This hole is so strange.

76
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,030
There is nothing inside.

77
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,790
It scared me.

78
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,070
Have you found anything?

79
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,790
No.

80
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,710
How about you?

81
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,790
Me either.

82
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:18,750
Let's go.

83
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,150
Tony Qiang and I were caught by Mr. Jiao.

84
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,990
Bring the map to Thunder City here to save us.

85
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,709
The video has expired for several days.

86
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,550
Do you want to do it or not?

87
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,070
It's been a whole day.

88
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,110
Black Glasses didn't do anything.

89
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,470
He definitely doesn't like you.

90
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,950
There is nothing wrong with your video.

91
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,070
Why hasn't Black Glasses showed up?

92
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,430
You saw it yourself.

93
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,390
I'm not important to him at all.

94
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,990
Mr. Jiao.

95
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,430
I have done everything you asked me to do.

96
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,790
It's just that to Black Glasses,

97
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,390
the thing you want is more important than me.

98
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,430
Yes indeed.

99
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,870
Since he doesn't care about you at all,

100
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,420
why should I still keep you alive?

101
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,390
Right?

102
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,670
Mr. Jiao, I beg you.

103
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,830
Please let me go.

104
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,990
Let you go or not,

105
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,110
it's up to the thunder to decide.

106
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,030
Sorry.

107
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,910
Thunder wants you to die.

108
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,910
I love you.

109
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,040
I only have 30 hours left to solve Xue's problem.

110
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't know if Uncle Erbai's still alive.

111
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,750
And I don't know what's going on with Kylin either.

112
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,230
I have no money now.

113
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,390
Xue.

114
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,790
It all comes down to whether you'll take the bait or not.

115
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,790
Mr. Third Junior.

116
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,550
I've finished sorting out the goods.

117
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,030
But there are not many left actually.

118
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,670
Bai.

119
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,230
Make a signage for me

120
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,030
saying that

121
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,200
Hao's Antique Shop is going to have an auction.

122
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,080
Auction?

123
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,910
Yes.

124
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,310
But the few things left

125
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,270
are not very valuable.

126
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,070
I don't think the buyers will want them.

127
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,470
Of course we can't just rely on those antiques.

128
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,390
I'm going to take out my big gun.

129
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,560
It's something that Xue always wanted.

130
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,200
What is it?

131
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,150
Grave Robbery Notes?

132
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,480
You want to auction Grave Robbery Notes?

133
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,000
If you want to catch big fish,

134
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,670
you need to use good bait.

135
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,430
This time

136
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,470
I'm going to settle the accounts once and for all with Xue.

137
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,350
I'll let him know

138
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,310
how I earned my reputation in this cycle back then.

139
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,700
<i>Hao's Antique Shop</i>

140
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,260
<i>Wu Xie</i>

141
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,910
Mr. Third Junior, look.

142
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,630
What do you think?

143
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,670
You women's makeup stuff is like magic.

144
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,070
But can you make me look healthier?

145
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,830
Look healthier?

146
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:00,950
Sure.

147
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,500
<i>Hao's Antique Shop
Grave Robbery Notes' Auction Plan</i>

148
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,870
Mr. Third Junior.

149
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,430
Why do you want to

150
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,390
show Xue that you look healthier?

151
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,150
Those who are dying of illness

152
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,790
will have a short moment of looking better right before they die.

153
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,110
Don't jinx it.

154
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,510
I was just saying.

155
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,790
I just want to make

156
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,510
myself look better

157
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,870
so that Xue won't be sure what's going on with my body.

158
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,110
This is called confusing your opponent. Do you understand?

159
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,440
This is the first step in my plan to deal with Xue.

160
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,270
I have spent a lot of thought on it.

161
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,950
Looking healthier?

162
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,360
So that roughly equals to a flushing complexion.

163
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,910
No problem.

164
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,990
Leave it to me.

165
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,870
Alright, we're finished.

166
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,950
Mr. Third Junior.

167
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,310
What are you doing?

168
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,270
These people are

169
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,270
all seniors in the antique circle.

170
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,390
They will never let the Grave Robbery Notes

171
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,670
fall

172
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,510
into the hands of that old bastard Xue.

173
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,350
So

174
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,110
we are going to tell everyone that

175
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,350
we're going to auction the Grave Robbery Notes.

176
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,720
The bigger the fuss is, the better.

177
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,430
Be friends with the enemy of our enemy.

178
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,830
This is the second step.

179
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,590
Roger that.

180
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,550
What's so funny?

181
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,110
Bai Haotian!

182
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,430
It's from one of the five famous kilns.

183
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,270
Mr. Fifth.

184
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,960
You really have a keen eye for good stuff.

185
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,430
Let me tell you.

186
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,560
This is a plum vase with carved patterns produced in Ding Kiln.

187
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,630
Close it.

188
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,590
I won't say anything harsh.

189
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,190
But Ding Kiln porcelains

190
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,670
have a sleek outline and beautifully drawn patterns.

191
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,950
Look at that lousy patterns

192
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,480
drawn with trembling hands of an amateur.

193
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,320
Are you kidding me?

194
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,270
Mr. Fifth.

195
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,110
You can't just decide it's a fake

196
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,310
with nothing but your judgement.

197
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,710
If it weren't for my granddaughter's sick and I need money,

198
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,670
I wouldn't have wanted to sell it.

199
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,030
I need the money to save her life.

200
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,630
If you have a family emergency and

201
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,830
you need money to save your granddaughter,

202
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,630
no problem. Just leave it here.

203
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,760
I'll give you 20,000 yuan.

204
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,200
If you need more, just come to me again, okay?

205
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,470
But Mr. Fifth.

206
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,710
This is taking advantage of you.

207
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,990
I can't take your money.

208
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,670
If you don't accept it,

209
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,630
what are you going to do with your granddaughter's illness?

210
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,150
I was just kidding.

211
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,480
Just accept it.

212
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,950
Actually I also need to ask you for a favor.

213
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,270
I heard that

214
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,190
you granddaughter

215
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,990
has a photographic memory.

216
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,110
I want her to

217
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,520
do something for me with this ability.

218
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,390
No problem, Mr. Fifth.

219
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,750
As long as I can be of help,

220
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,120
I'll call her over right now.

221
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,830
Mr. Third Junior.

222
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,270
Do you think Xue will really come?

223
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,120
The news that we are going to auction Grave Robbery Notes

224
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,390
has already spread out.

225
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,310
I believe, from what I know of him,

226
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,160
he will grow suspicious

227
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:20,950
and so

228
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,560
he will

229
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,230
sound me out again before the auction.

230
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,790
This is the third step in my plan to deal with him.

231
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,310
We'll just wait for him to take the bait.

232
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,390
Mr. Third Junior.

233
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,110
Why do I feel that

234
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,630
you've become a different person after you woke up this time?

235
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,030
That's because you didn't know the real me before.

236
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,710
Hey, don't be so rude.

237
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,350
The grand auction.

238
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,510
You are not welcome here.

239
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,830
I'm here for this.

240
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,280
You even made tea for me?

241
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,790
You think this is your cup? You just drank from it.

242
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,590
Why can't you live your life more daintily?

243
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,800
Mr. Third Junior. You are still so dainty

244
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,340
when you have hit the rock bottom.

245
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,379
Fine.

246
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,629
The conflicts between us

247
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,310
are long-existing.

248
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,950
I don't have any resources to fight against you anymore.

249
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,710
Now you brought your people to have a good laugh of me?

250
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,470
What?

251
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,139
Kicking someone when he's already down?

252
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,860
I'm not here just to have a good laugh.

253
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,590
I heard that you are going to have an auction.

254
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,909
But you sold fake antiques earlier

255
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:29,030
and we still haven't settled the score yet.

256
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,310
If I allow a shop like this to hold an auction,

257
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,350
the rules of the industry will be broken.

258
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,030
As the industry leader,

259
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,510
I can't just sit back and watch it happen.

260
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,630
How about I smash this shop again

261
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,320
so you can forget about having an auction?

262
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,270
You can try.

263
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,310
If you dare touch anything in here,

264
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,510
you'll have to answer to me.

265
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,630
You even have a sidekick.

266
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,190
Okay.

267
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,630
Or you can do a package deal

268
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,630
of selling this shop together with

269
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,790
all your baubles to me.

270
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,670
Then it will quench my anger.

271
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,510
While you're still breathing,

272
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,000
hurry up to save the people you want to save.

273
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,910
Maybe you can see them one last time.

274
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,190
I mean you guys can see each other one last time.

275
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,590
Mr. Xue.

276
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,150
I thought you didn't think

277
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,350
my baubles have any value.

278
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,510
Don't play dumb with me.

279
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,480
What I want is Grave Robbery Notes.

280
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,470
Oh, you want Grave Robbery Notes?

281
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,510
If you want it,

282
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,600
you'll have to

283
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,630
wait for the auction.

284
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,350
Take the offer while I'm still talking to you nicely.

285
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,470
I'll still get it in a few days no matter what.

286
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,230
The problem is, it's not that I don't want to give it to you.

287
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,390
Everyone has known that

288
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,560
I'm going to auction off the Grave Robbery Notes.

289
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,200
If you suddenly break the rules by

290
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,630
taking it from me with force in advance,

291
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,070
can you still do business in this industry

292
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,800
when everyone finds out what you did?

293
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,910
I refuse to give it to you for your own good.

294
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,950
Or I can ask around for you to

295
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,830
see what everyone has to say.

296
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,600
Hello, Mr. Sun.

297
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,390
Nothing important.

298
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,440
I just want to tell you that

299
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,270
Mr. Xue is here in my shop

300
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,040
saying that he wants to take Grave Robbery Notes.

301
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,630
Could you do me a favor asking

302
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,750
Mr. Zou and Curator Liu to

303
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,750
see if they are okay with it?

304
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,910
Will they agree to let Mr. Xue

305
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,950
take Grave Robbery Notes ahead of the auction?

306
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,760
If you guys agree,

307
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,070
I will give it to him now.

308
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,270
No can do?

309
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,790
Just with your cheap antiques,

310
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,590
I'll take your last name

311
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,510
if they show up at your auction!

312
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,470
Let's go!

313
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,270
Hello, Fatty?

314
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,110
How are things going at your side?

315
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,990
Yes, I'm here keeping an eye on her.

316
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,390
Don't worry.

317
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,070
What's the current progress of the stuff now?

318
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,070
It's no use rushing her.

319
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,280
She's a master, right?

320
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,830
Masters all have attitude.

321
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,590
Just focus on your job.

322
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,630
How are things going on your side?

323
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,200
Xue has already been here.

324
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,430
The only thing we need is your stuff.

325
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,990
You have to make sure it's finished on time.

326
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:58,870
Got it. Rest assured.

327
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,750
Consider it done.

328
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,330
<i>Day 1</i>

329
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,710
Master.

330
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,830
Can you take some time out to

331
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,280
work on my rush order first?

332
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,390
It's still early yet.

333
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,390
It's not early.

334
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,110
It'll be too late if you don't get started now, master.

335
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,400
You have taken a deposit.

336
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,920
You can't do this to me.

337
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,390
I will refund you the money.

338
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,150
I won't take this job.

339
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,030
Don't, don't.

340
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:34,670
Come on!

341
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,600
That's not what I meant.

342
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,670
You have to take this job.

343
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,440
Who else can I go to if you don't take this job?

344
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,350
But we're really in a hurry.

345
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,190
I'm begging you, okay?

346
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,440
When will you need it?

347
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,750
The day after…I mean tomorrow.

348
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,710
I can't. I won't take this job.

349
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,510
But we desperately need it.

350
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,350
Someone's life depends on it.

351
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,950
No.

352
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,950
Say it.

353
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,230
What exactly do you want?

354
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,150
Unless

355
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,710
you give me your skin.

356
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,790
Nonsense!

357
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,630
You're such a nutjob.

358
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,360
what kind of sick joke is this?

359
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,350
It seems that you don't want it desperately enough.

360
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,470
I do!

361
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,590
I'll give you ten seconds.

362
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,350
Ten.

363
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:25,910
You…

364
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,910
-Stop it.
-Nine.

365
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,750
-Young lady!
 -Eight.

366
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,390
What kind of trick is this?

367
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,110
Five.

368
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,560
-Four.
-I've seen

369
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,950
-Three.
 -this world so much more than you have.

370
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,110
-Two.
-You think you can scare me away?

371
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,590
One.

372
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,950
Okay! I'll do it.

373
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,270
But which part of me do you want?

374
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,510
Are you making my skin into a bag

375
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,920
or a leather jacket?

376
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,030
Even if it's a bag, wallet or duffel bag?

377
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,550
Mr. Fifth.

378
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,480
Mr. Fifth.

379
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,080
Wu Xie!

380
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,280
It's me.

381
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,720
Them are here.

382
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,910
All of them want to go to Hao's Antique Shop's auction to get some stuff.

383
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,240
Hao's Antique Shop has valuable stuff.

384
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,600
Xue wants to go solo this time.

385
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,680
We can't let him have it.

386
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,360
What's going on?

387
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Mr. Xue.

388
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,200
Since everyone is present today,

389
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,760
I'll cut to the chase.

390
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,680
You know very well

391
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,000
whom Wu Xie made an appointment secretly to see his goods.

392
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,200
You can't keep all the good stuff to yourself.

393
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,530
What are you talking about?

394
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,080
Watch your mouth!

395
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,520
Curator Liu is a senior.

396
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,080
It's not easy for him to come visit you.

397
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,070
Can you two calm down?

398
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,480
That's exactly why we called both of you here to confront

399
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,960
since we don't trust each other.

400
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,400
I know what you mean and

401
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,040
we did always do as Mr. Xue said.

402
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,720
But didn't we all agree that

403
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,160
none of us would go to

404
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,560
Wu Xie's auction?

405
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,200
We'll wait until he can't insist anymore, then

406
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,560
we'll buy his shop and split the profits we earn.

407
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,360
How can you go without us

408
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,000
asking him for that Grave Robbery Notes?

409
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,680
Mr. Xue.

410
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,320
We always follow you

411
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,240
no matter you wanted to us to gang up to squeeze down the goods' price or get a bargain.

412
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,680
But this time

413
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,840
if you want to ditch us to get the good stuff to yourself,

414
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,240
we won't let you do it.

415
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,880
Mr. Zou, relax.

416
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,290
You know it better than anyone

417
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,960
if Wu Xie has valuable goods or not.

418
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,440
He's just bluffing.

419
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,120
So you mean

420
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,080
there is nothing precious at all in this auction?

421
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,800
What treasure can he possibly have now?

422
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,840
This is nothing but his plan to turn us against each other

423
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,920
like what we're doing now.

424
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,390
He'll profit from it

425
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
if we can't team up to squeeze down the price.

426
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,320
Then why did you go visit him?

427
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,880
I went to sound him out, obviously.

428
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,440
He told me he had a precious antique.

429
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,520
I went there and

430
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,360
I didn't even see anything.

431
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,920
If you believe me,

432
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,600
just listen to me this time.

433
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,030
None of us makes a bid in the auction.

434
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,600
He won't be able to sell at a high price so

435
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,880
all of his things will still be ours.

436
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,520
Why can't you just calm down and wait in patience?

437
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,320
That's well said.

438
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,920
But I'm just afraid that some people might point us to the wrong direction.

439
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,120
I'd say

440
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,480
let's listen to Mr. Xue

441
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,360
and not go to the auction this time.

442
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,480
That's right.

443
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,960
Since you guys are here now, don't be in a hurry to leave.

444
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,840
Spend the night in my place and

445
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,280
let me entertain everyone.

446
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,680
Sixth, get the guest rooms ready.

447
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,240
Mr. Third Junior.

448
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,680
I asked around.

449
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,960
They are at Xue's place.

450
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,760
I guess they're questioning him.

451
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,000
I will get some more tea.

452
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,800
Hello?

453
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,720
She's working on it. I'm keeping an eye on her.

454
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,130
But I dare not rush her.

455
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,390
Okay.

456
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,000
I'll take another look.

457
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Don't hang up.

458
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,040
Master.

459
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,360
Master.

460
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,480
Are you tired?

461
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,000
Master?

462
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,790
Let me get you some water.

463
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,640
How is it going?

464
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,240
Can you be quiet?

465
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,680
Or

466
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,760
I can sew up your fat lips.

467
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,360
Just wait.

468
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,920
I don't know when she can finish it.

469
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,280
Anyway, do as fast as possible.

470
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,200
Xue has taken the bait.

471
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,960
We must hurry and

472
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,600
get the thing ready before the auction.

473
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,670
Sure, no problem.

474
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,840
Okay. Gotta go.

475
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,560
This is bad, Mr. Third Junior.

476
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,400
Those who originally said they would come to the auction

477
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,440
are not coming.

478
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,090
Who are they?

479
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,320
Mr. Zou, Vice President Sun,

480
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,920
and Curator Liu all said they're not coming.

481
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,360
That's great.

482
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,800
That means Xue

483
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,640
have detained these people.

484
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
He is determined to get

485
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,080
our fake Grave Robbery Notes.

486
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,920
He will definitely buy it.

487
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,440
Really?

488
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,080
Bai.

489
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:44,930
Go away.

490
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,080
Don't try to bully us!

491
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,920
No one can bully us.

492
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,120
<i>Hao's Antique Shop</i>

493
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,220
<i>Hao's Antique Shop's Auction
Grave Robbery Notes</i>

494
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,400
This is the first time

495
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,080
I've seen an auction with so few bidders.

496
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,560
You see, only I've come.

497
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,520
So Mr. Xue, you want to

498
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,200
get all my goods at a rock-bottom price?

499
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,360
Do you think I'm interested in

500
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,720
the goods you put on the list?

501
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,320
It doesn't matter if you are interested or not,

502
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,960
I won't sell

503
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,720
the Grave Robbery Notes to you.

504
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,120
I don't want it either.

505
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,320
Wu Xie.

506
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,200
I'm here

507
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,880
to do business with you this time with sincerity.

508
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,840
Let me take a look at your box.

509
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,080
There is information of so many ancient graves there. I'll just pick one

510
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,920
and the money is all yours.

511
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,360
I wouldn't have hit rock bottom of my life

512
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,720
if you were a man of his word.

513
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,600
Wu Xie.

514
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,160
Listen carefully.

515
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,880
I admit I was a bit intimidated by you earlier.

516
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,990
But now you are nothing in my eyes.

517
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,480
This offer I gave you

518
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,270
was well thought out.

519
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,920
I know you can't refuse it.

520
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,840
What if I do refuse it?

521
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,800
That's why your Uncle Erbai looked down on you.

522
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,680
Don't be childish.

523
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,600
What you need now is money,

524
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,910
not your meaningless self-esteem.

525
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,040
My money in name

526
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,480
is spent to buy your auction goods,

527
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,640
while actually what you give me is just the grave's location.

528
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,640
It depends on me whether I can get the antiques out.

529
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,440
This is an opportunity for both of us.

530
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,360
Do you know how much my information is worth?

531
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,400
It's enough

532
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,960
to buy your whole shop.

533
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,400
That little suitcase of cash is nothing.

534
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,270
Mr. Xue, you're trying to have a free ride.

535
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,280
Okay, then I want to see

536
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,320
who dare come to your auction.

537
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,720
OK, suit yourself.

538
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,320
Bai.

539
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,200
Get ready to greet our bidders.

540
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,360
He didn't take the bait.

541
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,960
Don't worry, he will definitely take the bait.

542
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Is Mr. Xue here?

543
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,680
No.

544
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,120
Why do you want to see him?

545
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,240
Where is he now?

546
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,360
Who are you?

547
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,720
When he comes back,

548
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,880
tell him to come to this place to find me.

549
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,710
I have all the money ready.

550
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,320
Huo Daofu?

551
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,240
Who the hell is he?

552
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,440
Why did he act like he's king of the world?

553
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,720
I wanted to smash him when I saw him like this.

554
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,440
If you are able to smash him,

555
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,640
you wouldn't need to kiss Xue's ass.

556
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,440
Do you know the Huo family?

557
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,800
Yes.

558
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,000
Huo Daofu is the most outstanding one

559
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,920
among the younger generation of the Huo family.

560
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
I never heard there's any business dealings

561
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,480
between Xue and him.

562
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,000
What was the money he prepared for?

563
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,640
Unless…

564
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,560
Unless

565
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,200
Xue got something precious

566
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,880
from Wu Xie with rock-bottom price behind our back.

567
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,040
I knew we can't trust that old fox.

568
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,120
I have to go and see what he's up to.

569
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,200
Don't go!

570
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,040
Curator Liu.

571
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,590
Will Mr. Xue be able to handle it?

572
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,080
Let's go help him.

573
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
He can't handle it?

574
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,080
Hao's Antique Shop's grand auction

575
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,000
starts now.

576
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,310
Let's bid the first lot.

577
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Blue and white porcelain jar with ice-crack pattern.

578
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,040
What's wrong with you?

579
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,280
Only the two of us are here.

580
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,800
What's the point of the auction?

581
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,170
Starting at 15 thousand yuan.

582
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,960
Any bid?

583
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,430
Go outside to

584
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,070
see if our people are here.

585
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,810
Starting at 15 thousand yuan.

586
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,310
Any bid?

587
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,520
I'm going to ask one last time.

588
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,600
Blue and white porcelain jar with ice-crack pattern.

589
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,440
Starting at 15 thousand yuan.

590
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,840
Any bid?

591
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,640
Pass.

592
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,480
Next item.

593
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,400
Late Qing dynasty round vase.

594
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,280
What took you so long?

595
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,710
I know.

596
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,520
Where's it?

597
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,320
There you go.

598
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,680
What do you think?

599
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,480
How about it?

600
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,400
Nice. Very convincing.

601
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,680
You can think about how to thank me.

602
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,800
The content inside is also well done.

603
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,610
I know.

604
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,120
This can easily pass as a real one.

605
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,480
OK, take your time to read it.

606
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,560
I have to go for some errand now.

607
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,120
Come back here!

608
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,040
What is it?

609
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:35,880
What's wrong with you?

610
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,330
Come on!

611
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,190
Why did you only ask her to do half of it?

612
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,040
The second half is nothing but blank pages.

613
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
What should I do with it?

614
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,480
Hear me out.

615
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,720
Let me tell you, there was really no time to finish the whole copy.

616
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,800
Let me tell you, that chick

617
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,760
is a weirdo!

618
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,080
But the problem is, she is the only one who can do such a good job.

619
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,280
But it's only half done!

620
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:49,880
Hey!

621
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,520
If it were someone else, he couldn't even bring anything back.

622
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,520
I'm the only one who can pull it off!

623
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,800
Just put it down.

624
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,950
The ink is not fully dried yet,

625
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,560
you know.

626
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,480
She said that

627
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,910
it would take another three or four hours to dry.

628
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,920
You have to use your wisdom to improvise.

629
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,040
If you show it to them now, your secret will be revealed.

630
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,560
Right?

631
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,840
Fine.

632
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,680
Bro, wish you all the best of luck.

633
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,840
I have to do some of my own business.

634
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,840
You have your own business?

635
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,480
Everyone has his own business!

636
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,240
It's Piaopiao.

637
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,920
Piaopiao didn't contact me recently.

638
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,400
She's probably blaming me for putting my friend over my girlfriend.

639
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,080
Of course I need to go see her.

640
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,190
Off you go. Surely you must go.

641
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,560
Just think about how you're going to repay my favor.

642
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,080
Thank you.

643
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,840
I'll pass on your offer of water.

644
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,320
Thank you.

645
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:23,750
Okay?

646
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,190
Alright.

647
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,199
-You're on your own now.
-Bye!

648
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,040
I wish you success.

649
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,710
Wish me success…

650
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,880
I want to kick your ass!

651
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,570
Mr. Xue will let you guys in in a while where he'll

652
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,330
show her something.

653
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,520
She needs to read and memorize it by heart.

654
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,090
Write everything down after that.

655
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,210
After the job's done,

656
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:55,900
Mr. Xue will reward you generously.

657
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,340
Okay.

658
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,090
Young lady, memorize everything you see with your whole heart.

659
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,690
Fifteen thousand yuan.

660
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,490
Any bid?

661
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,420
Late Qing dynasty round vase.

662
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,180
Starting at 15 thousand.

663
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,060
People are in position.

664
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,890
As soon as Wu Xie takes out Grave Robbery's Notes,

665
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,340
I'll let them in.

666
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,650
Wu Xie is buying time.

667
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,290
Call Wu Xie out.

668
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,220
Did you hear me?

669
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,530
Late Qing dynasty round vase.

670
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,650
Did you hear me?

671
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,210
Starting at 15 thousand yuan.

672
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,220
If you keep stalling for time, I'll have to take action.

673
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,930
Give it back! How can you snatch our goods?

674
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,420
You!

675
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,810
What are you guys doing here?

676
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,130
We can't come?

677
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,180
Just the right timing.

678
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,970
I thought you guys wouldn't come.

679
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,740
In my hand is the

680
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,930
Grave Robbery Notes.

681
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,970
What you guys need to do now

682
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,770
is asking your people to send cash here.

683
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,210
No cash,

684
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,570
no bidding.

685
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,570
Look at Mr. Xue.

686
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,450
He brought with cash early in the morning.

687
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,210
You see?

688
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,970
I knew there are valuable goods here.

689
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,890
You are very greedy, Wu Xie.

690
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,060
I learned from Mr. Xue.

691
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,890
Okay. I announce now

692
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,450
the auction officially begins.

693
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,260
Wait.

694
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:42,930
Everybody.

695
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,100
We have agreed beforehand that

696
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,060
I'll take care of this matter.

697
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,700
Now you have broken the rules.

698
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,570
If Mr. Erbai knows this,

699
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,490
you won't be able to do business in this circle.

700
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,260
But no one knows whether Mr. Erbai will ever come back.

701
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,370
Mr. Zou, what do you mean?

702
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,780
You don't want him to come back?

703
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,370
That is not what I mean.

704
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,850
No matter if he can come back or not,

705
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,020
I want this thing but

706
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,850
everyone will have a share of the profit.

707
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:08,780
I'll take 50% and

708
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,370
the rest of you can split the rest 50%.

709
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,420
I have always wanted this thing.

710
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,260
You know what I'm capable of doing.

711
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,530
Xue.

712
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,690
We are all in business.

713
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,740
What can you possibly do to us?

714
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,410
Does it make sense

715
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,900
to bluff to us?

716
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,170
Xue.

717
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,970
Everyone knows

718
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,410
how much the notes is worth.

719
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,260
Wu Xie is now auctioning it which means

720
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,610
he wants to sell it for real.

721
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,610
Let's just take its course to bid for it.

722
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,090
Whoever has the most money wins.

723
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,700
With the notes,

724
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,210
that person can easily make the money back?

725
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:46,850
I don't understand

726
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,490
what business you are trying to do here.

727
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,610
Alright. Wu Xie.

728
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,250
Mr. Third Junior.

729
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,690
Don't listen to Xue.

730
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,300
Just start the auction of it.

731
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,940
Okay.

732
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,330
So you've completely changed you attitude.

733
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,610
So be it.

734
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,170
Let's all change our attitude then.

735
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,410
That's not what you said earlier.

736
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,530
So when we talked over tea,

737
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,930
you just pretended like you agreed with me?

738
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,220
Okay.

739
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,570
You haven't forgotten what happened to that girl in that hair salon, right?

740
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,970
Do you want to end up like her?

741
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,900
Xue, what do you want to do to us?

742
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,730
What are you doing?

743
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:19,770
Come on!

744
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:20,770
Go ahead.

745
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,770
I'd like to see who dares step up.

746
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,210
Take a seat.

747
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,210
What should we do?

748
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,180
This trick doesn't seem to work.

749
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,330
Wu Xie.

750
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,260
No one is going to bid.

751
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,380
You can inspect the goods now.

752
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,090
Mr. Xue.

753
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,370
This

754
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:46,210
is definitely the authentic Grave Robbery Notes.

755
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,530
But you can only read half of it.

756
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,930
Are you going to choose the ancient graves written in the first half

757
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,500
or the second half?

758
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,890
You need to make a choice.

759
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,460
A piece of advice.

760
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,330
I advise you to read the first half.

761
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,090
Because all the important graves

762
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,580
are in the first half.

763
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,570
Stop joking.

764
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,250
Your grandfather wrote the notes since he was a young man.

765
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,820
What important ancient graves could he find when he was young?

766
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,250
The big fish is obviously in the second half, right?

767
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,890
I'll choose the second half.

768
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,620
Have you read the notes before?

769
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,010
No.

770
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,090
Bai.

771
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,530
Wrap the first half for him.

772
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:00,780
Okay.
