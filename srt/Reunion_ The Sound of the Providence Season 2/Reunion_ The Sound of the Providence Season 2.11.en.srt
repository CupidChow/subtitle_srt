Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,320
Episode 11

4
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,670
Jiang Zisuan.

5
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,460
You're still too young to beat me.

6
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,470
Are you okay, Fatty?

7
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,630
I even got my clothes dirty because of you.

8
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,190
Are you guys all okay?

9
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,590
Look at this disgusting face

10
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,790
Are you sure you want to personally disguise as him?

11
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,510
Do you want to do it?

12
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,190
But you can't even fit in his clothes.

13
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,910
The only thing that might give me away is my body.

14
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,829
No. Your face doesn't look like him, either.

15
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,990
But I can beat you with my acting skills! Do you believe it?

16
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,630
I do. I shall not dare doubt you.

17
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,590
You

18
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,470
need to figure out how to play him.

19
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,430
This guy is very sullen.

20
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,710
You need to figure out how to make convincing look in your eyes.

21
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,070
You two, take off his clothes.

22
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,670
What do you think?

23
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,070
Do I look like him?

24
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,870
I want to kick your ass now.

25
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,910
I can pass as him, right?

26
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,630
I have to go to Jiang Zisuan's room

27
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,710
to see if the entrance is really there.

28
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,390
I've come in.

29
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,550
How is the situation?

30
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,910
It won't be so easy to find.

31
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,230
Okay, be patient.

32
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,590
Take your time.

33
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,110
Kun and Gen shall be put in the center with the element of Earth.

34
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,630
Qian and Dui shall be paired with the element of Metal while Zhen and Xun with Wood.

35
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:34,700
I didn't expect this room

36
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,380
was built according to Feng Shui theories.

37
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,750
How's it going?

38
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,190
I found it.

39
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,430
There's a panel inside the wall which is sealed by welded rusty iron.

40
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,310
There is a vertical scratch on it.

41
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,870
It was cut open by a chainsaw once.

42
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,230
Can you open it?

43
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,590
It was welded from the inside.

44
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,070
But I can try to force it open.

45
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,510
I think we should try this risk.

46
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,310
Fatty.

47
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,910
I need Hong to

48
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,510
send me some sulfuric acid now.

49
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,110
You want Hong to send you sulfuric acid?

50
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,110
Where can we find that right now?

51
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,350
There's an old-model scooter at the door.

52
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,980
It uses a lead battery which is full of sulfuric acid.

53
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,670
Wait.

54
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,820
Fatty.

55
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,270
My poison is going to kick in soon.

56
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,990
Hang in there.

57
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,990
Come on.

58
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,230
So soon?

59
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,510
Jiang Zisuan.

60
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,510
Open the door, Jiang Zisuan!

61
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,790
Jiang Zisuan!

62
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,310
What?

63
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,630
I am not welcome?

64
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,150
You're so passionate.

65
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,350
Shall we have some drink

66
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,070
to liven things up?

67
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,390
Why didn't you turn me down today?

68
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,070
That's a good start.

69
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,230
What is this?

70
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,270
What's wrong?

71
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,510
You can't wait to have me, right?

72
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,430
Why? You're dumbfounded by me?

73
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,070
This floor is still under examination.

74
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,630
Mr. Jiao said that no one is allowed to go in there.

75
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,030
Fine.

76
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,550
Pick up, pick up!

77
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,710
We can't do this again.

78
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,910
What happened?

79
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,030
Are you scared?

80
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,950
Mr. Jiao is not a kind person.

81
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,060
If he knows about our affairs,

82
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,990
neither you nor I will live.

83
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,950
Besides,

84
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,070
I want to kill Wu Xie.

85
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,870
I don't want to cause any other troubles before that.

86
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,420
It's always Wu Xie.

87
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,520
Let's go back to the

88
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,310
previous employer-employee relationship.

89
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,990
It's good for both of us.

90
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,470
Jiang Zisuan

91
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,230
You…

92
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,510
You…

93
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,790
You're just fooling around with me.

94
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,190
You should leave.

95
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,830
You finally answered your phone!

96
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,310
You got the sulfuric acid, right?

97
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,470
Okay.

98
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,030
I'll wait for you at the stairs.

99
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,230
Come on.

100
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,630
Let me tell you,

101
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,030
this is even more dramatic than those salacious suspenseful stories.

102
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,830
That woman is crazy and out of control.

103
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,190
You have to watch out.

104
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,710
Everyone has their sad story.

105
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,740
Love brings all kinds of evil.

106
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,590
Fatty.

107
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,790
I'm going down to the secret tunnel.

108
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,990
Keep an eye on the situation outside.

109
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,710
Don't try to do anything!

110
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,790
If you move,

111
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,030
I'll electrocute you.

112
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,230
And don't say we're abusing you.

113
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,070
You have food and water here.

114
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,750
Wu Xie asked you to do this?

115
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,750
What does he want?

116
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,390
Actually I don't need you to tell me.

117
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,750
He's not here and

118
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,390
he asked you to watch me so that

119
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,990
I can't leave this room.

120
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,830
He wanted me to leave the place

121
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,750
where I would stay for a long time.

122
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,790
If I am right, he is

123
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,350
in my room now, right?

124
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,510
You are very simple.

125
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,070
Don't know how to maintain a poker face.

126
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,110
Then you will get yourself in danger by Wu Xie's side.

127
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,870
You have to watch out for yourself.

128
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,430
Wu Xie doesn't like girls who don't pay attention to their looks.

129
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,270
You really like him.

130
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,590
There's always someone who likes him.

131
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,500
Wu Xie never lacks admirers.

132
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,310
Is it wrong to like someone?

133
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,190
Don't you have someone you like too?

134
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,590
But liking someone can be fatal sometimes.

135
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,630
My sister

136
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,750
died from her love for Wu Xie.

137
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,430
Manager Bai.

138
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,630
How about I guard him for you?

139
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,030
It's okay.

140
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:37,390
How long have you been in love with him?

141
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,579
Let me tell you a story.

142
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,060
It's about my sister and Wu Xie.

143
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,750
They met during an expedition.

144
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,990
At that time they belonged to different sides.

145
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,590
But as you know,

146
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,230
there is no absolute right or wrong in the world of adults.

147
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,150
Soon the two enemies became friends.

148
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,430
They teamed up for tasks

149
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,910
and explored the unknown secrets together.

150
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,990
She finally fell in love with Wu Xie.

151
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,590
Give me your hand.

152
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,270
My sister was a passionate woman, to both her love and her enemy.

153
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,700
That was the first time she had fallen in love with a man.

154
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,030
She sacrificed everything for him.

155
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,830
She chose to look the other way for him.

156
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,990
But the man left her there and

157
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,900
left her to die alone.

158
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,510
The last time I saw my sister,

159
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,190
she said that she was going to

160
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,830
a place called Snake Marsh.

161
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,070
She said she wanted to help Wu Xie find someone.

162
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,390
I know Wu Xie had been looking for that person.

163
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,430
And every time

164
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,230
many people died because of his mission.

165
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,750
I tried to persuade her.

166
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,190
I asked her not to go.

167
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,310
But she didn't listen and

168
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,300
she still went with him.

169
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,990
And she never came back again.

170
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,270
Ning.

171
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,190
I don't want you to go.

172
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,870
You will die if you go, you know?

173
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,630
You always do as Wu Xie asks you to.

174
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,110
But you never listen to what I say.

175
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,710
Say no more.

176
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,590
I will go no matter what you're going to say today.

177
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,790
Ning!

178
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,780
When you are out there alone,

179
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,670
take good care of yourself.

180
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,630
She died.

181
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,510
Between my sister

182
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,990
and that person he was looking for,

183
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,430
Wu Xie didn't choose my sister.

184
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,830
My sister finally

185
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,230
died tragically in Snake Marsh.

186
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,030
He is not that kind of person.

187
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,420
Your sister fell in love with him because he is gentle to others

188
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,950
and he is never such a selfish person.

189
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,510
Do you know men?

190
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,910
You don't even understand human nature.

191
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:40,910
Let me tell you,

192
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,670
there are two kinds of good people in this world.

193
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,390
The first kind is those really good people.

194
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,540
They are really innocent and nice.

195
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,910
And for the second kind,

196
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,030
kindness is just a weapon for him.

197
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,020
This kind of person won't treat you badly

198
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,390
when you are still useful to him.

199
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,070
He will manipulate you

200
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,670
so that you'll die for him willingly.

201
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,750
Your Wu Xie

202
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,350
is the second type.

203
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,390
That's bullshit!

204
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,430
He doesn't need to manipulate me.

205
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,390
I have been most willing to do what I did!

206
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,430
Congratulations, then.

207
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,620
You have been manipulated by him.

208
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,430
Don't be surprised.

209
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,750
You will end up just

210
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,470
like my sister in the end.

211
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,550
Wu Xie

212
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,750
who you admire and worship

213
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,750
is a person who will achieve his own purpose

214
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,070
even if he has to betray the whole world.

215
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,350
He is not such a person!

216
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,710
He has been helping me all along.

217
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,110
He came here to save people.

218
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,910
This is why he's a master of manipulation.

219
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,030
He made everyone thank him

220
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,950
as if he was the savior.

221
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,670
But what you guys don't know is that

222
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,710
he was the one who caused you

223
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,270
to get into all the troubles in the first place.

224
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,950
Kylin left a mark of danger at the entrance.

225
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,550
There are traps ahead

226
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,110
after I cross this circle.

227
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,190
We can't get in there rashly.

228
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,270
No one is on guard.

229
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,400
<i>Remain silent, ye who enter here</i>

230
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,760
<i>All shall be killed with the presence of sound</i>

231
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,950
What's going on?

232
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,070
Don't try to play any tricks.

233
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,030
I have a serious craving for smoking.

234
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,190
Young lady, can you do me a favor to

235
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,580
hand me a cigarette?

236
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,550
Just uncuff one of my hands.

237
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,390
No.

238
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,500
It's more than enough for you to kill me

239
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,350
with one uncuffed hand.

240
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,110
Forget it then.

241
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,030
Just smoke like this.

242
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,590
It seems that you have found the entrance.

243
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,550
Don't move. Don't move!

244
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,950
Don't be afraid.

245
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,550
Liking someone doesn't mean I am weak!

246
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:23,820
Alright. Okay.

247
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,150
Calm down.

248
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,030
Calm down.

249
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,230
Calm down.

250
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,510
I see great potential in you.

251
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,430
That's what happened.

252
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,150
I wanted to be with him

253
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,470
but he is not interested in me.

254
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,740
So I don't want to make him happy.

255
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,430
I'd rather to be killed with him.

256
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,430
Is that true?

257
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,470
Jiao, do it now.

258
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,950
Kill him and me.

259
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,190
You just go to Thunder City.

260
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,750
You

261
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,510
want him to die, right?

262
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,790
Yes.

263
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,790
You want to die with him.

264
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,190
A couple died for love.

265
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,750
Do you really like him?

266
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,630
Do you know why I wanted to make you my mistress?

267
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,630
Was it just because of your body?

268
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,820
The most interesting thing about you is that

269
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,980
although you are willing to sell your body and soul,

270
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,350
you still have some true feelings inside you.

271
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,180
That's what I paid you for.

272
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,190
So I won't kill him.

273
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,950
And I will grant all your wishes.

274
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,100
Is there anything that you want to say?

275
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,990
I'll give you one last chance to defend yourself.

276
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,990
Not talking?

277
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,540
Acknowledge it with silence?

278
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,470
Okay, then.

279
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,940
Chop his fingers off.

280
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,510
Okay.

281
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,270
I'm happy to do that.

282
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,110
Don't worry.

283
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,260
I will do it nice and quick.

284
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,180
Sir!

285
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:47,630
Look!

286
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,220
He is not Jiang Zisuan.

287
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,140
It is you.

288
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:22,950
What are you doing?

289
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,270
I have to go.

290
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,390
Where are you going?

291
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,660
You're getting more and more fierce.

292
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,420
We can't just wait here doing nothing.

293
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,710
Go ahead then.

294
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,790
Just storm in there.

295
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,700
You'll only get yourself and him killed.

296
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,220
Mr. Fatty.

297
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,710
Let's trade him to get Wu Xie back.

298
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,620
Use your brain!

299
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,230
This nobody can't be compared with Wu Xie in value.

300
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,660
Call the police then.

301
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,230
Why did I forget our honorable police officers?

302
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,700
Why is there no signal?

303
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,710
The signal has been unstable since just now.

304
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,870
You won't get through.

305
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,260
Mr. Jiao ordered yesterday

306
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,580
to disconnect phone signals

307
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,830
when ordinary guests were almost gone.

308
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,030
And there is only one cell phone base station nearby.

309
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,190
Someone should have cut off the power just now.

310
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,110
It wasn't you, right?

311
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,540
How could it be me? I've been here all the time!

312
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,190
Be quiet.

313
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,390
If you guys want to call someone,

314
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,700
you can only use a satellite phone.

315
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,310
Why are you here?

316
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:27,210
I…

317
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,310
I came to travel.

318
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,179
Do you think I am silly?

319
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:32,949
Don't.

320
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,420
Mr. Jiao, don't get me wrong.

321
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,860
I really came here to travel.

322
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,219
Besides,

323
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,909
this is not your territory.

324
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,590
I'd suggest you abide by the law.

325
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,350
When did you come here?

326
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,780
I just arrived yesterday.

327
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,139
And I immediately bumped into you today.

328
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,909
The two of us are destined to meet.

329
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,590
Let's have a drink together in a while.

330
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,429
What do you think?

331
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,070
You played the game really wild.

332
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:09,389
Where's Jiang Zisuan?

333
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,940
When was

334
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,190
the last time any of you saw Jiang Zisuan?

335
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,950
Last night, I think.

336
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,510
Find him, now!

337
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,030
Yes, sir.

338
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,910
What were you doing

339
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,620
sneaking into his room

340
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,500
pretending to be Jiang Zisuan?

341
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,390
The entrance is in Jiang Zisuan's room!

342
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,140
Come on!

343
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,580
Hurry up!

344
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:05,510
Mr. Jiao.

345
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,220
The people you got in Dumb Village before

346
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,270
were all mercenaries.

347
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,740
Why are the people working for you this time

348
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,860
are nothing but rubbish?

349
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,900
Is Wu Erbai

350
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,860
under the ground now?

351
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,030
I have no idea.

352
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,630
Did you find Jiang Zisuan?

353
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,470
Not yet.

354
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,550
Do a nose count.

355
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,110
Everyone in this building now is our people.

356
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,710
They must be hiding in one of our guys' rooms.

357
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:34,660
Yes, sir.

358
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,630
Let's talk.

359
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,470
Sure.

360
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,230
Let's talk.

361
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,950
Wu Erbai,

362
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,910
I know you are under the ground.

363
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,900
I know you won't be trapped in there.

364
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,590
Your nephew

365
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,990
is in my hands.

366
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,150
Let's talk about terms.

367
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,910
I'm going to count to three.

368
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,190
If you don't answer by then,

369
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,100
I'll killed him.

370
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,550
Mr. Jiao.

371
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,510
Stop shouting, will you?

372
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,460
Uncle Erbai is not stupid.

373
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,420
He knows I'm dying.

374
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,470
Will he still make a deal with you with me as the hostage?

375
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,430
You are still too young and too insensitive.

376
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,420
Wu Erbai is getting older.

377
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,070
You can't tell if he

378
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,190
can be as cruel as you young people.

379
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,140
Uncle Erbai.

380
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,020
Sorry that

381
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,510
I caused troubles to you.

382
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,060
I can't live long anyway.

383
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,550
Just concentrate on your own business.

384
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,430
I have observed

385
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,830
his people.

386
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,380
All are useless.

387
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,180
You punk!

388
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,990
They are not capable of passing the mechanism traps in the tunnel.

389
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,270
So don't worry.

390
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,430
Then I'm going to kill you.

391
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,190
What happened?

392
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,070
Sir.

393
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,390
Sir!

394
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,900
Go.

395
00:39:59,270 --> 00:39:59,950
Go!

396
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:28,820
Go get them!

397
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,820
It's a surprise attack!

398
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,510
Keep up!

399
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,110
Keep up.

400
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,980
Dude, sorry.

401
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,860
This time we made a lot of noises.

402
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,950
I guess we'll have to disturb your sleep.

403
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:06,950
Whose side will you take?

404
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:07,830
I…

405
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,630
I am in a dilemma now.

406
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,830
Give me some time to think.

407
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,940
Take your time to think.

408
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,750
We met again.

409
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,830
Your Wu family is still so insidious and cunning.

410
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,060
You got trapped, you got out,

411
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,110
but you didn't leave.

412
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,070
That means this place

413
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,980
has something to do with Thunder City.

414
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,590
You really won't give up.

415
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,820
Let's negotiate.

416
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,270
Sure.

417
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,500
The tide has not ebbed.

418
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,310
Your people can't make it through.

419
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,020
Why should I negotiate with you?

420
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,990
Your Wu family people are all evil.

421
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,550
I'm trying to persuade you for your own good.

422
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,100
Besides,

423
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,590
I have been observing

424
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,430
your gang for a long time.

425
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,950
You can't win this battle.

426
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,510
Erjing.

427
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,020
What if I still have a trick up my sleeve?
