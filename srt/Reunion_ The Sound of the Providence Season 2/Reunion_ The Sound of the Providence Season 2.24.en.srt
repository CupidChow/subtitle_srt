Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,650
Episode 24

4
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,660
Does Hong show any unusual changes?

5
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,540
What's wrong?

6
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,380
What are you doing?

7
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,900
I told you to watch him. Did you?

8
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,300
He woke up in the middle of the night and started to paint something.

9
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,460
Then he fell asleep and stayed asleep till now.

10
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,220
I kept watching him

11
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,300
He woke up.

12
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,580
Look.

13
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,820
He's

14
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,700
so comfy.

15
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,379
He could sleep all night until he woke up naturally.

16
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,860
But we had to stay up all night.

17
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,140
Didn't you also sleep a lot?

18
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,580
Hello.

19
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,100
Hurry up! Come here!

20
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,180
Something is in the water.

21
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,780
Let's go.

22
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,140
What happened?

23
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,820
I know.

24
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,580
I will kill them all.

25
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,020
It's Liu Sang's watch.

26
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,740
Sang is still alive!

27
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,300
Okay, all of you can go into the water now.

28
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,700
What is this?

29
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,460
Look.

30
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,300
Production date?

31
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,180
892673.

32
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,700
This is the serial number of the bronze coffin.

33
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,420
They belonged to the same shipment.

34
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,300
Here is a note.

35
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,020
Take a look.

36
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,380
There seems to be texts on it.

37
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,980
Gentle.

38
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,380
"There is a place of rebirth underwater

39
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,700
which can remove the curse of bronze."

40
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,780
A place of rebirth.

41
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,300
Sang did a great job this time.

42
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,820
So it means that

43
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,820
there really is a passage underwater.

44
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,940
We really have to go down there.

45
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,660
We have to go.

46
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,660
Wait a minute.

47
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,860
Something doesn't add up.

48
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,940
If Liu Sang is still alive,

49
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,060
he would have definitely swum back to find us.

50
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,940
But now he only uses this method to deliver a message,

51
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,420
not to mention it's so vague.

52
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,140
This is not his style.

53
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,580
It can be a trap.

54
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,100
If we go down into the water now,

55
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,260
we will definitely fall for the trap.

56
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,460
Yes.

57
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,980
Since the bad guys give us such a bait, there must be something fishy.

58
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,540
We won't go down there. It'll drive them crazy.

59
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,580
But this is also good news.

60
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,020
If there's someone under the water setting a trap,

61
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,420
Sang

62
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,620
still stands a chance to survive.

63
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,900
The strange fish was from the section of unredeemable goods,

64
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,940
so was the bronze coffin.

65
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,459
That responsible runner was stored in it,

66
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,020
and now Liu Sang's bottle is also from the section of unredeemable goods.

67
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,780
All the clues

68
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,500
point to the section of unredeemable goods.

69
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,420
We have to go in there.

70
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,100
The pond was full, and the rain stopped.

71
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,780
Loach is everywhere in the mud of the field.

72
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,260
I am waiting for you every day.

73
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,020
Waiting for you to catch loaches with me.

74
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,620
Hong?

75
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,620
Are you okay?

76
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,820
My big brother,

77
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,380
let's go catch the loaches together.

78
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,420
Guys.

79
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,459
We have known each other for quite some time.

80
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,740
It's kind of fate.

81
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,580
So there's something

82
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,820
I want to tell you out of our bond.

83
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,620
What are you doing, Hong?

84
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,740
This is very simple.

85
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,260
I just hope everyone

86
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,900
dies knowing what kills you.

87
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,500
Don't move.

88
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,740
Calm down.

89
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,620
Hong!

90
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,140
Hong.

91
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,500
You can tell me if something happened to you.

92
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,860
Don't act impulsively. Calm down.

93
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,940
You take it off.

94
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,460
Back off.

95
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,180
Alright! No problem.

96
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,540
Why are you here?

97
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,660
I wanted to spare your life.

98
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,500
I think you all look so afraid of death.

99
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,860
Do you think I am afraid of death?

100
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,980
I know you must feel bad now.

101
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,580
Don't do anything stupid.

102
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,420
You can tell us what's bothering you.

103
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,140
Right?

104
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,660
There must be a way to solve it.

105
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,420
No, I don't want to kill you.

106
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,580
But I can't control myself.

107
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,980
I have to do this.

108
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,700
Don't blame me.

109
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,260
I am apologizing to you guys.

110
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,940
Sorry.

111
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,620
No, it's okay.

112
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,460
It's okay.

113
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,860
Hong, you...

114
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,340
Go catch loaches with me.

115
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,220
Bye-bye!

116
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,820
It'll be over soon.

117
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,860
Take it easy.

118
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:09,700
How's he?

119
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,860
He's still under anesthetic

120
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,620
so he is not awake.

121
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,060
He has some superficial traumas

122
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,140
and a little concussion.

123
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
But all in all, he's normal.

124
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,340
Maybe he'll suffer from a temporary

125
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,140
disorder in awareness and language function.

126
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,580
But he'll be better in a few days.

127
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,540
Why wasn't I hurt?

128
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,020
When Hong set off the bombs,

129
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,900
Mr. Fatty threw his body in front of you.

130
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,780
Just to be cautious,

131
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,740
Warehouse 11 placed everyone here for medical treatment.

132
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,020
Mr. Third Junior.

133
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,820
What should we do now?

134
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,540
I have to get discharged as soon as possible.

135
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,940
If we want to find out what's going on,

136
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,060
we have to treat ourselves as goods so that

137
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,140
we can be stored into the section of unredeemable goods.

138
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,820
If we let the spy stay here,

139
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,260
he might do anything to hurt our people.

140
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,020
There are fewer people in the section of unredeemable goods.

141
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,580
After we go in there, there will be less threats to the people outside.

142
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,980
We have been there once.

143
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,300
And we came out of there.

144
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,460
Trust me.

145
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,540
We have to have hope in our heart now.

146
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,180
Just go.

147
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,340
You really have so much faith in me?

148
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,300
Who else should I have faith in except you?

149
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,220
What should I do if something really happened to you?

150
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,940
Don't worry.

151
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,660
I won't let anything happen to Warehouse 11.

152
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,660
We found a row of footprints

153
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,500
at the corner of the water area's bank.

154
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,220
Someone dived into the water at night.

155
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,660
Where's Sang?

156
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,210
<i>There is a place of rebirth underwater</i>

157
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,160
<i>which can remove the curse of bronze coffin</i>

158
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,700
Bye-bye!

159
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,020
Are you crazy?

160
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,300
What do you think you are? The Hulk?

161
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,900
Are you wearing an armor?

162
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,820
Trying to block the bomb with your body.

163
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,900
Are you a fool?

164
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,460
I forgot that.

165
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,220
I just fell asleep.

166
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,940
This is not a big deal.

167
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,460
I won't become an idiot.

168
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,180
I have more than enough braincells to deal with the concussion.

169
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,220
But you are different.

170
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,740
You just had a miracle recovery.

171
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,380
What a big loss it will be

172
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,020
if anything happens to you now!

173
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,500
I'll do it this time.

174
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,020
It'll be your turn to save me next time.

175
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,420
Knock on wood!

176
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,340
There's no next time.

177
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,300
We will never get involved in such conspiracies again.

178
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,700
Okay?

179
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,100
Nah, I can't make any promise.

180
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,940
We said such things

181
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,100
every time.

182
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,140
As the saying goes,

183
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,340
"Where there are humans, there are wars".

184
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,740
We are destined

185
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,020
to experience

186
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,660
such adventures and conspiracies all our life.

187
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,540
We can't just hide from them.

188
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,620
We have to take the initiative to attack first.

189
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,140
Fatty.

190
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,300
Please stay alive.

191
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,940
If something happens to you,

192
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,020
I won't be able to do this on my own.

193
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,340
Can you get up?

194
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,140
If you can, I need to discuss something serious with you.

195
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,380
No. I can't move.

196
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,260
Let's discuss it lying down.

197
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,980
I'm planning to

198
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,020
store us in the section of unredeemable goods as goods.

199
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,900
Do you remember I told you before that

200
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,420
all clues now

201
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,700
are pointing to that section.

202
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,900
If we want to survive,

203
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,900
we have to go to the source of the problems to take a look.

204
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,540
We need to talk to someone.

205
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,500
I have a dream.

206
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,260
Let me talk to everyone else.

207
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,820
Didn't you say you can't move?

208
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,060
But it's something serious.

209
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,540
Bros.

210
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,860
Get up.

211
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,820
Are you feeling better?

212
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,580
I have a dream.

213
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,860
We have to live.

214
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:29,540
So in order to

215
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,460
find a solution to save the lives of

216
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,409
the numerous poisoned staff

217
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,820
of Warehouse 11,

218
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,500
you voluntarily enter the section of unredeemable goods.

219
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,780
Sign this waiver.

220
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,340
Then you can go in,

221
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,100
Thank you, Warehouse 11.

222
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,700
OK, sign it.

223
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,460
This is about the safety of Warehouse 11.

224
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,700
I have to go in there. It's my responsibility.

225
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,380
I've seen many loyal friends,

226
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,340
but you're exceptionally loyal.

227
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,980
I'm Mr. Third Junior's apprentice.

228
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,060
He's so loyal to his friends.

229
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,940
Of course I have to be loyal, too.

230
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,300
Why is there fog again?

231
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,620
When we came here last time,

232
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,780
there was no poisonous fog.

233
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,100
It seems that someone already knows that we are coming.

234
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,140
There must be more dangers ahead.

235
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,140
Everyone, put on your gas mask

236
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,100
and pass quickly.

237
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,340
Yes, sir!

238
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,020
Yes.

239
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,380
Bai.

240
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:44,780
Come on.

241
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,020
Give me your hand.

242
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,860
Fatty.

243
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,060
Bai.

244
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,780
Fatty.

245
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,060
Bai.

246
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,620
Fatty.

247
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,900
Bai.

248
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm here!

249
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,860
Fatty!

250
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,180
Fatty.

251
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,860
Fatty.

252
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,020
Are you alright?

253
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,460
I feel dizzy.

254
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,260
Did you fall and hurt your head?

255
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,180
I am fine.

256
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,540
Did you see Bai?

257
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,660
Bai!

258
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,780
Isn't she here?

259
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,780
Have you guys seen Bai?

260
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,380
No.

261
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:38,940
No.

262
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,940
No.

263
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:42,900
No.

264
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,580
You guys stay and wait for me here.

265
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,700
I'll go find her.

266
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,780
Let me go with you.

267
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,460
No. You stay here and keep an eye on him.

268
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,740
Anyone there?

269
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,900
Anyone?

270
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,460
Where are you guys?

271
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,980
Anyone there?

272
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
Anyone there?

273
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,060
Can you hear me?

274
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,860
Fatty.

275
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,420
Fatty.

276
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
Mr. Third Junior.

277
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,460
Bai!

278
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,580
Bai.

279
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,060
Bai.

280
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,060
Bai.

281
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,820
Mr. Third Junior!

282
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
Fatty.

283
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,980
Mr. Third Junior.

284
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,140
Bai.

285
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,140
Bai.

286
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,260
Bai?

287
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,860
I'm here.

288
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,260
Here.

289
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:36,980
Bai?

290
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,140
I'm here.

291
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,740
Bai

292
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,740
Bai, are you okay?

293
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,500
I am fine.

294
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,060
I picked up a flashlight from the ground following the source of light.

295
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,340
It must be dangerous in this area.

296
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,860
Be careful.

297
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,500
Bai.

298
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,780
Bear with me.

299
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,220
Run!

300
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,460
Can you still hang in there?

301
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,620
No.

302
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,900
Fatty.

303
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,540
Fatty.

304
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,300
Fatty, ready to light fire!

305
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,940
Mr. Fatty, what's going on?

306
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,820
Lighter, give me a lighter!

307
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,580
Take it out now!

308
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,780
Fatty, fire up now!

309
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,300
Fire!

310
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,540
Bai is injured.

311
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,380
It's your fault.

312
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,380
How can this be my fault?

313
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,180
If it weren't for you landing on top of me,

314
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,340
I wouldn't have fallen down there.

315
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,780
But you could have caught me.

316
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,220
You are so heavy!

317
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,820
I wish I could catch you.

318
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,740
But who landed on top of me then?

319
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,700
Shuke Shuke.

320
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,180
You look just that mouse pilot.

321
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,740
I'm beta.

322
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,540
Beta is much thinner than you.

323
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,020
As a tough girl,

324
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,180
wounds on your body

325
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,060
are like medal representing your bravery.

326
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:33,980
Don't worry about it.

327
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,740
When this thing is over, I will take you to Korea.

328
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:37,860
Fatty.

329
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,220
What did you find?

330
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,060
A jar stuffed with hair.

331
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,380
It's a trap carefully designed.

332
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,540
The jars were all hidden on the routes that we must pass.

333
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
As long as we pass by, we will definitely step on one of them.

334
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,380
We guessed it right.

335
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,380
The murderer has appeared

336
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,340
and he's right in the section of unredeemable goods.

337
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,060
If so,

338
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,460
there will be more traps ahead

339
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,420
waiting for us.

340
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,260
We can't rule out this possibility.

341
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,220
Everyone, watch out.

342
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,940
We can go find

343
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,940
an old friend of mine.

344
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,260
Who?

345
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,980
Wang Junyi.

346
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,700
Why didn't you say so earlier?

347
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,380
Let's go.

348
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,500
I'll lead the way.

349
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,220
There are traces of someone living here.

350
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,820
Is it here?

351
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,620
He should have left.

352
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,940
He took all the household items with him.

353
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,300
He moved?

354
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,220
Nothing left.

355
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,860
I am impressed that

356
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,100
he could live so long

357
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,300
in this dark and enclosed place.

358
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,580
I am impressed.

359
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,940
Are you alright?

360
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,060
I am fine.

361
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,900
Hang in there.

362
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,100
Okay.

363
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,060
Looks like we're running out of time.

364
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,660
We have to find Wang Junyi quickly to

365
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,580
ask him what this is really about.

366
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,020
I'll go with you.

367
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,180
Let's go.

368
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,660
Fatty.

369
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,060
Take everyone to a safe place.

370
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,220
Got it.

371
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,620
Go.

372
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,820
Bai, look.

373
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,820
These things were left here during the past one or two days.

374
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,060
Could it be Wang Junyi?

375
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,180
And…

376
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,860
Does your neck still hurt?

377
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,380
I am fine.

378
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,340
Is this a mentor's concern for his apprentice?

379
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,220
Here it comes gain.

380
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,260
We are not making a romantic TV series.

381
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,740
I think Wang Junyi is nearby.

382
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,980
You're so smart.

383
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,780
What is that place?

384
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:48,620
No.

385
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,490
We can't get it open.

386
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,860
It looks like he once lived here too.

387
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,380
Why is there still no signal?

388
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,940
Is your message sent successfully?

389
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,860
Not me.

390
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,460
Low battery prompt.

391
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,260
Let's see if there's any clue.

392
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,420
It's power-off.

393
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,820
Take a short break.

394
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,380
Okay.

395
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:38,980
Are you alright?

396
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,620
I am fine.

397
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,540
Alright?

398
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,140
Let me see.

399
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,980
What did you just see?

400
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,900
A shadow.

401
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,180
Shadow?

402
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:11,820
Shadow.

403
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,220
It's alright.

404
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:26,620
Come on.

405
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,100
Take this.

406
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,860
Draw

407
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,460
the shadow.

408
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,180
Draw what you saw.

409
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,020
Okay.

410
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,140
It'll be alright.

411
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,420
We will definitely cure you.

412
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,380
Just draw it.

413
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,700
You scared me to death.

414
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,380
What happened?

415
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,500
Come here.

416
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,260
What happened?

417
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,740
Bai, come here.

418
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,060
Look.

419
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,820
Kanjian starts to show symptoms.

420
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,500
This is the same as the shadow Hong painted.

421
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,660
Yes.

422
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,380
Okay.

423
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,420
Many people are scared to death by the poison.

424
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,220
I'm fine.

425
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,860
Did you guys find Wang Junyi?

426
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,220
No.

427
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,940
We found a lot of

428
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,620
bonfire remnants and traces of life along the way.

429
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,780
Judging by these traces,

430
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,980
Wang Junyi has done enough

431
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,180
preparation for a long journey before he

432
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:11,940
left here.

433
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,660
But he can't go up from the section of unredeemable goods.

434
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,460
He should have gone further into it.

435
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,540
Wang Junyi said he was going to explore the way.

436
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,860
He said that there are still places

437
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,540
in the section of unredeemable goods that he hadn't been to.

438
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,220
We found his phone.

439
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,980
There must be important information in it.

440
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,060
But it's out of battery.

441
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,100
It's a piece of cake.

442
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,780
I am called the human portable power bank.

443
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,860
Hurry up.

444
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,540
It has adequate power to turn on.

445
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,620
This person was a go-between.

446
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,060
Why did he come to the section of unredeemable goods?

447
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,580
They came down here

448
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,900
to find Zhang Fo Ye's goods.

449
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,860
But they only got poisoned by the bronze wares and

450
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,620
have been stuck here since.

451
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,980
They're crazy.

452
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,420
They look so happy after being poisoned.

453
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,460
I take my hat off to them.

454
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,100
So, Wang Junyi is with them?

455
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,700
The phone is almost out of power.

456
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,460
We have to keep going.

457
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,860
The passages ahead from here will be very complicated.

458
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,860
Let me first give you a guide.

459
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,540
My name is Luo Xin.

460
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,220
We are go-betweens looking for Zhang Fo Ye's goods.

461
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,620
One day

462
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,660
we heard human's voice from the bottom of the water

463
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,260
saying that we could find the goods at the section of unredeemable goods.

464
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,780
So we came down.

465
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,620
But many people were poisoned by exposure to the bronze fragments.

466
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,780
At first

467
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,300
they would hear strange sounds

468
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,020
and see some strange shadows.

469
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,500
Then they would get hysteria

470
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,860
and their skin would turn dark.

471
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,700
Those poisonous bronze fragments come

472
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,380
from the depths of the section of unredeemable goods.

473
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,340
We worked so hard to find

474
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,820
the source of them.

475
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,780
But surprisingly, we found a person

476
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,500
deep in the section.

477
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,940
His name was Jiang Yuan.

478
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,780
Jiang Yuan!

479
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,380
He said he was also poisoned once.

480
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,900
But he had recovered

481
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,900
without any sequelae.

482
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,020
He told us that

483
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,020
many people had been poisoned by this toxin.

484
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,540
They found the antidote

485
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,020
at a certain warehouse section.

486
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,460
The name of this section is called the Place of Rebirth.

487
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,660
He also showed us a lot of files

488
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,140
so we were convinced that what he said was true.

489
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,460
I will take you

490
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,180
to a place called the Place of Rebirth.

491
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,500
There you'll have a chance to be cured.

492
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,940
There will be no power supply further deep.

493
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,140
You can lighten your loads to speed up.

494
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,020
Uncle Junyi asked me to record a video to

495
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,300
leave this information to you guys.

496
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,620
Latecomers, you must follow up.

497
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,900
You must follow our steps.

498
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,020
Place of Rebirth.

499
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,340
The file said that

500
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,900
he became a runner in 1940

501
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,700
and died in 1942.

502
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,980
Now it seems that the file is wrong.

503
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,820
He survived.

504
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,620
What are you doing?

505
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,020
Quiet.

506
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,620
I will take you

507
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,300
to a place called the Place of Rebirth.

508
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,500
There you'll have a chance to be cured.

509
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,900
There will be no power supply further deep.

510
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,220
You can lighten your loads to speed up.

511
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:32,780
Listen.

512
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,660
Come down.

513
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,020
Come down.

514
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,740
Come down.

515
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,340
Come down.

516
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,980
Come down.

517
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,100
Come down.

518
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,940
Come down.

519
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,220
Come down.

520
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,100
Listen to this.

521
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,420
This is what I recorded earlier.

522
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,900
Come down.

523
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,980
Come down.

524
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:13,660
Same voice.

525
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,860
Come down.

526
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,100
That's the murderer!

527
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,260
He was the one who tried to seduce us into the water.

528
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,220
He also sent the bronze coffin out for us to discover.

529
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,220
No, Wang Junyi is in danger.

530
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,020
Let's go.
