00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,259
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Episode 26

4
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,660
I have a bad feeling about it.

5
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,140
We have to find Jiang Yuan right now.

6
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,779
Let's go.

7
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,460
I'm tired these days.

8
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,500
What are you doing?

9
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,780
The big hero hasn't had the first bite yet.

10
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,820
How can you begin to eat already?

11
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,260
Wantang, you need to have some table etiquette

12
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
I need to replenish some energy.

13
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,140
Wantang, let me tell you this.

14
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,220
There is actually something on your face

15
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,060
that's pleasing to the eye.

16
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,620
Look at this big bold forehead.

17
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,420
It doesn't look like a good man's forehead, right?

18
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,700
Fatty.

19
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,300
How can you say such mean things?

20
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,700
I'm gonna….

21
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,379
Wantang, you owe me a big one.

22
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,820
Think about how to thank me.

23
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,700
You also got a lot of antiques from me for free.

24
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,140
Come on.

25
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:53,740
You…

26
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,260
It's all thanks to Mr. Fatty.

27
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,020
Let's all make a toast to Mr. Fatty.

28
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,420
Why do I feel that you're not so sincere?

29
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,060
Kanjian also made a big contribution.

30
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,620
That's true.

31
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,020
Kanjian did a great job.

32
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,660
He's such a Hercules.

33
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,020
Let's raise our glasses together!

34
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,700
Come on.

35
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,700
Everyone, cheers.

36
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,500
It's a happy gathering today.

37
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,379
You all worked very hard for it.

38
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,020
-Cheers. -Thank you, Mr. Fatty.

39
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,420
Thank you, Mr. Fatty.

40
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,740
Alright.

41
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,860
Let's dig in.

42
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,780
How nice it would be if we have twenty grilled lamb's kidneys now.

43
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,660
Did you realize something?

44
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,180
This steam therapy is only a temporary medical relief.

45
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,260
The hospital hasn't given us

46
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,980
their chemotherapy results yet.

47
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,740
We'd better try to find

48
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,220
the real cure for the poisoning.

49
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,140
So many people were hurt by those bronze fragments.

50
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,820
We can't let them

51
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,900
live such a miserable life forever.

52
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,060
If we want to find a way to detoxify the toxin once and for all,

53
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,460
we need to trace back to the original making method

54
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,740
of the poison and analyze the ingredients and

55
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,020
their properties.

56
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,940
I need a lab.

57
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,540
I will arrange it for you.

58
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,580
I heard it.

59
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,980
He is far away from us.

60
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,940
Deep down there.

61
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,180
Fortunately, it's quiet enough here.

62
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,820
What can you tell me about the structure here?

63
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,940
I can hear the structure of all the passages.

64
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
But some are full of goods.

65
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,140
These passages are not through and through.

66
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,780
I can only walk ahead to lead the way.

67
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,060
I can't draw a picture of them.

68
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,180
So,

69
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,420
you know what's going on,

70
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,140
but you can't draw it out.

71
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:02,940
I see.

72
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,380
After we go out,

73
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,380
I will pull some strings for you.

74
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,300
I think you're overdue for college education.

75
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,100
Wu Xie.

76
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,780
This is not a question of literacy,

77
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,740
okay?

78
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,260
Go that way.

79
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,700
Hello, your food delivery is here.

80
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,060
Just leave it there.

81
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,700
Can you give a good review to my service?

82
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,380
Thank you.

83
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,220
Uncle Erbai.

84
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,020
Long time no see, Uncle Erbai.

85
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,940
Uncle Erjing, what are you guys doing here?

86
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,860
The doctor said that

87
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,660
Mr. Erbai's situation has improved a lot now.

88
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,860
So he doesn't need to go to the hospital often.

89
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,940
That's good news.

90
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,780
You are going down

91
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,220
to Warehouse 11 for your mission soon.

92
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,620
We don't know

93
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,540
when you'll come back.

94
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,220
So, I took Mr. Erbai here to see you.

95
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,260
You know that Mr. Erbai hopes

96
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,500
you can spend more time with him.

97
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,300
Yes, of course.

98
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,420
Let's go in.

99
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,459
Look at you.

100
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,100
You are like a different person now.

101
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,940
Uncle Erbai.

102
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,140
Uncle Erbai.

103
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,020
Eat as much as you can.

104
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,380
You need extra nutrition

105
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,100
so that you can get better soon.

106
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:37,900
How is it?

107
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,100
Are you used to taking care of him?

108
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,940
Sure, no problem at all.

109
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,820
You don't want it anymore?

110
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:50,420
Mr. Erbai needs to go number two.

111
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,900
Number two?

112
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:53,420
What number two?

113
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,940
Mr. Erbai, you need to go to the toilet, right?

114
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,140
That thing.

115
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,100
Here. Come on.

116
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,340
You have to learn how to take care of a patient.

117
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,900
So, so this one, right?

118
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,500
Yes. Hurry up.

119
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,700
Uncle Erbai.

120
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,300
I, let me take off your pants first.

121
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,340
It's okay. It's alright.

122
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,900
Uncle Erbai, it's okay even if you can't aim at it.

123
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,700
I'll wash your pants for you.

124
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,580
It's okay. Relax.

125
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:26,940
That's it.

126
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,780
Relax and let it out.

127
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,660
Is it over.

128
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,820
Uncle Erbai, then…

129
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,980
Let me help you put your pants on.

130
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,500
Okay, you just have some rest.

131
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,100
I'm going to wash the pants.

132
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,300
Mr. Erbai.

133
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,820
Now you must know

134
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,220
why I brought you here.

135
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,980
You alone is enough

136
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,580
for me to carry out my plan.

137
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,780
When I kill the real Wu Xie,

138
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,620
and then expose the identity of this imposter,

139
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,980
the whole Wu family

140
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,220
will be mine.

141
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,380
But don't worry.

142
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,100
You will still be the patriarch.

143
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,060
But by then, only I can

144
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,220
hear the orders you make.

145
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,500
It turns out that no matter how prestigious a person was,

146
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,500
after he loses his health,

147
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,940
he will lose everything.

148
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,500
We'll meet at the same place.

149
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,100
Yes, sir.

150
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,780
Uncle Erbai.

151
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,460
I washed it clean.

152
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,340
Uncle Erbai.

153
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,820
Why are you crying?

154
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,740
Are your eyes itchy?

155
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,300
Hungry?

156
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,860
Thirsty?

157
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,100
You…

158
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,380
What do you mean by blinking constantly?

159
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,780
I don't understand.

160
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,340
If it were Mr. Third…

161
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,780
Mr. Erbai,

162
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
I'm going to tell you the truth.

163
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,300
I,

164
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,420
I am not Wang Meng at all.

165
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:17,980
No.

166
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,780
I mean

167
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,900
I'm not Mr. Third Junior.

168
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,620
I am actually Wang Meng.

169
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,980
You know?

170
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,620
You knew that?

171
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,740
You..

172
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,780
You know. So

173
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,340
you're blinking because

174
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,780
you want to tell me something.

175
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,500
What do you want to tell me…

176
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,900
You want to tell me…

177
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,580
Mr. Erbai, how about

178
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
I'll do the talking?

179
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,020
If I am right,

180
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,180
you just blink your eyes.

181
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,380
If I am wrong,

182
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,020
you just stay still, okay?

183
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,100
Let me guess what you want to tell me.

184
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,580
You…

185
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,380
You want to poop?

186
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,940
No, no.

187
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,740
What was I thinking?

188
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,420
You have something important

189
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,020
to tell me.

190
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,300
Something important.

191
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,700
What can the important thing be?

192
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,780
It has something to do with Mr. Third Junior.

193
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,460
Yes, yes!

194
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,220
It has something to do with Mr. Third Junior.

195
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,860
But he's not here.

196
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,980
Boss

197
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,700
has been off to investigate the spy.

198
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,100
He went to Warehouse 11.

199
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,700
But he was afraid that people might find out he's gone.

200
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,940
So he asked me

201
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,460
to stay here disguising as him.

202
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,820
So that the spy won't find out…

203
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,540
What…

204
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,300
Mr. Erbai, why do you

205
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,020
keep blinking?

206
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,300
You, you…

207
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,500
You know who the spy is?

208
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,460
You do know!

209
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,460
You really know who the spy is?

210
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,860
Who is the spy? Come on!

211
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,060
Tell me.

212
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,980
Tell me.

213
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,660
I'm listening.

214
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,340
Go on.

215
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,180
I'm sorry, Mr. Erbai.

216
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,020
I forgot that you can't speak.

217
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,260
So,

218
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,060
let's stick to the old rule.

219
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,260
Blink if I am right about something.

220
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,900
Let me say the names.

221
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,340
The spy…

222
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,340
Spy.

223
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,140
Mr. Fatty?

224
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,940
Wrong.

225
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,860
It's not Mr. Fatty.

226
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,380
Mr. Zhang Qiling?

227
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,540
Impossible. Definitely not him.

228
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,180
Bai Haotian?

229
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,460
Glasses?

230
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,260
Kanjian?

231
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,860
It can't be Jin Wantang, right?

232
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,409
Who else can it be?

233
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,889
Who else…

234
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,180
The only one left is Erjing.

235
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,340
Erjing.

236
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,500
Erjing is the spy.

237
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,740
Boss will take us to lunch!

238
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,100
Yes.

239
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,660
You'll have to wait.

240
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,700
Let's go back and do some business first.

241
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,260
Let's go.

242
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:56,700
Go.

243
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,380
Go.

244
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,420
Erjing is the spy.

245
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
What? How?

246
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,540
Erjing is…

247
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,180
He is actually the spy among us?

248
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:08,940
Mr. Erbai.

249
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,220
Erjing….

250
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,580
That means

251
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,860
he can kill you any minute.

252
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,420
You are staying by his side every day.

253
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,660
Erjing.

254
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,500
No.

255
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,780
We can't stay here doing nothing.

256
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,340
But…

257
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,780
Mr. Erbai, no.

258
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,620
We can't stay here anymore.

259
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,580
I'll take you to escape with me.

260
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,540
We're leaving now.

261
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,340
He should be back in a while.

262
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,420
Mr. Erbai.

263
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,340
Hurry up, let's go!

264
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,260
I'll take you out of here.

265
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,380
Let's go.

266
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,140
What is it?

267
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,620
Let's go together.

268
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,900
You don't want to go?

269
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,740
Why not?

270
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,740
After Erjing comes back, he'll…

271
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,260
What is it?

272
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,580
What…

273
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,060
The knife?

274
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,100
Knife…

275
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,020
You want me to…

276
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,820
Okay.

277
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,260
Mr. Erbai.

278
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,300
Here goes nothing!

279
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,500
I will put up a fight with Erjing.

280
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,060
When he comes in later,

281
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,900
I will fight him desperately.

282
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,220
I will take you out with me!

283
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,620
I…

284
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,220
will risk my life protecting you.

285
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,260
He, I…

286
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,060
I'll wait for him to come back and then…

287
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,980
What does it mean this time? Mr. Erbai?

288
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,580
No!

289
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,980
Mr. Erbai.

290
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,220
My boss hasn't come back yet.

291
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,620
No, no, no.

292
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,220
You can't kill yourself!

293
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,020
There are many solutions to this matter.

294
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,420
I will…

295
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,500
I can't help you do this.

296
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,460
I, I definitely can't do this.

297
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,700
Mr. Erbai, you must be optimistic.

298
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,460
Don't worry.

299
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,220
Mr. Third Junior must have a way to solve it.

300
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,220
He

301
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,380
won't let things

302
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,300
deteriorate like Erjing wants.

303
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,180
There is always a solution to a problem, right?

304
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,740
You can't try to end your life. It's not worth it.

305
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,780
What are you doing?

306
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,820
Put the knife down.

307
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,300
I…

308
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,940
What am I doing?

309
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,940
I know everything.

310
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,820
Erjing,

311
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,100
you are the spy.

312
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,060
You're the spy among us!

313
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,100
You,

314
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,420
you made Mr. Erbai come to be in such a state.

315
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,860
And now you want to kill my boss.

316
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,580
What proof do you have to accuse that I am the spy?

317
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,300
What proof do I have?

318
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,340
Because

319
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,100
Uncle Erbai told me just now.

320
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,540
Mr. Erbai, he told you?

321
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,260
Then let Mr. Erbai speak now.

322
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,700
I will let…

323
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,580
But I just saw it clearly with my eyes that

324
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,100
you tried to kill Mr. Erbai with the knife.

325
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,740
He…

326
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,780
Stop your acting.

327
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,940
I knew it was you.

328
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,500
Catch him!

329
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:20,860
Freeze!

330
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,540
Freeze!

331
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,140
Freeze!

332
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,820
Freeze!

333
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,620
Catch him.

334
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:23,940
Don't come closer!

335
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,340
He's a traitor.

336
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,860
Traitor!

337
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,460
Don't.

338
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,420
Don't chase me!

339
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:26,780
Freeze!

340
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,100
Freeze!

341
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,820
Freeze!

342
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,660
It won't work, Mr. Erbai.

343
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,700
As for what happened today,

344
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,420
I just need to spread the news saying that

345
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,100
Fatty, Zhang Qiling and others all join

346
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,540
Wang Meng's conspiracy.

347
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,340
They want to join hands to

348
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,020
destroy the Wu family.

349
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,620
I have more important things to do now.

350
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,460
I'm going to Warehouse 11 to get them personally.

351
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,260
I am going to

352
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,220
kill all these conspirators.

353
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,100
Mr. Erbai,

354
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,220
wait for my good news.

355
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,580
You two, go over there.

356
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,140
The rest come with me.

357
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,500
Yes, sir!

358
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,660
Thank you.

359
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,580
You're welcome.

360
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,740
Uncle Ma!

361
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,500
Uncle Ma, are you alright?

362
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,060
Uncle Ma!

363
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,980
What happened to you?

364
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,780
Found two down here.

365
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,580
What's the situation on your side?

366
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,180
I also found one here.

367
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,220
The ore steaming therapy cannot really eliminate the toxins.

368
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,420
I am not healed now.

369
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,140
I guess that these ores

370
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,180
may contain trace amounts of toxins.

371
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,860
It looks like they have turned for the better

372
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,460
while actually the symptoms of poisoning are getting more serious.

373
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,900
What?

374
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,020
But..

375
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,020
Didn't you say that the toxins have been eliminated from them?

376
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,180
Calm down.

377
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,340
How can we calm down?

378
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,540
We don't want this to happen either, right?

379
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,940
Even if you insist on letting us explain,

380
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,660
we don't know what happens exactly now.

381
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,780
How about

382
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,100
you let us out

383
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,420
so that

384
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,100
we can figure out what's happening?

385
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,300
I can't let you go, not now.

386
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,740
The Wu family's people are here.

387
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,780
My brother Erjing. I am so glad to see you.

388
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,180
Explain to them for us.

389
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,540
Wu Xie is already dead.

390
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,460
Someone

391
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,980
pretended to be him

392
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,340
to get into our Wu family.

393
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,260
This person hurt Mr. Erbai and destroyed our branch.

394
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,900
He wants to destroy the whole Wu family.

395
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,500
The whole thing is a scheme.

396
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,460
I have called the police.

397
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,660
Now these people will be handed over to the police from us.

398
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,420
I hope Warehouse 11

399
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,180
can cooperate with us.

400
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,620
What did you say?

401
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,620
Come with us.

402
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,780
You have been exposed.

403
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,260
There's no need to put on an act anymore.

404
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,420
What does it mean?

405
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,900
Wait.

406
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,260
What proof do you have?

407
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:34,820
Take a look.

408
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,860
The Mr. Third Junior who came back from Thunder City

409
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,940
was actually Wang Meng who disguised as him.

410
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,660
His identity has been exposed by me.

411
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,860
I have found out

412
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,860
your whole plan.

413
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,860
Things happening outside the warehouse

414
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,300
is not our business.

415
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,180
But this matter

416
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,540
has a direct relationship with Warehouse 11.

417
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,700
Whether he's true or an imposter,

418
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,500
you must give an account of what happened.

419
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,460
Warehouse 11 is not somewhere

420
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,820
your Wu family can come and go as you wish.

421
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,420
Don't think you can

422
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,100
take them out of here with nothing but your word.

423
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,340
Manager Tong, don't worry.

424
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,980
Our Wu family will give you an explanation.

425
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,100
Wait.

426
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,580
Something sounds fishy to me.

427
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,980
These people

428
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,900
came to Warehouse 11 and made many troubles here.

429
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,420
They must take responsibility for what they did.

430
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,100
Now you want to take them away with you

431
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,460
by saying that they are spies?

432
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,660
Manager Tong.

433
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,500
These people killed Warehouse 11's staff.

434
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,220
How can we let them go

435
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,340
just because someone else says that he will deal with them?

436
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,740
This must be a trick.

437
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,860
And Erjing has been working for Wu Erbai for so many years.

438
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,460
He and Wu Xie are very close.

439
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,420
He is here to get these people out.

440
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,900
We will detain them here.

441
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,700
Let us hand them over to the police.

442
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,340
This little girl is smart.

443
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,580
Bai.

444
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,940
It's only been a few days since we met last time.

445
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,620
You have grown up.

446
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,460
I am only telling the truth.

447
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:19,820
Fine.

448
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,860
These people can stay here for now.

449
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,580
But I want to go down to the section of unredeemable goods.

450
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,380
I want to take all the people there up myself.

451
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,380
Otherwise, I can't guarantee the safety of Warehouse 11.

452
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,500
The consequences will be more serious than now.

453
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,220
Wait a minute.

454
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,860
How can you make me believe you?

455
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,020
What are you afraid of with me going down to the section of unredeemable goods?

456
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,020
In worst case, you can leave us there and won't let us come up.

457
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,500
This initiative is in your hands.

458
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,660
Bai.

459
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,020
We can't

460
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,140
take this risk.

461
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,380
Someone.

462
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,460
Take them into the section of unredeemable goods.

463
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,300
Left.

464
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,300
The world heard by ears

465
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,740
is far more comprehensive than what the eyes can see.

466
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,860
I am already familiar with the environment already.

467
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,780
Just make sure Jiang Yuan can't go into this passage,

468
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,140
then he will gradually be corned.

469
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,880
<i>Restricted Area</i>

470
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,300
You can't escape.

471
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,300
Your heartbeat

472
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,340
is more obvious than any other sound in the dark.

473
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,180
You don't even know what you are dealing with.

474
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,300
Who made you do this?

475
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,220
Someone who can get me out of here.

476
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,660
I can take you out of here,

477
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,300
as long as you tell me who he is.

478
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,980
I don't want to leave like this.

479
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,220
You don't understand.

480
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,500
Leaving here doesn't mean

481
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,420
going back to the ground.

482
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,660
Leaving…

483
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,260
It means that I'll leave with the treasures of South Sea King which are

484
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,820
right underneath our feet.

485
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,490
That man said that

486
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,780
as long as I did as he told me to,

487
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,380
I could get the treasures.

488
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,010
He will come down with the magical artifact that can open the mechanism.

489
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,450
By then

490
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,740
we

491
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,620
can both get a large fortune.

492
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,060
You are going to South Sea Kingdom's imperial temple, right?

493
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,700
How did you know that?

494
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,900
I heard it from thunder.

495
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,100
Who are you?

496
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,620
I am also one of our own.

497
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,220
I came here to join you.

498
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,020
You are not.

499
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,020
You are trying to fool me.

500
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,020
I left a lot of marks

501
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,100
that only our people can understand.

502
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,300
If you were really one of our own,

503
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,580
you should have noticed them.

504
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,820
He just died.

505
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,300
This is over.

506
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,340
The only clue is gone.

507
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,140
This should be their mark.

508
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,060
This tattoo

509
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,060
doesn't look like made in a professional tattoo parlor.

510
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,620
It's very crude.

511
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,740
He tattooed it in the section of unredeemable goods himself.

512
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,460
He just said that he could get the treasures.

513
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,980
This organization looks like

514
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,660
it has been running a long time.

515
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,660
Its members are not just some rogues.

516
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,300
They have a deep obsession with the treasures.

517
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,580
People who can live in the section of unredeemable goods can't be that stupid.

518
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,060
Do you remember Mr. Jiao?

519
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,540
You should never underestimate

520
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,060
the temptation and magic of money.

521
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,220
Just make them believe that

522
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,740
there is great wealth under the ground.

523
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,180
Then you can agitate them to do what you want them to do.

524
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,780
I knew you would come here.

525
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,380
Wang Meng sent a message saying that

526
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,540
Erjing is the spy.

527
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,940
Everyone saw that.

528
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,820
I told you guys so earlier.

529
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,460
Your world must be turned upside down.

530
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,740
But he's been with Uncle Erbai for so long.

531
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,780
Why didn't he do anything until now?

532
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,300
Stop talking and let's go!

533
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,900
He only realized recently that he could rebel?

534
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,300
Hurry up.

535
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,420
Has Erjing gone down to the section of unredeemable goods?

536
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,300
Naive is in danger.

537
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,980
We have to inform him.

538
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,420
There is no phone signal in the section yet, right?

539
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,100
Not yet.

540
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,420
Hurry up!

541
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,180
Let's go.

542
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,660
We can only take you to this far.

543
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,860
You need to do the rest by yourself.

544
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,340
Wish you guys good luck.

545
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,300
Let's go.

546
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:07,740
Come on!

547
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:17,740
Move.

548
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,060
Everyone,

549
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,220
after I waited for so many years,

550
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,740
my plan of getting the treasures of the South Sea King

551
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,380
is about to happen soon.

552
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,140
It's been twenty years.

553
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,340
I finally came back here.

554
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,380
The treasures

555
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,660
are here.

556
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,340
Look at its natural terrain to hide something

557
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,380
and the perfect environment for the thunder listening.

558
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,820
I had lived here for a long time.

559
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,780
I had seen the whole picture of the section of unredeemable goods.

560
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,860
I will take you straight to the destination.

561
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,180
This time I also brought with us

562
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,300
the artifact of the South Sea King.

563
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,500
It can

564
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,020
open the imperial temple's mechanism.

565
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,860
We will use this artifact

566
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,540
to restore the thunder listening device

567
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,020
to activate the artifact

568
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,940
which will help us get the treasures.

569
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,940
This is the mark Jiang Yuan left us.

570
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,660
We are going to follow these marks to find him.

571
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,940
If you meet Wu Xie's people,

572
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,220
don't hesitate.

573
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,140
Kill them on the spot!

574
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:51,780
Yes, sir!
