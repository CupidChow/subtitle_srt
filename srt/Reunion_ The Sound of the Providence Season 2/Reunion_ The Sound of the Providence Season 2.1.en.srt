Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

My name is Wu Xie.

5
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,930
My grandpa was a famous grave robber

6
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,490
before the founding of New China.

7
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,609
He had a mysterious notebook

8
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,050
titled

9
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,810
Grave Robbery Notes.

10
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,889
Uncle Sanxing has never come back

11
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,290
since when he went out at a time

12
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,330
I think he might have died.

13
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,620
<i>Message Uncle Sanxing: Beixin Bridge, smoke in bamboo grove and rain on locust tree,</i>

14
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,970
Uncle Sanxing!

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,850
The monarch of Luoyun Kingdom of the South Sea is South Sea King.

20
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,010
Its people had seven ears.

21
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,290
Legend has it that they could understand the Thunder God's words,

22
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,050
so they got to know a lot of secrets from the Heaven.

23
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,770
He's listening to thunder.

24
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,690
He's listening to thunder.

25
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,170
Your uncle

26
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,250
was the only one of the whole archaeological team who was missing.

27
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,210
Your uncle went to Thunder City on his own

28
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,530
and ended up dying on the way.

29
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,330
No way!

30
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,850
My uncle was not that kind of person!

31
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,890
Uncle Sanxing,

32
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,690
if

33
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,530
there is anything I haven't finished yet,

34
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,650
it is to find you.

35
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,810
I want to die without regret.

36
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,610
I may never get out.

37
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,290
The Section of Unredeemable Goods is so big.

38
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,730
I can't find a way out.

39
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,650
I've been here for three years.

40
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,930
It seems that it should be

41
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,010
the source of the thunder whispers.

42
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,010
So whatever happens,

43
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,130
I must go to the Section of Unredeemable Goods.

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,490
Episode 1

45
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,290
Actually there is a legend about the Section of Unredeemable Goods.

46
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,570
During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression,

47
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,130
Warehouse 11 was under the jurisdiction of one of the last few administrators

48
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,530
Zhang Qishan, aka Zhang Fo Ye.

49
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,250
When the war started,

50
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,720
we were outnumbered ten to one,

51
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,490
and everybody thought we'd lose.

52
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,290
It was a very intense war.

53
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,970
When the Japanese soldiers were about to capture our stronghold…

54
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,890
Attack!

55
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,610
Everybody, speed up!

56
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,970
In the nick of time, Zhang Fo Ye

57
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,130
lured a group of well-equipped Japanese soldiers

58
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,330
into the Section of Unredeemable Goods in Warehouse 11.

59
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,930
Hurry up! Get a move on!

60
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,410
Go!

61
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,330
What?

62
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,450
What's going on?

63
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,370
Watch out, guys!

64
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,610
Thanks to the numerous traps Zhang Fo Ye had set up there,

65
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,450
the Japanese army was annihilated as a whole.

66
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,770
What's more,

67
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,050
as I heard from a warehouse clerk who stored goods there,

68
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,810
even to this day, that place

69
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,810
is still being haunted by screams of Japanese soldiers

70
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,770
and voices of evil spirits,

71
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,170
so nobody dares to go there

72
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,050
and people rush away as soon as they leave the goods there.

73
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,009
What you said

74
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,690
makes it even more imperative for me to go there.

75
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,890
Why?

76
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,690
Back then my uncle

77
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,010
was coerced into entering the Section of Unredeemable Goods,

78
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,450
and he left

79
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,930
very important clues there,

80
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,490
so I can only know the truth by going down there

81
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,730
and know who coerced him.

82
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,240
Normally there would be a legend like this

83
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,330
for places with hidden secrets

84
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,570
to prevent others from getting close to the truth,

85
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,570
but this is a poorly made-up legend.

86
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,850
The warehouse is about to be closed. I'm off.

87
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,170
I'm going too.

88
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,610
I've also received a text message.

89
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,009
I'm gonna go and get my reward.

90
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,840
What reward? Don't add yourself to the trouble.

91
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,480
You can't get in without me.

92
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,600
Why?

93
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,450
The passageway from Ganyang Warehouse to the next warehouse

94
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,130
is under the water.

95
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:07,970
But

96
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,410
this entrance is blocked by the goods in stock.

97
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,090
If you want to enter the outfall,

98
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,090
you have to move those goods first.

99
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,600
But each underwater container

100
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,490
has a sensor on top.

101
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,970
The defense system is activated

102
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,850
as long as it is not the time for storing or retrieving goods.

103
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,810
Once the goods are subject to external forces

104
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,250
and can't keep balance,

105
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,800
the traps will be activated,

106
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,010
bringing electricity

107
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,850
into this reservoir.

108
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,050
There is an indicator light on each container.

109
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,690
Green indicates safety,

110
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,090
yellow indicates safety zone has been reached,

111
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,090
and red indicates trigger of traps.

112
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,290
That's to say,

113
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,410
we must move the goods

114
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,050
while keep their balance?

115
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,850
I'll see what I can do about it.

116
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:50,930
Let's go.

117
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,410
Wait for me.

118
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,130
Keep up with me.

119
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:25,960
I'm keeping up.

120
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,450
Now your stature shows…

121
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,770
shows its advantage.

122
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,170
Let's get started.

123
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,850
We'll first thrust a rope through the iron chain.

124
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,850
Then you'll dive underwater

125
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,610
to get some lead blocks for anchoring the goods.

126
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,330
After that, we'll just need to

127
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,850
cut off the iron chain with an electric welder.

128
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,090
When the lead blocks sink,

129
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,250
they can lift up the iron chains

130
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,450
anchoring the goods.

131
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,730
In the last step, the two of us will pull the goods at the same time.

132
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,200
When they are kept horizontal,

133
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,370
we'll be able to lift the containers

134
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,250
blocking the outfall.

135
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,810
Bai!

136
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,810
Bai!

137
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,530
Hurry up! Go and have a look over there!

138
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:23,850
OK.

139
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:24,610
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

140
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,960
Hurry up! Someone has broken into the Ganyang Warehouse!

141
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,490
Here.

142
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,650
Someone has broken into the Ganyang Warehouse! Stop!

143
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,250
Someone has broken into the Ganyang Warehouse! Everybody on alert!

144
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,210
Everybody on alert!

145
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:30,930
Go over there. Over there.

146
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,930
Hurry up, hurry up.

147
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,690
Over there.

148
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,490
Search in separate directions, guys.

149
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,290
Be careful.

150
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,730
Bai.

151
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,530
Here.

152
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:34,680
Bai.

153
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:35,970
How are you doing?

154
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,490
How are you doing? Are you OK?

155
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,250
Yes.

156
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,290
Thankfully, the electricity was on and off once you triggered the traps.

157
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,410
What shall I do if you really die?

158
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,970
Do you want me to be in your debt for the rest of my life?

159
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,450
I won't let you

160
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,480
take risks with me again next time.

161
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,410
That's just a precautionary warning.

162
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,010
How can they kill people with electricity for real?

163
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,210
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

164
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,610
We'll lose

165
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,890
if we expose ourselves.

166
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,250
I don't want you to lose.

167
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,170
Even if the voltage was low,

168
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,410
what if you had an accident underwater?

169
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,120
I made a bet in my heart

170
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,730
before we went underwater.

171
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,090
What was your bet?

172
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,250
I wouldn't die

173
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,050
as long as you are alive.

174
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,250
Are you insane?

175
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,010
Are you insane?

176
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,170
What logic is your bet based on?

177
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,170
You're still alive because you are young,

178
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,210
because we were lucky.

179
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,010
What does that have to do with whether I'm alive or not?

180
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,370
I won anyway.

181
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,130
You've lost your mind.

182
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,410
All right, let's stop talking about this.

183
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,450
Warehouse 11 is in a state of siege now.

184
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,930
We have no way back.

185
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,730
We can only move on.

186
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,570
What's more, this is our only chance.

187
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,090
We have absolutely no way to get in here again next time.

188
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,610
Get a move on.

189
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,330
OK.

190
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:51,970
This way.

191
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,770
I'll leave that window to you.

192
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,160
Go.

193
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,010
Stay still.

194
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,050
There's another monitor here.

195
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,290
Cover your face.

196
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,090
What?

197
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,010
Cover your face.

198
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,810
What for?

199
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,290
Warehouse 11 is a rule-based place.

200
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,290
As long as our faces are not captured,

201
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,090
we can just refuse to admit it's us.

202
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,210
Is there even such a rule for Warehouse 11?

203
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,010
Let's go.

204
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,130
Go.

205
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,770
It's Wu Xie and Bai Haotian.

206
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,770
They are in the passageway area.

207
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,970
Location K13-8.

208
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:24,370
Run!

209
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,290
Location K13-8.

210
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,690
Why are you still covering your face?

211
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,410
Get out of here quickly.

212
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,730
Be quick.

213
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,090
They are in Location K13-8.

214
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,530
Notify clerks of other warehouses

215
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,330
to outflank them through Passageway M7.

216
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:45,720
This way.

217
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,170
Be quick.

218
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,930
Close all warehouse gates immediately.

219
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,690
Close all warehouse gates, close all warehouse gates!

220
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,170
Mr. Third Junior,

221
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,450
we'll be locked in the passageway

222
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,010
once the warehouse gate is locked.

223
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,090
We must hurry up.

224
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:09,850
Run!

225
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,170
Hurry up.

226
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,370
Dong,

227
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,690
take a couple of people to go there with you.

228
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,890
The rest of you, come with me. Hurry up.

229
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,610
Go, go.

230
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,370
Stop!

231
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,050
Stop there!

232
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,090
Where are you running?

233
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,490
T08-9, T08-9.

234
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,490
You must intercept them at T08-9.

235
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,890
Hurry up, keep up!

236
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,850
Go. They are in the front.

237
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,090
Request to open the gate.

238
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,010
Request to open the gate.

239
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:50,850
Stop going after them. Stop.

240
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,970
That warehouse is off limits.

241
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,730
We can catch them if we go in.

242
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,050
Ahead of us is the Section of Unredeemable Goods.

243
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,810
Nobody can set foot in it.

244
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:12,940
<i>Section of Unredeemable Goods</i>

245
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,050
This pit should be the entrance to the Section of Unredeemable Goods.

246
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,050
All the goods are shipped down

247
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,130
through this boom truck.

248
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,970
It looks so deep.

249
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,330
If you go back now,

250
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,410
you'll just be demoted in the worst case.

251
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,970
If you keep following me,

252
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,850
I can't guarantee your safety.

253
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,850
Till now I still believe

254
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,650
that I wouldn't die as long as you are alive.

255
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,010
And I also have things I want to do.

256
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,050
I'll go down first.

257
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,040
Take care.

258
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,240
Go.

259
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,930
What are we gonna do now?

260
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,930
There is still a great depth down here.

261
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,050
Uncle Sanxing was put in here a long time ago.

262
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,020
He should still be down there.

263
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,170
Let's find out more about the surroundings

264
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,170
and straighten things out.

265
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,890
OK.

266
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,250
Mr. Third Junior.

267
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,530
There is light down there.

268
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,560
Turn off your flashlight.

269
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,610
That's a distress signal.

270
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,330
Who are you?

271
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,770
Anybody there?

272
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:14,970
Is anybody there?

273
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,050
Who is over there?

274
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:22,970
Uncle Sanxing.

275
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,410
Wait for me here. I'll go and have a look.

276
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:27,730
No!

277
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,770
You can't go.

278
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,570
I think there is something weird about that distress signal.

279
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,570
It is weird indeed.

280
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,130
But as you know,

281
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,850
I must go down to have a look.

282
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,930
I'll go with you then.

283
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:48,560
Here.

284
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:49,930
Take it.

285
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,890
We can't both go down.

286
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,330
If anything happens to me down there,

287
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,370
can you pull me up?

288
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,810
I trust you.

289
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,810
Be careful.

290
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,850
Got it.

291
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,930
Anybody here?

292
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,290
Who's there?

293
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:44,970
Who's there?

294
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,210
Say something!

295
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,050
Is it you who sent the distress signal just now?

296
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,610
Xie,

297
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,290
help me.

298
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,250
I'm stuck here.

299
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,800
Xie,

300
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,290
someone wanted to kill me.

301
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,730
He threw me down here.

302
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,850
He wanted to harm our Wu family.

303
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,240
No,

304
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,410
you shouldn't be here.

305
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,080
Erbai fell for a set-up.

306
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,490
Go quickly!

307
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,480
What's down here

308
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,370
can cost your life.

309
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,530
Go!

310
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,570
Go quickly!

311
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,370
Uncle Sanxing.

312
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,650
Uncle Sanxing.

313
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,050
Let me get you out of here.

314
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,050
Let me get you out of here!

315
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,530
Go!

316
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:01,810
Give me your hand!

317
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,250
Xie.

318
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,490
Xie.

319
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,810
I can't.

320
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,210
Xie,

321
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,370
go.

322
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:19,810
Go.

323
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,330
No.

324
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,250
Uncle Sanxing,

325
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,400
I've been looking for you for over ten years.

326
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,570
I've finally found you today.

327
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,810
I won't let you stay here.

328
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,730
I'll definitely get you out of here.

329
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:34,890
Go with me.

330
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,050
Go with me!

331
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,010
Come on.

332
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,170
Uncle Sanxing,

333
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,970
why haven't you aged at all?

334
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,050
Uncle Sanxing!

335
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,890
Mr. Third Junior.

336
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,370
Bai.

337
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:50,970
Bai.

338
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,090
Bai!

339
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,730
I didn't lie to you.

340
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,520
Mr. Third Junior…

341
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:28,890
Bai.

342
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:30,810
Bai!

343
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,170
Come on.

344
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,490
Bai.

345
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:35,850
Bai!

346
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,010
What's going on?

347
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,050
Get up.

348
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:13,970
Let's go.

349
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,410
Are you OK?

350
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:40,610
Here.

351
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:51,490
Here.

352
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,090
My goodness.

353
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,800
Are we safe now?

354
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,730
I think we are for the moment.

355
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:14,970
Here you are.

356
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,330
What was that just now?

357
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,610
It may be a kind of venomous bug.

358
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,010
It can kill people

359
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,450
once it enters their brains.

360
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,450
Go.

361
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,250
Let's move on to have a look.

362
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:40,690
Wait a minute.

363
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,450
What's wrong?

364
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,450
Did I say anything to you

365
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,850
when I was in a coma just now?

366
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:53,730
Yes.

367
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,490
You said…

368
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,400
You said you suddenly felt hungry and wanted to have BBQ skewers.

369
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,480
And then you ordered four skewers of grilled garlic

370
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,490
and two skewers of grilled leek.

371
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,210
Didn't I say anything else?

372
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,250
Anything else?

373
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,370
Yes.

374
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,890
"Two more skewers of grilled lamb kidneys please."

375
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,170
Why do you prefer such a strong taste?

376
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:24,610
Let's go.

377
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,610
Wait for me!

378
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:59,870
<i>Off-limits Area of the Section of Unredeemable Goods</i>

379
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,210
The goods are the same as the ones above,

380
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:19,200
and they are not placed in order.

381
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:22,130
The surroundings here

382
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:24,450
feel somewhat different

383
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:25,790
from the surroundings where I saw

384
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,210
my uncle was in the video.

385
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:29,720
He should be further inside.

386
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,170
Go.

387
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,239
Mr. Third Junior,

388
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,009
this place is haunted indeed. Listen.

389
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,450
This way.

390
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,450
These bells are laid or hung in the middle of the road

391
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,330
as a man-made warning.

392
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,370
It's like a hunter lurking in the shadow is alerted

393
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,960
when a prey touches the trap.

394
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:13,690
Mr. Third Junior,

395
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,730
what's that sound outside?

396
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,370
Maybe it's thunder.

397
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,610
Mr. Third Junior, are you OK?

398
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,250
Are you OK?

399
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:23,810
Yes.

400
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,850
The Section of Unredeemable Goods is much bigger than we thought.

401
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,490
Zhang Fo Ye must have expanded this place

402
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,000
when he was preparing for the war back in those years.

403
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,610
Could it be that the Section of Unredeemable Goods

404
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,850
has really ambushed

405
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,290
the Japanese soldiers who entered here?

406
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,050
Did you hear that?

407
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,730
What sound is that?

408
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,010
There's something off about the sound.

409
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,650
Let's take this way. Come on.

410
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:15,530
Bai.

411
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,090
Bai!

412
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,010
Bai!

413
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:35,770
Bai.

414
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,680
Bai!

415
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,130
Mr. Third Junior,

416
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,810
the sound seems to be coming from there.

417
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,610
Mr. Third Junior!

418
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,130
Bai!

419
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,330
Bai!

420
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:46,930
Bai!

421
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,930
Mr. Third Junior.

422
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,530
I've read lots of accounts about Zhang Qishan

423
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,130
in my grandpa's Grave Robbery Notes.

424
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,690
For example, there is one account

425
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,650
which says

426
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:22,050
a black Japanese military train numbered 076

427
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,490
pulled into the station late at night in 1933.

428
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,810
Mr. Third Junior.

429
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,290
Mr. Third Junior!

430
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,010
Mr. Third Junior!

431
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,290
Could that be true?

432
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,570
All the carriages of the military train

433
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,290
were welded shut with iron sheets.

434
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,440
Blood kept seeping out of the train through the cracks.

435
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,610
Could it really be the Haunted Train No.076

436
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,970
Mr. Third Junior talked about?
