Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,559
Episode 19

4
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,740
Kylin, we can only take our chance.

5
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,940
Okay.

6
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,300
Cover your ears.

7
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,220
Go to hell!

8
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,620
Stop yelling!

9
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,980
You scared me to death!

10
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,700
So ugly and so pretentious.

11
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,900
It's Wu Xie.

12
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,420
When did my hand get hurt?

13
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,420
I didn't realize it at all.

14
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,060
Everyone, check your body.

15
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,700
Even I got hurt.

16
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,780
This wound is weird.

17
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,300
If my guess is right,

18
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,500
the wounds were caused by the edges of these reeds.

19
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,020
These reeds are made of bronze.

20
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,220
Their edges

21
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,140
are as sharp as a scalpel.

22
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,540
You won't even feel the pain when you're cut.

23
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,140
Mr. Jiao.

24
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,580
Judging by the sound,

25
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,340
this tunnel should be very long.

26
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,060
It runs along the entire mountain

27
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,500
connecting the inner part and outer part of Thunder City.

28
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,700
If my guess is right,

29
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,620
the reason why the valley resonated with thunder before was

30
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,060
the large number of reeds

31
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,980
were conducting thunder vibration within the mountain.

32
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,900
This tunnel serves as a sound transmission system.

33
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,460
Hurry up, go further.

34
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,220
Okay.

35
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,140
Let's go. Hurry up.

36
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,940
The damn cicadas were blown up.

37
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,540
Naive, are you alright?

38
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,060
How are you feeling?

39
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,660
Bai.

40
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,980
The shock wave didn't hurt you, did it?

41
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,620
Don't let the shock stop you from growing taller.

42
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,500
Sang.

43
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,780
Liu Sang?

44
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,900
Sang!

45
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,820
Sang!

46
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,100
How is he?

47
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,500
Not good.

48
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,100
That treehopper has gone very deep in his ear.

49
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,860
Kylin, can you do anything to treat it?

50
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,100
Kylin, use your blood!

51
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,460
Insects are afraid of your blood.

52
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,660
My blood is not fatal to them.

53
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,860
So it will only climb deeper and deeper.

54
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,740
If it stays in it,

55
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,140
the insect will

56
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,100
lay eggs and settle down in his ear.

57
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,980
Don't pinch me!

58
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:31,900
Don't pinch me.

59
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,060
Then we can only do it the dumb way.

60
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,980
Insects have phototaxis.

61
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,060
It can lure it out.

62
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,700
It must hurt. Hang in there for a while.

63
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,300
It's out.

64
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,500
I...

65
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,380
It goes even deeper.

66
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,300
It will get into his brain.

67
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,420
How about this?

68
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,060
We can take the risk and try another way.

69
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,180
I saw how the locals

70
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,140
dealt with the Gu worms when I was in Yunnan.

71
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,260
Take an iron stick and burn it to red-hot.

72
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,740
Pierce it under the skin.

73
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,660
The Gu worm will be burnt to death

74
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,860
by that hot iron stick.

75
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,700
This might save his life.

76
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,620
But it's too risky.

77
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,460
Come on.

78
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,460
Try it.

79
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,340
I believe you guys.

80
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,620
Come on.

81
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,660
Bear with me.

82
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,980
Bite the bullet, Liu Sang.

83
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,060
Don't move.

84
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,660
It's coming!

85
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,020
How about now?

86
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,820
Such a big chunk.

87
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,700
Glasses, you can be a good ear picker, too.

88
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,420
Pick my ears too some other time.

89
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,100
Are you okay? Are you feeling better?

90
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,260
How are you feeling now?

91
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,300
Let me tell you,

92
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,500
you owe a lot of people favors now. Take your time to pay them back one by one.

93
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,540
Can you hear me now?

94
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,220
I'm alright.

95
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,580
I listened to figure out the structure here

96
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,740
when you guys detonated the explosives.

97
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,860
You're good.

98
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,860
How is Liu Sang?

99
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,620
His eardrum is badly damaged.

100
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,300
He will lose his hearing

101
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,140
if it's affected by the sound wave again.

102
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,180
I got it.

103
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,220
I checked.

104
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,580
These sound transmission pillars form a huge maze.

105
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,580
Looks like we'll have to stay here for a while.

106
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,380
This place is too big.

107
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,340
There are this kind of "bath house" pillars everywhere.

108
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,260
Mr. Third Junior.

109
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,380
How did it go?

110
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,980
This is a topographic map of this place?

111
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,260
Yes.

112
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,060
Fatty.

113
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,300
Detonate again.

114
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,580
Again?

115
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,660
I can figure out the whole place with another explosion.

116
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:49,380
I was the one who said we can't do it again.

117
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:51,260
You'll be deaf if you go through another explosion.

118
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,849
I'll cover one ear.

119
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,140
One good ear is enough for me in everyday life.

120
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,380
Consider the damaged one as my present for you.

121
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,020
I tell you what, Liu Sang.

122
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,780
You don't have to do this.

123
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,260
I still have time.

124
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,700
No, you're running out of time, Wu Xie.

125
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,380
If we still can't find a way out,

126
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,740
in the end you'll still have to rely on my hearing.

127
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,540
And by then I will be completely deaf.

128
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,460
I don't think you want to drag everyone down with you.

129
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,580
And in this way,

130
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,420
we will be even.

131
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,020
You're such a loyal and sincere friend.

132
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,580
Okay. Let's blow it up! How?

133
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,460
He'll be fine.

134
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,460
I know

135
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,740
an excellent otolaryngologist.

136
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,860
Don't worry.

137
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,380
We have a dumb person, a half-blind one,

138
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,180
and a fat one.

139
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,620
When you are really deaf,

140
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,580
you can join us.

141
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,340
By then we can be the Disabled Four.

142
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,300
Since when being fat becomes a disability?

143
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,340
Ready?

144
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,700
Get ready!

145
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,500
Everyone cover your ears except Liu Sang.

146
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,980
I'm going to count to three.

147
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,860
One,

148
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,220
two,

149
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,660
three!

150
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,340
Speed up!

151
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,060
Faster!

152
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,980
Are we badass enough?

153
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,300
Liu Sang!

154
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,460
Liu Sang!

155
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,020
Are you alright?

156
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,180
Can you hear me?

157
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,660
Liu Sang!

158
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,940
Can you listen to me now ?

159
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,660
This is a kind of

160
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,700
sound transmission hole created by the sound transmission pillars in it.

161
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,060
Keep going down this road

162
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,420
until you see a door.

163
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,180
That should be where you are looking for.

164
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,060
You should go.

165
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,420
Let's go.

166
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,100
Bai.

167
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,260
Let's go.

168
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,820
Wu Xie.

169
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,620
I can't carry on anymore.

170
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,860
I'll stay here.

171
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,860
My hearing is seriously damaged.

172
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,540
I'll only be your liability if I follow you guys.

173
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,140
I won't die. I always get lucky.

174
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,580
Liu Sang.

175
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,460
-Just hear me out.  -No. Don't say anything.

176
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,660
Cause I can't hear anything now.

177
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,380
Don't worry about me.

178
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,980
Keep going.

179
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,740
Maybe your Uncle Sanxing is waiting for you ahead.

180
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,020
I'll stay and take care of him.

181
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,540
Don't worry. I can take care of him.

182
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,500
I can take care of myself, too.

183
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,540
Liu Sang is right.

184
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,300
You have to keep going. You can't look back.

185
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,060
Go.

186
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,900
Thunder hearing room.

187
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,820
Here we are.

188
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,540
Yes.

189
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,740
This is it.

190
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,060
We have finally arrived.

191
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,100
That's right. It's here.

192
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,540
Exactly like the mural in the South Sea King's Tomb.

193
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,860
Golden Water Coffin.

194
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,820
Where's it? Let's look for it!

195
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,940
Take a good look everywhere.

196
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,020
After such hard work.

197
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,540
Work...Work brings profits.

198
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,540
Profits...Profits come, and profits go.

199
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,860
Go...Go big or go home.

200
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,380
It has seven ears?

201
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,060
Only this one is a real ear.

202
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,260
I think the other six ears

203
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,620
were curved with a knife.

204
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,100
But such a barbaric custom

205
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,540
is rare in China's Central Plains area.

206
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,900
This ethnic group

207
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,100
should be very enthusiastic followers of sounds.

208
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,380
Where there is a will, there is a way.

209
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,180
Will…

210
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,780
Will you marry me?

211
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,460
You...You have the right to remain silence.

212
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,140
Silence sometimes is gold.

213
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,940
Gold...Golden Water Coffin.

214
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,129
Fatty.

215
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,820
Let me see.

216
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,610
Look.

217
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,100
Seven-ear Mummy.

218
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:34,940
There are four of them here.

219
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,580
Wu Xie.

220
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,160
<i>South Four Human Light</i>

221
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,740
This reminds me of Yang Daguang

222
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,500
and those tapes in his reception office.

223
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,940
Naive, look.

224
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,100
There are joints.

225
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,820
They seem to be reedited.

226
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,060
This is my Uncle Sanxing's handwriting.

227
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,020
These tapes were left by him.

228
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,460
Play one of them.

229
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,460
Thunder.

230
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,060
During this period of time,

231
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,980
I seemed to listen to the share of thunder for my lifetime.

232
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,660
I almost became a thunder god myself.

233
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,580
I finally know

234
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,620
why Uncle Sanxing and Yang Daguang

235
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,140
wanted to listen to thunder.

236
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,980
Because of these texts.

237
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,340
Look.

238
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,300
Fu...Off...Rascal.

239
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,440
<i>Fu Off Rascal</i>

240
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,980
Aren't these some cursing words?

241
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,060
Do you remember the message Uncle Sanxing sent me?

242
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,340
About the weather observation station?

243
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,140
I will

244
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,060
throw away that broken phone your uncle gave you.

245
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,820
He encrypted that text message

246
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,700
in his own way so that only I could understand.

247
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,300
He loved playing this deciphering game with me.

248
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,940
It was his method to train me.

249
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,820
This is Uncle Sanxing's cipher system.

250
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,380
This means "fortune".

251
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,660
Look at this tape.

252
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,740
It means is "pursuit but fail to get".

253
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,700
This is "power".

254
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,380
This one is "fortune". Got it.

255
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,840
<i>Beard Ran Supreme Rich</i>

256
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,280
<i>Fu Off Rascal</i>

257
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,380
I know.

258
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,140
I understand it now.

259
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,020
All the tapes here

260
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,060
are the messages in cipher contained in thunder

261
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,740
which have been translated.

262
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,500
If we want to use the artifact

263
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,140
to realize our wishes,

264
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,060
we have to use thunder's secret messages in cipher to activate it.

265
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,820
These are the cipher?

266
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,740
Yes.

267
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,460
Yes, they're the cipher.

268
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,380
If every section of thunder sounds

269
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,820
can really convey a message,

270
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,980
then it'll be a section of encrypted message

271
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,140
just like our knocking language.

272
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,620
That fake weather observation team asked Yang Daguang

273
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,940
to collect thunder for so many years.

274
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,540
They kept chasing thunder

275
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,980
and tried to come here despite all the challenges.

276
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,180
They definitely were not just going after money.

277
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,940
They really believed the legend.

278
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,860
They really believed that there was a powerful artifact that

279
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,940
could realize people's wishes.

280
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,220
Here is a box of tapes.

281
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,100
They...

282
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,860
They played those cypher here.

283
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,540
If thunder is the cypher,

284
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,340
then they tried playing the tapes

285
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,420
in the purpose of getting that magical artifact.

286
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,060
Your Uncle Sanxing just edited

287
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,940
the thunder material representing different cypher messages

288
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,140
together.

289
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,580
Did they get the artifact in the end?

290
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,660
If they did,

291
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,700
they would have taken

292
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,420
the tapes and the artifact away with them.

293
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,300
But yet, these tapes are still here now,

294
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,900
which can't be good news.

295
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,140
What really can't be good news is that you don't have time to waste.

296
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,180
Bring it on.

297
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,300
We have to try it no matter what will happen.

298
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,140
Play these tapes.

299
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,340
Make some noise!

300
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,900
Let's see if these pillars will make any response.

301
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,940
It won't work.

302
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,620
The power of the recorder is too low.

303
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,420
There is no that bell hanging upside down to amplify the sound.

304
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,980
I guess it's useless to play the thunder.

305
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,140
We'll have to wait for the real thunder.

306
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,140
It will only be activated

307
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,380
when this place transmits thunder.

308
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,180
But there's no time for us to wait for thunder to happen.

309
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
We don't need to wait for thunder.

310
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,940
The point is not the pillars inside.

311
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,780
It's those ones outside.

312
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,340
I specially paid attention.

313
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,980
By knocking on them,

314
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,420
each pillar will make a different sound

315
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,380
which can simulate the sound of thunder.

316
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,620
The ancient people invented a device

317
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,540
that could simulate the sound of thunder with their own methods.

318
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,220
So this way,

319
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,060
even when it's not thundering in Thunder City,

320
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,940
you can also activate the instrument

321
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,860
and use it, but just barely.

322
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,620
Do you still remember the bronze pillars

323
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,860
below the statues at that pagoda cluster?

324
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,060
Those pagodas should be related to thunder.

325
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,500
Look, the top of the pagoda is made of bronze.

326
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,500
This should be used to induce thunder.

327
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,620
This is a bronze pillar.

328
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,020
A device that is used to listen to thunder.

329
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,940
There are ninety-nine pagodas.

330
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,780
And then there are ninety-nine

331
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,940
bronze pillars outside, too.

332
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,260
So the pagodas must be

333
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,580
connected with the bronze pillars.

334
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,220
The bronze pillars are connected here.

335
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,420
So, the artifact should be right here.

336
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,700
When there was no thunder, the ancient people could still

337
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,380
simulate the sound of thunder

338
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,820
to create the frequency they needed

339
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,500
which activated the artifact

340
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,940
by knocking on these pillars.

341
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,420
And so,

342
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,060
as long as we knock on the bronze pillars outside,

343
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,380
they can transmit

344
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,220
the sounds here.

345
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,780
Once they make the right frequency,

346
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,020
the artifact will be activated.

347
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,260
That's a piece of cake, then!

348
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,260
Let's play

349
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,140
the thunder in the tape recorder as a reference,

350
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,860
and then we'll knock on those pillars,

351
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,900
"Fu...Off...Rascal".

352
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,300
Try until we find those pillars with the correct frequency.

353
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,020
That's it!

354
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,700
Not as simple as you think.

355
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,420
There are ninety-nine pillars.

356
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,260
It's hard to knock on them

357
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,380
with the correct frequency.

358
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,340
Even a symphony orchestra can't

359
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,900
always get it right even if it practices for decades.

360
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,500
The ancient people

361
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,940
would never use this way too often.

362
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,580
With the four of us, if we want to practice this instrument

363
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,020
to the degree of proficient,

364
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,580
it probably takes...

365
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,660
Three days?

366
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,660
Three years.

367
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,660
We need to listen to

368
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,580
these crackling sounds for three years?

369
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,980
We gotta go.

370
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,380
Naive can't afford to wait that long.

371
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,580
There is only one way to find out.

372
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,660
Have you heard of resonation?

373
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,300
I'll play the tape.

374
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,020
Bronze pillars of the same frequency

375
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,260
will resonate.

376
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,540
We'll

377
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,220
knock on these resonant pillars as fastest as we can.

378
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,620
If we get lucky,

379
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,460
we may be able to knock out a symphony.

380
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,060
Try a random tape first.

381
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,140
Try this one. It says "truth".

382
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,780
Is it really a reliable method?

383
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,940
Just play the music

384
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,820
as a salute to the unreliable us!

385
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,660
Let's get the party started.

386
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,780
Naive.

387
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,540
That one.

388
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,540
Go!

389
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,020
Thunder City has amplified

390
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,940
the sounds we made into real thunder!

391
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,580
Jiao!

392
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,380
Jiao!

393
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,220
Jiao!

394
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,420
Jiao!

395
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,580
Jiao!

396
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,380
Help me!

397
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,100
Save me.

398
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,780
Jiao!

399
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:02,900
Jiao!

400
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,540
Jiao!

401
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,300
Let's go.

402
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,460
Uncle Sanxing...

403
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,820
Who is it?

404
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,540
Naive.

405
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,340
What did you see?

406
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,100
Uncle Sanxing?

407
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,620
Is this really you?

408
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,300
My successor,

409
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,940
whoever who you are,

410
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,860
you finally came.

411
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,300
Now I will tell you everything that happened to me.

412
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,460
There was a fake weather observation team

413
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,380
who forced me go to a place called Warehouse 11

414
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,420
to get a person out of it.

415
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,060
That person was stored in the section of unredeemable goods of that warehouse as a piece of cargo.

416
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,980
Rumor has it that you can only get in that section, but you will never get out.

417
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,460
No goods can ever be taken out of it.

418
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,420
But in order to save Wenjin from them,

419
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,900
Tian Youjin and I

420
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,700
had to store ourselves in the section too so that

421
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,020
we could find a way to bring him out when we were in there.

422
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,700
Sanxing!

423
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,500
Sanxing!

424
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,940
Sanxing, don't go!

425
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:39,860
Sanxing!

426
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,780
We found that person.

427
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,340
But the treasures in Warehouse 11

428
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,780
triggered Tian Youjin's avarice.

429
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,340
He didn't want to get out of there

430
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,420
and he didn't want me to leave either.

431
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,620
But I just wanted to save Wenjin.

432
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,380
So I spent three years

433
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,220
in which time I tried every means

434
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,140
to get that person out.

435
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,140
But at the same time

436
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,580
I also became interested in listening to thunder.

437
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,180
I found that there may be

438
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,580
an ancient kingdom which had fallen in to history here.

439
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,860
So after I came out of Warehouse 11,

440
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,780
I found my way to get in the fake weather observation team.

441
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,780
There I learned that they had been looking for the South Sea King's Tomb.

442
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,700
It turned out there was an unknown ancient kingdom.

443
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,740
The first person to listen to thunder was the South Sea King.

444
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,100
I beat the fake weather observation team to it

445
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,660
to organize an archaeological team to find it and

446
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,060
entered the tomb.

447
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,020
But what we did

448
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,740
completely infuriated them.

449
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,820
I, Yang Daguang,

450
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,180
and Mu Xuehai

451
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,340
were kidnapped and threatened one by one.

452
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,220
They forced us to study

453
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,300
various cultural relic materials they brought out from the tomb.

454
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,820
Their purpose was to find Thunder City,

455
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,500
which was once the holy land of South Sea Kingdom.

456
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,580
Legend has it that there is an enormous fortune in Thunder City.

457
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,220
Even

458
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,100
the legendary powerful artifact of South Sea King

459
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,260
was also hidden inside

460
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,100
which can reverse one's regrets.

461
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,020
During this process we were looking for it,

462
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,700
Yang Daguang died of illness

463
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,460
and Mu Xuehai went crazy.

464
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,620
In the end, I was the only one who was still alive and sober.

465
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,700
In the end,

466
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,900
we managed to figure out the location of Thunder City.

467
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,500
I was forced to lead the team here.

468
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,100
Thunder City was a very dangerous place.

469
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,980
Everyone who forced me had died in here.

470
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,700
They came here for a treasure hunt,

471
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,260
but in the end they only got themselves killed.

472
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,580
I was also seriously injured.

473
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,060
While I was waiting for my doom, I kept thinking about

474
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,660
how my family would think of me

475
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,620
all these years I had been missing.

476
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,980
I was scared.

477
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,780
Go away!

478
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,740
Wu Sanxing!

479
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,220
We can never go back to where we were.

480
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,940
I was afraid Wenjin would never come back to me.

481
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,620
I was afraid that little rascal

482
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,100
would also hate me for walking out of his life without saying goodbye.

483
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,420
I wasted so many years and

484
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,260
I got nothing in return.

485
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,740
I just kept losing things in my life.

486
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,020
Just before I died,

487
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,540
I saw the legendary artifact.

488
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,940
I suddenly wanted to know,

489
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,780
could this artifact really reverse all the past regrets?

490
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,780
So I played

491
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,100
all the messages in cypher contained in thunder

492
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,900
I worked here.

493
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,060
As you can see,

494
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,460
this instrument

495
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,540
should be a device of an unknown ancient civilization

496
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,380
driven by thunder.

497
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,660
Later the South Sea King got it by accident.

498
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,860
It has powerful functions.

499
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,700
For example,

500
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,740
it can control and drive organisms

501
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,380
and even change the structure of organisms.

502
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,500
But its functions don't contain anyone

503
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,900
which can bring me back to the past to live my life again.

504
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,180
So this thing

505
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,860
is meaningless for me.

506
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,010
As a senior of you,

507
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,420
I want to give everyone who has managed to come here a piece of advice.

508
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,490
Trying to reverse the past regret

509
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,060
may cause more regrets.

510
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,530
It's better to cherish the people who're in your life,

511
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,420
and just live in the moment.

512
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,620
Leave here now.

513
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,970
If you can get out and see

514
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,260
my nephew Wu Xie,

515
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,340
please tell him for me that

516
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,420
I hope he can move on with his life

517
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,500
and forget me.

518
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,500
Uncle Sanxing.

519
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,740
Uncle Sanxing, where are you going?

520
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:45,940
Naive.

521
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,380
He is going to die!

522
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,540
The tape!

523
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,820
It's too late.

524
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:00,900
Come on!

525
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,420
Let's try again.

526
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,340
It can reverse all regrets.

527
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,460
What if it can save his life?

528
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,300
What are you doing there just standing? Find it now!

529
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,340
Or it'll be too late! Move!

530
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,420
Which tape?

531
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,380
Which tape?

532
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,860
Which one is the right one?

533
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,020
Shi Lai Mi Ru...

534
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,500
What is this?

535
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,460
This one!

536
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,940
Listen to the thunder carefully here.

537
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,540
Let's go out and knock on the pillars.

538
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,660
Listen here

539
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,620
Don't go anywhere.

540
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,140
Go!

541
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,580
Uncle Sanxing.

542
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,420
I am not afraid of death.

543
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,980
It's just that leaving with my loved ones

544
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,420
is so painful.

545
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,460
Thank you, my friends

546
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,700
who have accompanied me here going through hell.

547
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,220
It's not worth it risking your life for a dying person like me.

548
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,900
I'm afraid I can't repay your kindness

549
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,620
in this life.

550
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,700
I only hope

551
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,180
we can still be friends in my next life.

552
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,420
Because of my obsession,

553
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,460
I have hurt a lot of people in my life.

554
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,580
Many people died

555
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,340
one by one because of me.

556
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,300
Yet I didn't know what I did was wrong.

557
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,820
But when I have come to this age,

558
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,180
I have realized that

559
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,860
maybe that's just how life is.

560
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,980
Ups and downs, accepting it or not,

561
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,580
you just move forward in a spiral.

562
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,340
Life is a cycle.

563
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,900
No one can escape such destiny.

564
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,580
I thought I won't have regrets when I leave this world.

565
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,540
But it's not true.

566
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,940
I still can't leave this world calmly.

567
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,300
I am still reluctant to leave this world.

568
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,260
I had been a coward

569
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,780
when I just embarked on my journey of adventure at the beginning.

570
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,660
Many people were protecting me at that time.

571
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,420
As they left me one by one,

572
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,700
I had to protect myself.

573
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,180
So at this last moment,

574
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,380
just let me go back to that

575
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,820
innocent and naive young man.

576
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,060
This is the best ending for me.

577
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,580
Goodbye.

578
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,740
My friends.

579
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,220
There are footsteps.

580
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,260
But not Mr. Third Junior and the rest two.

581
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,460
Maybe Mr. Jiao's people also came here.

582
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,220
We must leave here immediately.

583
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,500
Jiang Zisuan?
