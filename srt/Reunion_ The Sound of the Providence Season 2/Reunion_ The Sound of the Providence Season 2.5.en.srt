Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,329
Episode 5

4
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,139
Red-capped Daffodil

5
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,690
can remain in the water for as long as he likes,

6
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,250
because he's very good at swimming.

7
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,620
Nice to meet you, my internet friend.

8
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,090
Reddy.

9
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,050
Fatty.

10
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,130
What have you been up to recently?

11
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,290
You haven't been very active on the internet

12
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,170
I've been busy.

13
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,530
Let me introduce someone to you.

14
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,450
You can just call him Wang.

15
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,730
Wang?

16
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,700
No, no.

17
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,370
I'm Wang Meng.

18
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,810
Nice to meet you.

19
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,100
Welcome.

20
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,410
You look quite

21
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,850
different from your profile photo.

22
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,730
My profile photo?

23
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:24,580
It was slightly Photoshopped.

24
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:31,450
Excuse me, sirs.

25
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,610
Smoking is prohibited here.

26
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,540
How about having some milk tea?

27
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,540
Get them two cups of Xiangpiaopiao Milk Tea,

28
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,420
red bean flavor, please.

29
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,330
Get four more cups.

30
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,060
Six cups in total, please.

31
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:40,620
OK.

32
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,530
Thank you.

33
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,780
I told you clearly

34
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,020
on the internet

35
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,810
that I've quit my old job now.

36
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,380
I just wanted to take you out

37
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,220
to meet my friends.

38
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,100
I always talk about you in front of them.

39
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,810
Give them a chance to meet you.

40
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,370
Hold on.

41
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,210
Wu Xie asked you to come here, didn't he?

42
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,300
How did you know?

43
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,850
Speaking of Wu Xie,

44
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:05,180
he's like a brother to me,

45
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,690
I must take you to meet him.

46
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,380
As I never

47
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,260
hung out with you guys before,

48
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,660
I wouldn't have known these things.

49
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,220
But the other day, someone came to me

50
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,740
and said Wu Xie was going to send somebody here to ask for my help.

51
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,860
That person told me not to offer my help,

52
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,820
because Wu Xie's going to die soon.

53
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,490
He told me your business is going to bust.

54
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,980
Who said that?

55
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,420
Mr. Xue.

56
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,580
Mr. Xue?

57
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,940
Since Mr. Xue is doing great

58
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,340
at the moment,

59
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,940
I must take his words seriously.

60
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,900
As to what kind of person Wu Xie was,

61
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,090
I wasn't sure.

62
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,460
Because Mr. Xue asked for my favor,

63
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,540
I checked Wu Xie's background,

64
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,260
and found out he's indeed a someone.

65
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,660
That said, I still

66
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,220
can't help you.

67
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,140
If you think about it

68
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,260
from my perspective,

69
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,500
I can't afford to offend Mr. Xue.

70
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,900
You can afford to offend me then?

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,020
If you're offended,

72
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,660
I can delete you in my contact list, my internet friend.

73
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,220
To be honest,

74
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,340
under the current situation,

75
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,380
no one dares to accept this job.

76
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,860
The first person to

77
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,590
accept this job

78
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,230
will get punished by Mr. Xue.

79
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,060
I don't want to be that person.

80
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,750
Which person do you want to be then?

81
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,860
Shut up.

82
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,740
Reddy,

83
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,420
listen,

84
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,180
we're friends, aren't we?

85
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,020
Since you know why I've come here,

86
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,220
I'll stop beating about the bush.

87
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,820
Look,

88
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:22,460
I hate to bother you,

89
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,939
but I've really run out of options.

90
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:26,300
A friend of mine is trapped in the Roaring Spring.

91
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,260
Only you can save him.

92
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,460
Come on.

93
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,180
I'll pay you RMB 200,000 upfront.

94
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,790
Two hundred thousand?

95
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,150
Keep a low profile.

96
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,259
Let's do this without anyone knowing it.

97
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,870
Two hundred thousand!

98
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,490
Hong.

99
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,009
Here.

100
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,600
The two ladies are leaving.

101
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,100
Don't hurry.

102
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,740
Come on, drink the Xiangpiaopiao Milk Tea before leaving.

103
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,750
You stay at here.

104
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,080
Please drink the milk tea.

105
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,700
Drink the milk tea before leaving. Come on.

106
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,170
Why does he know everything?

107
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:00,870
One cup for one person.

108
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,570
No, thanks.

109
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,230
Come on.

110
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,810
Here, here.

111
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,480
They are leaving.

112
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,150
Ms. Chu,

113
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,260
sorry about this treatment.

114
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,670
Here we meet again.

115
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,950
What do you want?

116
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,710
You've finally started talking!

117
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,630
Great!

118
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,350
I've got something nice for you.

119
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,030
It's specially made for you,

120
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,030
cobra soup.

121
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,509
Cobras are venomous,

122
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,150
but they taste good.

123
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,550
The soup can help clear the heat and remove toxics in your body.

124
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,750
Since you've just had an operation,

125
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,320
this soup will do you a lot of good.

126
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,590
How amazing!

127
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,160
You've even started to speak now.

128
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,990
The doctor's amazing!

129
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,030
You'd been stalking me?

130
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,830
I didn't want to disturb you.

131
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,880
So I chose the right moment

132
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,870
to invite you here.

133
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,880
Mr. Jiao,

134
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,230
I don't have what you want.

135
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,830
Let me go.

136
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,160
I told you

137
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,360
I'm a reasonable person.

138
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,440
I treat people with courtesy.

139
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,400
If you want to leave, it's dead easy,

140
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,720
as long as you promise me one thing.

141
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,760
Your boyfriend

142
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,590
and those people found a map near that subterranean river.

143
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,800
The map is very important to me.

144
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,240
As long as you ask him

145
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,590
to copy that map for me,

146
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,320
I'll set you free.

147
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,110
But

148
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,120
I haven't seen him since I left the Dumb Village.

149
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,840
So I really don't know where he is.

150
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,360
Keep your head still.

151
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,010
I can wait.

152
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,200
Take your time to think about it.

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,280
I can wait.

154
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,120
Whenever you're ready to talk,

155
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,570
just let me know.

156
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,759
OK.

157
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,090
That's it.

158
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,650
I'm feeling much better.

159
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,680
I'll check out at the hospital tomorrow.

160
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,880
You just

161
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,410
worried about Kylin and Uncle Erbai so much

162
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,600
that you got ill.

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,710
Why is it so expensive to hire people now?

164
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,160
I can't believe we need to

165
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,710
get RMB 500,000 just to hire Reddy.

166
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,640
Well, as you said,

167
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,650
the Brilliance Auto

168
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,900
have been uploaded

169
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,640
to the 58.com used car market.

170
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,350
Has it been sold?

171
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,640
No, but there are many people left comments,

172
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,220
and I predict it will be sold soon.

173
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,980
Hello?

174
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,610
Hello.

175
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,200
Did you

176
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,150
sell a Brilliance Auto on 58.com?

177
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,650
Yes.

178
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,790
Can it be cheaper?

179
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,740
That's the lowest price.

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,560
The price is honest because we sincerely want to sell it.

181
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,540
Can you make it 5,000 cheaper?

182
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,650
Someone wants to buy the car.

183
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,010
5,000.

184
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,500
We can't agree with this price. As you can see,

185
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,950
we took good care of this car,

186
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,860
and the oil filter has just been changed.

187
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,050
Even the brake pads,

188
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,200
tire…

189
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,740
Fatty.

190
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,300
Could the price be a little higher?

191
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,360
Wait a minute, my boss will talk to you.

192
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,210
Hello, we won't sell it.

193
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,100
Why?

194
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,010
The man was on the point of agreeing.

195
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,020
I don't want to sell it.

196
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,620
I am not willing to sell my van to them.

197
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,060
Anyway, it has gone through so many battles with us, right?

198
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,990
It is like our comrade-in-arms.

199
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,100
It's like my white dragon horse to me.

200
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,250
I abandon it

201
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,880
at the last step, am I righteous?

202
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,760
I know, you are really a righteous man.

203
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,770
Let me tell you, Fatty.

204
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,100
We must get this done and dusted in no time.

205
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,260
We've got 5 hours left before dark.

206
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,500
We need to get the money ready

207
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,410
as soon as possible.

208
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,050
I know!

209
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,730
I can't wait to see Kylin, either.

210
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,410
The three of us must be together.

211
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,370
You guys can't just leave me alone.

212
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,170
If I'm the only one left,

213
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,690
what am I supposed to do?

214
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,460
What is a legend?

215
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,970
A legend that lasts forever

216
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,490
is a real legend,

217
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,370
isn't it?

218
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,690
Any news about Mr. Xue?

219
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,530
I heard that his daughter is suddenly getting married.

220
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,730
I guess he wants to seize the chance

221
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,890
to finalize his take-over of the Wu Family.

222
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,570
About this,

223
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:30,970
since you're smart

224
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,020
and good with numbers,

225
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,850
please take the trouble

226
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,340
to work it out.

227
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,010
It doesn't matter if I'm good with numbers or not.

228
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,060
It's important you get the money ready.

229
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,890
Got it.

230
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,580
Be careful.

231
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,190
<i>2 Day 13:07:15</i>

232
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,580
Have a look.

233
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,970
Raise it a bit more, please.

234
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,610
RMB 400 at most.

235
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,610
RMB 400 isn't even enough to cover my cost.

236
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,850
I've decorated the shop

237
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,380
Mr. Third Junior asked me to find.

238
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,020
Now that we have a shop, we can start doing business.

239
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,930
Well done. I didn't expect you'd be so efficient.

240
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,570
I'll drop by your shop after I get my delivery.

241
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,900
While it's easy to open a shop,

242
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,220
it's hard to run it.

243
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,050
You must ask a professional for help.

244
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,770
One of my titles is the "Start-up Guru".

245
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,970
How about hiring me?

246
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,100
How come you have so many titles?

247
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,290
Because I'm smart.

248
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,570
Today, I'm going to give you a

249
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,450
VIP one-to-one session.

250
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,970
Little Wushanju shop opening promotion.

251
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,080
<i>Green Moon Pavilion, also known as "Little Wushanju"</i>

252
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,460
<i>Our antiques are in better condition than those of the Wushanju</i>

253
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,140
10% off all items.

254
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,380
<i>For any fake item, a compensation worth ten times the price of the fake will be available</i>

255
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,020
Little Wushanju?

256
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:33,930
Little Wushanju shop opening promotion.

257
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,030
<i>Green Moon Pavilion, also known as "Little Wushanju"</i>

258
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,020
10% off all items.

259
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,050
<i>Our antiques are in better condition than those of the Wushanju</i>

260
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,780
All our items are in perfect condition.

261
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,300
Little Wushanju?

262
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,580
How dare they!

263
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,700
Little Wushanju shop opening promotion.

264
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,500
10% off all items.

265
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,540
Let's check it out.

266
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,500
Welcome.

267
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,510
You like this one?

268
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,660
It has almost zero defect.

269
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,100
It's in very good condition.

270
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,460
But it doesn't look special.

271
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,500
It's indeed not an ancient item,

272
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,220
but it's made in a royal kiln.

273
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,340
It will definitely fetch a good price from those who appreciate its value.

274
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,420
A royal kiln?

275
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,820
How did you know that?

276
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,660
This isn't something an ordinary person is able to notice.

277
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,070
Another one of my titles

278
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,510
is the "Antique Identification Guru".

279
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,420
Come over and look.

280
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,230
From these craze lines,

281
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,740
you can see

282
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,630
the porcelain body

283
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,860
has an iron gray hue which is typical of royal kiln porcelain bodies.

284
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,300
Those made in the folk kilns are white.

285
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,300
Can you see it?

286
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,300
Can you see it?

287
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,700
I can't.

288
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,420
That's normal.

289
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,420
You definitely can't see it.

290
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,910
Let me show you an example.

291
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,550
My skin color indicates a royal kiln.

292
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,190
Yours indicates a folk kiln.

293
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,220
Because folk kiln porcelain bodies are white.

294
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,190
Folk kiln porcelain wares look nicer.

295
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,150
Of course.

296
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,270
But royal kiln porcelain wares are expensive.

297
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,350
This is the difference between you and me.

298
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:15,990
Got it?

299
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,310
How about taking me as your master

300
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,230
to learn from me?

301
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,590
You have wasted your time in Warehouse 11,

302
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,220
you know?

303
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,390
You have potential.

304
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,150
Look, this one is exactly the same.

305
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,500
A pair will fetch an even better price.

306
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,500
What's wrong?

307
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,790
What's the matter?

308
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,020
Well, well, well,

309
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,980
look what they've done.

310
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,510
I nearly fell for their trick.

311
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,350
This

312
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,990
is a fake.

313
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,350
This one is authentic for sure.

314
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,940
Later on, buy

315
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,750
this one

316
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,590
for RMB 100,000.

317
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,430
Don't raise the price.

318
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,950
Let's make a profit out of this.

319
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,550
We may save one day's time.

320
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,740
Grab it now, grab it.

321
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,310
Hold it.

322
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,150
Welcome.

323
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,940
Don't touch it.

324
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,110
Don't touch it.

325
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,870
It's OK.

326
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,750
Don't touch it.

327
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,270
It's OK.

328
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:19,670
You may damage it.

329
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,660
I like it.

330
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,750
It's OK. Take it if you like.

331
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:22,790
You are

332
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,950
really experts.

333
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:24,910
You've

334
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,230
picked the most precious item in my shop.

335
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,630
What

336
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,870
an ordinary vase!

337
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,630
Are you sure it's the best in your shop?

338
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,560
You're the owner, aren't you?

339
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,350
Don't try to fool us.

340
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,310
My boss likes this vase.

341
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,270
I don't see why she

342
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,910
picked this one among all the others.

343
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,550
-Why this one?
-Because I like this one.

344
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,040
There are so many others.

345
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,830
Why do you like this one in particular? It's so ugly!

346
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,470
It's OK.

347
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,440
The owner says it's the best one.

348
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,000
Exactly.

349
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,520
But that doesn't mean it suits you.

350
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,310
What?

351
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,230
I just like this one.

352
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,950
You don't like any other one?

353
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,430
No!

354
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,550
Fair enough.

355
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,430
Go talk with him yourself.

356
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,190
Young lady, how do I address you?

357
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,390
My surname is Bai.

358
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:00,710
Ms. Bai,

359
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,440
the vase in your hands

360
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,960
is an imitation of Ge wares made during the Reign of Emperor Qianlong.

361
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:05,990
Do you like it?

362
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,990
I do.

363
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,680
It's made in a royal kiln, right?

364
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,760
Ms. Bai, you're really an expert.

365
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,670
Porcelain wares from the royal kilns are very valuable.

366
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,870
I bought this pair of vases

367
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,310
from a family who had seen better days.

368
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,790
Their ancestors

369
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,960
were nobles of the Eight Banners.

370
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,960
Although this vase

371
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,750
doesn't come with a seal,

372
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,800
it used to be placed in the mansion of a noble family.

373
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,470
That's why I like it.

374
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,200
Exactly.

375
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,350
I can see you really like it,

376
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,550
so I'll give you a bargain.

377
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,390
I bought this pair

378
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,590
for RMB 190,000.

379
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
I won't charge you too much.

380
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,160
RMB 200,000 for a pair.

381
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,040
What do you say?

382
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,400
I just like this one,

383
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,950
and I'll only buy one.

384
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,830
How about RMB 100,000 for one?

385
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,840
What do you think?

386
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,280
You only like this one?

387
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,000
Fine.

388
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,200
I'll sell it to you

389
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,720
as you're the first customer

390
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,840
in my shop.

391
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,280
Thanks.

392
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,000
OK. I'll sell this one to you.

393
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:08,710
OK.

394
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,990
Ms. Bai,

395
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,719
look carefully,

396
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,199
I'm packing this up for you.

397
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:19,640
Wait.

398
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,600
Boss,

399
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,719
I think this one is better.

400
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:27,949
Have a look. How about we buy this one?

401
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,120
Let me take a look.

402
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
This one does look better.

403
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,680
I'll take this one.

404
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,090
Guys,

405
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,360
you surely know

406
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,930
the rules of transactions.

407
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,640
She initially liked this one.

408
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,520
This one is more expensive than

409
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,840
RMB 100,000.

410
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,680
Aren't these two the same?

411
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,560
Exactly.

412
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,200
My boss did say she liked that one,

413
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,650
but now she likes this one.

414
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,200
Yes.

415
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,480
Well, you have decided to buy this one,

416
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,440
you can't go back on your word.

417
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,880
I'm telling you,

418
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,890
if I reveal

419
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,240
who she really is,

420
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,850
it'll scare the hell out of you.

421
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,720
I'm sure you're a smart guy.

422
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,690
Don't play innocent with me.

423
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,040
Let's strike a deal.

424
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,480
For this pair of vases,

425
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,560
I don't care if they're authentic or fake,

426
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,320
we'll take them for RMB 100,000.

427
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,050
Great.

428
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,570
In this way,

429
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,960
you can't fool anyone else with them.

430
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,650
Well...

431
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,120
Don't waste my time.

432
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:30,690
See?

433
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,810
Boss, calm down.

434
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,360
She likes this one. If you don't sell it to her,

435
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
she'll smash both of them

436
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,160
on the street.

437
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,880
Then everyone will know

438
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,760
they're fake.

439
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,730
Do you think you can continue

440
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,370
doing business here?

441
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,280
I bought this authentic one

442
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,360
for RMB 200,000.

443
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,120
You're just bullying me.

444
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,610
Did I hear you wrong?

445
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,520
This is the authentic one.

446
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,770
Then this one is a fake?

447
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:54,970
A fake?

448
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,210
The owner

449
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,290
sells fake items.

450
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,290
Keep it down. Keep it down.

451
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,760
You're proud of selling fakes?

452
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,720
Keep it down.

453
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,330
I'll pack them up for you, OK?

454
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,090
I really shouldn't have let you in.

455
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,200
Fine. Fine. Fine.

456
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,880
Just leave.

457
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,850
Don't forget to pay RMB 100,000.

458
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,330
They're yours.

459
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,210
I know you're smart.

460
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,360
I'm doing you a favor.

461
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,570
Otherwise, you may make a bigger mistake.

462
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,290
Do you understand?

463
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,970
In the future,

464
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,560
we'll come back to your shop

465
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,360
and buy more items from you.

466
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,090
Forget it. Just pay and leave.

467
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,370
<i>Hao's Antique Shop</i>

468
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,000
Hao's Antique Shop.

469
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,290
What an awesome name!

470
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:41,930
Let's go inside then.

471
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:42,690
Let's go.

472
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:49,730
Not bad.

473
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,300
I know.

474
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,730
It looks very similar to Wushanju.

475
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,930
For Mr. Third Junior's convenience,

476
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,290
I arranged the furniture and decorations

477
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,250
in a similar way to Wushanju,

478
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,730
but it still can't compare with Wushanju.

479
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,330
You're really thoughtful.

480
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,090
No wonder you're a die-hard fan of his.

481
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,490
A loyal fan.

482
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,530
Now can you tell

483
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,530
which one is authentic?

484
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,370
I can't.

485
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,250
Let's take it out.

486
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,850
It's indeed hard for an ordinary person to tell the difference.

487
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,820
Let me take a look.

488
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,420
This is it.

489
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,500
Take pictures of it.

490
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,970
This one is authentic?

491
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,410
Take pictures of it.

492
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,260
I'll add you to the group chat,

493
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,490
so you can sell it there.

494
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,980
I'd better stay out of this.

495
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,180
Let's work together secretively.

496
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,010
Don't offer a price.

497
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,770
You got it?

498
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,900
Get them interested first.

499
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,050
Just say it's an imitation of Ge wares made during the Reign of Emperor Qianlong

500
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,060
in a royal kiln.

501
00:20:59,130 --> 00:20:59,450
Got it.

502
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,980
<i>An imitation of Ge wares made during the Reign of Emperor Qianlong in a royal kiln</i>

503
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,650
I've sent out the information.

504
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:13,700
Good.

505
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,900
Fatty.

506
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,060
I still don't understand.

507
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,010
How did you

508
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,820
tell which one's fake and which one's authentic

509
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,340
by just one look?

510
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,100
It's all about the bubbles.

511
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,540
It's all about the bubbles?

512
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,970
Porcelain wares in imitation of Ge wares in the Qing Dynasty

513
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,340
attached importance to

514
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,900
the texture of the glaze

515
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,620
which resembled that of butter.

516
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,900
Bubbles and craze lines

517
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,100
weren't valued.

518
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,020
Take a look with a magnifying glass.

519
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,740
Have a look.

520
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,420
Can you see it?

521
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,140
There are bubbles, aren't there?

522
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,700
Yes.

523
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,020
But the bubbles are sparse,

524
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,300
which are totally different from

525
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,380
those on the fake vase.

526
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,940
Now look at this one.

527
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,660
Look at this one.

528
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,340
Can you see?

529
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,220
These bubbles are more densely packed than those on the other vase, aren't they?

530
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,340
Yes.

531
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,020
These are more densely packed.

532
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,620
Why?

533
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,980
Because this one is in imitation of the Ge wares

534
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,500
in the Song Dynasty.

535
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,540
You got it?

536
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,260
I got it.

537
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,540
Just remember

538
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,980
the one with more bubbles

539
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,420
is fake.

540
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,580
The one with more bubbles is fake.

541
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,020
The one with less bubbles is authentic.

542
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,430
The one with less bubbles is expensive.

543
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,990
That's it.

544
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,780
Let me tell you,

545
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,340
we don't sell fakes,

546
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,300
otherwise this pair will fetch a great price.

547
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,260
Someone's made an offer.

548
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,220
Let me see. I can see it on my phone, too.

549
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,190
RMB 500,000. Shall we sell it?

550
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,860
To be honest, this is a decent offer.

551
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,230
It's almost at the top limit.

552
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,380
Don't accept the offer.

553
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,100
Tell him to come here

554
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,190
in person and talk.

555
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,180
If no one offers a higher price,

556
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:45,830
we'll sell it to him.

557
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,030
Ask him to come to Hao's Antique Shop.

558
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,420
Yes.

559
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,110
OK.

560
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,720
<i>Bai Haotian Would you sell it for RMB 500,000?</i>

561
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:50,900
Sent.

562
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,690
<i>Laoliu Come to Hao's Antique Shop to talk</i>

563
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,840
<i>Bai Haotian OK</i>

564
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,180
Hello?

565
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,740
Am I talking to Wang Yueban?

566
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,470
Speaking.

567
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,790
I'm calling from your local police station.

568
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,110
Is Ye Piaopiao your friend?

569
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,430
What's the matter?

570
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,830
Your friend had a fight with someone in a hair salon

571
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,860
and got seriously injured

572
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,910
and is now in A&E at the hospital.

573
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,820
You'd better hurry up.

574
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,380
OK, I got it.

575
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,630
Thank you. Thank you.

576
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:10,780
What's happened, Fatty?

577
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,220
I've got to deal with something urgent.

578
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,420
What's happened?

579
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,470
The guy is coming soon, right?

580
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,980
Hide the fake away now.

581
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:18,310
This one.

582
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,110
Hold it tight.

583
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,020
Is the one with more bubbles authentic or fake?

584
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,710
Fake.

585
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,070
Hide the fake away now.

586
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,710
You understand?

587
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,100
OK.

588
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,180
When that guy comes,

589
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,590
try to keep him

590
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,870
until I come back.

591
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,190
When I come back, I'll smash the fake one on live streaming.

592
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,580
Got it.

593
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,060
<i>2 Day 07:14:35</i>

594
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,980
Anyone inside?

595
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,870
Coming.

596
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,020
Are you Laoliu?

597
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:00,830
You're the owner?

598
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,670
Yes.

599
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:02,910
You're so young.

600
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,320
I thought all

601
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,150
antique shop owners are old guys.

602
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,790
Please come inside.

603
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,030
The item is inside.

604
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,270
Answer my call.

00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,030

I'm so worried.

00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,250
<i>Piaopiao</i>

609
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,400
Why doesn't she answer my call?

610
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,830
Calm down.

611
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,190
She's going to be fine.

612
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,280
Gorgeous!

613
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,030
The more I look at it, the more I like it.

614
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,880
Look at the craze lines.

615
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:47,790
Ms. Bai,

616
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,310
how come there's another one here?

617
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,430
This one is not for sale.

618
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,440
I'm just taking a look at it.

619
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,590
It's not for sale. Not for sale.

620
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,350
Just let me take a look at it.

621
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,600
You're so sly.

622
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,990
They obviously make a pair.

623
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,110
Fabulous.

624
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,630
I came here with cash

625
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,270
hoping this purchase would bring me good luck.

626
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,710
I didn't expect that you have a pair of vases.

627
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,640
It's double good luck.

628
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,280
How about this?

629
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,150
I'll have my men bring here another RMB 500,000.

630
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,200
I'll take

631
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,470
both of them.

632
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,720
I'm so sorry.

633
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,080
I love these vases too.

634
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,920
I'll keep one of them for myself.

635
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,680
What?

636
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,920
You think I can't afford them?

637
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,080
No, no.

638
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,760
How about you reconsider it?

639
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,040
I'm so sorry.

640
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,470
It's really not for sale.

641
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,510
What a pity.

642
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:04,880
Fine.

643
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,720
A single vase is not bad.

644
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,950
It's unique.

645
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,800
Right.

646
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,960
But, Ms. Bai,

647
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,480
you need to allow me to select and take

648
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,120
the better one that I'm more satisfied with.

649
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,280
Is it OK?

650
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,560
Sure.

651
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,040
I'm bringing you a magnifier.

652
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,080
No need.

653
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,320
As a professional, I always take my tools with me.

654
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,160
Beautiful.

655
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,360
Look at

656
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,640
the crazing and the gold line.

657
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,720
Isn't it delicate?

658
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,650
Look.

659
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,810
The one with more bubbles is authentic or fake?

660
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,640
Fake.

661
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,120
Well...

662
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,090
You have a good eye for it.

663
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,680
I bought this pair of vases

664
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,280
from the poor guy in the north.

665
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,570
His family used to be under a plain banner of the Eight Banners.

666
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,120
He has a large collection of treasures from the palace in the past.

667
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,530
Almost all of those treasures have been sold,

668
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,800
except for this pair of vases.

669
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,320
I have a suggestion for you.

670
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,160
This one's quality is superior.

671
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,400
Look.

672
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,970
Then I have to take a close look at it.

673
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,770
You're right.

674
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,440
Look at the double crackle.

675
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,370
Isn't it better?

676
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,650
Trust me. This one is absolutely better.

677
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,240
Indeed.

678
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,610
These lines do look better.

679
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:41,890
See?

680
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,600
Ms. Bai.

681
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,170
You're quite honest as a businesswoman.

682
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,000
Nowadays, it's uncommon to see someone

683
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:48,850
doing business the way you do.

684
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:52,650
Fine.

685
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,920
I'll take this one.

686
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,360
If you've made up your mind, I'll wrap it up for you.

687
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,520
Actually,

688
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,090
I have a rule for buying antiques.

689
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,290
I want you to sign a contract.

690
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,450
As you know,

691
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,440
there're many traps and tricks in this industry.

692
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,890
If I bought a fake piece

693
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,370
without any legal protection,

694
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,050
I'd suffer a huge loss.

695
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,290
No problem.

696
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,730
Hao's Antique Shop

697
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,090
never sells fake pieces.

698
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,050
Great.

699
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,050
I like doing business

700
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,570
with someone as decisive as you.

701
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,250
Let's sign it.

702
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,570
Come on. Let's sign it.

703
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,250
Ms. Bai, if you have any other good piece later,

704
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,730
please inform me.

705
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,490
Sure.

706
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,490
Uncle Fatty?

707
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:46,610
Where's your mother?

708
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,690
Was there anyone making trouble here?

709
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,130
Wait. Where's the ambulance?

710
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,570
What ambulance?

711
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,330
My mom said she had to spend a day away from home attending to something.

712
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,700
She hasn't come back yet.

713
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:56,770
What's going on?

714
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,370
I've been set up.

715
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,890
Stay home and take care of yourself.

716
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,140
Call me once your mother comes back.

717
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,140
You can also call me as long as you need help.

718
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:11,740
Haotian!

719
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,090
Haotian!

720
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,010
Where's the vase?

721
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,370
I've sold it. Look.

722
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:17,730
You've sold it?

723
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,860
Bring me the other one. Hurry. Let me check it.

724
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:20,860
Hurry.

725
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,890
Do you know that?

726
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,020
Hardly had you left when they arrived.

727
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:25,700
I didn't even have time

728
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,250
to put away this vase.

729
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,010
They were this close to picking the fake one.

730
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:30,890
Fortunately,

731
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,180
they picked the real one in the end.

732
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,020
What?

733
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,580
You were wrong.

734
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,220
Wrong? That's impossible!

735
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,250
Take a look and see for yourself.

736
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,300
Look. Look. Look.

737
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,100
Look at it.

738
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,380
What happened just now?

739
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,650
What happened exactly?

740
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,220
Beautiful.

741
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,700
Perfect.

742
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,810
It's indeed a good piece.

743
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,450
That's impossible.

744
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:10,700
In the beginning, he said

745
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,890
that he wanted to buy both of the vases.

746
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,900
I refused.

747
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,700
I said I had to keep one for myself.

748
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,660
Then I took a close look at it.

749
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,180
I checked it under a magnifier.

750
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,140
This vase's bubbles are more densely-distributed.

751
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,860
I intentionally sold them the one with sparsely-distributed bubbles.

752
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,020
How come this one

753
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,020
has now become the one with fewer bubbles?

754
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,500
Which magnifier did you use to check it?

755
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,940
Their own one.

756
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,380
We're screwed.

757
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,220
We were set up.

758
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,060
When we check antiques,

759
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,580
we always use our own devices

760
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,570
instead of other people's.

761
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,980
Otherwise, fraudulent practices will be so easy in that way.

762
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,660
Do you think it's easy to put bubbles in it?

763
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,500
It's very easy.

764
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,100
You can put them wherever you want.

765
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,860
You can make

766
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,900
whatever bubbles you want.

767
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,420
Take this one for example.

768
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,780
If you look at it this way,

769
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,340
the bubbles you see

770
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,940
are actually the ones in his magnifier.

771
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,300
Wherever the magnifier is,

772
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,300
the bubbles will always be there.

773
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,220
Do you understand?

774
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,860
Yeah, I get it.

775
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,740
But I don't understand

776
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,140
why he tried so hard buying a fake vase.

777
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,780
What else did he do?

778
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,870
What?

779
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,300
They signed a contract with me.

780
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,060
Bring it here. Hurry up.

781
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,960
<i>For any fake item, a compensation worth twice the price of the fake will be available</i>

782
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,480
<i>Party: Bai Haotian</i>

783
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,660
Naive,

784
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,830
come over here right away.

785
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,390
There's something wrong. Hurry up.

786
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,470
Hao's Antique Shop.

787
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,620
Hurry up!

788
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:55,660
<i>Hao's Antique Shop</i>

789
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,100
That's what happened.

790
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,390
Don't worry.

791
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:27,620
Bai,

792
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,230
you just go home.

793
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,580
Leave it to me.

794
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,390
I won't leave.

795
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,590
This is not Warehouse 11.

796
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:40,990
Do what I said.

797
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,780
I'm driving you home first.

798
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:43,950
Fatty.

799
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,430
So it turns out to be you.

800
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,590
You're here to get beaten up, again.

801
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,640
What's your problem?

802
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,030
We're all doing legal business.

803
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,670
Are you trying to tell me that I'm not welcome here?

804
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,680
Laoliu

805
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,590
We've known each other for a while.

806
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,430
Look at you.

807
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,150
You want me to believe you're doing legal business?

808
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,910
You look like a law-abiding man.

809
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,240
Then why do you sell fake antiques?

810
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,350
What fake antique?

811
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,510
You used a modified magnifier.

812
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,550
Little rascal,

813
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,070
you're being rude.

814
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
Do you have any evidence?

815
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,830
I have.

816
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,990
I've got the contract.

817
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,150
You sold me the vase

818
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,630
and signed the contract.

819
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,590
I bought it from you.

820
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,190
Having signed the contract, you shouldn't deny it.

821
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,360
Pay me compensation.

822
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,070
Give it to him.

823
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,830
Give him the money.

824
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,440
Wu Xie.

825
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,080
The amount seems to be wrong.

826
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,550
We've made it clear in the contract

827
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,870
that the compensation for the fake piece should double the price.

828
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,750
Right?

829
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,830
Do I really need to beat you up

830
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,880
so that you can get it?

831
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,910
Don't play with me.

832
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:16,790
I'm offering you another opportunity.

833
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,549
I'm pretending that you took the wrong one unintentionally.

834
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,720
I've given you the money. Take it and leave.

835
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,640
Fatty.

836
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,110
So you do have a real piece here?

837
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,640
You should've told me about that earlier.

838
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,310
Right?

839
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,600
Now you've ended up

840
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,839
creating such a misunderstanding, haven't you?

841
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,509
Now that you have the real one, bring it here.

842
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,120
Bring it here.

843
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,000
If you give it to me, I'll give up the fake one.

844
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,150
It makes sense to pay you a compensation that doubles the price.

845
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,239
No problem.

846
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,600
It makes sense.

847
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,759
Look at you.

848
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,680
We're all in this business.

849
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,190
Be less greedy so that you won't get into tremendous trouble.

850
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,960
I'm warning you.

851
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,200
See it clearly for yourself.

852
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,760
Now that I've given you this one,

853
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,880
give us back the one we sold you earlier.

854
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,280
Deal.

855
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
I'll bring it to you.

856
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,400
Wait.

857
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,050
You sold a fake antique to me!

858
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,520
Hao's Antique Shop swindles its customers!

859
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,770
Come and take a look.

860
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,680
Hao's Antique Shop sells fake antiques.

861
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,120
You're lying. You cheated us.

862
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,520
We've given you the real vase

863
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,490
and given you back your money.

864
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,040
You guys have taken the real vase.

865
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:45,800
What do you want?

866
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,120
You promised me in person

867
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,730
that your shop had no fake antiques.

868
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,610
Right?

869
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,130
We've signed a contract.

870
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,010
Take a look, guys.

871
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,040
The contract. We've signed the contract.

872
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,680
Look.

873
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,440
Bai Haotian, Hao's Antique Shop.

874
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,760
Take a good look at it. I've got the contract.

875
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,200
Now that you've signed the contract,

876
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,690
you should take the responsibility, right?

877
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,040
The most important thing for me

878
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,810
is the spirit of contract.

879
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,280
Do I make sense, guys?

880
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,560
Today, I'll destroy your shop.

881
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,520
Do I hear it right?

882
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,990
You want to destroy Haotian's shop?

883
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,250
Come and have a try.

884
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,280
Even if Wu Erbai was here,

885
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,970
he would have no excuse.

886
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,680
Laoliu,

887
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,120
let's focus on what's going on right here.

888
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,760
Uncle Erbai's name

889
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,810
isn't what you bastard can talk about casually.

890
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,410
If you dare say his name once again,

891
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,550
I'll beat you up and break your teeth.

892
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,510
Fatty.

893
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,360
We did make a mistake,

894
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,930
Let them in.

895
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,250
You're even boasting your strength.

896
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,450
Don't ever think I'm scared of you.

897
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,210
Guys, destroy their shop!

898
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,490
This is the vase I bought in their shop.

899
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,410
I had no idea that it's fake.

900
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,730
I talked to them, but they didn't admit it.

901
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,850
Just now they even wanted to beat me!

902
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,290
Do you see that? Do you see that?

903
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,330
I've always thought the decoration of your shop isn't good.

904
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,730
Now it's a good chance

905
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,640
for me to redecorate it for you.

906
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,130
Cheer up.

907
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,810
There's nothing good in there.

908
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,330
Anyway, it has saved us some trouble.

909
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,650
He tried so hard to throw it away.

910
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,890
We'll give it back to him later.

911
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,530
We can settle the score

912
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:38,610
with him later on.

913
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,910
<i>2 Day 05:03:31</i>

914
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,020
New antiques won't arrive until the old ones are gone.

915
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,780
I'm the one to blame.

916
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,450
After all, I have a soft spot.

917
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,850
They used Piaopiao to deceive me,

918
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,410
luring me away.

919
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,100
How could I...

920
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,610
Haotian.

921
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,580
Are you trying to report this to the police?

922
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,140
You can't call the police.

923
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,340
Why?

924
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:15,900
Look.

925
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,180
Many of the things they smashed

926
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,010
aren't our goods at all.

927
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,900
These are really not the goods of Hao's Antique Shop.

928
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,820
It looks like they left these here on purpose.

929
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,180
How do you find out?

930
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,340
Do we have such high-quality pieces?

931
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,780
They're expensive.

932
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,980
It looks like Xue Wu

933
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,420
has planned all this mess.

934
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,940
He wants to destroy us.

935
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,660
They've planned this for a long time.

936
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,620
Otherwise, they couldn't have had the heart

937
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,700
to smash such expensive goods.

938
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,140
I think these antiques are probably

939
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,980
involved in some crimes.

940
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,660
For them, it would be nice if the police came here.

941
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,150
They'd be happy if we called the police.

942
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,260
If the police came here seeing so many stolen antiques,

943
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,460
they'd arrest us.

944
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,820
Why are they so evil?!

945
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:04,750
Haotian.

946
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,830
You've spent so much time staying in Warehouse 11

947
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,100
that you can't imagine

948
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,420
how dangerous the outside world is.

949
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,020
Let me tell you.

950
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,100
You're lucky to have met us.

951
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,540
Otherwise,

952
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,900
you wouldn't get into this trouble.

953
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,670
You'll grow up quickly.

954
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,310
I hate you.

955
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,100
Xue Wu clearly

956
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,150
wants to stop our operation.

957
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,590
He always looks like a coward;

958
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,820
I never thought he's so ruthless.

959
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,190
After learning about how his master cared for him,

960
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,660
he regretted so much

961
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,500
and sincerely apologized to his master.

962
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,990
Then he continued to dedicate himself to learning painting.

963
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,140
His master continued to help him as always.

964
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,390
Later,

965
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:45,980
a rogue came to buy paintings

966
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,710
and insisted that his master was selling forgeries.

967
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,620
The master was so irritated that he had cerebral hemorrhage.

968
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,820
Xue Wu tried to talk his master into retiring

969
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,430
and quitting the job.

970
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,710
But the master said Xue Wu was short-tempered

971
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,740
and that he was afraid that Xue Wu would suffer losses if he wasn't around.

972
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,550
Day after day, the master's illness deteriorated

973
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,990
and his health got worse and worse.

974
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,830
Xue Wu was very sad.

975
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,710
In order to have his master treated,

976
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,420
he sold all of the paintings

977
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,910
he had collected.

978
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,790
But he was still short of money.

979
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,750
His master died of the illness.

980
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,070
From then on, Xue Wu started to see

981
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,510
poverty as a terrible thing.

982
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,990
He started to make money at any cost.

983
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,070
He's a poor man.

984
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,710
Those who're evil usually have a sad story about themselves.

985
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,510
There'll be a wedding of Xue Wu's daughter tomorrow.

986
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,230
We need to take our money back.

987
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,910
But the decisive battle will break out the day after tomorrow.

988
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,310
You guys...

989
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,350
Hello.

990
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,030
We're the cleaners you hired through 58.com.

991
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,070
Who hired them?

992
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,310
I hired them through 58.com.

993
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,910
So fast?

994
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,070
Boss.

995
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,980
<i>Open As Usual</i>

996
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,630
<i>Temporarily Closed</i>

997
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,560
Boss.

998
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,400
Has Laoliu come back?

999
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,550
I haven't seen him yet.

1000
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,550
I guess he's afraid there're people tracking him.

1001
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,920
Did Wu Xie call the police?

1002
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:13,560
No.

1003
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,030
I heard that he directly closed the shop.

1004
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,670
He didn't call the police?

1005
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,480
Then he's either scared

1006
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,870
and not in good health,

1007
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,670
or so careful

1008
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,230
that he found out that I had set him up.

1009
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,680
You should keep an eye on Mr. Third Junior.

1010
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,280
What he did back then was quite horrible.

1011
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:40,040
Try and make him have an attack of illness as soon as possible.

1012
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,560
He'll be a trouble if he lives on one more day.

1013
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,280
There's another thing I want you to attend to.

1014
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,630
Boss, I'm all ears.

1015
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,120
It's my daughter's wedding tomorrow.

1016
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,350
I've talked to all my friends, either in or outside the industry.

1017
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,110
It'll be a very important occasion.

1018
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,360
All of Wu Erbai's former subordinates will come to the wedding.

1019
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:04,150
I need to let everyone know clearly

1020
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,440
that who's in charge and that the Wu family has totally lost.

1021
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,720
So you have to make sure

1022
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,480
the wedding will be grand and splendid.

1023
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,070
Make sure there'll be no problem.

1024
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,270
Boss, I'll see to it.

1025
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,790
All of our men will go to the wedding.

1026
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,200
Keep an eye on Wu Xie.

1027
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,190
He'll definitely go there.
