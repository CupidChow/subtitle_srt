00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,900
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Episode 22

4
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,020
I tell you what,

5
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,620
they've been down there in the water for so long.

6
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,700
They must have gotten something.

7
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,500
Something happened to them!

8
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,820
Pull them up quickly.

9
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:13,300
Hurry up!

10
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,020
Pull.

11
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,900
Get out of the way.

12
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,380
Pull harder!

13
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,140
How did it go?

14
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,460
Slowly.

15
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,300
Be careful.

16
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,420
Come on.

17
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,020
Are you alright?

18
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,340
Sir.

19
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,379
Look at this iron sheet of the case.

20
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,180
Military materials.

21
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,379
There's a serial number.

22
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,340
Look.

23
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,100
Zero three seven.

24
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,360
<i>0-37 Danger
Do Not Touch</i>

25
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,379
It fits.

26
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,660
This must be the cargo Zhang Fo Ye deposited here.

27
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,660
Yes!

28
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:05,580
Danger. Do not touch.

29
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,820
They have been soaked in the water for decades.

30
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,900
What danger can be there?

31
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:11,980
You're right.

32
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,060
Do you want to get rich?

33
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,580
Yes!

34
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,380
Slow down.

35
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,740
What is this?

36
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,460
I've never seen such a thing before.

37
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,780
Must be something valuable.

38
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,180
Zhang Fo Ye's stuff

39
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,500
must be something good.

40
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,340
Good stuff.

41
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,940
We're getting rich!

42
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
This cargo has not been touched by anyone for a long time.

43
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,220
Director Bai.

44
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,060
What is under the water?

45
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,260
Tell us.

46
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,300
These are all bronze fragments from the Han Dynasty.

47
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,100
According to the totem patterns on them,

48
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,380
they might belong to the South Sea King.

49
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,540
This cargo belongs to the so-called Go-between 037.

50
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,129
I told you guys!

51
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,460
I found Zhang Fo Ye's cargo!

52
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,420
We're getting rich!

53
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,660
It's not that simple.

54
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,260
According to the archive,

55
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,060
under the water there are more than just these fragments.

56
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,860
Case No. 037 involves over 100 pieces of cargo.

57
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,140
Investigating this one alone is not enough.

58
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,620
Then we'll go down again.

59
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,660
Three of you have had an accident underwater.

60
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,180
It's not safe to go down again.

61
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,660
Director Bai.

62
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,940
We are all aware that

63
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,980
the higher the level, the more dangerous the go-between will be.

64
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,220
This is a rule

65
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,900
everybody in Warehouse 11 knows.

66
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,540
But

67
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,980
since we have come here in the middle of the night,

68
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,900
we never plan to leave empty-handed.

69
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,980
We will definitely solve

70
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,580
this case.

71
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,580
Listen up.

72
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,740
After you go in the water,

73
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,700
knock once if you find anything.

74
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,140
Knock twice if you need extra people to help you.

75
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,780
Knock three times if there's danger and

76
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,620
you need to go ashore immediately.

77
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,220
Be cautious when you're in the water.

78
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,380
Keep in touch.

79
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,300
Understood.

80
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:49,980
Be safe.

81
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,660
Yes!

82
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,500
Slowly. Be careful.

83
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,340
Go.

84
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,780
He knocked once.

85
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,260
Our guess is right.

86
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,620
There is some treasure down there.

87
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,980
He just knocked twice now.

88
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,860
Twice?

89
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,100
Is the thing too big?

90
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,380
You two, go down and help him.

91
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,140
He knocked twice again.

92
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,580
He still needs more people?

93
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,260
What can be so big?

94
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,740
Seriously?

95
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,300
Something doesn't seem right.

96
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,780
Pull them up!

97
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,620
Are they alright?

98
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,980
Now! Pull them up.

99
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,180
Pull! Hurry up!

100
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,180
Director Bai.

101
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,700
Come down here.

102
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,820
Come down here.

103
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,660
Who is this?

104
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,020
What did he say?

105
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,820
I told you. It's crooked.

106
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,180
Which side?

107
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,660
The right side.

108
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,460
We're running out of time!

109
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,580
Hurry up!

110
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,540
Chop, chop!

111
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,260
Come on!

112
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,660
Hurry up.

113
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,460
Do it faster.

114
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,420
Bridegroom, don't hang around here.

115
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,780
It'll be too late if we don't hurry.

116
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,300
Move faster!

117
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,820
Hurry up. Chop, chop!

118
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,540
Hurry up. Stop idling about here!

119
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,820
You just wander around without doing anything.

120
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,500
When will we finish the preparation?

121
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,060
Come on!

122
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,620
Hurry up!

123
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,820
Okay.

124
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,620
Come on. Hurry up.

125
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,620
You lose.

126
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,380
Look at others.

127
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,820
Why didn't you get to work?

128
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,580
Look at them!

129
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,900
Is it straight now?

130
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,700
Almost there.

131
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,020
Here you go.

132
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,500
Okay.

133
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,300
Okay, listen to my orders.

134
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,660
Okay.

135
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,500
How's it? I'm doing a good job, right?

136
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,340
Pretty good.

137
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,020
Look.

138
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,020
Nice.

139
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,620
Good water for a good day.

140
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,740
Drink some Nongfu Spring.

141
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,060
I did all the work, okay?

142
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,020
You know that?

143
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,140
This is yours.

144
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:56,980
Be careful.

145
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,900
You…

146
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,260
Go on. Hit him!

147
00:09:59,420 --> 00:09:59,700
Hit him.

148
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,180
This bastard.

149
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,900
Aim at Fatty.

150
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,740
Avoid his attack!

151
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,260
Yes!

152
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Now hit him.

153
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,500
Hide.

154
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,460
Hit him now.

155
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:05,860
Okay.

156
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,460
Fatty, that's enough!

157
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,020
Don't hide if you dare.

158
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,460
Are you all ready?

159
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,740
Yes.

160
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,620
OK, let's go.

161
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,740
Here we go!

162
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,660
Go.

163
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,500
The auspicious hour has come.

164
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,300
Today,

165
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,300
our Wushanju Antique Shop is reopening.

166
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,420
Let's pray that our business will go well.

167
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,460
Come on.

168
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,060
Hit me.

169
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,500
This way.

170
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,620
I'm over here.

171
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,140
Fatty.

172
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,460
Come on!

173
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,140
How many invitations did you send?

174
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,500
Over a thousand.

175
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,980
I was thinking that

176
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,140
I would never have a chance to have a wedding.

177
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,380
So I want to take this chance to

178
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,380
call as many people as possible to have a big party.

179
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,020
Who would have thought that no one's coming?

180
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,340
Look how unpopular you're.

181
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,900
Bring it on!

182
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,820
Where's Bai?

183
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,820
Bai should come.

184
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,380
Bai just returned to her post.

185
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,820
She will definitely come if she is available today.

186
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,540
You see? Everyone is busy.

187
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,340
I miss her, to be honest.

188
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,900
Over here! Come here.

189
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,060
Someone's coming.

190
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,940
We have a customer?

191
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,780
Let me see.

192
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,220
Aunt Liu.

193
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,100
Which one of you is in charge?

194
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,060
Who said that you could set off confetti crackers at your door?

195
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,140
Look at the mess you made and the garbage you created!

196
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,940
I have to fine you guys.

197
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,540
Don't, hey. Aunt Liu, sorry.

198
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,260
But it's the first day we reopen.

199
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,660
She's not old enough to be an aunt.

200
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,420
Call her our sister!

201
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,180
Ms. Liu is like our big sister!

202
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,940
We're having an opening ceremony today, right?

203
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,660
So, so

204
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,820
we just wanted to create some buzz.

205
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,220
We're neighbors. Can you make an exception?

206
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,180
We'll clean it up in a while.

207
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,020
My boss has seen the mess.

208
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,660
I can't make an exception.

209
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,180
The fine will be 250 yuan.

210
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,900
How much did you just say?

211
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,580
Two hundred and fifty.

212
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,980
Hey, I'm not the boss here.

213
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,500
You are our first distinguished customer today.

214
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,780
Ms. Liu, our sister.

215
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,340
You see, we haven't sold anything yet.

216
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,100
So we have no money.

217
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,940
No money?

218
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,660
You still need to pay the fine.

219
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,380
No money.

220
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:43,980
No money and period.

221
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,380
Fine.

222
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,340
No, we really don't have any money.

223
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,660
Look.

224
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,700
Aunt Liu, hey.

225
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,940
You don't need to argue with him. Come on.

226
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,740
Let me scan your QR code to transfer the fine.

227
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,580
You won't transfer anything!

228
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,180
Don't say a word.

229
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:53,940
Hey…

230
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,500
We are all responsible for protecting the environment.

231
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,220
We will be punished if we pollute the environment.

232
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,780
Isn't it God's truth?

233
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,060
Come on.

234
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
I just transferred three hundred yuan to you.

235
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,660
Now this is a good guy.

236
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,140
Alright.

237
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,260
You should all learn from him.

238
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,700
Okay, fine, Aunt Liu.

239
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,900
I'll find someone to

240
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,780
clean the garbage at your door.

241
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,220
Thank you so much.

242
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,140
I wish you good business.

243
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,060
-Thank you, goodbye. -That old lady made a small fortune from you.

244
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,580
Wu Xie.

245
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,140
We haven't sold anything yet,

246
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,340
on top of that we already lost a lot of money.

247
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,020
What are you talking about?

248
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,700
What? You're back to a rich kid again?

249
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,900
Do you have money?

250
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,220
Yes.

251
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,260
If you have money, invite us to lunch.

252
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,100
We haven't had anything yet.

253
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,620
Okay.

254
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,660
Wuwailou Restaurant.

255
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,340
Sure!

256
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,620
Wu what?

257
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,700
Wuwailou.

258
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,220
Wuwailou is so tacky!

259
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,540
Shall we go and eat something elegant?

260
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,220
My treat. Let's go!

261
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,740
Let's go! The boss is footing the bill.

262
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,180
Let's go.

263
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,220
Dig in!

264
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,580
Don't be downcast in spirit.

265
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:41,980
Come on.

266
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,740
Our shop opens for the first day today, right?

267
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,700
No one came and

268
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,860
we haven't sold a single good.

269
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,900
We're so "happy"!

270
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,660
And we should.

271
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,300
The fact that it's reopened is something happy enough.

272
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,860
Come on. Dig in.

273
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:52,700
Come on.

274
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,460
Tomorrow can't be worse than today, right?

275
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,500
Come on.

276
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,020
Everyone, dig in!

277
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,380
We only ordered these four dishes?

278
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,020
What else do you expect?

279
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,140
We also ordered some rice, right?

280
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:01,980
Excuse me!

281
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,380
Can you serve us rice?

282
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,220
Excuse me. I need to serve a dish.

283
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,180
Thank you for the crabs, sir!

284
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,540
Don't touch it yet.

285
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,820
Who ordered this?

286
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Huo Daofu, did you order it?

287
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,780
We need to have the courage to be the first person to eat crabs.

288
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,700
Why did you want to know who ordered it?

289
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,140
Maybe she served the wrong table.

290
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,940
I ordered it for you.

291
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,100
Uncle Erbai.

292
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,820
Uncle Erbai.

293
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,340
Uncle Erbai.

294
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,700
Excuse me, we need another set of tableware.

295
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,980
Come on!

296
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,820
I knew it.

297
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,300
Everyone, eat as much as you like.

298
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,340
It's my treat today.

299
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,260
Let me.

300
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,020
Let me do it.

301
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,100
Uncle Erjing, take a seat.

302
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,940
Come on, Uncle Erbai.

303
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,020
Uncle Erbai.

304
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,740
How are you?

305
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,220
How are you recently?

306
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,500
Do you miss us?

307
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,820
Mr. Erbai must be hungry.

308
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,740
He can't eat crabs though.

309
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,220
Too hard to him now.

310
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,020
Look.

311
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,020
Thanks to Uncle Erjing who's been taking good care of Mr. Erbai,

312
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,060
he looks so well now.

313
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,500
Uncle Erjing, thank you.

314
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,260
We all need to thank Uncle Erjing. Come on.

315
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,060
Um,

316
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,420
let's make a toast

317
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,380
to Uncle Erjing with water.

318
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,260
Thank you, Uncle Erjing.

319
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:11,940
Uncle Erjing, thank you for your effort.

320
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,620
Thanks, Uncle Erjing.

321
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,940
Thank you for the dedication.

322
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,140
Thank you.

323
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,180
You guys, enjoy.

324
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,580
Eat while the dishes are still warm.

325
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,260
Come on.

326
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,780
Um, so Uncle Erjing didn't understand

327
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,100
what I meant by "make a toast with water".

328
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,340
There's no wine!

329
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,460
Excuse me!

330
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,740
Serve us some wine, please.

331
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
Serve some wine.

332
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,060
Two more servings of crabs, too.

333
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,900
Three servings.

334
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,180
Make it three.

335
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,340
Uncle Erbai, I hope you'll get well soon.

336
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,020
Let's enjoy.

337
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,420
You guys go ahead.

338
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,140
I'll feed Mr. Erbai some water first.

339
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,860
This is the wine you ordered.

340
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,940
What kind of service is this? Open it for us!

341
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,660
Forget it. I'll open it myself.

342
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,340
Go ahead.

343
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,580
Look at the yellow crab roe.

344
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,860
Enjoy, and pretend that we're not here.

345
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,420
I'll take care of Mr. Erbai.

346
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,060
The crabs are really delicious.

347
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,580
Uncle Erbai, how do you like the massage?

348
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,740
Next time!

349
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,620
There's no next time.

350
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,620
Come on. Buy us another meal.

351
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,820
The crabs are really good.

352
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,740
But a bit too small.

353
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,660
Let's get bigger ones next time.

354
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,740
Next time you'll pay.

355
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,700
What does this mean?

356
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,260
Why are there so many watches?

357
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,660
My Wushanju just reopened today.

358
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,700
What does sending me

359
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,340
so many watches mean?

360
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,420
It…

361
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,820
Maybe it means "I'm watching you"?

362
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,340
Uncle Erjing,

363
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,100
could you send my Uncle Erbai back?

364
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:50,860
Sure.

365
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,380
Uncle Erbai.

366
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,580
Just focus on your recuperation.

367
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,100
Call me anytime if you need anything.

368
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:56,980
Sure.

369
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,180
He'll need to have another massage when he goes home.

370
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,460
Take care.

371
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,660
Sure.

372
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,460
-Bye. -Bye.

373
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,380
Next time.

374
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,180
Please remember our promise.

375
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,660
Take us to dine out again.

376
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,220
Whoever did this did it deliberately.

377
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,540
Did you hear that?

378
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,540
Who are you?

379
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,100
Why are you pretending to be a ghost?

380
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,820
He's from Warehouse 11.

381
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,500
You know him?

382
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,580
His face looks familiar.

383
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,220
What are you doing here?

384
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,460
Xiangyang.

385
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,060
Xiangyang.

386
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,460
Xiangyang.

387
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,140
Stop calling.

388
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,060
Call an ambulance.

389
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,700
Okay.

390
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,500
Xiangyang. Xiangyang!

391
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,820
Is he still breathing?

392
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,860
Yes, but barely.

393
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,700
What…

394
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,100
What the hell is it?

395
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,060
Zero three seven.

396
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,900
Danger. Do not touch.

397
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,940
Here it comes again.

398
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,060
What is it?

399
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,220
Fatty, don't touch it.

400
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,300
There's definitely something suspicious about it.

401
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,260
One arm full of so many watches?

402
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,820
What does it mean to send so many watches

403
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,100
on our big day of re-opening?

404
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,060
Doctor.

405
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,260
The test result shows that

406
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,780
the patient suffers from adrenal cortex hypofunction

407
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,900
and it's acute.

408
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,420
Fortunately, you took him to the hospital in time.

409
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,620
It would be fatal had you guys come two minutes late.

410
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,260
OK, thank you.

411
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,100
I'll come to you after I get the test sheet.

412
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,620
Okay. You'll find me in my office.

413
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,020
Okay.

414
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,140
What is it?

415
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,380
I found it on that guy.

416
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,940
Xiangyang?

417
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,140
Why would he have Wushanju's business card?

418
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,580
It must be Bai's practical joke.

419
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,460
She hasn't seen us for days

420
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,740
so she wanted to give us a surprise.

421
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,220
Well, it did surprise us in the scare way.

422
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,220
So,

423
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,180
since it's nothing serious,

424
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,820
I have to go back

425
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,580
and deal with some business now.

426
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,740
See you.

427
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,620
Uncle Erjing, sorry about today.

428
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,740
We met such a bummer on the first day of reopening.

429
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,020
Don't say that.

430
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,380
Whenever something happens to Wushanju,

431
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,100
Mr. Erbai and I will help you as much as we can.

432
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,820
It's okay. Thanks.

433
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,300
It's a small problem.

434
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,460
Fatty and I can solve it ourselves.

435
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,140
You don't need to worry about it.

436
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,100
Okay, just go since you have things to do.

437
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:27,660
Okay.

438
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,740
Call me if you need anything.

439
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,940
Okay, don't worry, Uncle Erjing.

440
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,340
By the way,

441
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,300
that batch of bronze fragments

442
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,620
don't look like they are something ordinary.

443
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,380
You can take them to ask Jin Wantang.

444
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,900
He's an expert on such things.

445
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,380
Sure.

446
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,780
It's not that simple.

447
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,100
Someone is targeting at Wushanju.

448
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,420
Don't mention anything about my recovery to anyone,

449
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,620
not even Uncle Erjing.

450
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:56,940
Got it.

451
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,140
I'll go to Wantang to study these bronze fragments.

452
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,780
Okay.

453
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,700
I'll go to Warehouse 11

454
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,060
to ask around about it.

455
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:04,740
Yes.

456
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,940
Go find…

457
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,900
Find Huo Daofu to go with you.

458
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,780
He has expertise on bronze fragments.

459
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,900
Huo?

460
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,340
Didn't he only know how to fry dough sticks?

461
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,460
Then did you know

462
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,380
he's a good doctor?

463
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,500
I'll get the test sheet.

464
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,100
Who I thought was a doctor who could fry dough sticks

465
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,700
is actually a doctor who could fry dough sticks

466
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,180
with an expertise on bronze fragments.

467
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,060
God.

468
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,540
When you and Wu Xie came to me, it was never something good.

469
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,460
Wantang!

470
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,460
Wantang!

471
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,620
Come out to greet your distinguished guests.

472
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,420
Chop, chop!

473
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,980
I thought it was a monk in rags.

474
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,260
Come on.

475
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:53,860
Come on.

476
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,500
Beg me.

477
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,820
We're best friends.

478
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,020
Don't always ask me to beg you.

479
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,020
Come here.

480
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,020
I'll show you some good stuff.

481
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,540
Good stuff?

482
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,980
What kind of scrap metal did you bring this time?

483
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,660
Good stuff, yeah, right!

484
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,700
Come on. Open it.

485
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,380
Voila.

486
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,620
Rub your sleepy eyes.

487
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,900
See? I knew it was scrap metal.

488
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,740
No, no, no.

489
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,700
You can't touch it!

490
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,340
You can't touch it like this.

491
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:34,780
I just need to take a look.

492
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,420
I'll just take a look.

493
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,500
I'm begging you, alright?

494
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,860
Oh, you beg me?

495
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,660
I can't reject you, right?

496
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,900
Look at this condition.

497
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,900
They're so pretty.

498
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,100
It's a pity that

499
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,540
they're just fragments.

500
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,820
If you have an intact bronze ware,

501
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,940
I'm telling you…

502
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,820
Don't touch them!

503
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,540
How can you? I'm the owner, right?

504
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,660
But actually South Sea King was their owner.

505
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,180
This kind of bronze ware is rare nowadays.

506
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,620
What a pity that

507
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,540
it's broken.

508
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,020
If it is an intact ware,

509
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,340
it'll be priceless.

510
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,540
South Sea King again.

511
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,460
Weird, I know.

512
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,220
Look at these patterns.

513
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,700
They're connected together.

514
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,740
If my guess is right,

515
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,580
it had been something in a whole

516
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,220
before it broke into pieces.

517
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,620
This pretty boy actually has a brain.

518
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,060
Nice.

519
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,340
Then shall we piece them back?

520
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,380
This is good stuff.

521
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,860
Where did you dig this thing out?

522
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,060
A few days ago

523
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,860
you guys went to the South Sea King's Tomb, right?

524
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,580
Could it be you guys dug it…

525
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,500
Don't be ridiculous.

526
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,100
What kind of person do you think I am?

527
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,460
Look, these fragments

528
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,220
have made up a bronze axe.

529
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,580
It can be priceless.

530
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,980
There may be a big tomb under the ground

531
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,740
where you found these fragments.

532
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,420
Fatty.

533
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,060
Don't touch it since you don't know anything about it.

534
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,140
I don't know?

535
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,780
I was once a tomb raider, you think I don't know?

536
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,740
When I want to touch something, no one can say no!

537
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,140
I'm telling you guys,

538
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,340
I touched more antiques than

539
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,260
steamed buns you guys ever touched in your life.

540
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,060
Look.

541
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:39,940
Yes.

542
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,740
You touched so many good stuff.

543
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,420
No one dares to look down on you.

544
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,820
You're good at groping.

545
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,620
Why do you sound so nasty?

546
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,780
Doctor Fried Dough Stick!

547
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,100
How can you gang up with him to taunt me?

548
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,580
Ok, alright.

549
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,620
What he said actually makes some sense.

550
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,780
This thing is pretty evil.

551
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,140
I'll help you purify it.

552
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,260
What evil thing?

553
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,380
Do you think I was born yesterday?

554
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
Young man…

555
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,180
But I have proof!

556
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,500
Seniors in the antique business said that

557
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,140
you can't touch South Sea King's stuff

558
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,460
or you'll be haunted by demons.

559
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,540
But you don't believe my word.

560
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,060
Fine.

561
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,340
Wantang, you think I don't know you?

562
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,180
Your eyes will light up

563
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,100
when you see valuable stuff.

564
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,900
You created a lot of troubles for us

565
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,260
at the thunder listening adventure.

566
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,740
Now you tried to scare me with the haunted by demon bullshit.

567
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,940
Besides,

568
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,580
do you really need a magnifying glass

569
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,940
since this is such a big axe?

570
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,660
No, I was checking the patterns.

571
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,260
There are also a lot of watches in the case.

572
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,580
Why didn't you make up a story for them?

573
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,220
I checked those watches.

574
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,340
They're all broken.

575
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,700
No one is telling the right time.

576
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,660
Wantang will buy them all.

577
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,620
Wantang knows a good antique when he sees one.

578
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,380
Right?

579
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:36,820
Give them to him.

580
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,660
I don't want them.

581
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,380
How much do you want for this stuff?

582
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:39,780
See?

583
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,500
Did you hear him?

584
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,820
Didn't you say it's evil?

585
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,740
Why would you still want it?

586
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,260
It's exactly…because it's evil.

587
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,900
So leave it in my safe keeping for now.

588
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,420
Look at you. Hypocritic.

589
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,380
But I can't decide.

590
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,900
I have to

591
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,260
go back and ask Naive.

592
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,180
Hey!

593
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,300
When he and I

594
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,260
decide on a good price,

595
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,860
I'll reply to you.

596
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,340
That's it.

597
00:26:59,420 --> 00:26:59,580
Come on.

598
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,020
I have to go.

599
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,420
But…

600
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,540
Come on.

601
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,100
Chop, chop. I gotta go.

602
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,300
Fatty!

603
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,740
What are you doing?

604
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,780
You woke me up early in the morning,

605
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,140
and then you just

606
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,260
showed me the goods without even giving me a quote?

607
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,620
What kind of business are you doing?

608
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,740
Don't you need to check the goods before you buy things?

609
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,180
Right?

610
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:16,580
Oh,

611
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,060
come on!

612
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,740
isn't it a blessing just by

613
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,900
taking a look at such a valuable antique?

614
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,420
Don't do this to me!

615
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,060
Leave one or two

616
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,100
fragments for me to admire.

617
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,900
No, let's consider it a deposit.

618
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,740
Right?

619
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,500
You won't sell it to others, right?

620
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,540
I can see it now.

621
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,940
Wantang, you really like this thing.

622
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,180
Come on.

623
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,900
Lift the case.

624
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,380
Lift the case.

625
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,500
Okay.

626
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:39,820
Okay.

627
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,940
I have a lumbar muscle strain.

628
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,500
-Where are you going? -Thank you.

629
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,140
I will definitely give you a price hike...

630
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,500
I mean a discount exclusively for my friends.

631
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,420
You don't need to see us out.

632
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,940
Goodbye.

633
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,460
You!

634
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,500
Come on!

635
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,780
Leave one or two fragments!

636
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,320
<i>Archive Room</i>

637
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,500
Zero three seven.

638
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,260
Zhang Qishan.

639
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,780
I didn't know that this incident has affected so many people.

640
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:40,240
<i>0-37 Danger
Do Not Touch</i>

641
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,400
<i>Mr. Third Junior</i>

642
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,780
Hello, Mr. Third Junior.

643
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,420
You little rascal.

644
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,620
Why didn't you answer my call?

645
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,380
My Wushanju's reopening ceremony was held today. Why didn't you come?

646
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,700
I went there.

647
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,860
But the door was closed, and no one was inside.

648
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,300
Did something go wrong in Warehouse 11?

649
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,580
Why can't I get in touch with you recently?

650
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,940
Everything is going well.

651
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,740
Really?

652
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,260
Really!

653
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,700
Mr. Third Junior. You just had a narrow escape from death.

654
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,860
You have to learn not to be nosy.

655
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,740
Don't be nosy.

656
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,100
You have grown up now so

657
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,060
you started to lecture me, right?

658
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,140
If everything is really going well,

659
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,260
why would Xiangyang faint in my shop with

660
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,940
a case of bronze fragments?

661
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,140
What? Bronze fragments?

662
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,900
Mr. Third Junior, don't touch those bronze fragments!

663
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,860
What will happen if I do?

664
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,460
They're very dangerous.

665
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,940
Got it. I'll go and check on him.

666
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,020
Jin Wantang?

667
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,020
Jin Wantang!

668
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,380
There are many possible reasons to cause his coma.

669
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,660
Just take him to the hospital as fast as possible.

670
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,260
I will keep an eye on them in the hospital for you.

671
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,060
Will there be a problem moving them?

672
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,020
Try to be stable.

673
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,980
Okay. Sorry for the inconvenience.

674
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,580
It's okay.

675
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,940
Remember to invite me to hot pot next time.

676
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,740
Alright?

677
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,380
Sure, no problem.

678
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,180
You also like hot pot?

679
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,460
Doctor Fried Dough Stick is sick.

680
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,980
We have a big problem.

681
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,300
Why?

682
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,540
Why are you looking at me?

683
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,540
It's not my fault.

684
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
Just say it.

685
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,500
What happened?

686
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,300
That greedy Wantang

687
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,460
had to touch the fragments,

688
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,420
you know?

689
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,620
And then

690
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,460
Huo Daofu was playing jigsaw puzzles

691
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,260
trying to piece the fragments back together.

692
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,380
Didn't you remind me?

693
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,220
You said that I couldn't touch them! I always listen to you.

694
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,220
These bronze fragments are particularly evil.

695
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,860
People who touch it

696
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,180
will show mental fatigue and restlessness.

697
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,660
In some severe cases, the symptoms even include auditory hallucinations and coma.

698
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,860
Everyone said that

699
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,540
these bronze fragments are haunted.

700
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,020
But I didn't expect Xiangyang would come to you.

701
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,900
Of course he would come to him.

702
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,220
He is the master of mysterious phenomenon.

703
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,660
I don't think he came to you for treatment of his symptoms.

704
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,420
I was there on the night of the accident.

705
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,140
He knows that I know you well.

706
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,060
There was no need for him to carry such a heavy box

707
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,180
to come to Wushanju.

708
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,940
Anyway, we need to

709
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,020
figure out

710
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,460
what the deal is with these bronze fragments.

711
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,460
I'll take care of the rest.

712
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,100
Bai.

713
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,660
Hand an application for me to enter Warehouse 11.

714
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,940
No way.

715
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,700
I don't want you to survive your last adventure only

716
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,460
to embark on another one.

717
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,620
Two of my friends are sick now.

718
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,380
I need to help them.

719
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,300
But this is against the rules of the warehouse.

720
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,970
I heard you right, right? Rules?

721
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,140
Since when

722
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,300
you want to comply with the rules of Warehouse 11?

723
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:32,970
Political commissar,

724
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,380
commander,

725
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,010
sir and madam. Have you made up a plan?

726
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,340
Recruit a team and get to work. Got it.

727
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,340
Yes, sir!

728
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,180
Liu Sang, let's go.

729
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,180
Sang? Let's go!

730
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,860
Mr. Third Junior.

731
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,260
You guys really can't go.

732
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,660
Do you have anything else that you haven't told me?

733
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,580
There are many people in Warehouse 11

734
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,420
who have shown the symptoms as Huo Daofu and Xiangyang.

735
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,140
What's the situation in Warehouse 11 now?

736
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,300
Who is the supervisor?

737
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,660
It's Director Tong.

738
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,260
He is now in charge of the Operation Department of Warehouse 11.

739
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,100
He has 30 years of service in the warehouse.

740
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,260
He will never allow an outsider to go in.

741
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,740
Although you were once a legend in Warehouse 11,

742
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,700
after all

743
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,580
you have been fired.

744
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,020
Everyone of Warehouse 11

745
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,180
was gathered to have an emergency meeting.

746
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,420
We're going to close the warehouse.

747
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,060
This close-down is

748
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,780
different from the previous one which was a nose count.

749
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,100
During the previous one, even the warehouse was closed,

750
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,700
staff could still enter and leave it

751
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,540
as long as they registered.

752
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,220
But now during the close-down,

753
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,900
before the problem is resolved,

754
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,060
no one inside can come out

755
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,700
and no one outside can get in there.

756
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,900
In other words,

757
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,700
If you guys go in there

758
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,460
and then the warehouse is closed,

759
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,980
no one can get out of there.

760
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,220
What was in your little head?

761
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,940
If this didn't happen to Wushanju,

762
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,140
are you planning to solve it by yourself?

763
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,460
I found these bronze fragments

764
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:11,820
underwater in Ganyang Section

765
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,540
at the very beginning.

766
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,460
That is the field I am familiar with.

767
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,420
So I'll personally take someone down in the water to investigate.

768
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,380
I'm now waiting for the diving equipment to arrive.

769
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,180
Then do me a favor.

770
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,740
Help me prepare my diving equipment.

771
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,060
And I'm afraid this accident

772
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,220
is not targeting Warehouse 11.

773
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,660
It's meant for me.

774
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,300
Stop talking nonsense.

775
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,540
Didn't I tell you everything?

776
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,820
Just come here!

777
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,940
Here it comes again.

778
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,780
Fatty.

779
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,060
Let me tell you, I'm scared of your task already.

780
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,620
I will never go.

781
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,220
Come on! It's a sweet job.

782
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,700
I wouldn't have called you if it wasn't a sweet job.

783
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,020
I am a good friend.

784
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,020
Take the offer when I am asking you nicely.

785
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,740
If you don't come, let me tell you this,

786
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,900
if you don't take this offer,

787
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,860
you won't be able to get any offer again.

788
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,980
Do you understand what I mean?

789
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,500
If you don't come, I will take it personal.

790
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,660
I haven't settled the score with you about Mr. Jiao's thing.

791
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,300
No, you are being unreasonable.

792
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,460
I am.

793
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,700
That's who I am!

794
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,740
What can you do with me?

795
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,660
Come here quickly.

796
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,580
Let me tell you, I'm keeping track of time.

797
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,140
I will deduct one hundred yuan from your payment with every minute you're late.

798
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,180
It's your call.

799
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,660
Gotta go.

800
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,060
You mean

801
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,420
what happened in Warehouse 11

802
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,700
were all targeting at you.

803
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,900
Xiangyang took the bronze fragments to Wushanju.

804
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,260
This is a very strange thing itself.

805
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,860
Someone seems to have a plot against me.

806
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,700
You see,

807
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,260
Xiangyang looked blank when he got out of the vehicle.

808
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,060
He didn't even know where he was.

809
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,740
Then the person in the car

810
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,900
pointed him a direction and then

811
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,260
he walked directly towards my shop.

812
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,140
That means

813
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,860
actually when he came to you with these bronze fragments ,

814
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,820
the person behind it wanted to pass the hot potato

815
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,860
on to Wushanju.

816
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,460
Yes.

817
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,020
So

818
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,900
it's very likely that that spy is behind this.

819
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,380
So

820
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,620
I need to go to Warehouse 11

821
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,140
to solve this problem.

822
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,740
Uncle Erjing,

823
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,100
you know many people in Warehouse 11, right?

824
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,340
You want me to get you in?

825
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,780
You are not afraid that someone might want to kill you there?

826
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,700
I'll be fine.

827
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,580
I have my own plan.

828
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,140
How about

829
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,380
I go in there for you?

830
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:39,780
No.

831
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,900
I have to do it myself.

832
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,500
But have you ever thought of the possibility that

833
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,900
this might be a trap

834
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,620
to lure you to go back to Warehouse 11?

835
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,460
If I were the spy,

836
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,980
I would have solved all the problems

837
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,220
when you are away.

838
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,460
Then I'll catch you at the door of Warehouse 11.

839
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,220
Luckily for me,

840
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
you are not the spy.

841
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,060
Now only you and I know this thing.

842
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,700
I haven't confirmed the time I'll go to Warehouse 11 yet.

843
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,220
So no one will be waiting there to hurt me.

844
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,140
Uncle Erjing.

845
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,140
You have been working for Uncle Erbai for so many years.

846
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,180
Actually,

847
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,220
you are like a real uncle to me.

848
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,460
Please take care of my Uncle Erbai.

849
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,300
Wait for me to come back.

850
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,460
I have to go.

851
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,460
Bai is still worried about you

852
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,580
and I can't live without you, either.

853
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,620
You are such a drama queen.

854
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,460
Go away.

855
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,380
Since that person is coming after me,

856
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,020
I have to hurry to the Warehouse 11

857
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,980
to solve this problem.

858
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,260
What he wants is not just my life.

859
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,820
Kylin is travelling around the world again, I guess.

860
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,540
I sent him more than one hundred text messages

861
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,820
and he never replies.

862
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,260
So

863
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,620
they have surveillance on us.

864
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,460
They picked this time to set up a trap for me

865
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,140
taking advantage of Kylin's absence.

866
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,460
Why are all you people

867
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,260
so fond of schemes?

868
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,060
All of you!

869
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,700
Why can't you just call your enemy

870
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,420
outside and fight face-to-face? How cool

871
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,460
and how simple it will be!

872
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,980
This is actually not a scheme.

873
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,980
Because whoever did this

874
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,140
basically showed us everything he has done.

875
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,580
But I still have to

876
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,260
play the game according to his rules.

877
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,620
Here's what I plan.

878
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,940
I have to find out the purpose of the spy or spies before

879
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,300
we catch them.

880
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,620
I'll pretend to be Jiang Zisuan.

881
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,060
Then with Bai's help

882
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,820
I'll go down to Warehouse 11 today.

883
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,380
Then I'll let Wang Meng disguise to be me

884
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,020
to prepare equipment here.

885
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,980
Then spread the rumor that

886
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,900
I won't act until a week later.

887
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,180
I don't want too many people to know about this.

888
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,220
So now only you, me

889
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,660
and Bai know about it.
