00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,280
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,560
Episode 2

4
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,040
All the carriages of the military train

5
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,570
were welded shut with iron sheets.

6
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,220
Blood kept seeping out of the train through the cracks.

7
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,220
Could it really be the Haunted Train No.076

8
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,549
Mr. Third Junior talked about?

9
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,130
How come the Haunted Train was in the section of unredeemable goods?

10
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,710
All the tales told by Mr. Third Junior

11
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,640
are used for scaring people

12
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,330
The scariest thing in the world is not any ghost,

13
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,679
but the human heart.

14
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,280
The Defense Commander at that time was Zhang Fo Ye,

15
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,429
who commanded his men to cut open the locomotive.

16
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:36,770
Then it was found the carriages

17
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,360
were full of funerary coffins and dead men,

18
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,870
all of whom were Japanese soldiers,

19
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,580
who looked macabrely strange.

20
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,060
All of them were face down and died by violence.

21
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,490
There must be something queer in this carriage.

22
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,390
Mr. Third Junior would come in

23
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,430
to check it out if he was here.

24
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,550
Pretending to be ghosts?

25
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,870
I don't fear you guys!

26
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,740
Mr. Third Junior.

27
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,290
Mr. Third Junior.

28
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,110
The scariest thing in the world is not any ghost,

29
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,780
but the human heart.

30
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,120
The scariest thing in the world is not any ghost,

31
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,630
but the human heart.

32
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,060
Stop screaming!

33
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,680
It's me.

34
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,290
Mr. Third Junior.

35
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,090
Hurry.

36
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,800
Get up quickly.

37
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,850
Hurry up. Follow me.

38
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:03,870
Go.

39
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,300
Go quickly.

40
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,780
Faster, faster.

41
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:18,920
Come here quickly.

42
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,370
Dodge away!

43
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,260
Just go!

44
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,420
Hurry up, Mr. Third Junior.

45
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,860
Go, go. This way.

46
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,210
Hurry, hurry.

47
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,790
This is my home.

48
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,300
You two are safe now.

49
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,590
Mr. Third Junior, where did you go?

50
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,940
I want to ask you this, too.

51
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,760
I turned around and found you gone.

52
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:56,940
I just…

53
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,550
Come on,

54
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,450
take a seat.

55
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,850
Sit down and rest.

56
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,550
Thank you.

57
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,160
Take a seat.

58
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:01,960
Thank you.

59
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,250
Please.

60
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:08,790
Uncle Kuan,

61
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:09,790
thanks

62
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,120
for your help.

63
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,090
Uncle Kuan?

64
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,260
Are you Uncle Kuan?

65
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,110
You are…

66
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,180
Well,

67
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,100
do you know each other?

68
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,220
I'm Bai Haotian,

69
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,400
aka Bai,

70
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,810
from the Bai Family.

71
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,360
Do you remember me now?

72
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,070
You're that tomboy.

73
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,960
I'm not a tomboy. I'm not a tomboy now.

74
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,860
You've grown up now.

75
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,420
What were the things that chased us just now?

76
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,700
I'm not quite sure.

77
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,670
Those Dark Shadows seem to be swarms of bugs,

78
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,560
which attack people once disturbed.

79
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,430
Uncle Kuan,

80
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,370
how come you're living in the section of unredeemable goods?

81
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,930
I thought you had long left Warehouse 11.

82
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,200
That's a long story

83
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,690
to tell.

84
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,910
When I was young, I was so naïve

85
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,760
that I did something wrong,

86
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,300
which made me

87
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,020
want to die.

88
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,100
Later, when I heard about this section from an old man

89
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,240
in Warehouse 11,

90
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,640
I decided to spend the last fragment of my life here.

91
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,550
I used to major in historical archeology.

92
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,290
There are many materials underground,

93
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,530
so I've been living here,

94
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,470
reading books and studying these materials.

95
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,850
Warehouse 11 sends food and supplies here regularly.

96
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,190
Although these Dark Shadows are troublesome,

97
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,500
I've found a way

98
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,540
to coexist with them in peace.

99
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,640
What have you two come here for?

100
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,760
Uncle Kuan,

101
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,640
we want to ask you a favor.

102
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,740
What's it?

103
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,460
Do you know Wang Junyi?

104
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,400
Wang Junyi?

105
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,410
Never heard of this name.

106
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,780
Uncle Kuan,

107
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,950
is there any spot down here where we can get phone reception?

108
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,750
Phone reception?

109
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,160
Why do you have to look for that spot?

110
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:06,860
What's the matter?

111
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,350
That spot is too dangerous.

112
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,900
I tell you what,

113
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,800
that's the place where most of the Dark Shadows gather.

114
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,700
How can you go there?

115
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,720
Uncle Kuan,

116
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,720
I want to ask you about a person

117
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,080
called Wu Sanxing.

118
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,350
Wu Sanxing?

119
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,010
Actually, when we met previously,

120
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,690
I knew that you must have met him.

121
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,000
What on earth did Uncle Sanxing do

122
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,050
in the section of unredeemable goods?

123
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,610
I came down here more than a decade ago,

124
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,110
and I've just heard a little

125
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,100
about your Uncle Sanxing.

126
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,260
It's said that he had been acting strangely,

127
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,850
wandering about in the section of unredeemable goods

128
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,990
as if looking for something.

129
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,870
Then he left

130
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,130
and has never come back.

131
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,850
It's very likely that…

132
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,520
Look.

133
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,100
We're almost there.

134
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,540
Which way?

135
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,160
That way.

136
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,820
Well,

137
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,500
I can only accompany you here.

138
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,120
You'll have to rely on your own luck for the remaining path.

139
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,320
Uncle Kuan,

140
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,200
thank you.

141
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:31,810
You're welcome.

142
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,170
Thank you, Uncle Kuan.

143
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:33,950
OK.

144
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,830
Take care.

145
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,670
Same to you.

146
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,350
I'll leave, then.

147
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,230
OK.

148
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,270
I'll follow you till the end

149
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,210
even if I die.

150
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,580
Bai, hold this for me.

151
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,030
OK.

152
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,050
Come on, let's do it together.

153
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:07,480
Come on.

154
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,460
It's much colder in here than the outside.

155
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,370
Cover your eyes.

156
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,070
Go.

157
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:11,690
Look.

158
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,940
This should be the place

159
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,600
where Uncle Sanxing filmed videos.

160
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,520
Wang Junyi also came here, I suppose.

161
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,990
There's phone reception now.

162
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,060
Oh no, the phone reception is too weak

163
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,900
to get the message sent.

164
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,740
Let's keep walking inside.

165
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,280
OK.

166
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,260
This way.

167
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,420
OK.

168
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,400
Follow me closely behind.

169
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,220
Mr. Third Junior.

170
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,970
Turn off the flashlight.

171
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,110
Go.

172
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,280
Those Dark Shadows have appeared again.

173
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,310
And in a large number, judging by the sound.

174
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:38,990
Go!

175
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,340
Are you okay?

176
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,040
Have we entered

177
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,790
the lair of the Dark Shadows?

178
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,570
There are so many of them,

179
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,110
so this must be their lair.

180
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,440
If Wang Junyi had really been here,

181
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,380
how did he manage to survive

182
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,240
and send messages to me?

183
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,910
Isn't this ridiculous?

184
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,640
Never mind.

185
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,020
Let's try to get out of here.

186
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,820
Wang Junyi couldn't have

187
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,690
frequented this dangerous place.

188
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,760
Let's do another search inside.

189
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,650
But how are we supposed

190
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,030
to avoid so many Dark Shadows?

191
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,050
Haven't you found that

192
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,300
they can't see anything?

193
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,450
They can only tell directions

194
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,490
through sounds and smells.

195
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,350
As long as we try to make no noise,

196
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,730
we have a chance of getting through this.

197
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,900
OK.

198
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,790
Go.

199
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,980
Be careful.

200
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,880
I haven't heard their noises for a long time.

201
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,400
I guess we've arrived at another area.

202
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,540
What's this?

203
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,040
Welcome, welcome.

204
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,770
Welcome, welcome.

205
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,510
Welcome, welcome.

206
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,200
Welcome, welcome.

207
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,900
Hurry. Let's go!

208
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,420
Let's follow him up.

209
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,150
Let's go take a look.

210
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,610
Is he a man or a ghost?

211
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,110
There's phone reception here.

212
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,740
The message still can't get through.

213
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,250
What do we do?

214
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,690
Let's wait and see.

215
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,340
Welcome, welcome.

216
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,330
Welcome.

217
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,930
Mr. Third Junior!

218
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,200
Go!

219
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,540
Wang Junyi!

220
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,140
Follow me.

221
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,890
Are you Wang Junyi?

222
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,320
The guy who has been sending me messages?

223
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,400
Wu Xie.

224
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,500
Bai Haotian.

225
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,910
What on earth is your purpose of drawing me here

226
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,240
by every possible means?

227
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,570
How much do you know about what

228
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:57,000
happened to your Uncle Sanxing here?

229
00:29:59,170 --> 00:29:59,830
Come here.

230
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,100
What do you want to say?

231
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,080
I'm a friend of your Uncle Sanxing,

232
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,310
who has prepared you with a long story.

233
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,470
Do you want to listen to it?

234
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,380
Sit back.

235
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,620
Three decades ago,

236
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,120
an ancient relic was discovered in a mountainous region in the southwest,

237
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,060
which spanned two countries.

238
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,310
A team led by Wu Sanxing

239
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:49,290
and consisting of Tian Youjin and Chen Wenjin came to do a research.

240
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:54,840
On their way to the site, they came across a suspicious team.

241
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,190
To figure out the background of this team,

242
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,460
Wu Sanxing feigned conflict with them.

243
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:12,890
Hello, comrade.

244
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,730
A member of us collided

245
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,660
with one of your men just now,

246
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,390
which is hard to avoid

247
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,660
for people on a journey.

248
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:21,990
You seem to be

249
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,790
quite a sensible man.

250
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,130
It was one of my men who bumped against your friend just now.

251
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,400
It's due to our carelessness.

252
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,240
Sorry.

253
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,460
You guys don't look like locals.

254
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,630
Where are you from?

255
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,660
Are you visiting relatives in the village?

256
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,770
We're not visiting any relatives.

257
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,070
<i>Southern Weather Bureau</i>

258
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,230
We're from

259
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,290
a weather bureau.

260
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,170
We're going ahead to do an exploration.

261
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,570
Oh, so you're comrades from a weather bureau.

262
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,770
The work you do must be quite strenuous,

263
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,840
traveling through wind and rain.

264
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,270
We're contributing to the homeland, so we don't feel strenuous.

265
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,540
That's true.

266
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,150
I've got some tea leaves brought from my hometown.

267
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,140
Please accept this tribute to your hard work.

268
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,070
It smells fragrant.

269
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,010
Of course.

270
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,670
They're excellent tea leaves, old fella.

271
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,920
Then I'll just accept your present.

272
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,540
Liu, take this.

273
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,780
This small jar looks quite special.

274
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:20,450
This…

275
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,250
Old fella,

276
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,550
this jar contains research equipment,

277
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,880
which cannot be shown to others in normal cases.

278
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,390
You're right.

279
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,410
You're right.

280
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,320
It looks like raining soon,

281
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,650
and we've exhausted ourselves after a long journey.

282
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,510
There's only one spot for rest in the front,

283
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,110
so we better stop chatting

284
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,460
and resume our respective journeys.

285
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,010
OK, OK.

286
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,850
I'll leave you alone, then.

287
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,750
See you, old fella.

288
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:53,890
Good bye.

289
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,120
Good bye.

290
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,640
Hope you can contribute more to our homeland!

291
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:18,800
Any findings?

292
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,230
They said they're from a weather bureau,

293
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,190
but they look mysterious and their background is still unclear.

294
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,420
Can they be grave robbers?

295
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,530
Grave robbers?

296
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,500
Look at our surroundings. What a deserted place.

297
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,570
It's likely that this alleged research team appearing here

298
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,850
out of the blue has also come for that grave.

299
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,870
If that's so,

300
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,770
they can't be from any weather bureau.

301
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,610
Why can't you figure this out?

302
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,560
How can a well-connected man like you

303
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,100
fail to figure this matter out?

304
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,330
Have you guys noticed

305
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,430
the long canvas bags on their backs?

306
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,630
Judging by the shapes, they must be Type 56 semi-automatic carbines.

307
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,400
A bullet of such a carbine

308
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,160
causes a nail-sized hole when it enters your body,

309
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,660
and a bowl-sized hollowness when it leaves your body.

310
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,170
And it's hard for ordinary people to come by such weapons,

311
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,710
so we cannot afford to provoke this gang.

312
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,040
Then…

313
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,310
Then we…

314
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,840
The weather is going to change.

315
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:12,850
Go!

316
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,080
Let's get back to the camp.

317
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,370
Wait a moment.

318
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,220
What's up?

319
00:34:28,749 --> 00:34:30,189
We can't just leave here without doing anything.

320
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,709
If they're grave robbers,

321
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
they must have come here

322
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:35,479
for that ancient grave.

323
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,280
We can't let them have their way.

324
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,090
Let's not be so hasty in our judgment.

325
00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:40,590
What if they're from some other department?

326
00:34:40,749 --> 00:34:42,289
It's possible that they're our peers.

327
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,050
Let's follow them up and observe them.

328
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,650
This is not some harmless game.

329
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,610
They've got guns.

330
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,320
We better report to the Joint Defense Brigade first.

331
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,209
That'll be too late.

332
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,320
Wenjin,

333
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,950
you and Youjin go to notify the militia.

334
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,550
I'll go make an observation by myself.

335
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,180
No way.

336
00:34:57,789 --> 00:34:58,890
We should go together.

337
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:13,860
Wait.

338
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,160
Comrade, we're from a weather bureau.

339
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,100
Murder.

340
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,110
There's a murder.

341
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:33,660
Stop running.

342
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,670
There're two over there.

343
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,170
These guys acted quite fast.

344
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,580
They must be grave robbers.

345
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,820
They seem to be very sensitive to weather.

346
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,870
Let's follow them up.

347
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,080
What are they doing?

348
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,470
Performing some ritual, it seems.

349
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:05,810
Getting prepared to "enter the hole."

350
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,310
"Enter the hole"?

351
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,250
I had contacted the local militia,

352
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,680
who gave me this picture.

353
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,780
Our task this time is to verify

354
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,980
whether the pit in the picture is an ancient grave.

355
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,260
These grave robbers killed the militia members

356
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,810
because the latter had guarded the place

357
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,680
so tightly

358
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,010
that they couldn't get in.

359
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,620
Judging by their ritual,

360
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,720
they shouldn't be locals.

361
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,110
It's unclear where these bandits come from.

362
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,950
How did they know the location of the ancient grave?

363
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,020
They came here even faster than we did.

364
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,590
No idea.

365
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:48,950
We must stop them.

366
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,850
Bro Sanxing.

367
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,350
Wenjin.

368
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,250
Wenjin, Wenjin.

369
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,680
Bro Sanxing.

370
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,490
Bro Sanxing.

371
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,580
Murder!

372
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,210
– Murder! – It's Tian Youjin.

373
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,190
There's a murder!

374
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,470
Is anybody here?

375
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,690
There's a murder!

376
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,880
There's a murder!

377
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,150
Murder.

378
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,010
There's a murder!

379
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,100
Comrade, comrade.

380
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,470
It's a misunderstanding.

381
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,000
Let's talk in a friendly way.

382
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,980
We, we're just passersby.

383
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,710
We saw nothing here.

384
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:48,930
We saw nothing.

385
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,600
Kill them.

386
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,770
No.

387
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,310
Wait.

388
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,670
The Heaven doesn't allow them to die.

389
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,540
We can keep them for our benefit.

390
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,240
That leader of the gang

391
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,330
didn't kill Chen Wenjin or Wu Sanxing.

392
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,410
He controlled the former instead,

393
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:55,780
in order to force Wu Sanxing and Tian Youjin

394
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,170
to help the gang look for a person.

395
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,840
Who?

396
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,890
Those people asked your Uncle Sanxing and Tian Youjin

397
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,450
to come to the section of unredeemable goods in Warehouse 11

398
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,600
to take a person out.

399
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,040
The two of them found that person,

400
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,890
but Tian Youjin,

401
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,830
attracted by the treasures in the section,

402
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,810
and by utilizing the surveillance camera

403
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,250
at the entrance to the section,

404
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,320
he managed to give the wealth stored here

405
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,670
to all the high-ranking storekeepers with whom he had transactions,

406
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:37,640
thereby opening a path from the section to the outside.
