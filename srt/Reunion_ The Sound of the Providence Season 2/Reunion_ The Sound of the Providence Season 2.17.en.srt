00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,220
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,559
Episode 17

4
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,220
This dome

5
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,660
is the so-called Thunder City.

6
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,660
Speak of the devil.

7
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,140
What's wrong, Kylin?

8
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,500
A lightning happening in Thunder City.

9
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,180
What do you think will happen?

10
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,500
Kylin.

11
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,740
Thank God that you reacted to it quickly.

12
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,379
I told you so.

13
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,500
Now we are struck by lightning.

14
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,900
Don't say they didn't warn you.

15
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,940
Since there is lightning,

16
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,940
someone will be struck by it.

17
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,220
They didn't end well in history either.

18
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,900
How could they laugh at us?

19
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,220
You deserved to be struck.

20
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,540
What is this?

21
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,540
Naive, look.

22
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,660
This is a bronze pillar.

23
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,180
A device used to listen to thunder？

24
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,820
Probably.

25
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,420
Come here.

26
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,100
Don't get soaking wet in the rain.

27
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,060
What should we do now？

28
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,370
Let's take a short break here.

29
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,500
Okay.

30
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,940
The situation down here is complicated.

31
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,300
And there are many clues

32
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,500
hidden in the mural above us.

33
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,620
I need to take more time to study it.

34
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,340
This rain

35
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,220
reminds me of the time when the three of us were in Yu Village.

36
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,420
But how gentle the rain in Yu Village was.

37
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,580
I am really getting old.

38
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,580
I always look back nostalgically.

39
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,340
Kylin, you are older than anyone else.

40
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,380
Why don't you have any nostalgia?

41
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,340
How time flies.

42
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,380
What can you do with it?

43
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,620
Grandpa.

44
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,540
Do you have any experience that you can share?

45
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,180
Things are

46
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,620
different this time.

47
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,900
It's different every time.

48
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,100
It's the same every time.

49
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,780
Chief and the others are nearby.

50
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,140
What?

51
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,540
Did you see those hummocks?

52
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,300
They're hollow underground.

53
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,060
We have to find a way to give them a message.

54
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,380
But now there are too many people from both of our enemies.

55
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,340
It'll be too dangerous

56
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,220
for the Trio to show themselves now.

57
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,900
We need to find a way to let them stop.

58
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,460
What are you doing? Keep walking!

59
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,540
Let's go.

60
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,500
Go!

61
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,540
What did you hear?

62
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,420
There is not much movement. I can't hear the direction clearly.

63
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,220
There is no poisonous fog anymore.

64
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,900
We'll camp ahead to spend the night.

65
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,700
You must guard that guy with sunglasses.

66
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,300
We don't need him to say anything

67
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,780
or look for the road.

68
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:22,980
Let's go.

69
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:24,900
Let's go. Hurry up.

70
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,300
Kylin.

71
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,260
Kylin!

72
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,420
Fatty.

73
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,340
Fatty.

74
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,740
What happened?

75
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,340
Look!

76
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,100
What are you looking at?

77
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,860
Figures.

78
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,420
Have you had a nightmare?

79
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,420
You've been too tense recently.

80
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,140
Go to rest for a while.

81
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,020
Did you see that?

82
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,460
IMAX.

83
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,540
That' s it?

84
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,540
What...

85
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,980
Only when there is lightning

86
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,020
will these figures appear.

87
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:00,980
They appear.

88
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,900
Look.

89
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,740
All dressed in modern clothes.

90
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,980
Holding in their hands are…

91
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,700
Flashlight.

92
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,700
Tomb-raiding shovels.

93
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,460
And crowbars.

94
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,060
And shotguns.

95
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,060
Doesn't this one look like my Uncle Sanxing?

96
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,420
Uncle Sanxing!

97
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,260
I have to take a photo of him.

98
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,940
Your Uncle Sanxing was here.

99
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,300
They're gone again.

100
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,500
They were once here.

101
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,180
Uncle Sanxing.

102
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,100
Uncle Sanxing.

103
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,500
They are getting changed.

104
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,540
They change into wetsuits.

105
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,020
Wetsuits.

106
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,900
Winding canal for wine cup to float along the water.

107
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,740
For appreciation only.

108
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,860
You need to look up to see Thunder City.

109
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,340
So how can we get there?

110
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,420
Fatty, I know!

111
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,140
We have to dive into the water to Thunder City.

112
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,580
Dive into the water to Thunder City?

113
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,460
Uncle Sanxing!

114
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,580
Should we go to Thunder City from under the water?

115
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,380
Winding canal.

116
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,180
Uncle Sanxing.

117
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,140
Kylin.

118
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,980
Kylin, come and have a look!

119
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,700
-Can you...
-Kylin.

120
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,380
We found a way to Thunder City.

121
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,620
We will go there from underwater.

122
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,620
Let's go.

123
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,780
There must be a secret tunnel somewhere.

124
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,940
Come and take a look.

125
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,500
What are you doing?

126
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,020
Kylin, are you also possessed by evil spirits?

127
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,660
He is too excited.

128
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,340
His body will fail soon.

129
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,220
He has been coughing up blood recently.

130
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,060
He can't overdraw his energy like this anymore.

131
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,300
We have to force him to rest.

132
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,180
It's blood.

133
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,700
Help him up.

134
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,980
His body is so cold.

135
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,060
What are you feeding him with?

136
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,940
Draconis Palm's Resin.

137
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,540
It can help him get enough rest

138
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,740
and restore physical fitness.

139
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,300
This medicine is not growing everywhere.

140
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,660
Where did you find it?

141
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,020
I always carry it with me.

142
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,820
There's no entrance above.

143
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,420
I found the secret tunnel here when I got down.

144
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,020
It's at the back of the room.

145
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,580
Why didn't you tell us?

146
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,860
Finding the clues into Thunder City is Wu Xie's motivation.

147
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,740
If he arrives in Thunder City,

148
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,620
he will...

149
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,580
I know what you mean.

150
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,140
Just let him find it himself.

151
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,660
Let him have something he's after.

152
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,260
We need to stay with him.

153
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,620
Let's warm him up.

154
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,980
My body is warm.

155
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,700
It'll be alright.

156
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,580
This is our job.

157
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,580
Don't take it personal.

158
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,340
Sorry, bro.

159
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,060
Tie him up.

160
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,340
Keep an eye on all of them.

161
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,620
Yes, sir.

162
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,780
Alright.

163
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,660
What are you running for?

164
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,380
Well done.

165
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,500
I won!

166
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,540
Who else wants to play?

167
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,700
Who else?

168
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,980
How about you?

169
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,420
Who else wants to resist?

170
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,620
No one?

171
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,060
Whoever wants to resist, come on!

172
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,980
There are sounds above us.

173
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,220
Above us?

174
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,860
I'll go take a look.

175
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,620
Come back soon.

176
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,500
Hit him!

177
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,180
Hit him!

178
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,340
Who else wants to resist?

179
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,060
Get up.

180
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,300
Come on.

181
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,460
On your feet.

182
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,060
Yes!

183
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,340
I'm gonna kill you!

184
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,140
Hit him!

185
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,300
Hit him.

186
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,980
Yeah!

187
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,220
Nice punch!

188
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,540
Stop! Don't hit him!

189
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,540
Bravo!

190
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,420
Stop!

191
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,460
Don't hit him!

192
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,860
Don't hit him!

193
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,820
Stop!

194
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,460
Still laughing?

195
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,180
Please!

196
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,740
Liu Sang.

197
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,260
Leave him alone!

198
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,740
Stop.

199
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,340
That's what you got?

200
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,300
Yeah, come on!

201
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,300
He's so weak.

202
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,580
This fight is one-sided.

203
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,380
It's not fun at all.

204
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,180
He's so weak.

205
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,220
You finally woke up.

206
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,380
What happened to me?

207
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,940
If it weren't for my warm body,

208
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,540
you would have frozen to death.

209
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,700
You're getting much warmer.

210
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,580
Do you feel better?

211
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,020
What's the taste in my mouth?

212
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:54,860
Bitter, right?

213
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,860
Draconis Palm's Resin Kylin fed you.

214
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,420
Where's he now?

215
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,540
He went up to the ground

216
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,820
saying he heard something.

217
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,460
How did it go?

218
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,260
He's fine.

219
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,380
What happened?

220
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,420
Above us are Mr. Jiao's people.

221
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,660
They caught up with us?

222
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,500
Then Bai and others are also above us now.

223
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,940
Let's find a way to get them out first.

224
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,820
Kylin.

225
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,620
What's the situation above?

226
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,260
Mr. Jiao has more than 20 people.

227
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,180
I only saw Glasses, Liu Sang and Bai.

228
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,620
I didn't see your other friend.

229
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,140
Let's go.

230
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,580
Let's get them out.

231
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,060
These thugs

232
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,700
are fighting and hurting people all the time.

233
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,940
So vulgar.

234
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,500
What is your name?

235
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,340
Bai Haotian.

236
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,780
Bai Haotian.

237
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,660
What is your relationship with Wu Xie?

238
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,740
That's none of your business.

239
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,260
Stop!

240
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,500
You perverts, stop!

241
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,740
Stop, you perverts!

242
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:38,740
Stop!

243
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:40,580
If you kill him,

244
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,340
no one can take you to Thunder City!

245
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,180
Stop, do you hear me?

246
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,340
Stop!

247
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,500
Li Dajiang.

248
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,660
Come here.

249
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,220
Mr. Jiao.

250
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,860
I told you

251
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,220
that you can't kill him.

252
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,380
Yes.

253
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,860
She

254
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,100
is yours now.

255
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,220
Look.

256
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,100
Glasses is over there.

257
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,220
Let's go.

258
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,020
Since Kylin is willing to come forward,

259
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,060
the rest of us can all

260
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,300
lay back and watch the show.

261
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,620
Then you can lay back now.

262
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,620
You keep an eye on them then.

263
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,420
I know I am destined to die alone.

264
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,100
But I didn't expect you to be with me at the end of my life.

265
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,340
Just give up. This lock needs a key to open.

266
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,220
Wait for me.

267
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,060
Why did Kylin come back by himself?

268
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,700
What's up?

269
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,820
Glasses' hands are tied up with a lock.

270
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,660
I can't open it.

271
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,460
How about opening it with a knife?

272
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,540
If I force open it,

273
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,420
it will cripple his hands.

274
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,740
We need to find the key to it.

275
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,860
Crippled hands will affect his personal life.

276
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,740
Where are Bai Haotian and Liu Sang?

277
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,540
Over there.

278
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,620
Let's go.

279
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,100
Let's go to that tent first.

280
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:14,660
Let's go.

281
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,260
Let's go.

282
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,140
Let's go.

283
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,020
Let's go.

284
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,740
No one's inside.

285
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,060
What is it?

286
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,180
There's always someone staying by Liu Sang's side.

287
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,340
If we go to rescue Liu Sang forcefully now,

288
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,060
we'll spook them.

289
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,980
We must find

290
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,620
the key which can set Glasses free first.

291
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,740
Then we'll find out where Bai is.

292
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,780
Then the three of us will go out to rescue them at the same time.

293
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,700
We can't stay here for long.

294
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,220
Someone might come here anytime.

295
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,620
We need to have a plan.

296
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,580
Fatty.

297
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,380
Come here.

298
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:26,860
Look.

299
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,740
Did you see him?

300
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,540
Hong?

301
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,100
You want me to get him in here.

302
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,860
Right?

303
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,460
Yes.

304
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,980
We'll know everything if we get him.

305
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,300
Got it.

306
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,260
Fatty, take me with you!

307
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,140
-Wu Xie.
-Shh!

308
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,620
-Stay away from me.
-What's going on?

309
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,220
What are you guys doing here?

310
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,140
Hong.

311
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,820
I miss you so much!

312
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,100
How about

313
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,900
I never saw you and

314
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,620
you never saw me?

315
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,540
I'll go out.

316
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:30,940
Stop.

317
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,380
Stay.

318
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,740
If you still want to live,

319
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,420
just do as I tell you,

320
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,740
or...

321
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,140
Okay.

322
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,380
Stop messing with me.

323
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,380
I can't help you guys.

324
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,460
Hong.

325
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,540
Let me ask you,

326
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,260
do you have the key to the lock

327
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,100
that locks Glasses' hands?

328
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,820
No.

329
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,740
Who has it then?

330
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,340
There's a stupid fat guy.

331
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,100
He has it.

332
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,220
I am not talking about you!

333
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,260
A guard in our team is also quite fat.

334
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,100
I don't have the key.

335
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,300
Fine.

336
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,980
You must help us

337
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,380
to find that key now.

338
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,620
Then you need to tell me

339
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,380
where Bai Haotian is detained.

340
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,940
Bai Haotian? I don't know where she is.

341
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,020
Umm,

342
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,380
I can get the key for you.

343
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,740
But I have one condition.

344
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,740
After I get the key back,

345
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,740
you must take me with you guys when you leave.

346
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,540
I can't stay in this place for another second.

347
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,100
A piece of cake.

348
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,340
We've been friends for years, right?

349
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,180
Let's help him.

350
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,940
Let's drink together and

351
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,100
escape together.

352
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:28,780
No problem.

353
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,420
How many times have you lied to me?

354
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,540
Don't you lie to me again this time.

355
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,100
I never lie to people.

356
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,260
Give me that wine.

357
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,500
Why?

358
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,580
You want to have some Dutch courage?

359
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,980
Guys, come on.

360
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,140
Cheers!

361
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,900
This wine is good.

362
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,740
You're a bit tipsy now.

363
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,900
Look how you pour the wine.

364
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,020
Drink more.

365
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,540
Good wine.

366
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,420
Drink it.

367
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,540
Top the glass.

368
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,540
This is the last few drops.

369
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
Come on.

370
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,340
We almost finish the whole bottle.

371
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,820
Almost there.

372
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,380
Almost…

373
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,980
Enough.

374
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,180
You are not drinking?

375
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,460
You are not drinking?

376
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,220
I'll pour you some more.

377
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,380
Are you alright?

378
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,380
Is he alright?

379
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,740
Didn't you say you are a three-bottle guy?

380
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,220
Come on.

381
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:24,980
The rest is mine.

382
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,740
Nailed it.

383
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,380
If I'm caught, they'll kill me.

384
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,100
Let's get out of here!

385
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:46,860
Wait.

386
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,820
Don't lie to me this time.

387
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,740
Or I'll break our old friendship

388
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,260
and let you guys take all the blame.

389
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,260
Don't try to ditch me.

390
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,740
Of course not!

391
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,820
We can't let Hong break our old friendship.

392
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,420
We won't lie to people.

393
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,500
Surely not, Hong.

394
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:04,940
Let's go.

395
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,580
But you are not "people".

396
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:07,740
I…

397
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,460
Why do you still not understand

398
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,220
after so many times?

399
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,460
We won't let you leave with us

400
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,980
because we want to save your life.

401
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,700
Kylin.

402
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,900
You go save Glasses.

403
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,740
Fatty

404
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,380
and I will get Liu Sang and Bai Haotian out.

405
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,060
Baby.

406
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,020
I have wanted to sleep with you for a long time.

407
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
Go away!

408
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,340
Go away!

409
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,380
Go away!

410
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,060
Pooh!

411
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,500
I…

412
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,980
Do you want to die?

413
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,340
Didn't Jiang Ziyan tell you

414
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,300
Wu Xie's women

415
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,460
never ended well?

416
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,940
Do you regret it that

417
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,060
you didn't listen to him?

418
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,940
That's too late.

419
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,100
You will end up

420
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,060
like my sister.

421
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,620
No!

422
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,620
Don't move.

423
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,660
Wait for Kylin's signal.

424
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,620
After we get Liu Sang,

425
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,820
you take Liu Sang to find Kylin immediately.

426
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:33,580
Okay.

427
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,420
I'll save Bai Haotian.

428
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,860
Kylin is on the move!

429
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,460
Go!

430
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:56,740
Liu Sang.

431
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,260
Are you alright?

432
00:27:59,420 --> 00:27:59,820
Sang.

433
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:00,740
Where's Bai Haotian?

434
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,060
She's in danger! Hurry up!

435
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,180
Go away!

436
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,540
Go away!

437
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,140
Help.

438
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,660
Help!

439
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:05,940
Let's go.

440
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:15,980
Someone broke in.

441
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,900
What's going on?

442
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,300
Wu Xie took Bai Haotian with him.

443
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:48,860
Get them back!

444
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,300
Where is Wu Xie?

445
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,980
Wu Xie went to rescue Bai.

446
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,260
You guys wait here.

447
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,380
I have to find them.

448
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,020
Go.

449
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,660
Naive.

450
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,620
Hurry!

451
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,180
Freeze!

452
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,740
Is everyone okay?

453
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,980
I knew you would come to save me.

454
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,260
Actually, Chief saved you.

455
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,820
This is not the time to argue about this!

456
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,700
I am here. You guys will be fine!

457
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,780
Old soldiers never die.

458
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:06,740
What happened?

459
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,500
Whose blood is this?

460
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,060
Fatty!

461
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,580
Fatty!

462
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,340
Come on.

463
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
Get him here.

464
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,300
Sit here.

465
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,500
What happened?

466
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,220
What's going on?

467
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,860
You got shot.

468
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,500
I won' t make it.

469
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,420
Naive.

470
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,020
I didn't expect that

471
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,860
I'll die before you.

472
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,380
I'll be waiting for you

473
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,180
-in another world.
-Stop talking.

474
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,820
Kylin.

475
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,180
You are the one I worry about the most.

476
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,620
After the two of us die,

477
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,100
you'll be left alone.

478
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,900
But no matter

479
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,980
how many years later you will die,

480
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,900
we'll be waiting for you with bouquet there.

481
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,060
I really want to live another five hundred years…

482
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,820
It's just a scratch.

483
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,300
Stop talking nonsense.

484
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,180
Take it.

485
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,620
Hold the gauze and press your wound.

486
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,220
According to the instructions of Uncle Sanxing,

487
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,860
we can follow the direction of the canal

488
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,940
to find the entrance of Thunder City.

489
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,500
Let's go.

490
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,340
Hold me up.

491
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,260
I thought you're not hurt seriously.

492
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,140
My hand is hurt.

493
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,380
Kylin.

494
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,860
Kylin, here.

495
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,980
Are you okay?

496
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,340
I am fine.

497
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,300
Come on.

498
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,220
Hurry up, Glasses!

499
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,490
Chief, after you.

500
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,300
There is a door here.

501
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,660
Come on!

502
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,930
Fatty.

503
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,780
These pagodas are all connected to each other.

504
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,580
Someone is coming.

505
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,580
Let's go!

506
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,820
This way.

507
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,420
It's a dead end.

508
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,220
We hit a dead end.

509
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,420
There's no exit.

510
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,300
There is tunnel under the water.

511
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,820
How did you know that?

512
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,540
The scene painted on the mural we saw earlier.

513
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,020
I'll go down and have a look first.

514
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,380
Someone is coming.

515
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,940
Be careful.

516
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,980
Bai.

517
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:12,940
Naive!

518
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,940
Bai!

519
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,300
Bai!

520
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,180
Bai!

521
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,220
Where's the mechanism?

522
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,940
Where is the switch?

523
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,740
Bai!

524
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,500
Bai!

525
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,780
Hide. Come on!

526
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,300
It is impolite not to reciprocate.

527
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,100
Let me give you a big gift!

528
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,220
Come on.

529
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,620
Bai.

530
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,300
There is indeed a tunnel underwater.

531
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,100
Hurry.

532
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,180
Retreat.

533
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,580
Go into the water.

534
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,300
Go.

535
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,180
Let me give you another big gift!

536
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,980
What's inside like?

537
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,420
The passage inside is blocked by them.

538
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,980
Even if we start digging now,

539
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,860
it'll take more than ten days to get through.

540
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,740
The accesses to Thunder City

541
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,780
must be more than just one underwater tunnel.

542
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,300
There must be another way that

543
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,860
leads to Thunder City.

544
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,980
It surprised me that

545
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,380
that tunnel leads to this side of the mountain.

546
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,420
This place looks pretty safe.

547
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,820
I like it here.

548
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,620
I don't know where we are.

549
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,580
But anyway, there is meat, so we won't starve.

550
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,380
Fatty.

551
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,420
Do you remember that mural?

552
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,460
I think we got

553
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,900
to the other side of the mountain from the waterway painted in the mural.

554
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,420
This is probably...

555
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,380
Thunder City.

556
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,860
Yes.

557
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,340
This place is Thunder City.

558
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,780
I looked around.

559
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,100
The terrain here is exactly the same as the mural.

560
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,260
But this place is only just the perimeter of the city.

561
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,460
As for the main city,

562
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,860
we still need to look for it.

563
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,580
So let's spend some time

564
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,700
to study the terrain to

565
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,820
find the general direction of the inner city.

566
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,580
Take a break.

567
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,340
Let's set up a bonfire to warm up.

568
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,700
Sang.

569
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,580
Sang.

570
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,660
Give me a hand.
