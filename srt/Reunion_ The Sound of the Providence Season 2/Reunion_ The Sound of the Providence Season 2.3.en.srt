Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,510
Episode 3

4
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:11,890
Hello, everyone.

5
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,489
I'm Ding Gen, the newly appointed director of Warehouse 11.

6
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:20,250
It's an honor for me to be promoted to L14

7
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,010
and to work with you.

8
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,890
I hope we can work well together

9
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,570
in the following days.

10
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,530
Thank you all.

11
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,050
Thank you

12
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:31,810
Good.

13
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,890
Tian Youjin didn't allow Wu Sanxing to show that person out.

14
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,010
Being afraid that he couldn't make it out of there,

15
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,090
Wu Sanxing found a camera

16
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,610
with which he recorded what Tian Youjin did

17
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,530
as the clue for newcomers

18
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,130
to find out the truth.

19
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,920
Trapped there,

20
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,050
Wu Sanxing has been a keen observer

21
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,640
of the person they were looking for.

22
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,090
That person was a nobody in the warehouse,

23
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,210
who was listening to thunder whispers in the section of unredeemable goods.

24
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,480
Wu Sanxing recorded with his camera

25
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,250
the weird acts of that person.

26
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,960
After a long time,

27
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,250
he found that person was always listening to thunder.

28
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,130
It was said that the source of providence was in an ancient kingdom in the South Sea.

29
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,170
Sanxing thought

30
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,610
it was a significant archeological discovery.

31
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,050
Therefore, he took that person out of there

32
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,770
through the passage created by Tian Youjin.

33
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,600
Later, he organized an archaeological team

34
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,250
to visit the South Sea King's Tomb.

35
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,090
We finally made it.

36
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,970
That's the origin of Project 044.

37
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,080
I heard that they suffered a lot

38
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,130
in the tomb

39
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,210
and got to know the existence of Thunder City.

40
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,730
When they got out of the tomb,

41
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,800
it was those pseudo weather observers that welcomed them.

42
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,929
Holding Yang Daguang and Mu Xuehai as hostages,

43
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:26,929
they forced Sanxing to do research on and find Thunder City.

44
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,210
Yang Daguang died and Mu Xuehai went mad.

45
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,050
Sanxing was compelled

46
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,520
to bring the team to Thunder City.

47
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,009
So it was true that Uncle Sanxing was forced to go there.

48
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,130
A few days ago, I received a message

49
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,840
from Sanxing out of the blue,

50
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,210
saying that he went to Thunder City under threat.

51
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,370
That message seems to be a cry for help.

52
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,450
He talked a lot about you back then.

53
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,730
Now, you came here

54
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,210
by following my clues,

55
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,170
which proved you're competent.

56
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,050
Now go to Thunder City to find him.

57
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,480
You should have asked me to go to Thunder City directly.

58
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,370
Going directly to Thunder City without coming here first

59
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,010
would mean certain death.

60
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,970
Alright,

61
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,890
now you can have

62
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,160
your final award.

63
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,770
You've been looking for information

64
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,010
about Thunder City, haven't you?

65
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,240
Follow me.

66
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,080
I'll show you the place

67
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,330
Sanxing once lived in.

68
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,370
No one knew

69
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,930
what was on his mind.

70
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,920
You're his nephew and you were close to him.

71
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,290
You are supposed to know him better than I do.

72
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,200
I hope you can find him in Thunder City

73
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,930
and save him.

74
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,850
My job is done here.

75
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,210
Mr. Third Junior,

76
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,800
what are these paintings about?

77
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,930
Timelines and coordinate systems.

78
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,520
And some topographic maps.

79
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,600
Whoever enters Thunder City

80
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,730
will have no more regrets.

81
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,960
The ritual implement does exist.

82
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,560
Wu Xie,

83
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,280
you repeatedly broke the rules of Warehouse 11

84
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,090
by visiting the section of unredeemable goods without approval.

85
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,680
However, such fault is offset

86
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,930
with your contribution to Warehouse 11.

87
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,759
Now, you're fired.

88
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,210
Bai Haotian is provisionally suspended.

89
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,980
<i>To Bai: Hope you find a boyfriend soon. By Wu Xie</i>

90
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,850
To Bai: Hope you find a boyfriend soon.

91
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,170
It seems you haven't washed that clothes ever since.

92
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,160
But you're leaving

93
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,170
even before I find a boyfriend.

94
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,200
How are you supposed to find a boyfriend

95
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,570
if you never leave Warehouse 11?

96
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,130
You might want to travel around.

97
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,850
But I belong to Warehouse 11.

98
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,250
I'm not going anywhere else.

99
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,320
Then,

100
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,170
take care of yourself.

101
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,370
Thank you.

102
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,920
Thank you for what you did for me.

103
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
Mr. Third Junior,

104
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,800
your departure from Warehouse 11

105
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,680
requires my approval.

106
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,570
Will you come back to file the application?

107
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,530
When will you come back?

108
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,880
Are you a drama queen?

109
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,840
Why are you crying?

110
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,450
I'm inviting you to dinner tomorrow.

111
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,800
I've got some questions for you.

112
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,570
Close the warehouse.

113
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,940
Welcome to the free world!

114
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,250
That's all you've found after all this time?

115
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,600
Just these photos?

116
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,680
The best thing is

117
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,680
that we learned about what really happened.

118
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,570
And the cause of the repeating thunder whispers

119
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,040
in the photos.

120
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,680
That's good enough.

121
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,450
I thought Uncle Sanxing went to the underground river.

122
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,960
How could he send messages

123
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,600
to you and Wang Junyi?

124
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,880
Is he dead or not?

125
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Wang Junyi thought Uncle Sanxing was crying for help.

126
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,040
Isn't he trapped in Thunder City?

127
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,480
There is even cell phone service in Thunder City?

128
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,050
That's impressive.

129
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,690
The message sounds just like him.

130
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,840
But I'm not sure if it is him.

131
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,410
I don't have time to check it out.

132
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,720
It seems you have to believe it.

133
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,600
Fine,

134
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,120
let's play it by ear.

135
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,960
These photos were stuck by Uncle Sanxing

136
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,160
to the wall

137
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,800
in the section of unredeemable goods.

138
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,850
It seems he was looking for something.

139
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
The more you look at it, the more confused you become.

140
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,840
These are all kinds of mountains.

141
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,970
It seems he was looking for a valley.

142
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Is Thunder City located in a valley?

143
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,210
It was in the South Sea King's Tomb

144
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,280
that Uncle Sanxing saw the map of Thunder City.

145
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,490
If the pictures he posted in Warehouse 11

146
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,280
directly point to Thunder City,

147
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,000
he wouldn't need to go to the South Sea King's Tomb.

148
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,810
So, these clues

149
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,280
do not directly lead to Thunder City,

150
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,920
or the South Sea King's Tomb.

151
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,290
Is there any place

152
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
that we may have ignored?

153
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,450
This place enjoys good Feng Shui.

154
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,880
It seems to be a burial ground.

155
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,250
We don't get cell phone reception here.

156
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,920
I think this is the weather station.

157
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,210
Weather…weather station?

158
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,520
Uncle Sanxing asked me to go there

159
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,960
not only to see Yang Daguang.

160
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,880
He must have left some key clues,

161
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,560
which we missed because we were frightened

162
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,560
by Yang Daguang and the tape.

163
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,000
Let's go to the weather station now.

164
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,720
Are you free tonight?

165
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,210
Come and have dinner at my place.

166
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,320
What makes you so happy?

167
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,720
Today is a good day.

168
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,320
But tomorrow is even better.

169
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,280
So, perhaps we should

170
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,520
make some preparation today.

171
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,400
It's a big deal, after all.

172
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,330
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

173
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,240
The early morning.

174
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,610
It's like that old saying, "the earlier, the better".

175
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,080
Don't you think so?

176
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,360
We'll go to the weather station tomorrow.

177
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,160
You're gonna have to do one more thing for me

178
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,800
if you really want to save your daughter.

179
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,930
That is, persuading Fatty

180
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,480
into betraying Wu Xie

181
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,560
and working for me.

182
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,680
I don't think I can do that.

183
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,400
You're a woman.

184
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,880
A pretty woman.

185
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,160
Surely you can do it.

186
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,560
These days, I've been…

187
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,440
I'm thrilled.

188
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,930
Why do I feel so hot here?

189
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,890
Do you have a crush on me?

190
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,280
Well…

191
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,560
let's forget it. I'll drink it.

192
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
I wasn't hesitating.

193
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,090
I… I…

194
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,930
I'd better be standing when I say the following words.

195
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,280
Piaopiao.

196
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,880
I have a crush on you!

197
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,320
I have a crush on you!

198
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,880
I have a crush on you!

199
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,040
Come on!

200
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,720
That's hilarious!

201
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,520
Where is my chair?

202
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,800
Well.

203
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,800
Don't cry, baby
Stars are shining

204
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:19,400
Light from afar warms up the path

205
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,460
When you see the warm, bright, soft light from the stars

206
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:31,310
You should go look for it bravely

207
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:36,680
It's a mixture of bitterness and sweetness

208
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,110
You're waiting for someone's steps

209
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,780
Sometimes you want to cry when you smile

210
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:55,030
Let's cry
Let's forget

211
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:00,650
Look at the shining stars in the sky

212
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,210
They seem to understand your words

213
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:13,169
Don't be surprised
Don't be frightened

214
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,879
Let me get a candle.

215
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:24,919
Are you alright?

216
00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:26,919
Did you hurt yourself?

217
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,080
I'm not sure.

218
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:29,350
Let me have a look.

219
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,960
Are you alright?

220
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,600
I'm alright.

221
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,680
Let me have a look. Let me have a look.

222
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,480
Does it hurt?

223
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,440
Is it here? Does it hurt?

224
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,840
I'm sorry.

225
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,000
I really want to

226
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,480
take good care of you.

227
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,040
It's just

228
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,960
that my friend is in trouble.

229
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,800
It's not right for me to enjoy my life

230
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,120
and watch him suffer.

231
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,930
That wouldn't be honorable.

232
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,240
When things come to an end,

233
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,120
I'll come back

234
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,840
and…

235
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,800
Well…

236
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,800
I'll start a new life with you.

237
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,960
Would that be okay

238
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,450
for you?

239
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,490
You're all alone,

240
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,320
with some much trouble.

241
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,600
That's too hard for you.

242
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,400
It would be better

243
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,160
if you got a man to help you.

244
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,370
Anyway,

245
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,640
feel free to contact me

246
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,320
if you need any help.

247
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,570
See you.

248
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,480
I should tell you something.

249
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,440
For Mei's operation, we still need to work on it.

250
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,680
We've found a donor.

251
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,250
But we still need to wait in line for the operation.

252
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,520
Let's split up the workload.

253
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,770
You go to the hospital

254
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,360
to do the talking

255
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,600
and to take care of Mei.

256
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,010
I go to the donator

257
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,450
to persuade him

258
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,410
into having the operation soon.

259
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,850
What do you say?

260
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,080
It was you who went to the hospital

261
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,040
for the matching?

262
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,720
I guess I could do that

263
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,480
without telling you first.

264
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,680
Why didn't you tell me that?

265
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,760
Why didn't you tell me that?

266
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,410
Alright, alright.

267
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,200
Alright.

268
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,840
It was my fault.

269
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,280
I should have told you that.

270
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,410
Listen,

271
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,440
Xue is really an asshole.

272
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,840
Don't go to his place since tomorrow.

273
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,970
You may spend some time with Mei

274
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
at another place.

275
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,400
I'll take you back

276
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,280
after solving the problems.

277
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,570
You smashed his place

278
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,000
and destroyed all his antiques.

279
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,560
Do you think he'll let you off the hook?

280
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,280
He'd think of all the ways to ruin you.

281
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,600
No big deal.

282
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,800
I got it.

283
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,720
You'll be fine.

284
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,680
Kylin,

285
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,760
Fatty,

286
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,570
you know what,

287
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm closest to my uncle this time.

288
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,880
He truly was compelled to do that.

289
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,840
I think I'm about to…

290
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,920
Why haven't they finished drinking yet?

291
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,680
I still need to continue down his path.

292
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,840
Let's call his friend,

293
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,440
asking him to take them away.

294
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,450
He had so much to tell me.

295
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,680
I totally understand you.

296
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,720
That's why I have a huge crush on you.

297
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,160
Are they drunk?

298
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,280
Almost.

299
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,240
How much do I owe you?

300
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,760
Two hundred and twenty yuan.

301
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,080
You only need to pay two hundred yuan.

302
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,490
Here is three hundred yuan. Keep the change.

303
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,320
Thank you.

304
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,240
What's going on here?

305
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,280
Wake up, wake up. Are you alright?

306
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,800
Fatty.

307
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,890
Why did you drink so much?

308
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:55,920
I miss you so much.

309
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,310
Where is Kylin?

310
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:59,310
Kylin?

311
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:00,830
He is not Kylin.

312
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,880
Let me introduce her to you.

313
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,790
You must be Fatty!

314
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,070
Am I right?

315
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,040
You're so famous.

316
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,950
Who is this guy?

317
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,070
What are you talking about?

318
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,430
Do I look like a boy to you?

319
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,870
It's not that obvious, but…

320
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,150
Bai.

321
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,390
Bai.

322
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,710
This is Bai. Bai Haotian.

323
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,870
Bai Haotian from Warehouse 11.

324
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,480
My, my, my, the spider and the fly.

325
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,350
Look how drunk my friend is.

326
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,150
She is awesome.

327
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,590
She really is awesome.

328
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,390
Who won?

329
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,590
Me! Me!

330
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,470
Bai! Bai! Bai!

331
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,230
Listen…

332
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,790
That's enough. That's enough.

333
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,470
He is my best buddy.

334
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,630
Fatty is my best buddy.

335
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,270
I got it.

336
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,910
He accompanied me to the most dangerous places.

337
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

338
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,030
He'd always be by my side.

339
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:39,830
Yeah.

340
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,910
Along the journey,

341
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,670
I met

342
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,750
a lot of friends,

343
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,600
none of them accompanied me to the end.

344
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,710
But you did it.

345
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,200
Come on, you're gonna make me cry.

346
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,030
Let's go. Let's go.

347
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,030
I mean it. Fatty is the only one who did it.

348
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,990
He is the only one who did it.

349
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,390
He'd support me

350
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,550
for everything I do, every choice I make.

351
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,270
I'd support you, too.

352
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,350
Alright, alright.

353
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,230
Alright, alright.

354
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,070
That's enough.

355
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,710
Dude, dude.

356
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,590
Alright, alright.

357
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,070
You're drunk. You're drunk.

358
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,670
Come on.

359
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,760
It's okay.

360
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,350
Let's go back home. No, no, no.

361
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,430
Okay? Come back!

362
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,830
Listen, I want to

363
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,790
take this chance to…

364
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,550
What are you doing?

365
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,510
I want to take this chance to

366
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,470
have a drink with you.

367
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,390
We haven't had drinks together

368
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,990
for a long time,

369
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:18,710
have we?

370
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,630
Come on, here is a toast to you.

371
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,550
Yeah.

372
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,230
A toast to you.

373
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,070
Come on, bottoms up.

374
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,720
Let's be there for each other

375
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,240
in this mundane world.

376
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,230
Who are you?

377
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,270
Who are you?

378
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:35,950
-Who are you?
-Bai!

379
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,710
-Who are you?
-Bai!

380
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,950
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?

381
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,910
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?

382
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:40,830
Who are you?

383
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,070
What are you doing?

384
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,310
It's okay. Calm down. Calm down.

385
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,990
Who are you?

386
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,070
Sis,

387
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,230
what are you doing?

388
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,550
Who is your sis?

389
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,110
Why are you in our bed?

390
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,470
Don't you remember it?

391
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,630
Last night…

392
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,670
That's not true. What are you talking about?

393
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,790
What are you talking about?

394
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,390
I asked you not to come but you insisted.

395
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,510
You said you must do something or you'd be worried.

396
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,640
What do you mean by that?

397
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,430
Now I see, you're not here to do something.

398
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,350
You're here to do someone.

399
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,590
I carried you to the sofa last night.

400
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,790
How did you make it to our bed?

401
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,830
Are you still gonna deny it?

402
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,630
Are you gonna deny it because you got drunk?

403
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,310
I just knew it.

404
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,550
Are you still gonna deny it?

405
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,000
I have evidence.

406
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,110
I recorded it.

407
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,550
Here is the video.

408
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:24,430
Check it out for yourself.

409
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,190
Today, Wu, Bai, Fatty,

410
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:36,350
the three of us become sworn brothers and sisters.

411
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,270
Hear, hear.

412
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,510
We'd eat kebabs together.

413
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,550
Yeah!

414
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,670
We'd drink wine together.

415
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,070
Yeah!

416
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,710
Along with Uncle Sanxing.

417
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,680
Today, Wu, Bai, Fatty,

418
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:56,790
the three of us become sworn brothers and sisters.

419
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,550
Hear, hear.

420
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,710
We'd eat kebabs together.

421
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,320
Yeah!

422
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,830
Yeah!

423
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,870
We'd drink wine together.

424
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,350
Yeah!

425
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:04,830
Yeah!

426
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,430
We'd go look for Uncle Sanxing together.

427
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,350
Let's raise our head.

428
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,750
We'd be best buddies.

429
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:16,830
Where should we put these kebabs?

430
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,760
Here, here.

431
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,470
Here.

432
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,710
We'd be doomed if we betray each other.

433
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,190
Come on, let me have a look.

434
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,150
-I'm so happy!
-Let me have a look.

435
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,750
Is it okay for you?

436
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,790
Let's go. Let's go.

437
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,560
Let's go.

438
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,910
Let's go look for Uncle Sanxing. Let's go look for Uncle Sanxing.

439
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,550
This is my fourth sister.

440
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,240
This is my third brother.

441
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,870
You're drunk.

442
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,830
Why do you keep moving?

443
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,430
Why do you keep moving

444
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,550
even when you are in your seat.

445
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,710
You really are drunk.

446
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,950
Be nice to me.

447
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,960
Love me.

448
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,710
When I get married…

449
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,190
I'll give you one day off when you get married.

450
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,350
I'll give you a big bonus check when you get married.

451
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,270
I need to use the bathroom.

452
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,550
I don't want to be your sister.

453
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,510
I don't want to be your sister.

454
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,230
It seems you do have a big crush on him,

455
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,030
something unstoppable in the world.

456
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,870
You're impressed by yourself.

457
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,990
Sis,

458
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,160
I'm afraid it's too late.

459
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,190
It's no use regretting now.

460
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,830
We already became sworn brothers and sisters

461
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,310
after taking vows and burning the incense.

462
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,270
That's not true.

463
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,190
We burned kebabs, not incense.

464
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,630
The man you hold in your arms

465
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,750
is your third brother, understand?

466
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,230
You're not supposed to have feelings for him.

467
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,870
I, the hot guy talking to you,

468
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,270
am your second brother.

469
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,190
Please feel free to have feelings for me.

470
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,520
Your big brother is not here today.

471
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,670
He is awesome.

472
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,950
Big brother? He is even elder than you?

473
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,550
Yep.

474
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,150
It's called maturity, okay?

475
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,110
In your big brother, you see sincerity.

476
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,920
Come on, our big brother is definitely mature.

477
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,390
Absolutely elder than him.

478
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,790
Absolutely.

479
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,390
I, I need to use the bathroom.

480
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,030
I'm really…

481
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,310
Please don't go.

482
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,950
Anyway,

483
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,750
though our big brother is not here today,

484
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:11,150
the four of us have finally become family.

485
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,070
We should do our business now.

486
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,030
Do our business?

487
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,600
Yeah.

488
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,230
Yeah.

489
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,510
Do our business.

490
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,790
What business?

491
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,190
What business?

492
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,510
Our business is…

493
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,830
I want to go to the bathroom first.

494
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,710
Sis.

495
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,170
Director Zhao,

496
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,420
the operation went well.

497
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,450
Sorry for the delay.

498
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,770
Okay.

499
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,610
See you in two days. Okay.

500
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,770
Have some tea.

501
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:49,890
Thank you.

502
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,050
Doctor Xie,

503
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,850
do you have news of Glasses?

504
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,450
I want to talk to him.

505
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,810
He is a man

506
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,330
without plans.

507
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,970
What matters now is that your throat gets better.

508
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,290
Don't worry about him.

509
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,810
Don't wait for him.

510
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,890
Did he tell you something?

511
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,410
I heard that he turned you down.

512
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,050
He told me that we belong to two different worlds.

513
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,650
We're in a modern world today.

514
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,370
How could he turn me down using such excuses?

515
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,330
It seems you don't know him well.

516
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,930
You're right.

517
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,780
Ever since I met him,

518
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,770
I had the feeling that I never got to know him.

519
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,810
Would you mind telling me

520
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,210
about yourselves?

521
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,170
Our ancestors

522
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,570
worked in the underground world.

523
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,890
Now, our job is about

524
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,170
archaeology and historic preservation.

525
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,050
It's a dangerous job.

526
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,410
It's not surprising that he turned you down.

527
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,970
You mean archaeology and historic preservation?

528
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,490
He is right.

529
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,580
You two are from different worlds.

530
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,330
I don't care.

531
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,250
Besides,

532
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,370
there is no such rule

533
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,170
that people from different worlds

534
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,890
shouldn't fall in love with each other, right?

535
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,130
For those who are not afraid to die,

536
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,610
nothing in the world

537
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,610
would be a threat to them.

538
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:34,980
That's why

539
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,370
they wouldn't waste their time

540
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,090
on a relationship.

541
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,610
That's not true.

542
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,490
Doctor Xie,

543
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,410
thank you for telling me so much.

544
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,530
Even if what you said is true,

545
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,580
I don't want to give up.

546
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,010
I want to say something to him

547
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,210
face to face.

548
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,850
Thank you for curing my throat.

549
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,020
These days,

550
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,660
you took good care of me.

551
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,450
Now, I need to go back to the company to report on my work.

552
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,900
He asked me

553
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,210
to protect you.

554
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,250
So, you're gonna stay here without going anywhere.

555
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,370
Mr. Jiao wouldn't let you off easily.

556
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,660
I'll find a way

557
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,860
to handle his threat and keep you out of this.

558
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,290
Thank you for your kindness.

559
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,410
Don't worry.

560
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,490
I'm an adult.

561
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,050
I can take care of myself.

562
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,770
You can tell

563
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,730
why we belong to different worlds

564
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,450
by watching how much I would do

565
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,250
for things

566
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,970
he asked me to do.

567
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,890
Doctor Xie, take care.

568
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,770
Darlings, I'm back.

569
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,090
Guys, I'm back.

570
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,530
Bro, hurry up.

571
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,210
Welcome, welcome.

572
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,340
Thank you for all you've done.

573
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,650
Thank you. Thank you.

574
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,490
Let's send a warm welcome to Chu!

575
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,330
Welcome! You have a beautiful voice.

576
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,330
You're cured. You're cured.

577
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,170
You have a good voice.

578
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:54,900
You're cured.

579
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,690
Here is the wine.

580
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,610
Come on.

581
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:57,730
Come on.

582
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,500
Guys, I want to say something.

583
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,410
First,

584
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,770
welcome Chu

585
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:04,250
to bring our team back.

586
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:04,890
Great!

587
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,490
Second…

588
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:05,860
Great!

589
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,450
My sister,

590
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,210
your workmate,

591
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,970
can speak now.

592
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,530
We have two things to celebrate.

593
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,010
Cheers!

594
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,210
Cheers!

595
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,650
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

596
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:19,780
We should emphasize

597
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,050
the difference.

598
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,090
And amplify the effect.

599
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,890
The third thing is color tone.

600
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:25,970
The color tone

601
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,050
is still not good enough to me.

602
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,100
Make the background music louder.

603
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,610
I want to create a certain ambiance for this part.

604
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,490
Cheers!

605
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,850
Cheers!

606
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,690
Cheers!

607
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,610
Drink it up. Drink it up.

608
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,770
Great!

609
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,810
Awesome!

610
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,290
Cool!

611
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,290
Here is the cake.

612
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,330
Hurry up. Hurry up.

613
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,450
Hurry up. Look.

614
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:54,650
Come on, stop it.

615
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:55,409
Get off my back.

616
00:34:58,810 --> 00:34:59,489
Do I know you?

617
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,340
I'm sorry.

618
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,210
I'm sorry.

619
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,330
Fatty,

620
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,370
do you remember

621
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,050
how many times

622
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,610
along our journey

623
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,850
we've heard information from thunder whispers?

624
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,730
The first time was on the ship in South Sea King's Tomb.

625
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,890
You went crazy on hearing thunder.

626
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,290
Hey,

627
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,050
where is hotpot?

628
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:34,450
Where is hotpot?

629
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,250
What are you talking about?

630
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,290
Sis, I have something to tell you.

631
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,370
She is sleeping. Just leave her alone.

632
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,660
I'll tell her about it later.

633
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,170
Another time was at Yang Daguang's cave of treasure.

634
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,530
The thunderclaps were so horrible

635
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,290
that we almost got ourselves killed there.

636
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,370
So,

637
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,330
we were equipped

638
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,010
both times.

639
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,290
Then, what about this time?

640
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,570
What am I going to use this time?

641
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,250
Hey,

642
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,530
it's kind of like visiting an old place.

643
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,370
Thanks.

644
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,460
Uncle Sanxing should have expected

645
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,570
that we ignored something last time.

646
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:31,890
Let's look carefully.

647
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,850
Let's look carefully.

648
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,570
Sis,

649
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,170
let me show you around.

650
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:35,970
Follow me.

651
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,580
Let's go.

652
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,450
These old appliances were repaired and renovated.

653
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,090
There should have been more.

654
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,530
Some of them were abandoned and removed.

655
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,570
There are mosquitoes here.

656
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,210
You might need insect repellent.

657
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,090
Hey, I get jealous of him.

658
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,890
I'm bigger in size than him.

659
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,610
You should get me insect repellent instead, sis.

660
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,850
Don't call me sis.

661
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:18,610
But you're…

662
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,810
What are you doing?

663
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,930
Stay out of this.

664
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:24,850
Get down here.

665
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,490
You wait there.

666
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,610
Why are wiring stealers so furious these days?

667
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,490
Perhaps I should teach them a lesson.

668
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,250
I might need to use this later.

669
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,010
You're weak. You're a girl.

670
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,090
Just get some rest over there.

671
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,170
Are you sure you can take care of this?

672
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,930
I don't want to waste our time.

673
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,610
You have two minutes for this.

674
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,620
-That's too long.
 -Bai, let's go.

675
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,530
We are in charge of this area.

676
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,690
Who are you to scold us?

677
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,690
Is there any wrong with that?

678
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,090
Look, you got a mosquito there.

679
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,210
I'm surprised that you're so weak.

680
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,850
I haven't enjoyed myself enough yet.

681
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,450
How about we fight again?

682
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,170
Is that all you've got?

683
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,010
Alright, Fatty, let's do our business.

684
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:17,570
In a second.

685
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,010
Today is you lucky day.

686
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,930
I'm a nice person.

687
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,370
I give you a chance to make things right.

688
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,410
I want you to find something for me in the garden.

689
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,330
Okay.

690
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,410
Spare no effort in finding that thing.

691
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:33,930
Do you understand?

692
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:34,650
Understood, understood.

693
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,530
Hurry up. Go, go, go.

694
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:36,650
Stop!

695
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,570
Where are you going? Do you know what you're looking for?

696
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,250
Why are you so stupid? Take this!

697
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,130
Hurry up!

698
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,090
Hurry up! Let's go! Hurry up!

699
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,060
Bro! Bro!

700
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,890
It seems we found something here.

701
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:20,610
Do you hear that?

702
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,250
Yeah.

703
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,660
Let's go. That's a horrible scream.

704
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:26,890
Good job. You're free to go now.

705
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,330
Thanks. Thanks.

706
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,530
Go, go, go. Let's go.

707
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:34,690
Fatty.

708
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,690
Southern Weather Bureau.

709
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,010
Look.

710
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,010
Yeah.

711
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,330
Look.

712
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,090
I found something there.

713
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:58,850
An urn.

714
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,450
A wine urn?

715
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,370
This is an urn for bone ash.

716
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,290
Why is it here?

717
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,890
Uncle Sanxing saw that horde of tomb raiders

718
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,800
doing rituals outside the ancient tomb

719
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,730
and learned their method.

720
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,970
Do you mean

721
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,930
that those tomb raiders had also been here?

722
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:23,920
Maybe.

723
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:25,930
Fatty,

724
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,890
check if there is something else.

725
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,450
Nope.

726
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:32,770
Come on.

727
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,250
Let's keep looking.

728
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:55,970
Where are you going?

729
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,490
Well, it seems Uncle Sanxing…

730
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,440
-Was it for…
 -I'm coming.

731
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,650
What did you see?
