Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Episode 27

4
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,300
If you meet Wu Xie's people,

5
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,580
don't hesitate.

6
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:05,500
Kill them on the spot.

7
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,140
Yes, sir.

8
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,900
These are the location numbers of the goods deposited

9
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,779
in the section of unredeemable goods

10
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,460
by Mr. Erjing who

11
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,620
took advantage of Wu Erbai's business transactions

12
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,740
They are our trophies.

13
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,940
The bronze reeds in Ganyin section are especially important.

14
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,020
You must find them.

15
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,620
There are also a lot of gears and weapons stored here in advance.

16
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,580
Bring all of them.

17
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,500
Remember,

18
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,340
after you enter the section of unredeemable goods,

19
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,860
fan out to find these items.

20
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,300
Bring things you found with you.

21
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,660
Then we'll assemble again after that.

22
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,860
Did I make myself clear?

23
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,180
Yes, sir!

24
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,060
Yes, sir!

25
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,500
Let's set off.

26
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,300
Stack all these gears nicely.

27
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,460
Okay, man your post!

28
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,740
Everything's all here.

29
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,900
You, take eight people to come with me.

30
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,420
The rest of people will carry the goods and

31
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,540
keep a distance of

32
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,780
probably two kilometers with us.

33
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,500
Remember,

34
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,340
Liu Sang is with them.

35
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,180
So don't say a word.

36
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,980
Once we get closer to them,

37
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,860
I will signal you to shoot arrows together.

38
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,180
Then I will run to them and tell them that

39
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,700
someone is hunting us down.

40
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,780
Then Zhang Qiling will come after you guys.

41
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,500
This is the time you can lure him away from others.

42
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,500
Remember the location of places with such a mark.

43
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,420
Because this mark

44
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,900
means it's hollow under the ground.

45
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,340
I will put some expander in the space below.

46
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,780
When he is lured to come to such a place,

47
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,580
we just ignite the agent to collapse the tunnel.

48
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,860
This can separate him from Wu Xie.

49
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,900
Do you understand?

50
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,140
Yes, sir!

51
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,900
Now split up and take action.

52
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,140
Something is coming.

53
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,860
What is it?

54
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,660
Seems to be human beings.

55
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,580
Uncle Erjing?

56
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,540
What are you guys doing here?

57
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,580
He made a move.

58
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,660
Who?

59
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,540
The spy.

60
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,780
That spy took actions and

61
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,660
your plan has been revealed.

62
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,180
We were chased by them all the way

63
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,980
to here.

64
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,740
Liu Sang.

65
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,420
How many people do they have?

66
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,500
I can hear more than a dozen people, with sniper crossbows.

67
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,460
There are more people in the distance.

68
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,660
But I can't hear their movements clearly.

69
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,940
We're surrounded.

70
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,380
We are outnumbered.

71
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,340
Which direction is guarded by the least people?

72
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,100
That direction.

73
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,660
Then let's break through from there.

74
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,580
Uncle Erjing, what weapons do you guys bring with you?

75
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,060
We didn't have the time to bring any.

76
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,580
They seemed to get their weapons

77
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,380
from Warehouse 11.

78
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,620
It seems that they are very familiar with this place.

79
00:07:59,180 --> 00:07:59,540
Kylin.

80
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:23,740
Let's go!

81
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,940
I'm fine. I'll meet you later when I have the chance.

82
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,540
Kylin is fine.

83
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,420
Chief is fine. But we are not.

84
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,700
They have narrowed the encirclement.

85
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,060
The reeds are gone.

86
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,140
We can't kill them yet.

87
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,740
They stop.

88
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,820
What happened?

89
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,900
Leave them alone.

90
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,620
Let's leave this place.

91
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,700
Go.

92
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,860
We need to speak in private.

93
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,580
Yes, sir.

94
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,780
The situation has become critical.

95
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,060
Mr. Erbai has some information for me to give you.

96
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,340
Mr. Third Junior,

97
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,700
come with me, please.

98
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,820
Uncle Erjing.

99
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,580
How do you know it's me?

100
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,940
Let's

101
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,380
walk through the whole thing together.

102
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,060
Think about it.

103
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,340
The spy set a trap for

104
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,620
the whole team of Mr. Erbai in Spring of Roar.

105
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,460
It looks like

106
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,940
he wanted to Kill Mr. Erbai and every one of his people at the Spring of Roar.

107
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,620
Since you were terminally ill at that time,

108
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,540
if Mr. Erbai died,

109
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,260
no one would be entitled to take over

110
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,540
the entire Wu family's business.

111
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,060
Wait.

112
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,700
What is it?

113
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,140
When I went to the place in Warehouse 11 where Jiang Yuan stayed,

114
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,380
I found a lot of bronze reeds there.

115
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,820
They were brought back by the spy from Thunder City.

116
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
In other words,

117
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,380
he not only hurt my Uncle Erbai,

118
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,100
on top of that he also went to Thunder City and

119
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,420
got these things out of there

120
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,060
while we didn't notice

121
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,820
and then he brought them into Warehouse 11.

122
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,980
I don't understand.

123
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,620
If he just wants to take over our Wu family,

124
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,500
he could have just killed my uncle and me.

125
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,460
There was no need for him to go to Thunder City.

126
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,820
So the spy and his associates' purpose was

127
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,580
not just to accroach the Wu family.

128
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,300
If Uncle Erbai went to Thunder City,

129
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,460
he could have put Thunder City under his protection.

130
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,300
By then the spy would have to face

131
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,180
two powerful enemies, Uncle Erbai and Mr. Jiao at the same time.

132
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,660
He would stand no chance of winning at all.

133
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,420
So he made his two enemies fight against each other while

134
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,180
he became the one who profited in the end.

135
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,900
I think he is very patient.

136
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
He hid and waited in the dark for so long

137
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,020
until he finally found the opportunity to

138
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,620
kill two birds with one stone.

139
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,860
But why did he want to

140
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,900
smuggle these things into Warehouse 11?

141
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,380
Actually, I already have a preliminary theory.

142
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,220
I will explain to you in detail later.

143
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,580
The most important thing now is

144
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,740
to find those bronze reeds.

145
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,940
They are very important to the spy.

146
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,660
After I found them,

147
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,260
Liu Sang and I hid them in a place only we know.

148
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,460
Those killers

149
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,460
forced your team to meet me with

150
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,900
a very simple purpose.

151
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,620
They wanted to find the reeds.

152
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,180
There are their people

153
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,100
in your team.

154
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,460
They tracked after you to force you to find me

155
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,700
because they want to know where I hid the reeds.

156
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,940
Is my theory close to yours?

157
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,540
From what's happening,

158
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,580
these people are our key.

159
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,740
We must catch them.

160
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,620
They are the only clue we have.

161
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,500
What do you have in mind?

162
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:26,900
Liu Sang.

163
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,180
Bring a group of people

164
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,580
and go get the reeds.

165
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,260
Which one of you are stronger?

166
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,420
Come on. Step out.

167
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,820
Come back as soon as possible.

168
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,580
Don't linger. The clock is ticking.

169
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,620
Do you still want to live?

170
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,140
Look at your neck.

171
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,340
Remember to find Chief.

172
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,860
He is fine.

173
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,500
Do not worry.

174
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,260
Then let's pack our things and

175
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,500
follow them.

176
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,820
They're over there.

177
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,580
Man.

178
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,660
Come here.

179
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,540
Uncle Erjing.

180
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,340
We lost him.

181
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,100
How can you lose him?

182
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,820
Go find him!

183
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,820
Yes, sir.

184
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:33,610
Over here.

185
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,300
What are you looking at? Go!

186
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,820
It's time for you to do it, right?

187
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,740
Where are the reeds?

188
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,860
I am not going to tell you.

189
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,580
I'll dead after I tell you that.

190
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,780
You'll die whether you say it or not.

191
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,740
I always have a way to make you tell me.

192
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,380
But I want to know,

193
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,980
do you want to die fast

194
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,460
or a bit slowly?

195
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,260
It's your choice.

196
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,660
Deafen him.

197
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,780
If you do that,

198
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,780
you will never find the reeds.

199
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,780
You'll need my ears to find the reeds.

200
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,460
I'm confused.

201
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,260
When I wanted to deafen you,

202
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,780
you just said that your ears can find the reeds.

203
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,820
Then what if I want to pull your teeth out?

204
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,460
Will your teeth

205
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,340
help us find the reeds too?

206
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,020
You don't believe me?

207
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,180
I can't help it if you don't believe me.

208
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,060
Pull his teeth out.

209
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,340
Wait, wait!

210
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,740
Or you can look at the back of my neck first.

211
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,060
Don't try to play tricks.

212
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,900
Saw that?

213
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,620
The poison on me

214
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,860
may kick in at any time when we're at the section of unredeemable goods.

215
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,780
I'm as good as a dead man now.

216
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,860
No matter how you want to torture me, suit yourself.

217
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,580
But once I die,

218
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,220
you'll never find the reeds.

219
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,420
Don't play tricks.

220
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,780
What? Do you want to kill me now?

221
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,660
Come on.

222
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,300
Aim at here.

223
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,420
You can't do anything, right?

224
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,740
Alright.

225
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,500
You don't have to go to the extreme.

226
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,980
As long as you can help me find the reeds,

227
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,580
I will keep you alive.

228
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,460
You can keep me alive?

229
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,660
Okay.

230
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,580
Then save my life first.

231
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,780
Or I might die

232
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,620
halfway through. What should you do by then?

233
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,500
We are familiar with the thing behind your neck.

234
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,180
You still have time.

235
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,220
Okay, then.

236
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,740
How about this?

237
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,580
I will take you to find half of the reeds.

238
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,900
Then you detoxify me.

239
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,220
Then I will tell you

240
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,700
where the other half of the reeds are.

241
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,980
What do you think?

242
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,780
Fine.

243
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,140
We'll do as you say.

244
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,580
Come on.

245
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,940
Get up.

246
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,820
Come on. Help him stand up.

247
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,340
Are you okay?

248
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,780
Are you okay?

249
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,220
Look at you two. How can you hit him so hard?

250
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,220
Look at this slap mark.

251
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,100
Look, it's bleeding.

252
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,820
I'm sorry.

253
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,820
Are you alright?

254
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,380
Bai, over here.

255
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,300
Go this way.

256
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,380
Why did you stop?

257
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,740
The passages here are more complicated than the previous ones.

258
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,060
I need to listen first.

259
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,940
Are you trying to wait for your reinforcement?

260
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,380
Bai!

261
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,100
Did you hear anything?

262
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,140
What?

263
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,780
I seem to hear our Knocking Language.

264
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,900
Is it Mr. Third Junior?

265
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,020
I don't know.

266
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,180
It stopped after a few taps.

267
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,900
And it didn't contain information.

268
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,220
I'm warning you,

269
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,460
before the reeds are found,

270
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,620
don't tap on anything.

271
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,540
I know you guys can

272
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,540
send messages by tapping on things.

273
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,500
Don't play tricks.

274
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,500
Don't do anything stupid.

275
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,060
Shall we?

276
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,220
Go. We have to find Naive now!

277
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,660
Let's go.

278
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,340
Hurry up.

279
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,820
What are the benefits of joining your team?

280
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,380
Why do you want to know?

281
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,660
Nothing.

282
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,860
I just want to know what it is

283
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,020
you guys are working so hard for.

284
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,780
We can get treasures.

285
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,580
You believe the rumor?

286
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,500
I saw them with my own eyes.

287
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,220
Mr. Erjing showed us

288
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,140
a part of the treasures of the South Sea King.

289
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,100
Their value

290
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,180
is beyond your wildest imagination.

291
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,580
Then do you think

292
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,140
I am qualified enough

293
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,860
to join you guys?

294
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,540
You are not.

295
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,100
What if I give you something to show my loyalty?

296
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,260
What if I can help you find

297
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,620
Wu Xie's another team who are hidden in the dark?

298
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,220
Will I be qualified by then?

299
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,460
Are you trying to trick us?

300
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,900
Listen to it yourself.

301
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
Come on.

302
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,500
Listen here.

303
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,380
Did you hear that?

304
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,860
There are really some human sounds.

305
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,980
I will take you to catch them.

306
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,540
Let's go.

307
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,180
Go.

308
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,900
So? I didn't lie to you, right?

309
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,380
But why do I feel that you are acting strange?

310
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,820
Your previous reputation in this circle wasn't like this.

311
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,700
You have a knife against my neck now.

312
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,540
If I try to do anything stupid,

313
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,260
you can kill me any time.

314
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,540
I want to hand in this proof of my loyalty myself.

315
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,420
Then you will kill them.

316
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,860
I will let you join our team.

317
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,220
Go!

318
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,420
We can't let them run away.

319
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:12,980
Bai!

320
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,500
Turn off the flashlight.

321
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,100
Who is that?

322
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,620
Knocking Language?

323
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,100
I'm Liu Sang. Help me.

324
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,620
Liu Sang?

325
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,860
Are you trying to inform him

326
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,060
or kill him?

327
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,980
I'm going to distract them. You go get Liu Sang.

328
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,980
Be careful.

329
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,500
Someone ran away!

330
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,660
Go after him!

331
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,740
Twins?

332
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,020
Clean up the mess.

333
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,060
Okay.

334
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,500
Don't move. Stay still!

335
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,660
Sang!

336
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,500
Sang!

337
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,700
We have tacit understanding with each other.

338
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,180
By a stroke of fortune,

339
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,220
you met me who is such a wise man.

340
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,820
Get up.

341
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,860
Why are you here?

342
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:23,980
Where's Naive?

343
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,300
Erjing hijacked him.

344
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,420
Erjing is the spy.

345
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,180
You also knew that Erjing is the spy?

346
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,740
You guys knew it, too?

347
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,620
As soon as Erjing and his men came down here,

348
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,100
I could tell he was lying by the sounds I heard.

349
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,420
I wanted to tell Wu Xie.

350
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,740
But he was always by Wu Xie's side.

351
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,780
I couldn't find a chance to tell him in private.

352
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,740
He also set a trap for Chief.

353
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,700
Fortunately, Chief was not injured.

354
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,740
He just fell to the next floor.

355
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,740
Does Mr. Third Junior know he's the spy?

356
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,980
I'm not sure about this.

357
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,220
Erjing has been working for Mr. Erbai for so long.

358
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,580
I guess

359
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,340
Naive won't realize he's acting strange within a short time.

360
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,420
He relies on logic to think.

361
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,500
But the logic behind

362
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,740
what Erjing has done is so confusing. I can't figure out why.

363
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,300
I suspect that

364
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,500
what he's doing should be

365
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,220
about the treasures of South Sea King.

366
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,260
Wu Xie should have grown suspicious long ago.

367
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,340
But Erjing is not alone.

368
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,740
There are a lot of enemies

369
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,500
hiding in the dark.

370
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,620
I guess Wu Xie wants to fish all of them out and catch them all in one go.

371
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,780
Finding the treasures?

372
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,820
After Wu Xie and I got down,

373
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,060
we hid those reeds they

374
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,100
stored in the section of unredeemable goods.

375
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,540
Erjing asked a team to separate me from Wu Xie

376
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,060
because he wanted to torture me and

377
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,820
ask me to take them to find the reeds.

378
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,300
I think the reeds are

379
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,860
important objects which can help them find the treasures.

380
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,580
Erjing…

381
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,420
Did he lose his mind?

382
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,980
He is too old to

383
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,820
believe in the treasure hunt bullshit.

384
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,940
He thinks this is the world in the manga One Piece?

385
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,660
We have to save his stupid soul

386
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,140
Anyway,

387
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,580
we have to find a way

388
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,540
to inform Mr. Third Junior about the fact that Erjing is the spy.

389
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,420
Bai,

390
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,940
when Mr. Third Junior is around,

391
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,620
you pretend to be a cute weak little girl.

392
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,380
But when he's not, you show your true color as the pack leader.

393
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,260
We'll be much more efficient

394
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,580
if you can stop joking around.

395
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:17,980
Liu Sang.

396
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,100
Listen carefully to see where Mr. Third Junior is now.

397
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,580
We have to tell him by Knocking Language.

398
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,540
No, we can't use that.

399
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,780
Erjing already knew this secret cypher.

400
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,020
We have to think of something else.

401
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,780
What happened?

402
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,540
Where are the people escorting Liu Sang?

403
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,740
I followed

404
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,820
the traces they left behind.

405
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,980
But they went missing.

406
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,780
Liu Sang is gone, too.

407
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,340
Do you think it is because

408
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,860
there are hidden dangers in the section of unredeemable goods…

409
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,940
I think it's either Zhang Qiling,

410
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,500
or there are other people hiding in the dark

411
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,300
who we don't know yet.

412
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,420
Zhang Qiling is such a good warrior.

413
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,780
What shall we do if he comes?

414
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,940
Wu Xie is in our hands.

415
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,100
He will hold back since he's afraid he might cause collateral damage.

416
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,100
Let's wait to see what happens next.

417
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,660
The section of unredeemable goods is so big.

418
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,620
Maybe it's just a false alarm.

419
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,100
But we can't stay here anymore.

420
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,700
We have to keep moving

421
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,180
in case someone contacts Wu Xie.

422
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,180
We will find the antidote with him.

423
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,220
Tell your men to make marks along the way.

424
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:17,780
Yes, sir.

425
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,780
But since they have Liu Sang, will this work?

426
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,300
I have already told them.

427
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,660
After they go out,

428
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,900
deafen Liu Sang immediately.

429
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,980
Mr. Fatty.

430
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,140
What are you doing?

431
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,260
We have to hurry up.

432
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,220
These three idiots worked hard to find us

433
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,860
just to give us these gifts.

434
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,100
I have to return the favor.

435
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,820
I have received your gifts.

436
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,020
What is this?

437
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,340
The subordinates of Erjing have been

438
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,460
drawing this kind of hidden marks along the way.

439
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:56,900
I think Erjing

440
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,420
will follow the marks to find their way.

441
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,540
So I am drawing some fake ones just in case.

442
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,500
Then we can follow the real ones to go back.

443
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,100
Hurry up.

444
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,700
We can still go three more levels down.

445
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,420
The rest are all dirt roads.

446
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,780
Three levels below are the most primitive tunnels.

447
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,420
Should be the bottom of the section.

448
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,820
If there is still space under this kind of dirt roads,

449
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,500
it'll need support strong enough to hold it and also…

450
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,580
I understand.

451
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,060
No need to explain.

452
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Kylin…

453
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,620
As to that place where Zhang Qiling fell earlier,

454
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,940
is there still room below it?

455
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,700
Don't move.

456
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,420
Step back.

457
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,300
These bronze fragments

458
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,940
are the things that poisoned so many people.

459
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,340
Don't touch them.

460
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,220
Be careful.

461
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,020
Yes.

462
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,620
These marks point in two directions.

463
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,820
This is not the destination.

464
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,220
But there is a heavy smell of marsh.

465
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,540
It may explode any minute.

466
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,060
Let's get out of here.

467
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,540
Let's go.

468
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:58,980
Over here.

469
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,500
What is it?

470
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,540
What is this?

471
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,100
Put out the fire.

472
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,180
Mr. Third Junior, watch out!

473
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,940
-Be careful. -Come here!

474
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,420
Go!

475
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,580
The bronze fragments stabbed me during the explosion!

476
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,380
Mr. Erjing!

477
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,380
Mr. Erjing! Are you okay?

478
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,530
Cut my arm off.

479
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,450
Mr. Erjing! No!

480
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,260
Do it now!

481
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,260
Mr. Erjing! No!

482
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:40,620
Do it now!

483
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,530
Okay!

484
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,490
Mr. Erjing!

485
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:49,700
Get the gauze.

486
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,380
Okay.

487
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,970
I have to cut it off to stop the spread of toxin.

488
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,010
Mr. Erjing!

489
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,180
Mr. Erjing, hang in there.

490
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,660
Its effect can last for four hours.

491
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,580
Why don't you sleep for a while?

492
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,220
I'm fine.

493
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,540
Fortunately, it doesn't hurt as much as I expected.

494
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,860
I won't bother you by repeating how grateful I am.

495
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,260
I failed to protect Mr. Erbai.

496
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,740
Actually this made me

497
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,700
feel better in my conscience.

498
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,540
By the way,

499
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,460
do you have news from Liu Sang and Kylin?

500
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,340
It's been so long since they're gone.

501
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,780
Could it be that something happened to them?

502
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:04,940
They'll be fine.

503
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,620
You just need to take care of yourself.

504
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,660
No.

505
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,860
Let's keep going.

506
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,460
Otherwise, if those people catch up with us,

507
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,300
we'll be in big trouble.

508
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,140
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

509
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,420
Let's go.

510
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,220
Why is there a bottle of wine here?

511
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,180
This is good wine.

512
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:24,660
What are you doing?

513
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,580
Give it to me!

514
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,220
You dare drink wine that appeared in such a place?

515
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,060
You are not afraid of being poisoned?

516
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,020
I'll only take a few sips. What's wrong with that?

517
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,980
What do you think is wrong?

518
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,580
What are you arguing about?

519
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:31,940
Mr. Erjing,

520
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,900
we found a bottle of wine.

521
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,620
This was produced four years ago.

522
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,540
But this bottle is too clean.

523
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,980
It looks like someone left it here on purpose.

524
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,260
Can it be Jiang Yuan?

525
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,500
You guys, go ahead and see

526
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,540
if there's anyone.

527
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,420
Yes, sir.

528
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,380
This wine is good.

529
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,300
Do you want to have a sip?

530
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,580
Sure.

531
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,620
What? You dare drink this?

532
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,820
Time is running out. Let's hurry up.

533
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:48,860
Mr. Erjing!

534
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,020
Where did you find this?

535
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,100
Over here.

536
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,700
What do you think is going on?

537
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,580
Could it be a mark left by someone?

538
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,820
I don't think so.

539
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,100
Maybe we broke into someone's territory and

540
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,300
this is a warning.

541
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,780
A warning?

542
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,580
There are many weirdo storekeepers in warehouse 11.

543
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,860
We don't know

544
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,300
if there's still anyone living in the section of unredeemable goods.

545
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,300
Besides, if it is those people hunting us down,

546
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,980
they would have taken action immediately.

547
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,220
It's better to be cautious.

548
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,780
If you see such a weird thing like this again,

549
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,100
don't touch it.

550
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,020
Yes, sir.

551
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,460
Let's go.

552
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,540
The message sent in your method is too obscure to understand!

553
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,580
Can Mr. Third Junior understand right away?

554
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,500
It's obscure, not obscene.

555
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,940
Don't make corny jokes.

556
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,260
I think your plan is too risky.

557
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,380
Will it work?

558
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,220
You still don't know your Mr. Third Junior well.

559
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,620
I am so battle-scarred

560
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,740
and I know what I am doing.

561
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,180
Or

562
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,180
I'll explain to you

563
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,180
my elaborate plan again.

564
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:35,940
Listen carefully.

565
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,660
We put different things

566
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,940
along the way they're passing by, right?

567
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,260
This some digital information.

568
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,740
Naive will gradually realize that

569
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,020
we are giving him some hints.

570
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,900
What hints?

571
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,940
A countdown.

572
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,980
When the countdown is over,

573
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,860
we will rush over from the dark.

574
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,900
We will launch an attack

575
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,260
to beat Erjing and his people.

576
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,700
We can catch them off guard.

577
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,780
But the passages are so narrow.

578
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,380
We'll be at a disadvantage if we attack.

579
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,180
Not only Wu Xie will be in danger, so will we.

580
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,940
And you think I haven't thought of that?

581
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,060
Now the spy's identity has been exposed.

582
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,660
As long as we can get Naive out, he'll be over.

583
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:21,700
Just follow my command.

584
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,740
Tie the cross bows

585
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,340
all together.

586
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,220
As soon as we launch the attack,

587
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,580
just shoot the arrows all in one go.

588
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,340
Erjing will be scared

589
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,500
by the fierce firepower

590
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,540
and think there must be a lot of our people here.

591
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,020
Since they think the main force is here,

592
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,100
they will launch a counterattack.

593
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,060
You know?

594
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,300
Leave the rest to me.

595
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,180
Like an agile swallow,

596
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,420
I'll approach from the flank

597
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,140
to get Wu Xie out.

598
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:48,900
But we..

599
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,140
We are a

600
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,780
well-trained military unit.

601
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,860
Our aim is to be united, alert,

602
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,060
earnest and lively.

603
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,260
Get ready for a guerrilla battle anytime.

604
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,860
Advance when the enemy withdraws,

605
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,340
and strike when they are tired.

606
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,020
Alright, alright!

607
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,220
Stop that!

608
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,660
Or is it "Strike when they are fagged"?

609
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,100
But what if

610
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,740
Wu Xie is held hostage by Erjing when we attack?

611
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,500
You think Wu Xie as stupid as you?

612
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,300
He will definitely understand our intentions.

613
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,500
If it were me to come down with him,

614
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,820
I would have solved the problem in there

615
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,820
and gotten Erjing under control.

616
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,300
The I can collaborate from within with your forces from outside

617
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,020
to have a rolling victory.

618
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,460
Trust the tacit understanding between me and Wu Xie.

619
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,100
Didn't you say there's no tacit understanding between you?

620
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,660
You can say that, too.

621
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,740
Of course,

622
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,700
Bai, that's also true.

623
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,900
Let's go.

624
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,100
My legs are numb squatting so long.

625
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,420
Let's go.

626
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,260
Mr. Erjing.

627
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,580
Mr. Erjing.

628
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,620
This is the thing you want.

629
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,340
You suspect there is a problem with this box?

630
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,820
I suspect that someone adjusted this music box.

631
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,460
There may be some kind of information hidden in it

632
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,700
trying to tell Wu Xie something.

633
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,220
Mr. Erjing.

634
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,580
We have the antidote.

635
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,220
Why would you cut off your hand?

636
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,940
To remove Wu Xie's suspicion.

637
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,660
He started to suspect me.

638
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,700
The artifact can let it grow back.

639
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,540
Don't worry.

640
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,340
Since the music box is now in our hands,

641
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,620
Wu Xie must have not deciphered

642
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,580
the secret message hidden in it yet.

643
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,260
He may not know it yet.

644
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,220
But those people won't stop.

645
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,500
They will definitely

646
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,380
continue to pass on information to Wu Xie.

647
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,540
If any strange thing like this appears again,

648
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,780
destroy it directly.

649
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,980
Don't leave any traces.

650
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,860
I think there may be someone hiding somewhere near us.

651
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,780
Get some people to search around us.

652
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,180
Yes, sir.

653
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,500
And also

654
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,100
keep a close eye on Wu Xie.

655
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,980
Don't let him have any contact with anyone or anything.

656
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,660
If he finds out anything,

657
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,340
just disable his limbs.

658
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,500
As long as he's still alive,

659
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,860
anything else is not important.

660
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,260
Yes, sir!
