00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:36,860
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,600
Episode 16

4
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,340
What happened？

5
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,900
He is all covered with bite wounds.

6
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,020
Looks like he was attacked by some creature.

7
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,020
Why did they attack us?

8
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,260
I have no idea.

9
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,340
I shot this crossbow’s arrow at him.

10
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,580
It was shot deeply into his body

11
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,060
Ordinary people would have died of pain.

12
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,940
But he didn't seem to be afraid of pain at all.

13
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,940
He was like a beast.

14
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,940
Mr. Jiao.

15
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,420
The road ahead must be very dangerous.

16
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,940
Can your people handle it?

17
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,420
You are badly hurt.

18
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,820
Can you handle it?

19
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,460
Are you not scared at all?

20
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:10,260
Let’s go!

21
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,180
Go.

22
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,940
I deliberately let Kanjian find out that some of the parachute bags were missing

23
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,580
and the map I drew for Wu Xie.

24
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,379
Now they have all gone down to the valley.

25
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,300
No one knows if they’re still alive.

26
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,379
If they can pass through it alive,

27
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,100
they have exploited the way for me.

28
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,980
I'll also be happy if they die.

29
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,060
I hate everyone in your Wu family anyway.

30
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,420
But now I am going to take you back to Wuzhou.

31
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,940
Look how you have become.

32
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,620
You’re the best puppet for me to seize the resources of the Wu family.

33
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,620
I want to use the power your Wu family possesses

34
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,180
to get something very important in Thunder City.

35
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,060
It’s the key for me to open the access to another place.

36
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,740
You all think that Thunder City is the end of the journey.

37
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,980
Actually, it’s not.

38
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,060
You don't know where the place is,

39
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,140
neither Wu Sanxing

40
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,700
nor Wu Xie.

41
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,620
Mr. Jiao doesn't even have a clue.

42
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,660
Only I know where it is.

43
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,340
Only I deserve to have the real treasure.

44
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,780
How did it go?

45
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,060
What did you hear?

46
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,980
Just like Glasses said,

47
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,340
there are many creatures outside.

48
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,620
And they are nearby.

49
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,620
What are they?

50
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,820
Are they edible?

51
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,060
Some are like humans, some are not.

52
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,300
There’re more and more of them.

53
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,260
Glasses.

54
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,500
Is what he said

55
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,780
the things you are afraid of?

56
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,220
Since we came, can we get rid of them now?

57
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,220
They became more since you guys came.

58
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,220
At the beginning

59
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,820
this place only had some animals affected by the poisonous fog.

60
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,220
They acted crazy like they had mutated.

61
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,620
Now there are some of Mr. Jiao’s people, too.

62
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,140
They were also

63
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,820
affected by the neurotoxin in the poisonous fog.

64
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,220
These people don’t seem to feel the pain.

65
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,380
They are crazy.

66
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,980
We need to transfer to another place as soon as possible.

67
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,300
If we want to get out of here, we have to speed up.

68
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,580
But we can’t make it with just me and Dumbie.

69
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,340
What do you mean?

70
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,700
The task gets easier with your help.

71
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,900
Mud can purify the air.

72
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,460
We’ll smear some mud on the mask.

73
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,700
Although the effect is limited, in times of crisis,

74
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,020
it can last a few more minutes.

75
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,340
Mr. Third Junior, you're awake.

76
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:40,980
I will go with you.

77
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,580
Just lie down.

78
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,140
What's going on?

79
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,260
Your task is to have a good rest at base.

80
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,260
Don't let us worry about you.

81
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,180
Bai, keep an eye on him.

82
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,860
Take this.

83
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,900
Leave the task of exploiting the way to us.

84
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,940
Be a good boy and stay at the base.

85
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:02,340
They all retreat.

86
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,420
These monsters are afraid of water.

87
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,900
Since they retreated, there will be a thunderstorm soon.

88
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,620
Let's go out during this time.

89
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,220
We can be there for up to 20 minutes.

90
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,060
Let’s go.

91
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,860
Watch out for the poisonous fog.

92
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,580
Wait.

93
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,380
Everyone, be safe.

94
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,380
See you later.

95
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,180
See you later.

96
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,700
You have to follow my orders this time.

97
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,700
Let’s go!

98
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,940
You finally found Kylin and Glasses.

99
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,860
You must feel more at ease now.

100
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,660
Yes.

101
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,820
Twenty minutes.

102
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,380
The monsters will start to round up.

103
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,140
Hurry up.

104
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,420
Jia Kezi will be on alert and Liu Sang, you’ll listen to tell the positions.

105
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,820
Let’s split up.

106
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,140
Kylin.

107
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,500
Stand firm.

108
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,580
Be smart and get ready!

109
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,180
Position number one, ready?

110
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:28,940
Go!

111
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,260
Number two, get ready!

112
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,180
Go!

113
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,420
Position number three, ready.

114
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,700
Go!

115
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,220
Did you hear that?

116
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,860
It's a blast.

117
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,100
It’s from that direction.

118
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,860
We are getting closer and closer to them.

119
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,140
A battle is inevitable to happen.

120
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,340
How did it go?

121
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,860
There are twelve of them.

122
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,620
What were you painting?

123
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,260
You’re a genius.

124
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,460
Keep listening.

125
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,780
Even God helps me.

126
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,140
Four minutes left!

127
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,340
Take cover first!

128
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,660
They’re coming.

129
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,180
How many are they?

130
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,980
They’re everywhere around us.

131
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,980
Time is running out.

132
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,740
We stand no chance

133
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,780
if we are caught up in a battle with them.

134
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,020
What should we do?

135
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,820
Avoid direct combat. Just hide from them and

136
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,460
circle around behind them.

137
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,660
Return by the same way we came.

138
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,300
Understood!

139
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,740
How dare you hurt my bro?

140
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,580
I’m gonna...

141
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,500
Take this!

142
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,300
You’re welcome.

143
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,660
You’re welcome.

144
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,060
You hit another one to coma.

145
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,660
I’ll stick with this.

146
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,500
Here they come again.

147
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,580
Go get him!

148
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,540
You go without me!

149
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,260
Go!

150
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,780
Be careful.

151
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,220
Naive, let me tell you.

152
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,780
I almost died before you do.

153
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,620
How did it go?

154
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,420
Did you guys find the exit?

155
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,500
Of course, we found it because we have Liu Sang, right?

156
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,700
You are right.

157
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,260
Why didn't you praise me back?

158
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,260
So clumsy of speech.

159
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,580
I am the lucky one. So the duo of us is invincible.

160
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,940
I should take most of the credit.

161
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:05,820
Look.

162
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,340
The shelters

163
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,700
get denser as you go further to this direction,

164
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,900
which means that the Japanese invaders

165
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,740
had frequent activities in this area back then.

166
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,740
Since they needed to transport supplies to the outside world,

167
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,660
the exit must be somewhere in this area, too.

168
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,260
If we follow these shelters,

169
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,660
we should be able to find the exit.

170
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,220
I think this method is feasible.

171
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,020
There will be a rain tomorrow.

172
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,620
Okay, then.

173
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,980
Then we will set off when it rains.

174
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,780
Okay.

175
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,380
Let’s celebrate tonight.

176
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,420
Everyone should take some good rest tonight.

177
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,540
So, no party?

178
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,980
Where are you going?

179
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,060
I think you can tell

180
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,540
the condition of my lungs by the sounds they make, right?

181
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,140
So, you can’t

182
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,660
feel the pain anymore.

183
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,660
No.

184
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,420
People will look better for a moment before they die.

185
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,780
I am

186
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,060
going to another world very soon.

187
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,940
So now is the best time

188
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,460
to say goodbye to everyone.

189
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,700
You are going to Thunder City?

190
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,740
If I get lucky.

191
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:28,980
Alone?

192
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:30,540
I wish to be left alone.

193
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:32,129
But

194
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,940
among them

195
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,460
there is someone

196
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,940
who will show up

197
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,980
whenever or wherever

198
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,740
I'm in danger.

199
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,260
There is another person who,

200
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,220
if I leave him behind again,

201
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,820
will dig up my ancestral graves.

202
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,340
The journey I want to embark is too dangerous.

203
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,980
So don’t follow me.

204
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,540
Please get them out of here safely for me.

205
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,740
Follow the route you said last night.

206
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,460
Let’s be together since we’re of the same feather.

207
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,580
I'm with you

208
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,780
and we won’t never be separated.

209
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,100
Did I show up too early?

210
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,340
Should I pretend to go after you

211
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,340
in another ten minutes so that you can fully express your emotions?

212
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,620
Naive, let me tell you,

213
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,140
if you dare ditch me again,

214
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,940
I'll dig up your ancestral graves when I go back.

215
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,860
I do know you well, Fatty.

216
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,420
You already know where Thunder City is, don’t you?

217
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,340
Kylin.

218
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,620
All the way south.

219
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,180
Let's go to Thunder City together!

220
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,740
Where's Mr. Third Junior and others?

221
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,460
Where are they?

222
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,260
Say something!

223
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,660
They left.

224
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,580
Guys.

225
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,100
Thank you for

226
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,260
accompanying me all the way to this far.

227
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,500
My life is coming to an end.

228
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,820
So I have chosen to

229
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,780
say goodbye in the most respectful way.

230
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,980
Bai.

231
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,780
Don’t be sad.

232
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,380
In many times in life,

233
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,700
encountering itself indicates separation.

234
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,300
And separation

235
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,980
can be the beginning of another encountering.

236
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,580
Glasses.

237
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,740
Please

238
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,860
take everyone back to the world outside safely.

239
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,340
You can go to Jin Wantang to claim

240
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,140
your reward after you go out.

241
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,540
As for Kylin and Fatty,

242
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,460
they will accompany me

243
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,300
to finish the last part of my journey.

244
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,460
Let this experience

245
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,220
draw the final period of The Trio.

246
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,940
My friends,

247
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,300
take care.

248
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,540
Let us

249
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,740
meet again in thunder.

250
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,260
Manager Bai.

251
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Don't stop me!

252
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,580
I'm going to find Mr. Third Junior.

253
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,020
Let go of me!

254
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,860
I'm going to find them!

255
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,380
He can't just send me home with a letter.

256
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,060
Step aside!

257
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,100
You don't want Wu Xie to worry about you, right?

258
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,580
No matter what your decision is,

259
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,500
think about

260
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,580
what he really wants.

261
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,420
What did you find?

262
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,980
There are footprints on the ground.

263
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,020
All traces are still fresh.

264
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,660
There must be someone here before us.

265
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,260
It seems that Wu Xie beat us to it.

266
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,660
In this case,

267
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,940
let's have a good time!

268
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,780
Follow the footsteps to go after them.

269
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,020
Go.

270
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,820
There are traces of someone living inside.

271
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,940
The various footprints are

272
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,100
from both men and women.

273
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,980
They must be nearby.

274
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,020
Go after them!

275
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,220
Go!

276
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:03,660
Hurry up!

277
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,260
Go this way.

278
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,740
Go!

279
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,620
This kind of mask looks shabby,

280
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,980
but it’s quite practical.

281
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,100
Why? Do you want to apply for a patent?

282
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,540
They are coming.

283
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,380
They seem to have found us.

284
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,660
Take everyone to hide.

285
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,660
I’ll take Mr. Jiao to meet some new friends.

286
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,300
Mr. Jiao.

287
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,660
Let’s go.

288
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,780
What is this place?

289
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,340
Why doesn’t it look like the previous cave?

290
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,780
This is impossible.

291
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,220
Where is she?

292
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,020
Where is she?

293
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,060
Your gun has run out of bullets.

294
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,060
I can take you to find her,

295
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,180
under one condition.

296
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,580
Okay?

297
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,340
Very well.

298
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,420
On your knees!

299
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,620
On your knees!

300
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:04,980
Liu Sang.

301
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:05,980
Glasses.

302
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,180
Where’s she?

303
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,420
I love you.

304
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,660
Before she died,

305
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,980
she realized that she meant nothing

306
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,220
to you.

307
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,940
How desperate she looked.

308
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,300
Her heart must hurt like hell.

309
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,780
Just you wait.

310
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,180
Naughty people never end well.

311
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,140
One day I will catch you.

312
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,380
And then I will kill you

313
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,660
in the most painful way.

314
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,900
Naughty?

315
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,660
You can still make jokes under such circumstances.

316
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,500
I want to know

317
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,700
how to go to Thunder City.

318
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,220
Where's Wu Xie? Did he go to Thunder City?

319
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,340
Cut a small wound and let him bleed slowly.

320
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,420
Don't...

321
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,420
Jia Kezi!

322
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,260
Li Jiale!

323
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,340
Stop!

324
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:34,860
Stop.

325
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,340
I will show you the way.

326
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,540
I will take you to find Wu Xie.

327
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,980
I’ll take you to Thunder City.

328
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,780
But,

329
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,540
but you can't hurt her.

330
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,660
I'll take you to Thunder City if you leave her alone.

331
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:03,980
Let’s go.

332
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,260
Go to Thunder City.

333
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,100
Hurry up.

334
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,140
Are those Mr. Jiao’s people?

335
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,220
Don’t look like it.

336
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,220
Look at the clothes they wear

337
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,060
and their status.

338
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,580
Mr. Jiao’s people wouldn’t act so leisurely.

339
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,260
Who are they then?

340
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,500
No one.

341
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,380
Kylin, are you too old

342
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,060
so you’re presbyopic?

343
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,060
You can’t see them?

344
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,820
Those are not humans.

345
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,660
Let’s go around them.

346
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,300
Kylin made up a ghost story to scare me.

347
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,340
Kylin's intuition is always spot on.

348
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,540
Since he said they are not humans, then they’re not.

349
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,620
I forgot that you two were always in the same team.

350
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,780
Things are complicated now.

351
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,820
Keep up with Kylin.

352
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,060
Don't wander away.

353
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:56,820
-Naive. -Uncle Sanxing.

354
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,020
Naive!

355
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,060
Naive!

356
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,740
That can’t be your Uncle Sanxing. Come on!

357
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,260
They are not real, right?

358
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,380
Kylin said that they’re not real people.

359
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:11,860
Let’s go!

360
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,060
I know they’re not real.

361
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,660
There is high performance magnetic powder

362
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,900
in the fog

363
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,980
with high concentration.

364
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,300
Magnetic powder is a magnetic recording medium which can

365
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,980
record images.

366
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,580
When the powder is activated by the energy of lightning,

367
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,780
it will act like a natural video recorder.

368
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,100
Uncle Sanxing must have been here some time

369
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,820
and they were recorded when it thundered.

370
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,140
You mean

371
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,820
your Uncle Sanxing used to go down this route.

372
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,780
Yes.

373
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:37,820
Let’s follow them to take a look.

374
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:38,450
Wait.

375
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,930
We don’t know if he’s still alive.

376
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,060
It’s too risky to

377
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,740
go over and take a look just because of these shadows. Let's observe them more.

378
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,180
Why should we waste time to observe?

379
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,010
They are leaving soon.

380
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,100
And the direction we are going now

381
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,930
was from what I heard in the thunder.

382
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,700
Instead of wandering around here without a purpose,

383
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,420
we might as well follow the shadows.

384
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,700
Maybe we will discover something.

385
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:54,260
Let’s go.

386
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,380
I have stopped the bleeding for you guys.

387
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,860
These are all for you.

388
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,940
It depends on your luck

389
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,780
whether you can go out alive or not.

390
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:55,940
I’m fine.

391
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,660
I’m fine. Let’s carry on.

392
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,660
What happened?

393
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,740
What happened?

394
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,620
What's wrong, Kylin?

395
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,180
Who’s that?

396
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,620
Take a look.

397
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:22,740
Go.

398
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,900
Jia Kezi?

399
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,980
Why is he here?

400
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,660
Jia Kezi!

401
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:39,940
Let’s go.

402
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,260
Stop!

403
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,500
Don’t run!

404
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,340
Jia Kezi!

405
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,580
I can’t take it off.

406
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,420
There is no poisonous fog here.

407
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,620
We’re safe.

408
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:09,940
Look.

409
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,100
I noticed that along the way

410
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,340
there are a lot of this kind of earth hummocks.

411
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,860
Did you see them?

412
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,180
Isn’t it weird?

413
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,500
So far there are ninety-nine of them.

414
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,860
You’re good.

415
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,820
Ninety-nine indicates the final destination of something.

416
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,340
This must be an artificial arrangement.

417
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,660
But Jia Kezi

418
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,340
was supposed to be with Bai and others.

419
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:28,860
Yes.

420
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,460
Yet he ran out by himself.

421
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,260
Yes.

422
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,180
Something must go wrong.

423
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,700
Let’s find Jia Kezi first.

424
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,660
Go.

425
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,060
Jia Kezi!

426
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,780
Jia Kezi!

427
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,300
Jia Kezi!

428
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,380
Jia Kezi!

429
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,380
Jia Kezi!

430
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,460
I'll go down to see if he’s there.

431
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,940
Jia Kezi!

432
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,020
Jia Kezi!

433
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,020
Jia Kezi!

434
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,700
Jia Kezi!

435
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,220
Jia Kezi!

436
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,020
Naive!

437
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,500
You dislocated your shoulder.

438
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,780
Naive.

439
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:58,940
Are you alright?

440
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,100
How are you feeling?

441
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:06,860
How are you feeling?

442
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,220
Done.

443
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,940
He had his throat slit and lost too much blood.

444
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,420
He inhaled

445
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,900
the neurotoxin in the fog.

446
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,980
He’s already unconscious and delirious.

447
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,460
How did it happen?

448
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,460
My God.

449
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,420
I guess they ran into Mr. Jiao.

450
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,460
This is not good.

451
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,180
I hope Glasses and others are fine.

452
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,900
They should be somewhere nearby.

453
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,740
Let’s go up and find them.

454
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,700
Then we’ll just leave him here?

455
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,260
Glasses and others are still useful to Mr. Jiao.

456
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,700
They will be safe for the time being.

457
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,860
Time!

458
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,940
Your time!

459
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,660
Just worry about yourself.

460
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,060
They will catch up with us.

461
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,540
Jia Kezi didn’t have to come here.

462
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,380
He chose to follow me.

463
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,900
Look how he ended up.

464
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,180
Jia Kezi.

465
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,780
We are still alive and it’s thanks to you.

466
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,340
This is the only insignificant ability I have.

467
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,260
How many times has your insignificant ability helped us?

468
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,780
Everyone has his own fate.

469
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,300
You can't blame yourself for everything.

470
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,620
Come on, let's settle him first.

471
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,540
Jia Kezi.

472
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,940
We will leave you here temporarily.

473
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,780
Don’t worry.

474
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,740
As long as we can get out alive,

475
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,380
we will definitely take you home with us.

476
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,260
We will get you out of here.

477
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,220
Let’s go.

478
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,420
Okay.

479
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,700
It looks like a hummock on the ground.

480
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,140
But it's actually a pagoda when you get down here.

481
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,780
Since there are so many hummocks on the ground,

482
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,260
is it possible that each hummock is a pagoda?

483
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:27,900
Yes.

484
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,420
So it might be a cluster of pagodas.

485
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,260
Due to a mudslide

486
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,700
or a landslide,

487
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,780
those pagodas were buried under the ground.

488
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,540
Naive, keep making up.

489
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,860
Soon we will have the answer to all the mysteries.

490
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,340
Thunder God.

491
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,100
What is this language?

492
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,780
You can read it?

493
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,860
This statue of Thunder God

494
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,100
is very similar to the ones

495
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,020
in the South Sea King's Tomb.

496
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,460
This should be the periphery of Thunder City.

497
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,660
People in this area

498
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,220
believed in the gods of nature.

499
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,740
Since this place worshipped Thunder God,

500
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,660
we came at the right place.

501
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,020
During the Ming Dynasty,

502
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,340
this place was the Ming Dynasty’s dependency.

503
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,700
So this was once the territory of China?

504
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,620
Long live China!

505
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,940
I love her!

506
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,500
This pagoda should be related to thunder.

507
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,340
Look.

508
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,100
A bronze piece.

509
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,220
Look, the pagoda has a bronze top.

510
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,420
This should be used to induce the thunderstrike.

511
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,380
We are not far from success.

512
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,380
If we want to find your Uncle Sanxing,

513
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,140
we have to be struck by lightning continuously?

514
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,340
Let’s go.

515
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,180
Am I wrong?

516
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,060
What are you looking at?

517
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,540
Let me ask you, what's this?

518
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,020
Winding canal for wine cup to float along the water.

519
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,140
Winding canal?

520
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,260
What was its purpose?

521
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,860
For appreciation only.

522
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:17,780
It does look good.

523
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,060
I found something.

524
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,580
Naive.

525
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,660
We actually guessed right!

526
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,300
So many pagodas.

527
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,620
There is indeed a cluster of pagodas overhead.

528
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,660
The lightning will be

529
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,700
conducted underground through the pagodas.

530
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,820
Because a lot of lightning’s energy is gathered here,

531
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,300
the dome will shine brightly.

532
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,660
This dome

533
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,100
is the so-called Thunder City.
