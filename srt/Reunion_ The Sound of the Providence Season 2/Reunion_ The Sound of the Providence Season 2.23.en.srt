00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,180
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,400
Episode 23

4
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,300
Why is he coming with you guys?

5
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,220
You have given up taking revenge on Wu Xie?

6
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,260
How about you? Aren't you here too?

7
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,940
Where's Wu Xie?

8
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,500
That's right.

9
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,379
Where's our boss?

10
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,620
We'll go in first. He will join us later

11
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,300
Let's go.

12
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,379
But

13
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,140
I heard that Warehouse 11 is heavily guarded.

14
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,500
But we have come so deep in it

15
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,540
yet we didn't see many guards on the way.

16
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,460
It's not challenging to get in here.

17
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,900
Naive has conquered this place.

18
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,660
Coming here is like going home to him.

19
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,300
Why do you keep whining? Hong?

20
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,140
I have a feeling that I shouldn't have gotten onboard.

21
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,300
I feel like I'm on a sinking ship again.

22
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,620
Yeah, right.

23
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,460
You should feel privileged that

24
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,380
you can get onboard on our aircraft carrier.

25
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,460
Just remember to pay me.

26
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,740
Every time I saw you, I want to…

27
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,260
Cut your crap.

28
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,220
I won't go anymore if you say another word.

29
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,620
All right.

30
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,060
Stop arguing.

31
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,820
Don't disturb other people when we're here.

32
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,780
The Ganyang section has quite a limited time for goods to be inbound.

33
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,980
We have to hurry up.

34
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,060
Let's go.

35
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,660
Go.

36
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,140
Suansuan.

37
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,340
Look at the patterns on the coffin.

38
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,020
They're the same as

39
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,580
the ones on those bronze fragments Huo Daofu and Wantang touched.

40
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,260
Suansuan?

41
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,220
Can't you give me a better nick name?

42
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,980
Suansuan's so cute!

43
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,860
It brings some warmth to your cocky face.

44
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,500
You were the one who chose to disguise as him with this face.

45
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,420
What should I call you then?

46
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,060
Garlic Pork Slice?

47
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,020
Badass?

48
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,780
Forget it.

49
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,180
I like the name "Forget-it".

50
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,340
Bai.

51
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,860
What are you guys doing?

52
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,020
Why is Sea Woman here?

53
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,900
This is a ceremony in Ganyang section.

54
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,060
When ancient boatmen fished out strange things from the water

55
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,540
or the carcass of a giant fish,

56
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,980
they would perform a ceremony to show their respect

57
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,060
before they burnt the things.

58
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,260
After someone was drowned to death here,

59
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,540
we could hear

60
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,260
someone talking in the water.

61
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,020
It was so spooky.

62
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,540
But when we followed the voice to find it,

63
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,060
we couldn't find anything.

64
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,100
She surrendered herself to the police the last time the warehouse was closed.

65
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,180
She has repented and also she didn't cause casualties.

66
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,980
So she was sentenced to two years' custody suspended for two years.

67
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:01,100
Since she is a senior in Warehouse 11,

68
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,300
the management decided to let her come back.

69
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,660
What happened?

70
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,140
Your current face makes me uncomfortable.

71
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,380
Light the sacred flame

72
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,460
to burn off evils!

73
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,780
What are you doing?

74
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,820
Something went wrong!

75
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,980
Danger!

76
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,780
Run!

77
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,340
Is everyone alright?

78
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,100
Bro, did you get hurt?

79
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,020
I'm fine.

80
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,860
Are you OK?

81
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,100
I'm fine.

82
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:31,900
Can you stand up?

83
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,580
Let me have a look.

84
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,260
I'll survive.

85
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,540
Come on.

86
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:35,980
I'll give you a hand.

87
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,580
My hand.

88
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,700
Be careful.

89
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,060
Let me help you up.

90
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,540
Here you go.

91
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,700
Help me stand.

92
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,540
Can you stand up? Slowly.

93
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,140
My bottom.

94
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:43,860
Are you alright?

95
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,700
My bottom.

96
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,940
I can't feel it anymore.

97
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,540
Are you alright?

98
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,380
I fell.

99
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,060
Why would it blow up?

100
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,820
This coffin was sealed so well.

101
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,060
The biogas inside was ignited by the high temperature indoor.

102
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,700
People in Warehouse 11

103
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,620
are not addicted to the coffin unboxing step.

104
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,100
They just burnt it without inspection.

105
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,260
The bronze fragments might puncture into our body.

106
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,380
Everyone has to undress for examination.

107
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,620
This is too much.

108
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,220
Show us some respect.

109
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,460
This is to ensure everyone's safety.

110
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,420
Anyone who got hurt by the bronze fragments

111
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,780
have to be sent to the hospital.

112
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,260
Better safe than sorry.

113
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,460
Safety first

114
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,060
is the rule of Warehouse 11.

115
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,020
It's not you outsider's place to object.

116
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,260
You have to undress, too.

117
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,020
Check if you're hurt by the bronze fragment during the explosion.

118
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,140
Is this a joke?

119
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,900
I am not injured.

120
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,100
Ma'am, let me tell you,

121
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,740
our people

122
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,459
are cleverer than Warehouse 11's people.

123
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,380
Look.

124
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,060
I'm fine.

125
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,980
I just got some dirt on my clothes.

126
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,459
Look, I don't even have a scratch.

127
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,260
Everyone must go through the examination.

128
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,340
I'll pass.

129
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,260
I have such a good body.

130
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,580
I'm afraid your people

131
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,660
will take advantage of me.

132
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,580
Suit yourself if you'd like to, but leave me alone.

133
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,700
Hong.

134
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,580
You go ahead.

135
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,860
Come on, Fatty.

136
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,340
You will take the examination on behalf of our team.

137
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,380
Why should it be me?

138
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,800
Isn't taking clothes off your specialty?

139
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,400
Let's examine him, too. Take off!

140
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,840
Everyone has to be examined. Don't be shy. Give him a round of applause!

141
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,880
You go first. Shake it!

142
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,600
You guys go first. Why should I be the one to undress first?

143
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,160
I am not taking clothes off! Examine him.

144
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,560
I'll undress if he does it first.

145
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,560
Then let's do it together on the count of tree.

146
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:40,900
What happened?

147
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,209
I kind of like this kid.

148
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,620
Don't worry. He is not dead yet.

149
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,100
Go ahead.

150
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,740
All fall apart.

151
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,740
What happened?

152
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,500
There's a living creature in his body.

153
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,820
Are you sure?

154
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,260
Die!

155
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,900
What kind of fish is this?

156
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,980
It's so disgusting.

157
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,980
It is Cargo No. XD009.

158
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,260
It has a label on it.

159
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,260
You are right.

160
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,940
This label is the article serial number.

161
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,460
But this cargo

162
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,860
should be stored in the section of unredeemable goods.

163
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,580
So why did it appear in the water of Ganyang section?

164
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,220
Li Jiale was not simply drowning.

165
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,380
We need to call the police and

166
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,940
send him to the hospital now.

167
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,540
Strange things happened frequently.

168
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,100
Suansuan.

169
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,100
Someone in the Warehouse 11 has set a trap for us.

170
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,140
Who is that?

171
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,420
Come down.

172
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,220
Who is speaking?

173
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,940
Come down.

174
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,460
Come down.

175
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,420
Come down.

176
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,580
Come down.

177
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,140
Come down.

178
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,140
I'll leave it to you to handle.

179
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,140
Thank you.

180
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,340
It's time for Kylin to show up.

181
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,780
There are ghosts

182
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,580
and weird fish in the water.

183
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,660
We desperately need "Avengers Assemble".

184
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,820
Kylin!

185
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,220
Don't worry.

186
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,380
He will show up soon.

187
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,900
But we still have to solve the problems ourselves.

188
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,260
This is definitely not a ghost story.

189
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,900
It was humans' deed.

190
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,940
Who tried to create a superstitious atmosphere.

191
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,460
Bai.

192
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,340
I need you to check

193
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,780
the inventory information of that coffin

194
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,020
and the runner who was responsible for it.

195
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,700
Okay.

196
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,340
Now this set of diving equipment is all we have.

197
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,100
Leave a set of monitoring equipment here.

198
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,100
And then tell everyone to stay away from the water.

199
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Something evil is under the water.

200
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,860
Let's go.

201
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,660
Why me?

202
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,980
Among all people, why should I be the one

203
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,300
who's poisoned?

204
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,860
You are dead meat.

205
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,580
Your heartbeat is fast.

206
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,500
Are you nervous?

207
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,100
Aren't you afraid?

208
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,260
I am.

209
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,580
But you are terrified.

210
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,620
This is the first time I've encountered this kind of weird thing.

211
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,420
I am a little scared.

212
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,180
Anyway, we can't dive into the water anymore.

213
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,300
I am leaving tomorrow.

214
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,940
Wu Xie won't blame me.

215
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,900
You can't go.

216
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,340
You have to wait until Warehouse 11's

217
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,380
problem is solved.

218
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,220
Why?

219
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,180
Because you can't just go in and

220
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,220
get out of Warehouse 11 as you wish.

221
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:48,940
Come on!

222
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,180
Wu Xie didn't come.

223
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,500
Why should we have to stay here?

224
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,180
Don't you think this is not fair?

225
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,260
You know,

226
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,460
I have exceptional hearing since I was a kid.

227
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,180
So I know something others don't know.

228
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,740
What are you talking about?

229
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,660
Everyone's heartbeat

230
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,860
is different in sounds.

231
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,300
What do you mean by this?

232
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,140
Nothing particular.

233
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,900
I mean,

234
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,580
Wu Xie will definitely come.

235
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,140
He won't just leave us behind like this.

236
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,060
It's a bit naive to think it this way.

237
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:56,940
Come on.

238
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,460
Drink some wine to calm your nerves down.

239
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,220
I'll pass.

240
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,460
In the world of the veteran swimmers,

241
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,980
if someone is drowned

242
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,180
like we encountered today,

243
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,900
the surviving ones have to drink some wine to pray for the victim's soul.

244
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,980
This is not for me.

245
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,660
It's for Li Jiale.

246
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,020
Come on. Clink glasses.

247
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,300
Why are you two here?

248
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,300
Oh, wrong room.

249
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,780
You are quite insensitive.

250
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,180
You are still in the mood to drink now?

251
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:44,980
Whose wine is this?

252
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,860
Mine.

253
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,980
You hid some good stuff from us?

254
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,300
What a charming fragrance.

255
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,740
Give it to me.

256
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,980
What are you doing?

257
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,380
Sang is still a kid.

258
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,820
Why do you have to ask him to drink wine?

259
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,380
I was just drinking some wine like usual.

260
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,060
What's wrong with that?

261
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,620
Really?

262
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,220
Really.

263
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,780
Look how panic you are.

264
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,980
Are you up to something?

265
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,780
Actually I saved the wine for you.

266
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,580
Come on. Drink it.

267
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,940
Cheers. Come on.

268
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,020
Don't be so stingy.

269
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,460
Come on.

270
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,580
This flask is really not enough for me to drink.

271
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,820
Just drink it up first.

272
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,060
You must be up to something evil.

273
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,660
Look how your little eyes roll.

274
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,020
What can I possibly do?

275
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,460
Fatty.

276
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:18,980
You…

277
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,820
Go. Someone is asking for you.

278
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,140
Just go.

279
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,860
Beware of this bad guy.

280
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,180
He has a special preference.

281
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,540
Just go. What nonsense are you talking about?

282
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,180
Coming!

283
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,540
Close the door behind you.

284
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,420
He just left without closing the door.

285
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,500
Come on.

286
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,580
Let's continue to drink.

287
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,180
Say it.

288
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,300
Say what?

289
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,060
Isn't there something that's bothering you?

290
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,140
Well,

291
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,340
I'm not bothered.

292
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,220
I was just thinking,

293
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,260
are

294
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,660
those bronze fragments really that powerful?

295
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,340
Why should those injured by the bronze fragments

296
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,420
all have to be hospitalized?

297
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,660
Do you think they will die?

298
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,820
Will they all die

299
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,580
as long as they're injured?

300
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,380
I was thinking,

301
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:20,500
since that bronze coffin

302
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,940
was fished out of the water,

303
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,740
the answer to my questions must be under the water, too.

304
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,369
If I had been punctured by a bronze fragment,

305
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,820
I would definitely dive in the water to check.

306
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,889
I will never go to the hospital.

307
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,649
And I'll never let that ghostly old woman

308
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,740
lock me up to wait for death here.

309
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,940
Okay, okay. Let's not talk about the unhappy things.

310
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,220
Cheers.

311
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,700
Cheers.

312
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,500
Be careful!

313
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,460
Are you okay?

314
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,300
Are you hurt?

315
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,620
Come on.

316
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,300
Are you hurt?

317
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:41,940
We're fine.

318
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,780
Is everyone okay?

319
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:43,940
Someone…

320
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,500
Someone fell.

321
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,420
Why would it blow up?

322
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,940
I am desperate.

323
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,700
Don't be afraid.

324
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,820
And please forgive me.

325
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,900
You will heal

326
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,060
as long as you make them all get poisoned.

327
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,060
Let them get poisoned.

328
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,940
Let all of them get poisoned.

329
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,540
Clean up this place.

330
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,820
Put these bronze fragments in the case.

331
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,740
Come here now!

332
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,820
Look.

333
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,020
These bloodstains are still very fresh.

334
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,300
Here.

335
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,100
According their statement just now, no one was injured.

336
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,740
You guys go check everyone present here just now again.

337
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,220
Must be thorough this time.

338
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,100
Yes, ma'am.

339
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,220
While we were cleaning up,

340
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,860
we found a bronze fragment with blood on it.

341
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,740
It means that someone was scratched by the bronze fragment, but he didn't report it.

342
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,780
To ensure the safety of Warehouse 11,

343
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,020
I have to check you guys again.

344
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,740
This old lady has to watch people get undressed.

345
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,700
We have proof.

346
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,300
Someone got away last time.

347
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,580
Why are you pointing at me?

348
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,940
You have no evidence to go against me!

349
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,860
Cut the crap. Just take it off since they even want to see you undressed.

350
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,660
Naive!

351
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,300
If Naive was here,

352
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,940
he would never say such mean thing.

353
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,340
Let me do it.

354
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,940
You are always half-naked.

355
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,820
Leave this opportunity to me.

356
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,820
She just wants me to take off my clothes, right?

357
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,980
Fine. I have been a decent man for lifetime. But now I can't anymore.

358
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,860
Look carefully.

359
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,820
Ma'am!

360
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,540
We found a row of footprints

361
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,420
at a corner of the water area's bank.

362
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,940
Someone dived in the water at night.

363
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,540
You see?

364
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
I told you it wasn't me.

365
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,500
I almost had to undress.

366
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,860
Where's Sang?

367
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,740
Where is the wetsuit?

368
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:36,740
At the canteen.

369
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,540
Go!

370
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,620
I left it here. But it's gone.

371
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,540
I have something to tell you guys.

372
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,700
Actually, I discovered that Liu Sang was poisoned long ago.

373
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,260
Then why didn't you say so earlier?

374
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,100
He wouldn't let me say anything!

375
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,140
Think about it.

376
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,780
Xiangyang is still hospitalized

377
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,980
and they can't clean the toxin in his system.

378
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,820
Sang always felt that the antidote

379
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,220
should be under the water in this warehouse.

380
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,660
So he didn't want to go to the hospital.

381
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,980
He wouldn't let you tell us, and you just did as he said?

382
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,140
Where's your brain?

383
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,940
Anyway, if he didn't want me to say anything, I had to keep it a secret.

384
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,220
But he just told me that

385
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,220
he has gone to

386
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,220
the place where the bronze coffin was pulled out

387
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,340
to see if he can find solution there.

388
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,580
So he sneaked in to dive into the water.

389
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,420
I felt that…

390
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,460
I haven't finished yet! What is this supposed to mean?

391
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,540
You keep going.

392
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,740
Bai.

393
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,460
Mr. Third Junior.

394
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,220
I found some information about the things you asked me to check.

395
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,500
The serial number of the bronze coffin

396
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,540
is 892673.

397
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,980
Both it and the bronze fragments sent to Wushanju by Xiangyang

398
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,580
belong to the same batch of cargos: Cargo zero three seven.

399
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,100
Zero three seven?

400
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,340
Why does it sound so familiar?

401
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,740
I checked for a long time.

402
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,660
This batch of cargos never really entered Ganyang section

403
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,020
because an accident happened while they wanted to put them in storage.

404
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,260
So they were thrown into the section of unredeemable goods and

405
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,100
they have never really entered Ganyang section.

406
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,060
What about the legend of Zhang Fo Ye and the cargos?

407
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,260
It's fake.

408
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,900
This shipment really belonged to Zhang Fo Ye.

409
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,580
But he didn't deposit them here himself.

410
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,380
But there is no specific information recorded in the archives.

411
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,140
If the legend that

412
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,260
Zhang Fo Ye had some treasures deposited in Ganyang section is just fake,

413
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,460
but this fake news is very popular,

414
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,100
there is only one possibility behind it.

415
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,500
Someone spread it on purpose.

416
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,900
The key is that after this rumor started to spread widely,

417
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,820
the coffin in the rumor really appeared

418
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,340
under the water of Ganyang.

419
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,460
It means that someone deliberately got it

420
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,940
out from the section of unredeemable goods

421
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,860
because they wanted to commit with this legend as some sort of cover-up.

422
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,980
You have to check

423
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,060
the list of all personnel who entered and exited Warehouse 11 recently.

424
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,140
I suspect there must be

425
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,420
accomplices of that spy working in the Wu family.

426
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,940
Also, pay attention to

427
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,580
if there's anyone who keeps asking

428
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,380
why Wu Xie didn't come long with his team.

429
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,380
That person is our prime suspect.

430
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,300
Okay.

431
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,100
What about the runner?

432
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,460
I didn't find him or her.

433
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,460
There's no record.

434
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,860
I guess it has been deleted.

435
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,780
Even you can't find it with your level of clearance?

436
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,820
This coffin is too old.

437
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,060
There was no computer system when it was stored.

438
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,300
There are only files on paper.

439
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,860
During the later process of transferring paper files into computer systems,

440
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,820
these files were easy to tamper with by people with a purpose.

441
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,340
Now these paper files

442
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,820
are in another warehouse.

443
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,180
If you need me to search them,

444
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,940
it may take more time.

445
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,500
That'll be too late.

446
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,260
I don't have that much time.

447
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,580
What happened?

448
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,740
Something happened to Liu Sang.

449
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,740
Hang up the phone.

450
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,980
Tell Bai not to follow this lead.

451
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,660
Bai.

452
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,860
Stop your investigation and come back.

453
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,100
Why not?

454
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,820
Don't ask now. Just trust me.

455
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,580
Just come back.

456
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,420
Okay.

457
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,580
Wu Xie.

458
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,220
The runner of this coffin back then was this man.

459
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,900
Later he was stored in the section of unredeemable goods and disappeared later.

460
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,380
You'd better look into him.

461
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,360
<i>Jiang Yuan</i>

462
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,740
How do you know that I'm in Warehouse 11 now?

463
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,700
Did you find your Uncle Sanxing?

464
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,260
Is he still alive?

465
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,820
Investigate this guy.

466
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,420
Find out…

467
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
Why is there a power outage?

468
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,940
This is not a life-friendly environment.

469
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,860
The warehouse is closed and now even the power goes out.

470
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,660
What's wrong with you, Hong?

471
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,260
Are you trying to scare us?

472
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,020
What happened to you?

473
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,340
Why are you so unsettled?

474
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:16,780
I am fine.

475
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,380
I'm going back to sleep now.

476
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,220
Hong?

477
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,500
You

478
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,220
seem so uneasy.

479
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,940
Are you dating someone?

480
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,140
It feels so much better.

481
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,780
Now this face looks much more pleasing to the eye.

482
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,700
Welcome back!

483
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,260
What's wrong?

484
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,580
Your face is stuffed for too long that you got acnes.

485
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,780
Stupid acnes caused by this stupid face!

486
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,700
How can we find his information?

487
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,300
We now have three leads.

488
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,740
The first one is the goods' serial number.

489
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,140
892673.

490
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,420
The second is a name, Jiang Yuan.

491
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,180
The third is a year, 1940.

492
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,580
Bring it on.

493
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,180
Bring it on.

494
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,780
Where should I begin with?

495
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,060
I never went to college.

496
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,220
I don't have experience in finding materials in a library.

497
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,940
Sang might be dead already when we finally find it.

498
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,100
These clues are all we have now.

499
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,980
We can only bite the bullet to find it.

500
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,500
Didn't Hong say yesterday that

501
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,820
Liu Sang has been missing for eight hours?

502
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,500
If he can't find a passage under the water,

503
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,940
even God can't save his life.

504
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,180
So

505
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,020
we can only hope that

506
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,740
he has found the passage.

507
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,900
Wish Sang all the luck he needs.

508
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,460
Are you sure it's here?

509
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,260
Fatty.

510
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,660
You found it?

511
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,420
Wow, I can't believe it.

512
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,020
Is there really such a big gap between people with or without a college education?

513
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,260
Maybe Wang Junyi helped me.

514
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,420
Thanks.

515
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,740
In 1940,

516
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,700
something went wrong with

517
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,860
a batch of goods with the article number 892673.

518
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,980
Cargo Manager Jiang Yuan

519
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,300
was the first person to make contact with

520
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,940
goods 892673.

521
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:44,940
In three days,

522
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,500
Jiang Yuan showed symptoms of

523
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,460
nervous, sensitive,

524
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,060
and strange behaviors

525
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,100
until he became crazy

526
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,380
and hurt other people.

527
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,740
When he was taken down,

528
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,620
Jiang Yuan always kept his head drooped down

529
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,260
and he kept saying

530
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,860
something was sitting on his neck.

531
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,620
We checked later and found

532
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,020
a lot of melanin deposits

533
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,340
on the skin of his back neck.

534
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,580
So scary.

535
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,180
Later, warehouse clerks who had been in contact with

536
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,220
cargo 892673

537
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,500
also showed symptoms of hysteria in different degrees.

538
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,260
There were some people who were very sensitive to watch's sounds

539
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,380
and would force themselves to wear a lot of watches.

540
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,380
According to the discussion by the board of directors,

541
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,020
we have stored all cargos that belonged to No. 892673

542
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,900
in the section of unredeemable goods.

543
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,300
In 1942

544
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,220
Jiang Yuan was confirmed dead.

545
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,820
Suansuan…No.

546
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,660
I got confused.

547
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,540
Naive.

548
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,380
Can it be that those bronze chunks

549
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,140
have a layer of chemical toxins on them which can

550
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,620
make people go insane and

551
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
hear imaginary voices?

552
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,980
That is one possibility.

553
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,740
But I can't be sure now.

554
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,820
Jiang Yuan was really pitiful.

555
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,500
He was killed by the goods he transported.

556
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:30,980
Fatty.

557
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,940
Look at his time of death.

558
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,540
1942.

559
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,020
1942.

560
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,300
He was poisoned in 1940

561
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,180
and then he lived for another two years.

562
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,740
How long is our current time window from taking in the toxin to showing symptoms?

563
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
Two days.

564
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,900
So that means somehow

565
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,300
Jiang Yuan found

566
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,140
a way to inhibit the bronze toxins.

567
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,340
I am impressed, Fatty.

568
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,260
I am smart by nature.

569
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,900
I don't need to go to college.

570
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,580
Okay.

571
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,500
Let's sort out the documents

572
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,660
and go back and check on other people.

573
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,780
Okay. Let's go.

574
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,220
Wait.

575
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,220
Don't forget who you are now.

576
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,500
I almost forgot.

577
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,700
Go.

578
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,740
The coffin comes from the section of unredeemable goods

579
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,220
and the runner was once in the section of unredeemable goods.

580
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,260
The criminal mastermind must be

581
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,140
someone who can freely enter and exit the section.

582
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,530
Who could that be?

583
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,530
Who's there?

584
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,490
Fatty, is that you?

585
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,940
What are you doing here?

586
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,860
Head drooped down…

587
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,300
It's just a mop.

588
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,140
What's up with you today?

589
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,700
In three days, Jiang Yuan showed symptoms of

590
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,580
nervous, sensitive,

591
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,180
and strange behaviors

592
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,900
until he became crazy and hurt other people.

593
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,780
When he was taken down,

594
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,540
Jiang Yuan always kept his head drooped down

595
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,140
and he kept saying

596
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,780
something was sitting on his neck.

597
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,520
<i>Locker Room No. 17</i>

598
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,260
I even have to tuck you in.

599
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,140
Let's go.

600
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,220
The way this guy had his head drooped down just now.

601
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,220
Does it look like Jiang Yuan in the photo?

602
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,820
Is this toxin targeting at

603
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,220
hurting people's cervical spine?

604
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,820
Stop joking around.

605
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,220
The pathogenic mechanism of this toxin is unclear yet.

606
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,500
Jiang Yuan was in contact with the bronze fragments.

607
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,940
But Hong didn't contact any fragment.

608
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,340
Install a camera in his room.

609
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,260
It's not good to install a camera in people's room, right?

610
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,460
That's for his own good.

611
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,380
Where should I install it?

612
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,540
You all are going to die.

613
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,700
You all are going to die.

614
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,700
Let's install one.

615
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,300
He woke up.

616
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,500
Look at him, so weird.

617
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,340
Sleepwalking, I guess?

618
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,980
He was poisoned?

619
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,340
He's well-hidden.

620
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,060
Nobody suspected anything for such a long time.

621
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,140
Fatty, look.

622
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,700
He keeps staring at this direction.

623
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,020
Is there something here?

624
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,660
Nothing's here.

625
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,060
He found the camera?

626
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,180
Go!

627
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,540
Hong!

628
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,940
Where's he?

629
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,700
Hong!

630
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,460
Are you okay?

631
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,140
I know that you are poisoned.

632
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,300
Did you start to hear or see illusions?

633
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,940
Tell us.

634
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,820
We will try our best to save you.

635
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,820
You are too arrogant.

636
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,100
Since you can't even see,

637
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,340
how are you going to save me?

638
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,660
What are you painting?

639
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,580
Okay, okay!

640
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,420
Okay, okay!

641
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,220
Okay.

642
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,420
Hong, listen to me.

643
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,220
You have to believe us, alright?

644
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,900
I believe I am not so mean

645
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,780
to you earlier, right?

646
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,060
If you don't believe us,

647
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,700
who else can you go to now?

648
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,020
Fatty, just go.

649
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,540
I have my own way.

650
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,100
You have a way?

651
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,060
Since you have a way, tell us.

652
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,780
Let's solve it together.

653
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,780
We are a team.

654
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,940
We won't leave you alone.

655
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,860
Besides, this is not your business alone now.

656
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,220
So many guys in the entire warehouse are poisoned.

657
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,300
And Sang, too.

658
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,620
What are you painting?
