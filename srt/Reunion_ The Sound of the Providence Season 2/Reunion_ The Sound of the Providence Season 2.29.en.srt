00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,180
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,960
Episode 29

4
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,460
Using you,

5
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,860
I took the artifact from Thunder City.

6
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,540
This is the last step of my revenge plan.

7
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,540
But I really didn't expect that

8
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,340
you would secretly take away a part of the artifact.

9
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,260
But Mr. Third Junior,

10
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,060
you still can't stop me

11
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,020
What kind of poison did you give us?

12
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,140
A rare heavy metal toxin.

13
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,100
This kind of heavy metal has a very small yield.

14
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,420
The hospital should also be able to find out the origin.

15
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,300
But it's hard to say how long it will take for them to find out.

16
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,100
Okay, Mr. Third Junior.

17
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,260
Since I have finished my lovely story,

18
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,660
can you understand me now?

19
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,580
You guessed it right.

20
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,180
The antidote is indeed

21
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,740
hidden in the imperial temple.

22
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,340
My people are coming soon.

23
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,060
I still have enough time.

24
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,180
But I am afraid

25
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,140
I can't say the same about your friends.

26
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,260
Put your bronze reeds in safekeeping.

27
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,180
We will need to strike a deal in the end.

28
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,100
Consider it.

29
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,180
We may still be able to make peace.

30
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,980
Fatty.

31
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,020
We are so close to them.

32
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,940
Why can't we just take down Erjing?

33
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,460
Then Mr. Third Junior will be safe.

34
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,580
I'm worried about his safety if things drag on.

35
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,780
Naive is trying to find out everything he wants to know from Erjing.

36
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,260
Let's give him more time.

37
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,340
Don't worry.

38
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,820
Your eldest sworn brother will show up whenever Wu Xie is in real danger.

39
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:52,980
Bai.

40
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,420
If you want to fit in the Trio,

41
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,940
you need to call me your brother more often.

42
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,820
So this is the South Sea Kingdom's imperial temple.

43
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,380
What do you think?

44
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,420
Isn't it spectacular?

45
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,780
All the walls are made of bronze.

46
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,580
It's exactly the same as the last time I saw it.

47
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,980
So many years have passed.

48
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,940
I heard it again.

49
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,780
Duh, I can hear it, too.

50
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,700
Knocking Language.

51
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,060
It's over there.

52
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:09,060
Let's go.

53
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,940
The price of that heavy metal toxin is very high.

54
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,380
But the thing is,

55
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,380
even if I tell you what the heavy metal is,

56
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,060
you don't know how to formulate the antidote.

57
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,060
So you really have to think about

58
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,500
whether to make peace with me.

59
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,460
I can only take half of

60
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,700
the Wu family.

61
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,300
I can consider avenging only half of what he did to me.

62
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,260
Then I have to thank you for the Wu family?

63
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,860
It's really amazing

64
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,100
that you could work for the Wu Family incognito for so long.

65
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,980
You can't understand me no matter how I explain now.

66
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,459
When I achieve my purpose,

67
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:02,940
you will understand

68
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,700
like the rest of the world.

69
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,660
There is nothing that I don't understand.

70
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,940
What you've been doing are just something evil. Simple as that.

71
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,459
I won't waste my time debating with you.

72
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,660
Take me to find the antidote now.

73
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,900
Be patient. We'll arrive soon.

74
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,220
This way.

75
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,220
The antidote is here.

76
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,780
It's useless to struggle.

77
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,860
The more you struggle, the deeper you will sink.

78
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,060
Give me the reeds.

79
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,420
Then I'll pull you up.

80
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,780
You think you can fool me?

81
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,980
If I give you the bag now,

82
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,740
will you still pull me up?

83
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,140
You have no choice.

84
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,700
OK, let's make a deal.

85
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,500
You pull me up

86
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,340
and let me

87
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,459
save my friends with the antidote.

88
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,740
I will give you the reeds.

89
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,780
Okay.

90
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,380
But you have to dismantle the grenade first.

91
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,620
Alright.

92
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,060
I've grabbed it.

93
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,140
Naive, here we come!

94
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,620
-Nobody move! -Mr. Third Junior.

95
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,260
Erjing, how can you be such an evil villain?

96
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,100
Fatty.

97
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,540
Go behind me.

98
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,420
Come on!

99
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,220
Hurry up.

100
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,260
Be careful. There is a quicksand vortex over there.

101
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:14,980
Okay.

102
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,420
Turn around.

103
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,620
Step back, Fatty.

104
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,380
Calm down.

105
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,660
This is for you.

106
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,100
Let's go.

107
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,700
Mr. Erjing!

108
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,620
Get out of the way! Don't mind me!

109
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:52,980
Continue to stick to the plan!

110
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,780
Get out of the way.

111
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:12,980
Go after them!

112
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,860
Go!

113
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,020
Go after them!

114
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,140
-Go after them! -Don't go.

115
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,820
We are running out of time.

116
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,060
Let's focus on the real business.

117
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,940
Leave a few people behind to guard the antidote.

118
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,540
Others come with me.

119
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,140
Yes, sir.

120
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,580
Yes.

121
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:36,940
Yes.

122
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,380
It's waiting for us.

123
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,180
It is calling us.

124
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,700
Mr. Erjing.

125
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,020
Everything's ready.

126
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,940
The only thing missing is the lotus reed you're holding.

127
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,100
Come on.

128
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,900
Over here.

129
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,700
Hurry.

130
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,020
I can't hear them anymore.

131
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,260
Let's rest for a while.

132
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,420
Take a break.

133
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,180
We came in time, right?

134
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,100
You came just at the perfect timing.

135
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,260
It's like you've been waiting for your cue.

136
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,220
Naive, I am impressed.

137
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,340
You must learn this from the great master, which is me.

138
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,540
Your skill of handling with grenade is

139
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,940
is getting better and better.

140
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,660
Let me tell you,

141
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,460
that grenade just now was fake.

142
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,700
It was just a grenade-shape lighter.

143
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,260
I had been using it to trick Erjing all the way.

144
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,940
I guess he is burning with rage now.

145
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,860
The big liar.

146
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,420
I'll find a real grenade to blow him up.

147
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,300
-Fatty! -Mr. Fatty!

148
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
-Fatty! -Mr. Fatty!

149
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,540
What happened?

150
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,060
Come here.

151
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,380
It's okay. I am fine.

152
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,060
Maybe I am running out of oxygen from the running.

153
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,140
It's okay.

154
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,380
I'm totally fine.

155
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,220
-The bronze Poison. -It'll be fine.

156
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,020
I am fine.

157
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,980
Nothing will happen to me.

158
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,140
Nothing will happen…

159
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,060
Nothing will happen.

160
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,260
-What's wrong? -He starts to show symptoms.

161
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:16,860
This is bad.

162
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,300
I really want to eat a big meal.

163
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,580
Steamed lamb.

164
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,740
Steamed deer tail.

165
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,620
Roasted duck and roasted goose.

166
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,860
Duck stuffed with glutenous rice.

167
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,060
I know where the antidote is.

168
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,860
It's at the place where you met me just now.

169
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,500
I will get it now.

170
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,460
You can't go.

171
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,780
It's heavily guarded.

172
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,860
You won't get it and return alive.

173
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,060
There is no other way.

174
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,700
Time is running out.

175
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,540
Wu Xie, we have to find Chief first.

176
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:48,860
Fatty.

177
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,780
We don't know if he's alive or dead.

178
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,580
Fatty.

179
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,900
Let go of me!

180
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,380
Wu Xie.

181
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,180
Kylin.

182
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,900
You came.

183
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,180
He shows up.

184
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,300
I followed you guys all the way.

185
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,060
Your chitchat with Erjing was so long-winded.

186
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,820
I observed the place.

187
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,660
The place is indeed heavily guarded.

188
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
In the past rosy years of our adventures,

189
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,220
in every critical moment like this,

190
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,300
the superman in my heart

191
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,420
would always come to the rescue.

192
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,580
We can't fight against them head-on.

193
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,540
But we can weaken their sight, state,

194
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,780
and the quantity of their weapons.

195
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,060
So, there is still no way for us to beat them?

196
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,260
Stand up.

197
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,540
I am fine.

198
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,940
What should we do now?

199
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
What should I do?

200
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,300
I'm also running out of time.

201
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,460
I'm hungry.

202
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,340
Bai.

203
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,500
I have a very important thing

204
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,420
for you to do.

205
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,540
Don't try to send me away with an excuse.

206
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,540
Who said that I want to send you away?

207
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,580
This task will be very difficult.

208
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,020
You have to follow my orders to make it happen.

209
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,860
I'll try my best.

210
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,740
I'm a director of Warehouse 11.

211
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,860
Why do you always treat me like a child?

212
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,780
What do you mean I treat you like a child?

213
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,380
You are a child.

214
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,260
I treat you as my idol.

215
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,740
But you always act like you're my father.

216
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,780
I'm old enough to be your uncle.

217
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,060
See? The teenage girl is going through a rebellious period.

218
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,580
Look at that.

219
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,780
None of us will act like your father.

220
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,860
This important task is…

221
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,900
What is it?

222
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,420
Take some rest now.

223
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,300
We will take shifts to assist and support Kylin later.

224
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,460
Let's go. Over there.

225
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,300
Come on!

226
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,060
Don't run!

227
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,820
Go after them!

228
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,700
Come on.

229
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,129
-I am here. -Hurry.

230
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:29,700
Freeze.

231
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:37,220
Freeze.

232
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:40,740
Be careful. It might be a trap.

233
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,860
Withdraw. Let's go back.

234
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,020
They stopped chasing us.

235
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:50,980
They stopped.

236
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,140
You could actually run quite fast.

237
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,860
Sang!

238
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,540
Get up quickly.

239
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,060
You guys are back.

240
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,620
We're back.

241
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,700
Sit down and take some rest.

242
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,700
It's up to you guys next.

243
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,660
You can count it on us.

244
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,580
But Mr. Third Junior.

245
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,380
This idea of yours is really…

246
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,660
Mean and cunning, right?

247
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,900
Then we're going.

248
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,780
Be careful.

249
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,740
Okay.

250
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,620
Let's go.

251
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,580
He fell asleep fast enough.

252
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,020
Who is that?

253
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,180
Come on!

254
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,620
Come get us.

255
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,060
Go!

256
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,580
Come on!

257
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,060
Freeze!

258
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,900
I am so tired.

259
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,740
Take a break.

260
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,620
Take a break.

261
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,820
Come on, guys.

262
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,860
Let's all take a break.

263
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,060
Sit down.

264
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,060
Here they come again.

265
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,220
Hurry up!

266
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,540
Go after them!

267
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,180
Go after them!

268
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,020
Don't run!

269
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,260
I'm too tired.

270
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,740
Let me sit down to rest for a while.

271
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,620
They are coming, again!

272
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,300
Come on.

273
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,060
Come get us!

274
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:44,940
Chase us!

275
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,060
They are trying to wear us out.

276
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,420
Let's take some rest.

277
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,140
Okay.

278
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,380
They keep coming nonstop!

279
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,700
They don't want to find us?

280
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,700
Come after us.

281
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,420
Come on.

282
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,860
Come after us.

283
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:03,780
Let's go.

284
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,500
Let's go.

285
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,260
Fatty.

286
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,020
Let's go, Fatty.

287
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,860
Little fatty gets up early in the morning.

288
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,620
He goes to the toilet with hands on his belt.

289
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,380
But someone's already in there.

290
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,780
So he has no choice but to pee on their faces.

291
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,420
Let's go.

292
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,020
Let's go!

293
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,660
Charge!

294
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,020
Let's go.

295
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,340
Naive, hurry up.

296
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,780
Let's go.

297
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,700
Wu Xie.

298
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,540
We have more people than you do.

299
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,020
Steady.

300
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,060
The poison is still in you guys' body.

301
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,300
Since you can't beat us,

302
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,220
why not join us?

303
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,460
South Sea King left many treasures here.

304
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,020
I can share with you.

305
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,620
Mr. Erjing.

306
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,580
Something happened.

307
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,300
They stole the antidote.

308
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,500
What?

309
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,780
You Wu family are all stubborn and never give up.

310
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,980
I told you not to act rashly.

311
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,540
You really can't control the younger generation at all.

312
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,540
Look at the consequences

313
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,820
your family suffer because of your lack of disciplining them.

314
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,940
Take him out.

315
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,500
More.

316
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,620
-That's enough. -Come on.

317
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,140
Enough.

318
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,940
Sang.

319
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,460
Give me some more.

320
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,020
I don't have enough to rub on this spot.

321
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,500
Hurry.

322
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,540
Bai.

323
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,900
Put this away.

324
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,660
Okay.

325
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,020
You and Liu Sang will return immediately.

326
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,500
Let me see…

327
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,340
And then bring the antidote to the people in Warehouse 11.

328
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,100
What about you guys?

329
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,420
Wu Xie.

330
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,460
Come out!

331
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,340
I have tolerated you enough!

332
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,380
Don't push me too hard!

333
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,500
Come out right now.

334
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,980
Or I'll kill your Uncle Erbai.

335
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,020
Your uncle is in danger.

336
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,500
Let's get him out.

337
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,060
Fatty.

338
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,860
Be patient. Wait a minute.

339
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,780
I'm going to count to three.

340
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,420
If you don't come out by then,

341
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,500
you will never see him again.

342
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,180
Three,

343
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,340
two…

344
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,740
He will die soon!

345
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,500
Kylin, go!

346
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,100
Fatty.

347
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,940
Wait!

348
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,140
I trust him.

349
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,220
Who?

350
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,380
Erjing?

351
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,300
One,

352
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,860
You…

353
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,620
Why are you able to stand up?

354
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,300
Long time no see, bro.

355
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,220
Mr. Erbai, you have suffered a lot.

356
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,980
I will get you out this time.

357
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,140
You freaked me out!

358
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,900
No. You won't escape from them taking him this way.

359
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,340
What should we do then?

360
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,900
Let's do what Wu Xie did.

361
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,620
I will disguise to be Mr. Erbai.

362
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,580
You will break in pretending to save me.

363
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,900
Then you will deliberately be found by them.

364
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,220
If those fools

365
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,500
think that they have taken Mr. Erbai back,

366
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,500
they won't chase you anymore.

367
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,060
I will stay here disguised as Mr. Erbai.

368
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,340
I'll hide among them and wait for Erjing to appear.

369
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,980
Then I can take him down

370
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,420
when he thinks he has everything under control.

371
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,540
Mr. Glasses, why are you so smart?

372
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,620
My physical strength I gained from running four laps around Ping Lake every day

373
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,740
has finally come in handy this time.

374
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,140
Freeze!

375
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:51,780
Freeze.

376
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:53,740
Come on!

377
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,260
I will come back to save you!

378
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,060
Freeze!

379
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,300
Freeze.

380
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,220
Don't chase him.

381
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,060
Take him back.

382
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,580
Take him.

383
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,540
To be honest, I admire you.

384
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,340
You are such a criminal genius.

385
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,980
But Wu Xie still won this time.

386
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
Do you know why?

387
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,860
Because he is cute and honey-lipped.

388
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,220
So at the critical moment

389
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,780
there will always be someone coming to help him.

390
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,300
Times have changed.

391
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,980
The lone-ranger way that requires you to go undercover and suffer alone has

392
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,060
gone out of fashion.

393
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,060
Don't you think so?

394
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,820
They look a little tense.

395
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,340
Put down your weapons.

396
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,460
You don't want to put it down?

397
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,660
Okay then.

398
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,060
Then I can only

399
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,940
kill your Mr. Erjing.

400
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,580
Don't drop your weapon.

401
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,220
Don't listen to him.

402
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,820
He won't kill me.

403
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:37,380
Mr. Erjing.

404
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:37,860
Mr. Erjing.

405
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,420
Go!

406
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,700
It's okay. Leave them alone.

407
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,700
Time has come. Implement the plan.

408
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,940
You're good, kiddo.

409
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,060
I knew we can count on you

410
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,700
to any task.

411
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,100
I can always learn from my master. Respect.

412
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
Why are you alone?

413
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,500
Why didn't Wang Meng come with you?

414
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,500
Didn't you see Erjing has so many people?

415
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,820
It was challenging enough

416
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,580
for me to come in here to find you.

417
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,020
That's true.

418
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,500
It's a miracle that

419
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,220
Wang Meng actually carried out this plan like I told him.

420
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,620
You always asked me to clear up the mess for you.

421
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,980
Super hero.

422
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,300
Can I ask you a question?

423
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,020
You couldn't wear glasses for so long this time.

424
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,020
Did your eyes feel uncomfortable?

425
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,260
Yes.

426
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,980
That's not cool. You two!

427
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,740
You didn't tell me that you had a plan.

428
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,180
So I was kept in the dark and worried.

429
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,260
Why did you do this to me?

430
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,020
I was afraid that if I told you too much information,

431
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,060
you would not be able to digest it.

432
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,300
Bah! You are so slow, not me!

433
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,780
If we want to go out

434
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,340
we need to solve Erjing and his people here.

435
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,260
Otherwise, if we go back up to near Warehouse 11,

436
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,380
we will definitely be ambushed.

437
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,220
Putting on South Sea King's robe,

438
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,180
I'll take back the treasures that belong to me.

439
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,040
<i>Fu Er Wu</i>

440
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,700
The thunderstorm starts.

441
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,100
Listen carefully to the echo of the thunder.

442
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,500
Erjing has repaired

443
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,580
all the thunder-listening devices here.

444
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,140
I am worried that the artifact will be activated.

445
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,300
Then Erjing will be able to open the mechanism and

446
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,340
find the treasures.

447
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,780
Activate it.

448
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,060
Then what else

449
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,500
can we do now?

450
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,420
We have to stop Erjing.

451
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,260
I always think that there's something weird with this artifact.

452
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,020
Everyone who tried to use it

453
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,780
had a miserable end.

454
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,620
South Sea Kingdom was annihilated.

455
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,300
My Uncle Sanxing went missing.

456
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,060
Mr. Jiao is dead.

457
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,220
We must be very careful.

458
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,500
What are these?

459
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,620
Phosphorescence from dead bodies.

460
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
There should be dead bodies everywhere in the walls of this tunnel.

461
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,620
Don't move.

462
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:08,820
What happened?

463
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,220
The whole imperial temple…

464
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,740
The whole temple is howling.

465
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,340
What's going on?

466
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,340
The whole city

467
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,580
becomes a living creature.

468
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,180
Isn't he just looking for the treasures?

469
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,930
What is this sound?

470
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,140
If I guess it right,

471
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
Uncle Sanxing

472
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,420
tampered with the tapes.

473
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,900
What happened?

474
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,820
Please tell him this for me.

475
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,500
He needs to move on.

476
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,100
Forget me.

477
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,060
Uncle Sanxing.

478
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,860
That old fox.

479
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
This is a secret message.

480
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,100
The tapes will not satisfy your greedy desire.

481
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,780
Let go and you will be free of your worries.

482
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,460
Among Uncle Sanxing's tapes,

483
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,620
those ones about wealth are fake.

484
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,020
You guys stay here.

485
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,540
I'll take Liu Sang to explore the way.

486
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,180
Okay.

487
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,220
Let's use the chance to take a break.

488
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,620
Wait for them to come back.

489
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,140
Sit!

490
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,380
What are these things?

491
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,260
I guess these things

492
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,860
led to the demise of South Sea Kingdom.

493
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,580
Tell me more.

494
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,580
I checked some files before.

495
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,500
According to historical records,

496
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,540
at all the ruins of ancient countries near South Sea Kingdom,

497
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,500
the archeologists unearthed a lot of bronze walls.

498
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,340
But only in South Sea Kingdom,

499
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,860
very few were unearthed.

500
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,020
All the archaeologists at that time

501
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,460
were puzzled by it.

502
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,380
Now I finally understand why.

503
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,060
In fact, South Sea Kingdom

504
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,020
found some kind of material

505
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,020
that could replace bronze to make walls.

506
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,020
But this material is toxic.

507
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,540
Usually in a stable state,

508
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,500
these toxins will not volatilize easily.

509
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,020
But in a certain vibration caused by thunder,

510
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,500
the toxins will be emitted.

511
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,420
South Sea King

512
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,380
built places for thunder listening

513
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,220
with this material.

514
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,700
Do you remember

515
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,460
the poisonous fog in the forest of Thunder City?

516
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,020
Yes.

517
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,620
The poisonous fog that can make the poisoned creatures look like

518
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,940
they have rabies.

519
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,900
So, this poisonous fog

520
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,140
was Thunder City's defense system.

521
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,140
South Sea Kingdom's imperial temple also has the same defense system which

522
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,940
was just activated.

523
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,100
At the end of the day, Erjing was fooled by Wu Sanxing.

524
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,900
Your Uncle Sanxing is the one who has everything under his control.

525
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,540
He is protecting cultural relics.

526
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,020
He doesn't want this artifact

527
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,580
to be used by greedy people.

528
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,740
Is it appropriate to recall the past

529
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,740
and reflect on the present in this environment?

530
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,060
How about it?

531
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,820
What did you guys find?

532
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,780
We are screwed.

533
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,860
We can't get out.

534
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,460
Why not?

535
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,260
What's up?

536
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,540
Normal thunder will only last a few hours.

537
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,820
But Erjing's devices

538
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,220
are powered by batteries.

539
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,460
They can work continuously for a month.

540
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,860
When all the poisonous gas is emitted,

541
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,140
the section of unredeemable goods

542
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,460
will become another valley in Thunder City

543
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,820
We can't let the poisonous gas spread out.

544
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,140
Or all the people in Warehouse 11 will be poisoned.

545
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,860
If this is the case,

546
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,140
we must go back

547
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,620
to turn off his thunder creating devices.

548
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,660
You are being unrealistic again.

549
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,140
Now it's all poisonous gas outside.

550
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,180
How can we do thast?

551
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,580
Liu Sang.

552
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,300
You know the way up.

553
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,420
Take everyone up.

554
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,500
Bai.

555
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,940
Tell the people in Warehouse 11

556
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
everything that happened.

557
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,980
Let them seal the entrance to the section of unredeemable goods.

558
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,700
Don't let the poisonous gas leak out.

559
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,380
Kylin.

560
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:46,820
Fatty.

561
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,660
Let's turn off the equipment.

562
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,620
Mr. Third Junior.

563
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,100
You must stay alive.

564
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,180
If you die,

565
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,020
I will stay in Warehouse 11

566
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
to guard your tomb for a lifetime.

567
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,260
I will talk to your spirit every day.

568
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,380
I'll be so nagging and noisy that you'll wake up in your tomb.

569
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,860
Put me down!

570
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,580
Remember to come back alive because you still have to pay me.

571
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,100
Put me down!

572
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,620
Put me down!

573
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,660
Mr. Third Junior, you must stay alive.

574
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,300
I am waiting for you to come back.

575
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,620
I'm waiting for you.

576
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,180
Are we kind of saviors now?

577
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,220
Not yet.

578
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,220
We will be after we succeed.

579
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,140
My life wish was to be a tomb raider.

580
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,140
How did I gradually turn into this?

581
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,940
Unfair fate.

582
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,380
Kylin.

583
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,420
How long can you stay in the poisonous fog?

584
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,140
With such a concentration,

585
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,140
fifteen minutes, max.

586
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,060
That won't work then.

587
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,100
We can't even make it halfway.

588
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,500
We can get there.

589
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,540
But we won't be able to return.

590
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,380
Let's go first.

591
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,260
Let me worry about

592
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,100
how to get back.

593
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,340
My blood

594
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,460
can only temporarily neutralize the toxin in the fog

595
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,420
and delay your time of symptoms kicking in.

596
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,540
It was the three of us together

597
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,300
at the very beginning of our story.

598
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,940
By the end of the story,

599
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,420
it's still the three of us together.

600
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,380
I found the treasures!

601
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,020
Bring it on!

602
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,100
These treasures are all mine!
