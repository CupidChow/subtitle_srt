00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,100
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,259
Episode 13

4
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,000
You stay.

5
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,800
Find someone.

6
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,759
Let's send Mr. Erbai up to the ground for treatment together.

7
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,320
It seems that

8
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,640
the only way to pass is going through this crack.

9
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,840
Okay.

10
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,360
You will lead the way

11
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,400
If you don't want to die,

12
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,760
shut your mouth after we enter there.

13
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,040
Mr. Jiao.

14
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,360
Uncle Erbai!

15
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,240
Run!

16
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,560
Run!

17
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,280
Hurry up, just go.

18
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,840
Hurry up!

19
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,760
Run!

20
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,360
Run!

21
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,000
Come on!

22
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,440
Mr. Third Junior!

23
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,440
Bai, are you okay?

24
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,720
Why did you guys come down?

25
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,040
What's the situation on the ground now?

26
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,840
It's safe for the time being.

27
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,680
Then why did Mr. Jiao come down, too?

28
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,000
Erjing wanted to buy some time for you,

29
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,120
so he gave Mr. Jiao

30
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,440
a fake map to Thunder City.

31
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,200
How about you?

32
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,920
Have you found any trace of Kylin and Glasses?

33
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,480
Not yet.

34
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,200
It was full of water when I just came down.

35
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,760
The water just receded and

36
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,240
these caves were revealed.

37
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,680
But the terrain here is too complicated.

38
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,560
I found nothing at the moment.

39
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,080
What should we do now?

40
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,120
Let's get out of here.

41
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,760
They all died just a moment ago.

42
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,560
They were all Mr. Jiao's people.

43
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,240
The scream just now

44
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,840
should be from them.

45
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,680
What stabbed him?

46
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
These bastards

47
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,640
all tried to escape.

48
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,520
It's easier to guard them here.

49
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,680
Especially this one.

50
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,360
He is the sneakiest one.

51
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,080
Hit him if he can't stay still.

52
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,200
Buddy, that's not what I meant.

53
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,720
Your Wu family has quite a tough approach.

54
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,280
You searched the whole floor and it's cleared, right?

55
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,159
Still searching it.

56
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,640
Get all the Jiao's people

57
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,680
down here.

58
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,320
Yes.

59
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,560
I need to see to such an

60
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
important mission personally.

61
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,520
Don't bother.

62
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,120
What?

63
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,000
Are you afraid that you can't guard all of them by yourself?

64
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,880
All I ask you to do is to keep an eye on him.

65
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,280
He runs away!

66
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,200
Freeze.

67
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,080
Freeze.

68
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,159
Stop!

69
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,800
Freeze!

70
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,400
Stop!

71
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,560
Freeze!

72
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,040
Stop!

73
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,360
Stop!

74
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,440
Freeze!

75
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:28,920
Freeze!

76
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,400
Stop!

77
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,800
Don't move.

78
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,880
Freeze!

79
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:38,960
Freeze!

80
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,640
Fatty, watch out!

81
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,400
There's a trap!

82
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,720
Run!

83
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,720
Run!

84
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,760
Run.

85
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,160
Go.

86
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,880
Are you alright?

87
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,680
I'm fine.

88
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,120
Is everyone okay?

89
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,560
Fine.

90
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,160
I'm fine.

91
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,080
What was that just now?

92
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,120
I'm not so sure either.

93
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,640
Maybe it was

94
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,000
a creature that will attack people as soon as it hears sounds.

95
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,280
I guess those corpses we just saw

96
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,440
met those creatures.

97
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,560
Jia Kezi.

98
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,600
We are still alive thanks to you.

99
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,760
That's the only insignificant ability I have.

100
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,080
The only insignificant ability?

101
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,240
How much has your ability helped us?

102
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,600
For the explosion sound just now,

103
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,720
can you tell which direction it came from?

104
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,640
Just ahead of us.

105
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,720
There is probably a bigger space over there.

106
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,680
But I'm not so sure.

107
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,720
Okay.

108
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,280
Guys, be alert.

109
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,840
Mr. Jiao's team

110
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,560
should be somewhere nearby.

111
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,760
Let's go!

112
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,440
There are two bodies here.

113
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,320
They come back to life!

114
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,600
Shh!

115
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,600
They're not coming back to life.

116
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,680
They probably weren't really dead.

117
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,920
Everyone, move with caution.

118
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,000
There are also many spikes here.

119
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,160
I'll go down to take a look.

120
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,120
Be careful.

121
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,680
Okay.

122
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,280
Don't move!

123
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,760
Mr. Third Junior!

124
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,800
There are thousands of breathing sounds here.

125
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,960
Breathing sounds?

126
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,200
Kezi, I think you're being paranoid.

127
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,600
I didn't hear any breathing sound.

128
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,320
They obviously died of those spikes.

129
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,080
But there is no obvious wound

130
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,280
on these two bodies.

131
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,040
I don't think they were killed by the spikes.

132
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
What is their cause of death then?

133
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,160
That's a good question.

134
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,280
I don't know either.

135
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,560
You…

136
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,040
Come on!

137
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,520
Let's go.

138
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,880
-Wait for me. -Let's see if there's any mark left by Kylin.

139
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,640
What happened?

140
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,520
Li Jiale.

141
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,520
Jiale.

142
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,600
Jiale.

143
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Jiale, give me your hand!

144
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,760
Jiale.

145
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,160
Run!

146
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,840
Help me.

147
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,520
Jiale.

148
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,360
Jiale.

149
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,600
Come up!

150
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,240
Jiale.

151
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,360
Jiale, give me your hand, now!

152
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,880
Take my hand!

153
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,440
Jiale.

154
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,040
Jiale.

155
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,760
Give me your hand.

156
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,360
Hurry up!

157
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,120
Take my hand!

158
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,280
Give me your hand now!

159
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,440
Hurry up!

160
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,600
Jiale.

161
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,160
Jiale.

162
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,440
What are those things?

163
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,160
Jiale, Jiale!

164
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,560
This is the breathing sound I heard!

165
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,840
Clam shells.

166
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,920
There are clam shells everywhere.

167
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,240
What should we do?

168
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,200
First, hold him still.

169
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,160
Okay.

170
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,880
Come on.

171
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,120
Bear with me.

172
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,040
Bear with me.

173
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,920
Don't move!

174
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,960
How about now?

175
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,200
They bite into his body too deep.

176
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,600
I can't get them off with a knife.

177
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,840
What should we do?

178
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,600
We have to speed up

179
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
or he will die.

180
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,760
Harder!

181
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,640
It works!

182
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,160
It works.

183
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,960
It really works.

184
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,720
But there are more and more coming!

185
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,880
No, it's too late.

186
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,560
Let's go!

187
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,400
Come on!

188
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,080
Let's go!

189
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,720
Jiale, are you alright?

190
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,320
Come on.

191
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,240
The explosion just now

192
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,400
probably came from this direction.

193
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,280
Everyone, be careful.

194
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,600
Let's go.

195
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,400
How are you feeling now?

196
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,160
I'm fine.

197
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,560
Now I don't need to restrain him. God has done my job.

198
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,080
Wait.

199
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,320
Someone is there.

200
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,160
Someone?

201
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,400
Could it be Mr. Jiao's people?

202
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,520
Where are they?

203
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,880
I can't see anything.

204
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,720
You don't have glasses like I do.

205
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,440
Don't move. Stay here.

206
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,480
Kezi, come with me to take a look.

207
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,000
Be careful.

208
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,920
This seems to be a stage for Beijing Opera.

209
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,800
Yes.

210
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,560
Is it for the dead people to watch?

211
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,720
But this is not a tomb.

212
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,200
There are no dead people.

213
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,760
Did you hear anything?

214
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,960
I can't hear anything clearly.

215
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,480
Maybe

216
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,360
this stage was originally built on the ground.

217
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,680
Then it fell down here due to an earthquake.

218
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,400
We'll know when we take a closer look.

219
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,680
Okay.

220
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,720
Jia Kezi

221
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,560
Call them over.

222
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,480
Okay.

223
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,040
These stone figurines

224
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,680
were a funeral custom that appeared in the Song Dynasty.

225
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,280
They act as patron saints of a tomb.

226
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,640
But this is not a tomb.

227
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,400
Why are they here?

228
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,200
There are footprints here.

229
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,840
Don't move!

230
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,600
Don't move!

231
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,720
Stay still.

232
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
Take your foot back.

233
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,320
Slowly.

234
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,240
Everyone, step back.

235
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,440
This is a mechanism called Dancing Marionette Figurines.

236
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,800
They connected all the figurines together with this kind of thread.

237
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,000
Once someone touches any thread,

238
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,720
he will be attacked by these figurines.

239
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,360
But look at those footprints.

240
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,240
Maybe Mr. Jiao's people have passed before us.

241
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,960
How did they do that?

242
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,680
There must be someone really good in their team.

243
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,160
That person found the switch and

244
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,400
jammed it.

245
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,280
After everyone had passed,

246
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,920
he turned the switch back on again.

247
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,360
Mr. Jiao chose this path

248
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,320
which means this is the exit of Spring of Roar.

249
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,720
Then Kylin may have passed here too.

250
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,800
What are you looking at?

251
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,200
You look particularly handsome when you are serious about something.

252
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,480
I'll go in first to

253
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,320
see if I can find the switch.

254
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,160
You will pass through

255
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,240
if I can find it.

256
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,680
No. It's too dangerous.

257
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,800
Let me do it.

258
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,160
Don't be ridiculous.

259
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,160
I'm dying anyway.

260
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,000
Every day I stay alive is an extra bonus

261
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,680
and I won't lose anything even if I die now.

262
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,320
Just cheer for me outside.

263
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,920
Don't move.

264
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,280
Be safe.

265
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,000
Slower.

266
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,600
He's out.

267
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,080
Now your head.

268
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,600
Be careful.

269
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,360
Lower.

270
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,840
A little bit lower.

271
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Wu Xie

272
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,480
My sister is waiting for you.

273
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,160
Watch out!

274
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,680
Out of the way!

275
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,400
Let's go!

276
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,720
Go!

277
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,000
We must get rid of that person

278
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,360
or he might attack us sneakily any time.

279
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,560
We can't get past those figurines.

280
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,640
Go after them!

281
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,240
Wu Xie

282
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,520
You have 40 minutes left for today's quota of movements.

283
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,560
You go first.

284
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,160
Are you okay?

285
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,360
I'm fine.

286
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,760
Don't move.

287
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,400
Be careful.

288
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,560
You are hurt.

289
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,200
It's not serious.

290
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,000
Bear with me.

291
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,160
Are you out of your mind?

292
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,880
Let me tell you,

293
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,680
if the accident just now happens again,

294
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,760
just take care of yourself.

295
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,000
Don't try to save me.

296
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,920
I know I was brought here to dive underwater to save them.

297
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,240
I know that your life is not important to you.

298
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,520
Only the lives of the people you are looking for are important.

299
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,800
Huo Daofu was right.

300
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,200
After I die,

301
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,520
you guys will all start a new life.

302
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,880
So

303
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,480
if you want me

304
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,960
to die without regrets,

305
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,320
try to stay alive.

306
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,520
I'm counting on you to burn paper money for me every year.

307
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,080
I hope you can burn for a few more years.

308
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,440
How about

309
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,280
eighty years?

310
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,960
Alright.

311
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,480
Look!

312
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,040
What is that?

313
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,960
This is the mechanism that controls the Dancing Marionette Figurines.

314
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,200
This place is so narrow.

315
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
If you are attacked immediately,

316
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,000
there is no chance of surviving for you.

317
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
You have been taking good care of Wu Xie along the way.

318
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,640
You don't want him to die, right?

319
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,840
So you'd better follow up.

320
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,200
You are wrong.

321
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,760
I came to watch him die.

322
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,200
I'm following you because I don't want to miss

323
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
the moment he dies.

324
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,520
I don't want to die.

325
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,200
Let me hear it clearly.

326
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,920
Then you won't get what you want.

327
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,040
I heard it. It's ahead. Let's go!

328
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,080
Better not.

329
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,360
Kezi.

330
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,240
Kezi.

331
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,120
Kezi.

332
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,320
Kezi.

333
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,240
If you waste your time killing both of them,

334
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,960
you won't catch up with Wu Xie.

335
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,640
What do you mean?

336
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,400
Wu Xie has passed those Dancing Marionette Figurines

337
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,760
and entered the ancient temple.

338
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,720
You just saw it.

339
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,160
I'm not joking with you.

340
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,080
Do you think you can get in there on your own?

341
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,840
You think you can catch up with Wu Xie on your own?

342
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,080
Keep talking.

343
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,120
I have a good idea.

344
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,040
How about

345
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,560
you put them in front of us

346
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,920
as a shield?

347
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,080
So you and I can go in there.

348
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,160
I'm a doctor.

349
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,680
I'm not strong as you guys.

350
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,320
You don't need to worry that I might attack you.

351
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,960
Take out your knife.

352
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,520
Here.

353
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,800
What are you giving it to me for?

354
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,680
Open it.

355
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,720
Point it outwards.

356
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,440
What are you looking at me for?

357
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,720
Look outside.

358
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,400
Look outside?

359
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,440
And then what?

360
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,720
And

361
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,760
then you'll just stay here and don't move.

362
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,280
No matter what happens in a while,

363
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,040
don't come out.

364
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,920
Did you hear me?

365
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,400
Don't create extra trouble for me.

366
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,400
I don't like crowds.

367
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,760
You alone are enough.

368
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,360
Go.

369
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,600
Go.

370
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,880
Go.

371
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,440
You don't deserve to have it.

372
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,360
Wu Xie.

373
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,920
You know I only want to kill you.

374
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,400
Or

375
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,400
are you going to give up this woman this time again?

376
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,960
It's not your first time anyway.

377
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,640
Let her go.

378
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,080
Your gun.

379
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,680
Don't listen to him!

380
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,840
Did you see that?

381
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,400
What this man knows best is to confuse people's mind.

382
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,680
Some men lie to women

383
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,000
and break their hearts.

384
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,480
But this man

385
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,240
will get women killed.

386
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,080
You're lying!

387
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,920
Mr. Third Junior never lied to me!

388
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,000
Don't be afraid.

389
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,640
As long as I kill him,

390
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,480
no one will fall victim to him again.

391
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,400
Mr. Third Junior!

392
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,840
Let go. Just leave me alone!

393
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,840
Don't talk.

394
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,720
Don't move.

395
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,960
Wu Xie!

396
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,320
Goodbye.

397
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,320
Mr. Third Junior!
