00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,900
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Episode 28

4
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,210
There are footprints here.

5
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,940
They are left by paint.

6
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,540
The footprints are still fresh.

7
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:48,620
Strange thing happened again.

8
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,379
In this case,

9
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,460
we will play this game with him.

10
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,220
Everyone, be alert..

11
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,060
Yes, sir!

12
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,700
Yes, sir!

13
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,180
Let's walk along following the footprints

14
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,780
to see what's going on in front of us.

15
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,100
The footsteps are gone.

16
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,379
It's a dead end.

17
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,780
Do you still think this is a warning?

18
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,060
Look at these footprints.

19
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,500
You know,

20
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,580
the patterns on the soles are copyrighted.

21
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,940
A person with related expertise can recognize

22
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,620
the brand and what year the shoes are put on sale at a glance.

23
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,100
I am impressed.

24
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,820
You even studied this area?

25
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,300
No.

26
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,379
I was just saying.

27
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,700
You…

28
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,620
You are kidding me, right?

29
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,420
But seriously,

30
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,300
if someone really wants to kill us,

31
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,820
this dead end will cause huge troubles to us.

32
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,660
It seems that

33
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,620
curiosity might get us killed.

34
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,370
Everyone, be alert to ambush!

35
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:35,569
Let's get out of here now.

36
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,540
Yes, sir.

37
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,780
Wine bottle, which sounds like nine.

38
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,580
Music box…Eight…

39
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,900
Nine,

40
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:00,140
eight…

41
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,060
And the footprints are left with paint,

42
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,380
which sounds like seven.

43
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:13,220
Nine,

44
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,540
eight,

45
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,180
seven…

46
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,260
Do you have any news of Liu Sang?

47
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,340
I just asked them. Not yet.

48
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,220
Maybe he was abducted by the spy's people?

49
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:32,900
I don't think so.

50
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,740
I made a failure protection

51
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,660
on the bronze reeds.

52
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,660
We originally wanted to destroy them.

53
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,420
So if something happens to Liu Sang,

54
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,660
he will destroy them immediately.

55
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,860
The place where the reeds are hidden is not far from here.

56
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,220
If there is still no news,

57
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,300
we have to go there to take a look.

58
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,980
What did you hear?

59
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,540
They are chit-chatting.

60
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,900
About what?

61
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,100
He said that you're so simple-minded.

62
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,620
You said that, right?

63
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,740
I'm telling you,

64
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,980
sometimes the tacit understanding between two comrades-in-arms

65
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,060
is just as simple as this.

66
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,900
Out of the way.

67
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,580
Mr. Third Junior understands what you mean.

68
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,700
Everyone, get ready.

69
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,060
Let's do it at my command.

70
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,500
If

71
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,140
everything in this world

72
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,620
can start with some applaud

73
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,540
and just be put to an end with a sneeze,

74
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,860
how nice that'll be.

75
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,100
Applause means taking action and

76
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,340
sneezing means stop.

77
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,100
Stop?

78
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,100
So, we are supposed to stop during the middle?

79
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,060
Wu Xie seems to have her own plan.

80
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,660
What plan?

81
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,660
Keep listening.

82
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,459
Uncle Erjing.

83
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,700
How long have you been working for my Uncle Erbai?

84
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,380
It'll be twenty years

85
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,180
in a few months.

86
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,060
Have you ever resented our Wu family?

87
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,020
Or to be more specific, Uncle Erbai?

88
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,780
So many guys working for my family were dead or got wounded.

89
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,620
Do you think they will hate our Wu family?

90
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,500
Will they hate me?

91
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,140
You're think too much about nothing.

92
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,220
There are risks in any industry.

93
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,500
Even when you are walking on the sidewalk,

94
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,460
you might get involved in a car accident.

95
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,380
Right?

96
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,380
Life is always short.

97
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,100
They chose this path of career

98
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,820
just to support their family.

99
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,260
Of course it was only a job to support their family in the beginning.

100
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,420
But after a long time, this job will naturally become something different.

101
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
Take you for example, Uncle Erjing.

102
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,780
You've been staying by my Uncle Erbai's side for so many years.

103
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,700
It's definitely not just for the money he pays you.

104
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,380
When people spend a lot of time together,

105
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,459
of course they will grow some bond.

106
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,380
Since they chose this line of business,

107
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,540
they have been mentally prepared

108
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,140
to die for it since day one they took this job.

109
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,660
Me, too.

110
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,940
What's the matter?

111
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,980
Uncle Erjing, the blood vessels on the back of your neck have blackened.

112
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,220
Cutting your hand off doesn't seem to stop

113
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,620
the spread of these bronze toxins.

114
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,340
Really?

115
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,700
Take a photo and let me see.

116
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,980
You really don't care

117
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,900
about your safety?

118
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,260
We don't have any clue right now.

119
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,849
Although we both know that

120
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,820
there might be antidote in South Sea Kingdom's imperial temple,

121
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,740
in case there is really nothing there,

122
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,700
since the area under the section of unredeemable goods is so huge,

123
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,260
we will be like finding a needle in a haystack.

124
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,580
But being afraid won't change anything.

125
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,180
I won't let anything happen to you.

126
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,300
I will find the antidote as soon as possible and

127
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,700
catch the spy or spies.

128
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,340
Now have a rest.

129
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,980
Abort the mission.

130
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,580
Wu Xie already knew that Erjing is the spy.

131
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,180
He wants to get information from him about

132
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,940
the whereabouts of the antidote to the bronze toxin.

133
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,020
Did you really hear it clearly?

134
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,980
I am telling you, this is very risky for Wu Xie.

135
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,380
No, I have to get Naive out first.

136
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,780
I am going. Wait for us to come back.

137
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,020
Don't go.

138
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,140
Mr. Third Junior's is right.

139
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,740
We have no time.

140
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,900
I believe in him.

141
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,100
There is indeed a tacit understanding between you.

142
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,700
What should we do now?

143
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:47,820
Liu Sang.

144
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,740
If you can hear me,

145
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,940
this is my plan.

146
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,180
Did you remember what I just said?

147
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,980
As long as Erjing gets down to the Warehouse 11,

148
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,180
open this letter and read it.

149
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,100
Is there any other information Wu Xie left?

150
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,860
No.

151
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,100
It's all written in the plan.

152
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,140
On it he said that

153
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,660
he wants the two of us to finish this mission.

154
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,620
Mr. Glasses.

155
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,700
Mr. Erbai is still in their hands.

156
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,100
You must find a way

157
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,420
to get him out.

158
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,580
Don't start talking about the plan yet.

159
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,860
I haven't promised you that I would go.

160
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,660
But this is a matter of life or death, Mr. Glasses.

161
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,300
You can't watch Mr. Erbai to be killed by them.

162
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,220
You've known me for a long time.

163
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,540
So you should know the rules.

164
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,780
It costs money to hire me to do things,

165
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,780
actually, it costs a fortune.

166
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,180
Wu Xie did not leave any information.

167
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,580
But at least he should leave you some money, right?

168
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,260
Got it.

169
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,980
This is all my savings.

170
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,540
Mr. Glasses.

171
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,500
I'll only hire you for one day.

172
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,940
Are you playing me for a fool?

173
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,300
That's it?

174
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,820
It's not enough for my travel expenses for one day.

175
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,300
Consider this as deposit.

176
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,900
I'll sell my blood and my organs to pay you the rest of the money!

177
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,340
I will definitely pay you.

178
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,820
Mr. Glasses.

179
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,820
Can you help me one last time?

180
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,220
I'm begging you?

181
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,700
You can tell me to do anything!

182
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,900
Whatever you ask me to do!

183
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,060
Help me this once.

184
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,900
Mr. Glasses. Please?

185
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,180
Glasses!

186
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,060
Are you helping or not?

187
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,180
Just say a word!

188
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,420
You punk.

189
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,980
You are so stingy and calculating. Okay. Let's go.

190
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,900
Okay!

191
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,780
I have a flush.

192
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,420
Come on.

193
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,660
OK, I'll stick with my single cards.

194
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,420
Go on then.

195
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,540
I'll pass.

196
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:43,860
Cheers.

197
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,380
The cards are lousy.

198
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,220
Kun, is it time for the changing of the guard?

199
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,580
Did you go out to date a chick

200
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,940
Last night?

201
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,460
Keep a close eye on the house.

202
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,780
Got it.

203
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,820
That punk thinks about partying all day long.

204
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,020
Come on.

205
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,380
Let me tell you that the other day…

206
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,380
Kun.

207
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,900
Someone wants to talk to you.

208
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,180
Go for it if you think you're good.

209
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,220
Yeah.

210
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,260
Yeah. Do it.

211
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:27,780
Who is it?

212
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,060
Where is he?

213
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,420
He…

214
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,300
He said that he is coming in now.

215
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,180
Stop playing!

216
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:37,980
Grab your weapon!

217
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,340
Let's go!

218
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,140
Grab your weapon!

219
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,700
Grab your weapon!

220
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,100
Go!

221
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,340
Go after them!

222
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,620
Freeze!

223
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,180
Stop!

224
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,380
Stop!

225
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,100
Come on!

226
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:51,940
Don't move.

227
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,340
Chase him. Come on!

228
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,820
Hurry up and help them!

229
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,780
Where is he?

230
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,380
Where's he?

231
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,780
Where is he?

232
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,460
We lost him!

233
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,740
Kun.

234
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,340
We lost him.

235
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:05,980
Kun.

236
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,740
Kun.

237
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,100
Kun!

238
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,180
Kun, wake up.

239
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,020
Kun.

240
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,420
Kun.

241
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,980
Kun, are you okay?

242
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,820
Kun!

243
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,260
Wu Erbai is gone.

244
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,660
Wang Meng took him!

245
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,020
Go after them!

246
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,540
Hurry up! They're over there.

247
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,420
Come on!

248
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,260
Mr. Erbai.

249
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,540
Mr. Erbai, get up.

250
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,300
I can't take you away with me this time.

251
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,140
I will come back to save you.

252
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,860
Freeze!

253
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,380
Hurry up. Go get him!

254
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,180
Mr. Erbai, I will come back to save you.

255
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:51,780
Freeze!

256
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,820
Freeze!

257
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,700
Freeze!

258
00:16:59,340 --> 00:16:59,900
Don't go after him.

259
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,740
There's no point to catch Wang Meng.

260
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,740
As long as Wu Erbai is still in our hands,

261
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,380
they won't dare do anything.

262
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,620
Bring him back.

263
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,180
Take him.

264
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:23,610
This way.

265
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,540
This is it.

266
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,740
Don't touch them.

267
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,660
To prevent them from being stolen,

268
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,500
I added some expander in the case.

269
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,500
It will explode if not treated with care.

270
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,580
Uncle Erjing, stay away from it.

271
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,740
Let me dismantle the expander first.

272
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,940
Ok, be careful.

273
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,820
There you go.

274
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,380
Just to be safe,

275
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,180
I hid the reeds in three different places.

276
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,140
Uncle Erjing, leave one of your people to stay and guard them.

277
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,100
I will take you to find the other two places.

278
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,980
After we find all the rest,

279
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,740
we can come back here to meet again.

280
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,460
Sure. Let's do as you say.

281
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,220
-Wu Xie -Yes?

282
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,820
Wu Xie is about to succeed.

283
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,940
This is it.

284
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,660
Where are they?

285
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,820
Come on. Help me move this away.

286
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,460
Go now!

287
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,500
Come on.

288
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,860
Push.

289
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,060
Come on.

290
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,460
The rest of the bronze reeds are all here.

291
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,820
I'll go down to get them.

292
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,020
I'll come up to join you

293
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,060
after I get them.

294
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,580
Wait for me here.

295
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,380
Okay.

296
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,540
This hole is quite deep.

297
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,020
Stay here and wait for me.

298
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,620
Be careful.

299
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,500
Don't worry.

300
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,780
Be careful.

301
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,340
Did you find them?

302
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,100
Mr. Third Junior.

303
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,460
Mr. Third Junior!

304
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,860
You two, go down and have a look.

305
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,860
Yes, sir.

306
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,500
Kill him after you find the reeds.

307
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,300
Yes.

308
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,700
Uncle Erjing.

309
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:22,780
Come on.

310
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,780
Be careful.

311
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,460
Uncle Erjing.

312
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,140
Let's go.

313
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,740
He did it.

314
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,820
Go on!

315
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,060
The suspense has been driving me crazy!

316
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,220
What Wu Xie has been doing

317
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,020
is to distract Erjing's people away from him.

318
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,780
Now Erjing is on his own.

319
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,220
Wu Xie will act soon.

320
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,620
We have to follow them now.

321
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,980
Naive is not naïve at all.

322
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,500
Let's go.

323
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,420
Let's go.

324
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:09,900
Come on.

325
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,460
Be careful.

326
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,100
Here, here, and here.

327
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,140
Alright.

328
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,260
See?

329
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,740
Now we're even.

330
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,300
This mask is so suffocating.

331
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,420
Anyway, there are just the two of us now.

332
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,940
No need to disguise anymore.

333
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,940
I wonder

334
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,460
what happened with the guys.

335
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,260
It happened all too fast just now.

336
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,740
I didn't see it clearly.

337
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,420
Can we still meet up with them?

338
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,100
The passage we just went down was too complicated.

339
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,140
I guess it's impossible to return back by the way we came.

340
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,740
So we can only try to find

341
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,980
Jiang Yuan's marks as soon as possible.

342
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,020
I think we can

343
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,260
meet them somewhere.

344
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,940
Do you want some water?

345
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,260
It's okay.

346
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,140
Why do you have them?

347
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,260
What?

348
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,380
The reeds

349
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,180
Reeds?

350
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,220
Before I helped you,

351
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,340
I tried to pick up a few.

352
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,660
I carefully selected

353
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,860
the finest reeds.

354
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,980
They should be the key components to make sounds.

355
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,780
I specially packed them.

356
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,260
Don't touch them.

357
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,860
This is the protection I told you before.

358
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,460
All the reeds in my bag

359
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,260
are connected to this grenade.

360
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,820
If anyone tries to take these reeds,

361
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,140
his action will detonate this grenade.

362
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,620
No, Mr. Third Junior.

363
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,460
It's too dangerous.

364
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,500
Let me carry them.

365
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,740
Don't force it.

366
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,260
You have an amputated arm.

367
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,700
You can't handle it. Let me carry them.

368
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,740
No, I came down to protect you.

369
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,900
We have come to a critical moment.

370
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,060
You don't have the obligation to protect me anymore.

371
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,580
I said I'll do it.

372
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,740
How about

373
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,340
I'll carry them now?

374
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,820
You can replace me when I get tired.

375
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,420
Okay?

376
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:05,900
Let's go

377
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,580
find Jiang Yuan's marks.

378
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,540
We can meet them.

379
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,340
Come on.

380
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:13,980
Let's go.

381
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,340
Uncle Erjing.

382
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,900
You take some rest here.

383
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,740
Okay.

384
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,660
Why do I feel that

385
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,500
we've been circling around here?

386
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,060
If we can't find the right way soon,

387
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,900
I think we will starve to death here.

388
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,820
We won't starve to death, at least not so fast.

389
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,740
There are six boxes of pilot biscuits

390
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,860
4 loads of bread and 500ml water in my backpack.

391
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,220
Found it.

392
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,740
I was always worried that

393
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,700
this is not the scope of Jiang Yuan's activities.

394
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,660
But it seems he

395
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,460
really runs the place for a long time in the section of unredeemable goods.

396
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:20,940
Go.

397
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,900
Follow his marks.

398
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,060
What is it?

399
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,740
Uncle Erjing.

400
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,660
Did you realize something?

401
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,300
The road we have been walking on

402
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,420
keeps going downward all the time.

403
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,340
And all the marks Jiang Yuan left

404
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,740
are all the same.

405
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
If it were me,

406
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,300
I would have used two different marks.

407
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,940
One is for supplies and

408
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,460
the other marks food.

409
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,420
But all the marks he left

410
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,740
are all the same.

411
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,900
This can only mean one thing.

412
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,420
There is probably only one way in and out.

413
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,780
Maybe only Jiang Yuan

414
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,220
can understand this mark.

415
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,740
After all, he carved it.

416
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,780
No.

417
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,580
This mark

418
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,660
is left to

419
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,060
guide the way for the main forces entering the section of unredeemable goods after him.

420
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,140
So the marks must point to

421
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,100
the destination.

422
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,100
South Sea Kingdom's imperial temple.

423
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,740
Let's go.

424
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,620
These are the totem they left.

425
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,820
I think they were drawn by the people who stored the goods here back them.

426
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,220
Judging from this color of it,

427
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,900
they were drawn at least decades ago.

428
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,020
We should not be far from the destination.

429
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,100
Come on.

430
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,580
Clocks again?

431
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,940
We have seen a lot of clocks along the way.

432
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,700
Is there any specific meaning behind them?

433
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,380
I have no idea.

434
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,460
All pointers

435
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,540
are going irregularly.

436
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,900
Since yesterday,

437
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,820
the magnetic field in this underground place has messed up.

438
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,500
No.

439
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,380
Mr. Erbai, what is it?

440
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,540
The magnetic field under the ground gets messier.

441
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,900
I'm afraid something bad will happen.

442
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,260
Magnetic field…

443
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,740
Chaotic magnetic field.

444
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,220
Why is there a chaotic magnetic field here?

445
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,540
Have no idea.

446
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,820
This stone wall is fake.

447
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,450
Someone attacked it on

448
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,010
a bronze wall behind.

449
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,260
This bronze wall

450
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,140
affected the movement of the pointer.

451
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,620
Uncle Erjing.

452
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,300
We will arrive at the destination soon.

453
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,860
Isn't it spectacular?

454
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,100
Look at these colors!

455
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,980
It's just a wall made of bronze.

456
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,740
But that's impossible.

457
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,020
How could it be built of bronze?

458
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,100
At that time, bronze was just as expensive as gold.

459
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,620
It's impossible to build an entire temple with bronze.

460
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,820
Then what is it?

461
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,260
It's not bronze anyway.

462
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,940
Okay, whatever it is.

463
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,100
Let's hurry down.

464
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,700
Wait.

465
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,100
Uncle Erjing.

466
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,740
I have a question for you.

467
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:38,900
What is it?

468
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,500
Have you ever thought about a possibility that

469
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,380
I'm the spy in the Wu family?

470
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,180
What kind of joke is this?

471
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,540
This Wu family is yours anyway.

472
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,340
What if what I want is not the Wu family?

473
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,100
What if what I want

474
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,380
is everything in the South Sea Kingdom's imperial temple?

475
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,620
You'd better not move now.

476
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,940
As long as my backpack is a bit farther away from me,

477
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,220
the grenade will explode.

478
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,460
-You… -Me,

479
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,020
and the reeds in my bag

480
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,460
will all be blown up.

481
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,540
You watched me grow up.

482
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,780
I always thought that you saw yourself

483
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,700
as a member of the Wu family.

484
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,540
I really didn't expect you to…

485
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,300
The idea never crossed my mind!

486
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,860
Why would you save me?

487
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,180
That's because I was used to it.

488
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,460
Why did you save me?

489
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,900
I have protected your Wu family for so many years.

490
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,140
As long as any of the Wu family's members are in danger,

491
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,060
I will react to it immediately intuitively.

492
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,700
Mr. Third Junior.

493
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,180
Mr. Third Junior, did you get hurt?

494
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,060
No.

495
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,140
Uncle Erjing, your leg…

496
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,460
I am glad as long as you are fine.

497
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,860
Can I still trust

498
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,100
what you say?

499
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,220
When did you realize it was me?

500
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,100
You think it was hard to find you out?

501
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,220
It was not.

502
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,820
It was really not difficult at all.

503
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,580
But for so many years

504
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,380
my Uncle Erbai has always trusted you.

505
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,100
I also treated you as

506
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:09,980
one of my family members.

507
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,620
So I didn't want to believe,

508
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,900
and even now I still don't want to admit that

509
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,860
you, Uncle Erjing,

510
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,500
is the spy.

511
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,900
You have been working for Uncle Erbai for so many years.

512
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,260
What is your purpose?

513
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,140
My purpose is clear and simple.

514
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,140
The treasure of South Sea King.

515
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,020
Are you serious?

516
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,500
You made my Uncle Erbai become disabled

517
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,380
just for money.

518
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,620
Are you crazy?

519
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,140
I want to tell you a story.

520
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,660
Do you think I heard a rumor and just went for it?

521
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,780
You can't understand

522
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,540
why I am so obsessed with money that

523
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,500
I even served in your Wu family for so many years

524
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,660
just waiting for a chance to get money?

525
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,420
Yes. I can't understand.

526
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,220
That is because

527
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,980
I went to

528
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,180
work for your Wu family with that purpose from the beginning.

529
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,100
I swore that

530
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,380
I would use the Wu family

531
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,100
to get the treasures of South Sea King.

532
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,540
This was why I mixed inside your Wu family.

533
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,340
I did just like what Wu Sanxing did back then.

534
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,060
After he mixed inside the weather observation team,

535
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,540
he used schemes so I was abandoned by my companions.

536
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,940
Then he went to Thunder City

537
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,900
to achieve his purpose.

538
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,060
So tit for tat. I also wanted to destroy your family,

539
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,020
and take the Wu family as my own.

540
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,780
Then I would get the treasures and

541
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,740
realize my revenge plan in the end.

542
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,540
These important steps are all necessary.

543
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,900
One step less, then it's not a full revenge.

544
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,100
You know my Uncle Sanxing.

545
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,180
Open the door.

546
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,180
I was only seven years old.

547
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:07,900
Open the door!

548
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,460
A disaster happened to my family.

549
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,180
Open the door!

550
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,580
Open the door now!

551
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,700
Did you hear me?

552
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,860
Open the door!

553
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:15,780
Come on!

554
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:20,420
Search the place!

555
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,340
Don't go through my stuff!

556
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,580
I'll kill you.

557
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,500
Go away!

558
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,780
-I am going to kill you. -Calm down.

559
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,340
-Calm down. -Die!

560
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,100
Come on!

561
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,700
Mom, mom.

562
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,460
Mom!

563
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,900
When they were gone…

564
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,460
Wake up, wake up!

565
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,020
My mom was dying.

566
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,020
Mom!

567
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,060
I ran out to find someone to save my mother.

568
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,260
When I passed under a tree,

569
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,420
I heard someone shouting at me.

570
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,100
Kid, get out of there!

571
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,420
Who are you?

572
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,620
Where are you?

573
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,460
Get out of there!

574
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,460
At that moment the tree fell

575
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,140
and almost killed me.

576
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,300
The leader saved me.

577
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,380
He also let me join his thunder listening team.

578
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,020
It can satisfy all your wishes

579
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,780
and reverse all regrets.

580
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,260
So I started to study following the team leader.

581
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,660
After consulting a lot of historical archives,

582
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,140
I finally found that

583
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,220
everyone said the Holy Land is Thunder City with

584
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,260
the artifact and treasures.

585
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,780
Actually it was just

586
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,540
a camouflage of South Sea King.

587
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,580
He led everyone to Thunder City to a treasure hunt

588
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,100
while here,

589
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,940
the temple under Warehouse 11,

590
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,620
is where South Sea King's treasures are really hidden.

591
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,380
But you have to get the artifact in Thunder City first to

592
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,020
open the mechanism of the temple

593
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,980
and get the treasures.

594
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,820
So I had to use the resources of your Wu family

595
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,620
to do that for me.

596
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,500
So I persuaded Jiang Yuan who lived here

597
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,700
to be my informant

598
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,220
and guard the treasures for me.

599
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,900
Now my plan will come true.

600
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,780
So you used me.

601
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,140
You and Wu Sanxing have exactly the same personality.

602
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,060
You are both curious with

603
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,700
strong willpower and execution.

604
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:11,900
And also,

605
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,980
you are the only heir to the Wu family.

606
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,660
So I pretended to be your Uncle Sanxing to

607
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,700
send you a text message.

608
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,500
If you were not so curious,

609
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,460
my plan wouldn't have a chance to be carried out.

610
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,940
It was you who sent me that text message.

611
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,020
The message Wang Junyi received

612
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,580
was also sent by me.

613
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,940
After all, I have been hiding in the Wu family for so many years.

614
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,140
I am familiar with your Uncle Sanxing's encryption method.

615
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,980
Your Uncle Erbai is cunning.

616
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,220
He deprived you of your mobility right away

617
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,700
because he was afraid you might be used by someone.

618
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,980
I am telling you in advance.

619
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,660
You have to listen to me in many things.

620
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,900
He had already noticed the existence of a spy.

621
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,700
But you didn't listen to him.

622
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,060
You are like your Uncle Sanxing.

623
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,340
You never listen to anyone.

624
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,820
You just do things your own way,

625
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,100
Do you know what the biggest obstacle is for me to get

626
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,660
in the section unredeemable goods?

627
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,820
Tian Youjin's theft union.

628
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:30,940
They occupied

629
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,980
all the routes from Warehouse 11 to the section of unredeemable goods.

630
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,580
Thank you for

631
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,180
getting rid of them for me.

632
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,180
So I could go directly to the temple.

633
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,580
So,

634
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,060
everything was all part of your plan.

635
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,900
Using you,

636
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,300
I took the artifact from Thunder City.

637
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,980
This is the last step of my revenge plan.
