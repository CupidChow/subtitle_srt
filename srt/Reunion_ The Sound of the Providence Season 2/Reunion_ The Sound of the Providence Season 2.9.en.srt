00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,340
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,250
Episode 9

4
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,630
Listen.

5
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,870
Do you hear anything unusual?

6
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,990
Something is wrong.

7
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,150
There are people of different groups staying in this hotel.

8
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,070
Many people don't look like ordinary tourists.

9
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,910
And they are not equipped for travelling.

10
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,550
There are also many people on guards in the parking lot

11
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,190
Things are a bit complicated here.

12
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,629
It is really a bit complicated.

13
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,140
I guess this Tianlin Building has become

14
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,590
a battle field.

15
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,590
What do you think?

16
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,590
Go in there and take a tour.

17
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,430
Find Kylin and

18
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,390
save Uncle Erbai.

19
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,590
Let's go back to the car.

20
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,590
Let's go.

21
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,790
Okay.

22
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,510
Where are they?

23
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,270
I love this game.

24
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:21,900
Shall I stand here?

25
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,110
Sure.

26
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:23,910
Take a photo for me.

27
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,110
Make sure to include the building in the background.

28
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,860
Stand still. Here we go.

29
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,470
Done.

30
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:27,670
Okay.

31
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,940
How about my posture?

32
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,070
Alright, everyone get off now.

33
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,190
Remember to take all your belongings.

34
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,550
Okay.

35
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:38,390
Today we will stay here for the night.

36
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,590
This building is called Tianlin

37
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,950
with a long history.

38
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,430
According to the legend, when building it,

39
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,270
a kylin came down from the sky

40
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,430
to send a blessing to the building,

41
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,830
hence the name Tianlin, or Kylin of Sky in Mandarin.

42
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,550
There will be

43
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,310
a firework show here every three days.

44
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,790
It'll be held by the courtyard.

45
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,830
You guys can all go to take pictures if you're interested.

46
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,310
Okay, guys, follow me.

47
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,110
Let's go.

48
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,860
-I want this.
-Keep up.

49
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,110
-Keep up, hurry.
 -Give it to me.

50
00:03:59,230 --> 00:03:59,670
Okay.

51
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,350
Keep up, Zhang.

52
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,310
It's has a strong ethnic minority characteristic.

53
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:07,860
Yes.

54
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,990
Guys.

55
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,350
Line up and follow me.

56
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,110
Come on. Watch your step.

57
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,230
Look over there.

58
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,300
Okay, everyone, come here.

59
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,030
You can see the Tianlin Building behind me.

60
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,390
When people chose the location of Tianlin Building, they took its fengshui into consideration.

61
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,830
Look.

62
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,590
It's wide in front with a firm structure in the back.

63
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,390
It stays away from the wind with enough sunshine.

64
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,270
The first floor is the noisiest.

65
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,870
There is no sound on the third floor.

66
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,390
It should be completely empty.

67
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,140
What about the second floor?

68
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,220
People staying on the second floor are quiet.

69
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,470
They speak very lightly

70
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,630
with steady footsteps.

71
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,350
I think they are all masters of martial arts.

72
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,190
Take a photo for me.

73
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,990
The camera hates me.

74
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,230
Look over there.

75
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,110
Look at the second floor.

76
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,540
Why are the people of the Dumb Village also here?

77
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:33,870
Should we call the police?

78
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,710
What's the use of calling the police?

79
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:35,990
They didn't do anything.

80
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,230
They can say they came here to travel.

81
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,750
Don't provoke them yet.

82
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,590
Your Uncle Erbai doesn't have many friends, huh?

83
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,230
The whole world is celebrating when something seems to happen to him.

84
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,070
There will even be a firework show.

85
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,790
People will all come here if he's really dead.

86
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,510
Hong?

87
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,150
Where is he?

88
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,950
At your three o'clock.

89
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,430
Mr. Fatty!

90
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,790
Help me!

91
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,630
Didn't people say that he was killed by Xue?

92
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,140
I even burned some paper money as offerings to his soul.

93
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,550
He just pretended to be dead!

94
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,910
Okay.

95
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,950
I'll let you die for real this time.

96
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,630
Over here.

97
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,670
Here.

98
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,550
Let's take another one here.

99
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,270
Smile.

100
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,190
Look at this.

101
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,660
Who is he?

102
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,070
Look at these two.

103
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,709
This one is

104
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,150
Gu

105
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,510
and this one goes by

106
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,830
Myna.

107
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,150
They are both explosive experts among tomb raiders.

108
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,830
Of course, not half as me.

109
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,910
All desperadoes.

110
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,070
All the guys you need to raid a tomb are here.

111
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,150
You have to spend a fortune

112
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,230
to get so many experts here.

113
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,750
Since Mr. Jiao is so rich,

114
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,830
why bother to raid a tomb?

115
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,300
They all come for Thunder City.

116
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,150
It seems that there is indeed some treasure in Thunder City.

117
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,230
Jiao brings so many people here.

118
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,830
It seems that he's very determined to get it.

119
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,300
We have to find a way to stop them.

120
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,910
I'll check in first.

121
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,550
Okay.

122
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,900
Come on. Take a picture of me and my girlfriend.

123
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,270
Play along with me.

124
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,830
Try to get rooms on the third floor and

125
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,390
see their check-in information.

126
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,070
Let's look intimate.

127
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,710
What's the point?

128
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,390
It isn't convincing no matter how intimate you two look.

129
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,470
I think you need to change the relationship of your characters.

130
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,510
No problem.

131
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,110
Let's go.

132
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,510
Take the suitcase.

133
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,510
You punk.

134
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,180
Welcome.

135
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,750
How can I help you?

136
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,430
Check in, please.

137
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,110
Sorry, we're fully booked.

138
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,630
I booked online in advance.

139
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,750
Oh, you made your reservation on Ctrip.

140
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,990
So you booked

141
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,670
a single room, a room with twin beds and

142
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,790
and a room with three beds.

143
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,990
That'll be room 110, 118, and 121.

144
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,790
If you want to watch the fireworks show,

145
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,070
it'll be an extra charge of thirty-nine yuan.

146
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,070
Is there a room on the third floor? We want to stay on the third floor.

147
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,270
Sorry, it's fully booked.

148
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,630
Okay.

149
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,910
Then go ahead to get us checked in.

150
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,300
Don't make a mistake.

151
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,550
That single room is mine.

152
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,260
Sure, I got it.

153
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,510
You're lying to us.

154
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,820
The third floor is completely empty.

155
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,229
How can you take our registration form without permission?

156
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:50,430
I was surprised when I saw it.

157
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,230
You are deceiving consumers.

158
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,870
I'm going to file a complaint on Ctrip.

159
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,030
I didn't lie to you.

160
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,350
There is some exceptional case with the rooms on the third floor now.

161
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,630
The previous guests rented the whole floor.

162
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,990
They left earlier and

163
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,270
haven't come back yet.

164
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,870
But they already paid the rent in advance.

165
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,270
According to the rules, we can't rent the rooms to other guests.

166
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,830
Also the guests on the second floor now

167
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,310
already booked all the rooms on the third floor.

168
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,710
When the lease of the third floor expires,

169
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,540
guests on the second floor will move upstairs.

170
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,670
The third floor has a better view.

171
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,670
I see.

172
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,910
You see, it's not like we can come here to travel often.

173
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,510
Could you let me and my daughter

174
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,670
go up there to take a photo?

175
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,230
When the guests on the third floor left,

176
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,710
they sealed the exit of the stairs to the third floor.

177
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,780
You can wait until the lease expires.

178
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,310
You can't go up now.

179
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,510
This is crazy.

180
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,830
Rich people are crazy.

181
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:41,830
Done?

182
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,790
Soon.

183
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,270
This room is ready.

184
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,670
The air is really fresh here.

185
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,310
Then can I live a few more days?

186
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,470
What are you looking for?

187
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:13,790
A mark.

188
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,550
What mark?

189
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,950
Who left it to you?

190
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,830
Kylin left it to me.

191
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,470
Why?

192
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,670
What does it mean?

193
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,510
Three...

194
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,070
fifteen.

195
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,590
Third floor.

196
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,550
Room 315.

197
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,030
315?

198
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,870
Yes.

199
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,430
Buddy.

200
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,740
It's a dead end.

201
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,150
The place is haunted.

202
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,950
If you are interested in this place,

203
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,950
let's talk somewhere else.

204
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,470
Naive.

205
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,830
I got some important information.

206
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,630
Come back.

207
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,790
You will be recognized.

208
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,230
This man is a sniper.

209
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,190
He remembers figures of people he meets.

210
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,830
Curiosity killed the fat cat.

211
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,430
Time's running out for you.

212
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,230
Wait.

213
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,500
Who is this?

214
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,710
A friend.

215
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,190
Boss said that

216
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,180
we can't bring strangers in here.

217
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,190
Don't you know?

218
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,390
And why does he

219
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,190
look a bit familiar?

220
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,310
If Boss has a problem with it,

221
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,030
he can talk to me personally.

222
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,900
Now piss off.

223
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,630
You are a poacher, right?

224
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,870
I hunt rabbits.

225
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,790
You make trousers?

226
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,910
You didn't strike me as a tailor.

227
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,750
Hard of hearing.

228
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,350
I can't hear people clearly, so I have to wear this.

229
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,340
My eyes are sensitive to light, too.

230
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,350
My miserable life.

231
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,710
Any gains?

232
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,230
The hunting season for wild rabbits just starts.

233
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,990
I haven't hunted anything yet.

234
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,350
But I should be able

235
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,910
to get some rabbits this time.

236
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,750
Hunting is forbidden in this area recently.

237
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,260
I have to go deep in the mountains to hunt rabbits.

238
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,070
Nobody gives a damn there.

239
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,830
Oh, you just said rabbits?

240
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,510
I was wondering why you needed to go into the mountains to make trousers.

241
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,230
You just told me that

242
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,710
the building is haunted.

243
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,510
Is that true?

244
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,830
When I first came here,

245
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,790
I was as curious as you.

246
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,150
I also wanted to go up there for a tour.

247
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,270
Everything was normal during the day.

248
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,190
But at night,

249
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,830
after someone went to the third floor,

250
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,150
there would always be someone missing.

251
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,910
Check around.

252
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,350
Report if you find anything.

253
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,270
Yes, sir!

254
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,430
I'm in room 326. What the hell is this?

255
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,350
Sir.

256
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,030
The person who scouted with me

257
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,990
went missing.

258
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,270
Something doesn't seem right.

259
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:14,860
Let's get out of here.

260
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,790
Let's go.

261
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,350
Okay.

262
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,470
Did you call the police?

263
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,830
We are here to poach. We couldn't call the police.

264
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,670
So if you ask me, don't go upstairs.

265
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,710
Buddy.

266
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,790
Judging by your behavior,

267
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,710
you're not here just for traveling, right?

268
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,030
What do you think?

269
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,790
Let's try working together.

270
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,590
You want to buy me dinner?

271
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,470
You are so kind.

272
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,990
I am not interested in rabbits.

273
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,990
But I do like Bunny Girls.

274
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,270
I think what you said is

275
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,910
nothing but a rumor.

276
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,750
Look at this teeny-weeny place.

277
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,670
Where could the missing people go?

278
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,790
You don't believe it?

279
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,310
I am not trying to argue with you.

280
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,390
I am an absolute materialist!

281
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,140
If you don't believe it,

282
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,350
let's go upstairs to see what will happen tonight.

283
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,750
He knows that I'm here.

284
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,830
Come back quickly.

285
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,030
Forget it.

286
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,510
I have to go.

287
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,990
Let me

288
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,350
buy you dinner some time.

289
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,990
But you should try to watch less

290
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,110
TV show of this kind.

291
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,910
Bad for the brain.

292
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,150
You're welcome to visit me.

293
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,830
My boss and I have different ideas.

294
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,870
There are many things that I don't want to share with him.

295
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,110
You'll feel better

296
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,310
if you make friends and talk to them.

297
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,150
Take care of your health.

298
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,470
Our path

299
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,710
will cross again.

300
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,270
Jelly?

301
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,590
You still want to buy me snacks?

302
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,070
Okay.

303
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,380
You bastard.

304
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,350
What are you talking about?

305
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,550
What did you say?

306
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,550
All the people coming here are weirdos.

307
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,790
Guests on the first floor of this building

308
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,310
are individual guests and tourists.

309
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,270
Mr. Jiao's people

310
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,910
booked the whole second floor

311
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,110
and are staying there now.

312
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,430
The third floor...

313
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,070
I'll do it myself.

314
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,590
It's okay.

315
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:46,950
Hold it for me for a while.

316
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,230
Don't interrupt his train of thoughts.

317
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:48,950
Come on. Your turn to hold it.

318
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,870
You see? Come on!

319
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:52,790
Hey.

320
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,060
Lift it a bit higher.

321
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:55,820
The third floor...

322
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,710
The third floor used to be booked by Uncle Erbai's team.

323
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,790
We can tell from what the reception girl said that

324
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,030
they have been missing for a while.

325
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,470
There's a rumor that the third floor is haunted.

326
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,590
Can it be a camouflage

327
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,910
deliberately arranged by your uncle?

328
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,260
After all, Mr. Jiao's team has tracked them down.

329
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,950
It may also be the people on the second floor because

330
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,220
they didn't want others to go up to the third floor

331
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,230
so they made up a ghost story.

332
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,150
Kezi.

333
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,310
No one is on the third floor.

334
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,580
But there is a strange sound.

335
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,630
I can't tell what it is.

336
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,150
I don't think everything they said is a lie.

337
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,030
Because there are also some people on the second floor talking about that rumor.

338
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,070
That sniper

339
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,750
already knew we are here.

340
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,950
But he hinted to me through Fatty that

341
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,630
he won't tell

342
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,590
Mr. Jiao that we are already here.

343
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,870
This person must have his own purpose.

344
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,670
Everyone must be careful.

345
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,470
You should sit down.

346
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,620
Sorry.

347
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,510
Careful how?

348
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,150
Li Jiale.

349
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,030
Kezi.

350
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,150
And Bai.

351
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,670
You guys are new faces and they don't know you.

352
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,030
So don't expose your identity.

353
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,870
We must have someone to hide in the dark

354
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,710
to play this game well.

355
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,430
The mark that Kylin left me

356
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,630
refers to room 315.

357
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,950
So we must find that room as soon as possible to

358
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,350
see what Kylin left for us in there.

359
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,750
Starting today,

360
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,150
you have to take this medicine every day.

361
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,830
You can only move for two hours after taking it.

362
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,950
For the rest of your day,

363
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,510
you must stay in this room.

364
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,110
Why didn't you take it out sooner?

365
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,190
Let me tell you,

366
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,070
if you are stingy and only take one thing out at a time

367
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,270
like that cartoon character Doraemon,

368
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,630
I'll teach you a lesson.

369
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,350
Only this room has

370
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,990
stable temperature and humidity.

371
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,950
You can imagine your lungs

372
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,870
as a piece of fragile glass.

373
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:48,830
Try not to move

374
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,430
unless you really have to.

375
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,070
Then I am as good as paralyzed.

376
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,430
You know your own body better than anyone.

377
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,230
I don't mind watching you die.

378
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,790
If you don't listen to my advice,

379
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,390
I'll collect your body for you.

380
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,110
I can't just listen to...

381
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,230
Just listen to me.

382
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,190
Let's go.

383
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,670
Your coughing will make sounds and give us away.

384
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,180
Okay.

385
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,430
Wait a minute.

386
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,110
In this case, safety is your priority.

387
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,630
When I ask you guys to come back,

388
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,750
you must return immediately.

389
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,910
As long as it's not a real coughing, but a signal,

390
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,630
sure, no problem.

391
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,430
Bye.

392
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,140
You stay here

393
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,630
to take care of him.

394
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:38,870
Let's go.

395
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,790
Fatty, you old bastard.

396
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,230
Naïve.

397
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,430
Can you see it?

398
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,630
Fatty.

399
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,670
I heard you.

400
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:38,950
Hello, can you see me?

401
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,460
Yes. I heard you.

402
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,150
Your big face suddenly appeared and freaked me out.

403
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,990
Stay away from the camera.

404
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,910
Okay, I...

405
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,150
I'll turn back and stay away.

406
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,750
Alright?

407
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,710
Remember.

408
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,660
Our purpose of going up to the third floor

409
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,270
is to find room 315

410
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,030
mentioned in Kylin's mark.

411
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,150
Don't make any extra trouble.

412
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,750
Don't attract the attention of those on the second floor.

413
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:02,910
Did you hear me?

414
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,430
Do it quick.

415
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,990
Let's go.

416
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,790
Wait, wait, wait.

417
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,630
In this dark place, no one can see us.

418
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,070
Our disguise will only

419
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,310
attract attention, right?

420
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,030
Yes.

421
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,430
Let's go.

422
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,710
Naive, did you see that?

423
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,310
This iron gate is locked.

424
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,190
We can't try to get pass it.

425
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,550
There are always people on patrol on the second floor, too.

426
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,190
Make room. Let me take a look.

427
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,270
I'll just lever the wall panel open.

428
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,190
Keep your voice down!

429
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,070
Come on.

430
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,070
Faster!

431
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:51,750
Wait a minute.

432
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,260
This is too fragile.

433
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,590
It's like it was made this way for me to break it open.

434
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,220
Oh, come on!

435
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,670
Wait a minute.

436
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,230
Let's go.

437
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,430
Slow down.

438
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,470
You just stay here to be on the lookout.

439
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,110
Contact us anytime.

440
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,510
Okay.

441
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,510
Let us know if anything happens.

442
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:47,900
Okay.

443
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,950
Flashlight.

444
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,420
Here you go.

445
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,030
If someone shows up, hit them with it.

446
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:53,590
It's okay.

447
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,190
Take it.

448
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:17,870
Flashlight.

449
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,070
Turn it off!

450
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,180
Naive

451
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,910
We are in.

452
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,390
Kezi.

453
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,470
What's the situation out there?

454
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,310
No one is here.

455
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,580
I can't hear anything.

456
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,030
But there is this strange sound.

457
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,110
I'll go take a look.

458
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,710
Hello, Fatty.

459
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,030
Can you hear me? Hello?

460
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:21,750
Hello?

461
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,980
I'm here.

462
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,710
I'll give you update later.

463
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:27,660
Naive.

464
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,990
There's no room 315.

465
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,070
We walked around the whole floor.

466
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,030
Next to room 314 is room 316.

467
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,510
Kylin's secret signal is so well hidden.

468
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,070
Can it be a suite?

469
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,510
So room 315 is inside another room?

470
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,030
I'm going into

471
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,670
room 314 to take a look.

472
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,030
Observe the foot of the door carefully.

473
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,180
A mark left by Kylin.

474
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,230
Naive

475
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,790
Have you ever read Harry Potter?

476
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,070
Platform Nine and Three Quarters.

477
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,270
Enter the world of magic from there.

478
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,110
Fatty, what's wrong with you?

479
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,950
Don't pan the camera.

480
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,150
Give me a picture

481
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,230
to show the mark.

482
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,510
This is a warning of danger.

483
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:40,950
Fatty.

484
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,790
If you can't find room 315,

485
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,030
come down immediately.

486
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,030
Did you hear me?

487
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,710
Okay.

488
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,550
Let's go!

489
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,470
Let's go!

490
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,140
Wait.

491
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:49,870
Mr. Fatty.

492
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,750
We're leaving so soon?

493
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,670
Let's spend some more time here.

494
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,190
Since Naive said we should get out of here, then we should.

495
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,670
I can sense something strange here, too.

496
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,390
Let's go.

497
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,590
Why did you stop?

498
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,230
That buzzing sound

499
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,110
comes from this room.

500
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,430
It makes me very uncomfortable.

501
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,550
Leave it. Let's go.

502
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,230
Hurry up!

503
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,150
Wait.

504
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,990
Something's not right.

505
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,870
Bai, Bai!

506
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,710
Are you still at the head of the stairs?

507
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,270
I'm here.

508
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,590
I'm right by the head of the stairs.

509
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,270
Why can't I find you?

510
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,990
Did we go too fast?

511
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,430
Bai, wait there.

512
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,790
Let's go ahead and look for her.

513
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:43,990
Follow me.

514
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,510
This is weird.

515
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,790
Naive

516
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,230
All the stairs are gone.

517
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,710
It's like we fall into a trap by ghosts.

518
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,630
What ghosts?

519
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,910
I think you have hallucinations.

520
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,030
We can't get out.

521
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,790
Fatty, you guys can climb down.

522
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,830
Climb down?

523
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,590
How?

524
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,030
Don't you have climbing rope in your bag?

525
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,310
Come on.

526
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,500
Rope...

527
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,950
Can it take my weight?

528
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,190
I...

529
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,230
Catch it.

530
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,590
Fatty.

531
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,150
Fatty.

532
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,790
Someone is behind you.

533
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,550
Did you hear it?

534
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,990
Fatty, I got in touch with Uncle Erbai.

535
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,700
They are hiding in the room.

536
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:38,990
Go in and have a look.

537
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,150
It was a trap Uncle Erbai made!

538
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,990
Fatty, don't go in there!

539
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,390
Kezi.

540
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,870
Did you hear me? Don't go in there!

541
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,110
Fatty, hurry. Go in there.

542
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,030
What happened?

543
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,910
They have a problem.

544
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:36,590
Mr. Erbai's token.

545
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,420
People who stayed here were definitely his uncle's team.

546
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,939
But where are they now?

547
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,310
The teapot is already dry.

548
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,350
They should be gone for a week.

549
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,350
Naive

550
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,710
Your uncle is not in the room.

551
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,270
Go.

552
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,230
Go after them.

553
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,190
Is it my people?

554
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,030
Who is it?

555
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,940
Anyone here?

556
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,430
Fatty.

557
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,750
Liu Sang?

558
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,350
You know him?

559
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,310
Was he working for Wu Erbai?

560
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,110
Yes.

561
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,710
Kylin killed him.

562
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,870
What is this mark?

563
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,750
This is the mark indicating the Zhang family's execution.

564
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,030
I don't believe it.

565
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,470
Kylin...

566
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,750
Kylin killed all the people here.

567
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,870
What does it mean?

568
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,830
So was Liu Sang the

569
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,390
spy in Wu Erbai's team?

570
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,670
Bai!

571
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,910
I can't reach Fatty and others now.

572
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,630
I can only see you in the surveillance.

573
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,310
I'll go find them.

574
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,510
Don't move.

575
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,420
The situation on the third floor is unclear.

576
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,300
You just stay there.

577
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,150
I am coming over now.

578
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,870
Wu Xie, you can't move.

579
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,350
I'll go.

580
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,150
Where did you find these good-for-nothing?

581
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,390
This is the first time I played against my Uncle Erbai.

582
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,300
No one can beat him

583
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,350
among our generation.

584
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,390
I am going.

585
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,270
Wu Xie.

586
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,990
Look!

587
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,990
Room 315.

588
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,070
Naïve.

589
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,110
Room 315 just appeared.

590
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,980
What happened just now?

591
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,020
It was Kylin.

592
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,990
Kylin went crazy.

593
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,270
He said we were spies.

594
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,060
After he came up from Spring of Roar,

595
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,750
he said that no one was allowed to go to Thunder City.

596
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,790
He killed everyone.

597
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,870
I'm the only one that survived.

598
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:02,790
If...

599
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,190
If

600
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,550
someone sees this video...

601
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,910
Kylin killed everyone!

602
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,740
Kylin set up a trap to

603
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,590
trap everyone on this floor.

604
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,710
He doesn't want anyone to enter the Spring of Roar.

605
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,190
We are also trapped in this floor, Naive.

606
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,550
Come save us!

607
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,670
Can you hear me?

608
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,870
Naïve.

609
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,340
Can you hear me?

610
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,590
I'm going up there now.

611
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,390
Wu Xie.

612
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,990
You have only two hours.

613
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,510
Bai.

614
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,110
Bai.

615
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:44,750
Kezi.

616
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,340
Fatty.

617
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,470
Don't say anything.

618
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,310
Kezi.

619
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,590
I can't take it anymore!

620
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,150
Kezi.

621
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,780
Don't say anything.

622
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,670
Let me out!

623
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:03,430
-I am going to be deaf!
-Kezi.

624
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,310
Stop talking!

625
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,190
I'm going to be deaf!

626
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,950
Kezi, don't!
