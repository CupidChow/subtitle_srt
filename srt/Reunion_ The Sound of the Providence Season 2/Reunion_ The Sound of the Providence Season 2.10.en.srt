Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,210
Episode 10

4
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,270
Stop talking!

5
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:56,150
I'm going to be deaf.

6
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,910
Kezi, don't!

7
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,710
Mr. Third Junior?

8
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,629
Mr. Third Junior!

9
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,150
Mr. Third Junior!

10
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,910
Go to hell.

11
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,950
Manager Bai?

12
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:27,590
Why are you here?

13
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,870
What's going on?

14
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,870
Everyone, come to room 315.

15
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,750
I'll sit down first.

16
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,990
Are you guys okay?

17
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,430
Can you see me?

18
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,950
That hallucination was so real.

19
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,980
Actually we were trapped in the hallucination

20
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,470
as soon we entered Tianlin Building.

21
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,390
As long as there is wind,

22
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,510
these bronze pieces will keep vibrating.

23
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,550
During the day there are a lot of people up and moving

24
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,830
creating a noisy environment.

25
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,350
So we didn't hear the vibration.

26
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,870
But at night,

27
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,590
these sounds will become obvious

28
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,709
to create hallucination for people who hear it.

29
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,830
Your cunning Uncle Erbai did it.

30
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,630
These bronze pieces

31
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,620
look exactly like the ones

32
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,230
Jia Kezi took out from the smelting workshop earlier.

33
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,630
Uncle Erbai and his team must have worked out how these pieces work.

34
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,190
There is no clue left.

35
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,060
There was a mark

36
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,510
left to us by Kylin.

37
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,030
It means stop.

38
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,950
I think he wanted to remind us that

39
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,670
room 315

40
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,670
was actually a trap.

41
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,710
Based on my understanding of my uncle,

42
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,590
I think this whole floor

43
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,950
is a false target he set up

44
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,750
to attract everyone to investigate on this floor

45
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,350
while actually there was no clue there at all.

46
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:37,990
How about this,

47
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,390
all of you go back to your rooms to rest and refresh.

48
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,310
I'll hang these bronze pieces back.

49
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,790
Let's keep in touch.

50
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:46,270
Let's go.

51
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,190
You...

52
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,790
Sorry about earlier.

53
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,030
Let's go.

54
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:10,870
Go.

55
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,709
Who are you?

56
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,190
Someone who wants to kill you.

57
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,230
What?

58
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,910
I want to take a bath.

59
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,990
You...Just go ahead then.

60
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,459
You just take your clothes off without a heads-up?

61
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,310
Let's go.

62
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,470
Hurry up.

63
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,390
Ning?

64
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,350
What is your relationship with Ning?

65
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,710
Don't say my sister's name!

66
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,030
You don't deserve it.

67
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,630
You are Ning's brother.

68
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,150
You should have paid her with your life a long time ago.

69
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,910
Sis, I miss you so much.

70
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,630
Sis.

71
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,110
I'm so tired.

72
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,670
But I will avenge you.

73
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,430
So that's why you

74
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,230
approached me in the first place.

75
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,750
Sanye.

76
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,430
I really like you.

77
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,500
But you lied to me.

78
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,270
I hate

79
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,270
men who lie to me

80
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,390
most.

81
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,590
Where did you go?

82
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,750
I waited for you to come back all night.

83
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,430
I went to the third floor.

84
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,750
You dare go to the third floor?

85
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,940
Don't people say it's haunted?

86
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:41,910
What happened then?

87
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,630
What did you see?

88
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,390
Nothing.

89
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,990
Jiao couldn't find you

90
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,350
and he was furious.

91
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,900
They have set off already.

92
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,470
You'd better hurry to catch up with them.

93
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,430
Sir.

94
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,670
Some villagers

95
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,780
heard a big noise in this place yesterday.

96
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,710
I heard that a group of people came by.

97
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,830
The entrance had collapsed earlier.

98
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,470
Our people

99
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,830
spent a whole day

100
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,190
to clear the way to show the entrance again.

101
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,710
Sir.

102
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,590
We need to deal with some poisonous bombs inside.

103
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,950
You might want to leave for safety.

104
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,670
I want to witness it with my own eyes.

105
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,190
The gas bombs have been removed.

106
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,340
Take all of them back.

107
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,430
Yes, sir.

108
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,710
They seem to take all the bronze pieces in the smelting workshop

109
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,030
back to the building with them.

110
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,550
Is Mr. Jiao

111
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,140
also looking for your uncle?

112
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,430
I suspect that the spy in his team has been keeping an eye on us.

113
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,390
He already knew that we're here.

114
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,510
What do you mean?

115
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,470
What do you think this spy wants to do then?

116
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,110
I have no idea right now.

117
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,060
He lured us into the chamber with mustard gas but didn't kill us.

118
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,190
Normally the next step for him is to

119
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,150
tell Mr. Jiao that we are here.

120
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,630
So why didn't he tip him off?

121
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,790
What move is he going to make next?

122
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,030
Thank you, sir.

123
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,790
Thank you.

124
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,270
It's going to rain again.

125
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,470
Why are these bronze pieces everywhere?

126
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,190
Did Jiao take them back

127
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,510
trying to listen to thunder, too?

128
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,350
Is that your phone?

129
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,630
Let me see.

130
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,870
No.

131
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,910
What's vibrating then?

132
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,910
The bronze pieces!

133
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,340
Hurry up and cover your ears!

134
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,630
Get out.

135
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,670
Let's go!

136
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,100
Move faster!

137
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,470
Wu Xie

138
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,270
Why does it become louder?

139
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,590
Just go out first.

140
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,860
Where's Bai?

141
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,270
Where's Bai Haotian?

142
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:23,990
Here.

143
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,340
There...

144
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:24,889
Oh no.

145
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,310
Come here.

146
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,190
The door has been locked by Jiao's people.

147
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,790
What?

148
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,310
The door is locked.

149
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,590
Fatty.

150
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,030
Let me.

151
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,710
Come on!

152
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,270
Come on.

153
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,830
Pull hard with me.

154
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,030
One, two, pull!

155
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,350
One, two!

156
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,430
It's moving!

157
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,710
One, two, pull!

158
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,390
Pull harder!

159
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,390
Let's go.

160
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,070
Hurry up!

161
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,150
Hurry up, move!

162
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,630
Come on!

163
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,670
Come on!

164
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,830
Come on, Haotian!

165
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,350
Come on!

166
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,150
Just go!

167
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,820
Faster!

168
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,910
Keep up.

169
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,630
Keep up. Move, move!

170
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,110
Go quickly.

171
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:20,830
Come on!

172
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,550
Come on!

173
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,950
What is the sound?

174
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,470
Thunder.

175
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,070
Thunder?

176
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,230
This voice comes

177
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,710
from this big device.

178
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,710
This seems to be a thunder receiver.

179
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,990
A thunder receiver?

180
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,110
For the people underground to listen.

181
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:45,990
Mr. Jiao.

182
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,430
It looks like this is also the first time

183
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,230
the hotel has met such a phenomenon.

184
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,670
I asked several people

185
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,150
but no one knows why it happened.

186
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,870
Jiao.

187
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,990
My whole body is soaking wet. I'm freezing.

188
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,220
When can we leave?

189
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,970
Find someone smarter to explain to me

190
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,460
what happened.

191
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,630
At that time we were studying the bronze pieces.

192
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,880
The vibration started from the bronze pieces and

193
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,990
soon spread to the entire Tianlin Building.

194
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,090
So this sound

195
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,630
must have something to do with the bronze pieces.

196
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,170
But as for the specific reason,

197
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,330
it may take some more time to confirm.

198
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,350
No need to confirm anymore.

199
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,620
Soak all the bronze pieces in oil.

200
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,880
The entrance is in this building.

201
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,740
This is clever.

202
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,250
Get everyone out from the building.

203
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,050
Yes, sir.

204
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,290
We don't know when the rain will stop.

205
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,040
Don't catch a cold.

206
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,540
Thank you.

207
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,270
Don't worry.

208
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,940
The thunder has stopped.

209
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,520
Most people went back too.

210
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,210
I guess the strange sound in the building is gone.

211
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,190
We should go back in a while too.

212
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm not worried about the weird sound.

213
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,810
Mr. Third Junior has been out for so long and hasn't come back yet.

214
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,170
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

215
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,070
He's back.

216
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,680
Wu Xie.

217
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,560
Are you okay, Mr. Third Junior?

218
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,350
Are you alright?

219
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,150
How are you feeling?

220
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,650
Where have you been?

221
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,440
Let's go back to the hotel first.

222
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,410
Where's Mr. Jiao?

223
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,910
They have gone inside.

224
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,010
Where's Fatty then?

225
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,130
He went out to find you.

226
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,500
Jia Kezi.

227
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,680
I need you to do something for me.

228
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,390
Sure.

229
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,160
When it thundered,

230
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,640
I seemed to hear some sound coming from underground in Tianlin Building.

231
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,530
But I'm not sure what it is.

232
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,850
Can you listen to it?

233
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,200
Are you alright?

234
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,690
There is sound of water

235
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,890
coming from deep underground

236
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,080
with echoes.

237
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,920
There should be a

238
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,250
big cavity deep underground.

239
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,820
I see.

240
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,840
If you still don't do as I told you next time,

241
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,170
I won't treat you anymore.

242
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,760
Don't be like this.

243
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,960
What should I do if you won't give me treatment?

244
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,140
But you are so stingy making that medicine.

245
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,650
You said two hours and it was effective for two hours sharp.

246
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,280
You can't give me an extra minute?

247
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,950
If you came back a few minutes late,

248
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,320
you might die.

249
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,260
So stop your "never say uncle" attitude.

250
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,200
What's the use of you?

251
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,190
-You're welcome to treat him then.
  -Why did we even bother to bring you?

252
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:10,890
Who is the doctor here?

253
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,120
-You treat him.
 -Which one of us is the doctor?

254
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,220
-Go ahead.
 -Your patient is suffering.

255
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,240
You just stand there doing nothing

256
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,720
but whining.

257
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,560
What gives you the right to whine?

258
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,360
It's your duty, you know?

259
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,720
And you, too!

260
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,430
You...

261
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,590
It's also my fault.

262
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,640
Naive

263
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,990
Don't let us worry about you like this again, okay?

264
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,970
If you do this again,

265
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,380
I'm telling you, I'll give you a lecture.

266
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,390
You churros guy.

267
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:31,930
This is the last time.

268
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,290
The last time I did this.

269
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,130
Okay?

270
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,200
So,

271
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,200
did you have any new discoveries?

272
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:45,840
Where is my phone?

273
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,540
Here.

274
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,560
You went out to take pictures?

275
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,760
It's Tianlin Building.

276
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,280
Turn the picture upside down.

277
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,630
It looks a bit familiar.

278
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,730
The bell in Yang Daguang's treasure cave!

279
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,060
It was also used to listen to thunder.

280
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,080
I guess Tianlin Building, South Sea King's Tomb,

281
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,230
that weather station,

282
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,770
and Warehouse 11

283
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,180
all have the same topographic structure.

284
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,550
This is also

285
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,240
a site built by South Sea King to listen to thunder.

286
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,580
So this building is the key.

287
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,740
That's why this sound is...

288
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,820
The big bell above Yang's treasure cave

289
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,850
was used to receive thunder

290
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,490
and then conducted it to the cavity under the coffin

291
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,200
where the thunder was translated

292
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,660
when it resonated with the bronze pieces.

293
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,860
Now this Tianlin Building

294
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,660
is equivalent to that big bell

295
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,070
used to receive thunder

296
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,570
which will be conducted into somewhere underground.

297
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,280
Because Kezi could hear that

298
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,260
there is a lot of space

299
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,370
under the ground.

300
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,730
It meant  the entrance of Spring of Roar is

301
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,870
not in the woods at all.

302
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,110
It's right in this building.

303
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,380
So this Tianlin Building is a thunder-listening device

304
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,220
and the entrance to Thunder City.

305
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,540
I didn't expect that we were so close to Thunder City.

306
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,650
The key now

307
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,070
is the specific location of the entrance.

308
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,960
But we have

309
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,770
searched each inch of the first floor of Tianlin Building.

310
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,660
We didn't find

311
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,600
any space that can house an entrance.

312
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,450
I have been thinking about this question for a long time.

313
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,310
Uncle Erbai came here,

314
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,630
and then they disappeared out of thin air

315
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,830
without any trace left.

316
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,160
Their last video call with us was in Spring of Roar,

317
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,630
which is the only way to enter Thunder City.

318
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,120
So if the entrance really exists

319
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,960
in Tianlin Building like we guess,

320
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,210
then why can't we

321
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,700
find any

322
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,070
clue about the entrance so far?

323
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,040
After everyone entered the roar spring,

324
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,650
your uncle hid the passage?

325
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:53,930
Yes.

326
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,730
Kezi.

327
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,620
Are your ears okay?

328
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,820
I'm fine.

329
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,450
My eardrums are slightly broken.  That' all.

330
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,350
You'll turn deaf if you use your ear again when

331
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,310
the eardrums are already broken.

332
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,130
Being deaf may not be a bad thing for me.

333
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,340
But it's a bad thing for us.

334
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,470
Why do you sound so negative?

335
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,420
If you want to find the specific location of the entrance,

336
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,150
you'll need to let me enter every room.

337
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,050
I can hear

338
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,200
everyone's voice in Tianlin Building.

339
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,400
But I can't precisely pinpoint

340
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,890
the location.

341
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,960
I am not Liu Sang.

342
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,350
I have heard about Liu Sang's ability.

343
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,260
He not only can hear sounds far away

344
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,680
but also form the obstacles' structure

345
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,870
according to the frequency and band of the sound.

346
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,980
I can't be as accurate as him.

347
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,880
This is a big trouble.

348
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,690
That's the only way for us.

349
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,080
We can only check all the rooms one by one.

350
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,810
If I am right,

351
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,930
that spy

352
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,230
ran out of Spring of Roar in the chaos and

353
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,600
mixed in the crowd.

354
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,800
No matter what his purpose is,

355
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,430
right now

356
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,160
his plan must have already started.

357
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,120
Mr. Third Junior.

358
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,110
Mr. Jiao's people have started

359
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,340
to drive other guests to leave the hotel.

360
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,750
They give them a very high compensation.

361
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,380
Some people will move out tomorrow.

362
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,890
And now they're investigating rooms one by one.

363
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,530
I guess they also want to find the location of the entrance.

364
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,850
What should we do?

365
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,280
Open the door!

366
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,050
Change rooms at a high price!

367
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,290
Our boss Mr. Jiao has booked the whole building.

368
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,400
Everyone will get a subsidy if they're willing to leave.

369
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,040
Open the door!

370
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,300
Open the door!

371
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,120
What is it?

372
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,610
There seems to be no one inside.

373
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,160
May be an empty room.

374
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,460
Take the room numbers down and check them again later.

375
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,780
Okay.

376
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,470
Are you alright?

377
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,310
-I am okay.
 -Have some water.

378
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,280
I'm okay.

379
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,600
I almost suffocated holding the cough back.

380
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,650
No.

381
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,990
We can't wait any longer.

382
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,970
If you wait till tomorrow

383
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,830
when all the guests have moved out,

384
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,200
we won't be able to move in the building freely.

385
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,410
So we must find the entrance to

386
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,490
Spring of Roar tonight.

387
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,420
We can do that on the first floor.

388
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,660
What about the second floor?

389
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,020
I have a way...

390
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,490
In a few hours..

391
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,630
What are you nagging?

392
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,350
Everyone has their own duties.

393
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,800
Stay alert.

394
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,220
Except for our own rooms,

395
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,380
all outsiders' rooms have been emptied.

396
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,420
But there are still eight rooms that no one came to answer the door.

397
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,690
Keep knocking.

398
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,410
Force open the door if you have to.

399
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,340
Make sure to clear the building.

400
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,660
and get everyone out.

401
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,540
Got it?

402
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:03,900
Okay.

403
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,600
Your dishes will be ready soon.

404
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,210
Just take a seat first.

405
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,580
We came from the same province, right?

406
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,250
It's you again.

407
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:02,930
Buddy.

408
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,730
Which room do you stay?

409
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,840
You are my heart,

410
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,510
you are my liver.

411
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:14,850
Are you staying in 213?

412
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,110
It's 231.

413
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:19,780
Hey.

414
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,810
You really look familiar.

415
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,910
What's your name?

416
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,870
You still can't recognize me?

417
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,930
I can't.

418
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,600
Come on!

419
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,850
Have I seen you?

420
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,450
To think I even felt bad when you "died"!

421
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,950
Enough! You are that...

422
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,740
You shouldn't have had wine

423
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,410
since you have such a poor tolerance.

424
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,910
One shot and he's drunk.

425
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,140
Come on.

426
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,630
Alright.

427
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,560
I'll take you back to your room.

428
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,180
This bastard fakes his death to lie to us.

429
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,280
I want to scare him.

430
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,460
Help!

431
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,340
Help!

432
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:56,710
Keep calling for help.

433
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,290
I won't.

434
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,050
You guys really tracked us down?

435
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,070
Fatty.

436
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,040
Sorry.

437
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,490
I know I lied to you.

438
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,420
I am so sorry.

439
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,830
Come on.

440
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,150
It's not realistic

441
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,250
for so many of you to stay in my room.

442
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,540
Since you were so good at playing dead,

443
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,400
now play unwell

444
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,720
and very hungry.

445
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,700
Ask them to send you food

446
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,800
to this room.

447
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,500
Order something nice.

448
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,210
Did you hear me?

449
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,200
How about

450
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,650
I tell Mr. Jiao about you guys?

451
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,720
He paid a big price to get me work for him.

452
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,090
He's generous as an employer.

453
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,850
Anyway, we all want the same thing.

454
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,030
We can cooperate.

455
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,570
Cooperate your ass.

456
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,200
Do you want to play

457
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,520
bungee jumping at Tianlin Building?

458
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,140
No!

459
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,000
If you dare tell Mr. Jiao about us,

460
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,280
I will tie you with a tiny rope

461
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,730
and throw you out of this window.

462
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,490
We'll just flip a coin to decide whether we should cut the rope.

463
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,080
No, I was just discussing with you.

464
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,440
Don't!

465
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,610
I'll cut your balls off if you do anything stupid.

466
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:54,850
Fatty.

467
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,010
Mr. Third Junior.

468
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,170
The fireworks show has started.

469
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,220
This one is pretty.

470
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,360
This one, look!

471
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,650
Hurry up. Take a picture.

472
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:22,320
Go.

473
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,010
Take all these wines.

474
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:39,840
Look at that!

475
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:41,160
Look.

476
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:41,689
Look.

477
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,010
Nice.

478
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,160
Everyone, fireworks look the best with good wine.

479
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,440
Mr. Jiao

480
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,330
specially asked me to send you some good wine.

481
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,700
Your boss is really hospitable.

482
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:07,980
He surprises me.

483
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,010
Thank Mr. Jiao for me.

484
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,460
Say thank you for me to Mr. Jiao.

485
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,350
Then I will leave you alone.

486
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,000
Room 223 and 224 are not the target.

487
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,710
Who is it?

488
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,310
Our boss wants to give you some wine as gift.

489
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,300
-Bring it.
-Here's some wine for you from Mr. Jiao.

490
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,480
Two bottles of aged good wine.

491
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,280
Thanks.

492
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:39,940
Anytime.

493
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,680
Mr. Third Junior.

494
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,400
The firework show is over.

495
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,460
Bai, hurry up and set off more.

496
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,830
Be safe.

497
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,050
Our boss asked me to bring some wine to you.

498
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,770
How did it go?

499
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,900
The echo disappeared in this direction.

500
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,790
And the most likely location with a hidden space

501
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,290
is this room.

502
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,390
Room 208?

503
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,360
Yes.

504
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,710
Room 208.

505
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,170
That is Jiang Zisuan's room.

506
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,120
Hong.

507
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,810
Jiang Zisuan...

508
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,670
I have knocked three rooms open.

509
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,120
There are five rooms that no one answered.

510
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,270
I expect that

511
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,370
we can evacuate

512
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,000
everyone in another two hours.

513
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,070
We have to check our own rooms, too.

514
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,270
Why do you still hide cigarettes?

515
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,570
You're being irresponsible to your body!

516
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,250
I am not going to smoke.

517
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,180
This is for Hong.

518
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:51,770
You're kidding, right?

519
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,750
What should I do then?

520
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,240
Do I have any other option?

521
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,080
You...

522
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,170
This is bad.

523
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:01,980
Torturing in a good old fashion way.

524
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,430
One shot, and you'll beg us to let you talk.

525
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,400
But the cow never woke up last time in your experiment.

526
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,340
How can you compare Hong with a cow?

527
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,620
Stop joking.

528
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,310
Wish you all the best of luck.

529
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:16,900
Needle.

530
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,120
Don't worry.

531
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,930
I'll add some "spice" for you.

532
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,030
You still need more "spice"?

533
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,050
I think it's

534
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,600
not strong enough.

535
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,760
This is not an ordinary "spice".

536
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,740
Huo Daofu.

537
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,030
You are a doctor! How can you...

538
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,400
You guys gave Hong too much credit.

539
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,010
Naïve.

540
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,720
Have you really thought it through?

541
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:50,920
Fatty

542
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,120
Some people always have to make sacrifice

543
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,770
for the bigger picture.

544
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,240
I don't want to do this to him either.

545
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,460
Hong.

546
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,750
Let's go through the normal procedure

547
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,810
by doing some disinfection.

548
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:11,830
Don't move.

549
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,240
What if I inject it to some place that I shouldn't?

550
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,440
If you as do I say,

551
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,470
I'll give you the antidote in twenty minutes.

552
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,090
If you don't,

553
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,340
you will die.

554
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,260
Don't...

555
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,540
Don't...

556
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,800
By the way,

557
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,040
if your whole body trembles later,

558
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,410
that's a normal reaction of being poisoned.

559
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,730
Don't be nervous about it.

560
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,480
Here we go.

561
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,020
How do you feel, Hong?

562
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,160
Feel the poison kicking in?

563
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,950
Let's talk.

564
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:07,950
Are you eating?

565
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,610
Go away.

566
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,760
Here's the thing.

567
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,530
Wu Xie is in my room.

568
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,700
Jiao asked you to test me, right?

569
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:20,720
No.

570
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,700
It was really Wu Xie who asked me to come to you.

571
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,870
What do you want?

572
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,340
Don't you always want to kill me?

573
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,890
I have to leave

574
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,300
with you guys' evacuation method.

575
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,370
After I leave this place,

576
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,610
you might not have a chance to kill me personally.

577
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,520
So you want me to help you stay here.

578
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,010
I want to talk to you.

579
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:56,810
About what?

580
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,440
About your sister.

581
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,460
There are some things back then

582
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,060
that I want to share with you.

583
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,730
Don't you dare think of her!

584
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,910
He is in your room, right?

585
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:15,610
He's coming up.

586
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,410
Antidote! When will you give it to me?

587
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,110
Hot.

588
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,040
It's so spicy.

589
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,500
I give up!

590
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,420
I admit defeat.

591
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,700
Wu Xie.

592
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,810
You are too naive.
