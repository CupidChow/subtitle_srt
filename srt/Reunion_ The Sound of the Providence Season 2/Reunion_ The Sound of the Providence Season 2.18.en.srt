00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,320
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,650
Episode 18

4
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,059
Glasses.

5
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,740
You have to bring out

6
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,339
all your medical skills for me.

7
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:10,220
Don't try to be offhand with me.

8
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,100
Wait.

9
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:14,779
My life is in your hands now

10
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,780
Can you really handle it?

11
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,490
I have a good girl friend

12
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,490
and I've learned a lot from her.

13
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,260
Wait a minute.

14
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,860
We go way back, right?

15
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,220
Be gentle with me.

16
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,180
Be gentle!

17
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,700
Let me consider it.

18
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,020
What luck!

19
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,860
Why would I get hurt?

20
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,020
Done.

21
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,060
So fast?

22
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,820
You got strong teeth.

23
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,460
Are you hungry or are you going to give birth?

24
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,060
You're so lucky!

25
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,460
But I guess

26
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,940
you are usually quite unlucky.

27
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,300
That's why you got lucky just once.

28
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,660
Do you want it or not?

29
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,700
A silver lining!

30
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,100
We have something delicious for dinner.

31
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,740
Come on.

32
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,740
Come on.

33
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,860
Jia Kezi and Li Jiale

34
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,660
were right in front of me.

35
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,220
But I could only watch

36
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,820
two innocent people get hurt.

37
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,740
There was nothing I could do.

38
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,100
Later we also ran into Jia Kezi.

39
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,780
Kezi tried to send us a message.

40
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,780
But he was eroded by the neurotoxin

41
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,660
and lost his marbles.

42
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,860
We settled him at a place outside.

43
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,900
When we go back,

44
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,340
I will definitely take him home with us.

45
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,340
They came here following me.

46
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,420
I didn't expect they would end up like this.

47
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,980
When other men

48
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,300
say that he and a woman

49
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,459
are not from the same world,

50
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,700
it may just be his excuse.

51
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,140
But when I say that, I am just telling the truth.

52
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,820
I entrusted Chuchu to Hua

53
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,660
because he's so resourceful.

54
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,380
Chuchu

55
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,420
shouldn't have ended up like that.

56
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,900
Let me introduce her.

57
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,820
But Mr. Jiao...

58
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,820
I'll leave her to you.

59
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,740
The Wang family's people are working for him.

60
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,100
Even Hua may not be able to handle them.

61
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,500
I was negligent.

62
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,340
If something went wrong with Chuchu,

63
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,060
that means Hua may also be in danger.

64
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,580
Hello.

65
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,940
It was the best you could do to

66
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,860
entrust Chuchu to Hua.

67
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,380
Don't blame yourself.

68
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,860
Mr. Jiao never mentioned Hua.

69
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,420
I guess he should be safe for the time being.

70
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,260
Chuchu was persistent.

71
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,459
I thought I could accept the fact that she would live with a broken heart forever.

72
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,860
But I didn't expect that in the end

73
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,220
my decision would

74
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,740
cost her life.

75
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,460
I'm all responsible for this.

76
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,220
I heard that Thunder City can reverse all regrets.

77
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,620
Do you believe it?

78
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,620
Legend goes that the artifact of South Sea King,

79
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,420
once driven by thunder,

80
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,220
can fulfill all your wishes.

81
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,540
Since it can fulfill all wishes,

82
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,340
naturally it can reverse all the past regrets.

83
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,980
Since we have come to this point,

84
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,940
I believe it.

85
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,620
As long as we keep going,

86
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,980
I believe we will all reverse the regrets in our hearts.

87
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,940
Come on. Cheers.

88
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,459
Cheers.

89
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,860
I finally saw

90
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,540
what Thunder City looks like with you guys.

91
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,820
We've been fighting monsters and upgrading to the next level.

92
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,820
Come on.

93
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,540
Cheers.

94
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,420
The good men will be rewarded.

95
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,260
Come on.

96
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,780
What is this?

97
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,060
Look. It's over there.

98
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,460
What?

99
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,580
Look.

100
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,620
What is this?

101
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,700
Did you see it?

102
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,460
I can't see anything.

103
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,380
There!

104
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,820
Fatty Wang!

105
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,940
Sober up and

106
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,740
have fun!

107
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,300
Don't think you have puppy eyes

108
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,980
and you can be naughty.

109
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,940
Let me teach you a lesson

110
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,459
and you should feel privileged.

111
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,100
Don't think you are a fan of my Kylin

112
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,580
and I'll show you mercy.

113
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,820
Fatty Wang, just you wait!

114
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,300
Have some water and have some fun.

115
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,500
Naive!

116
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,020
Sang.

117
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,940
Well done!

118
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,260
Where did these bodies come from?

119
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,380
Judging by their appearance,

120
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,260
they haven't been soaked in water all the time.

121
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,100
Liu Sang.

122
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,620
Look under the water.

123
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,780
Is there a tunnel?

124
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,180
Be careful.

125
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,300
Are you alright?

126
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,540
What did you see?

127
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,220
I saw that

128
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,700
there are many bodies

129
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,300
under the water.

130
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,140
There is a cave over there

131
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,940
which looks deep.

132
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,820
I guess it leads to another space.

133
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,020
I'll take a look with you.

134
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:47,940
Over here.

135
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,980
What the hell is this place?

136
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,220
Why are there so many bodies?

137
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,740
They are various in degree of corruption.

138
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,380
They didn't die at the same time.

139
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,060
My guess is

140
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,260
this is the entrance to the core area of Thunder City.

141
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,420
These bodies

142
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,540
came here making a pilgrimage to Thunder City at different times.

143
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,140
They came here

144
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,580
with their regrets and desires.

145
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,060
But they didn't expect they would die here.

146
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,020
So that's how Thunder City reverses all regrets.

147
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,700
Since you die,

148
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,020
of course all your regrets die with you.

149
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,740
Am I right?

150
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,780
Bro.

151
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,980
Where is the entrance?

152
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,620
They wouldn't have died

153
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,020
if the entrance is obvious.

154
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,300
Everyone, be cautious.

155
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,340
Fatty.

156
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,900
Aren't we looking for the entrance?

157
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,140
Why do you keep rummaging through the bodies?

158
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,460
I want to see if they carried any valuable items with them.

159
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,260
Don't you think it's quite a high risk to reverse one's regrets?

160
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,540
I need to

161
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,980
see if I can find any antiques.

162
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,180
I'll put them in my pocket if I find any.

163
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,980
Maybe

164
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,780
we will decide to go back the next second.

165
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,500
Then I'll get nothing from this adventure.

166
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,020
That'll be really a regret.

167
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,300
As the saying goes, a thief will never return empty-handed.

168
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,540
I guess these dead people's regret

169
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,660
was that they were all poor when alive.

170
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,700
I did find a treasure.

171
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,460
What is it?

172
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,340
Come on!

173
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,820
Come here!

174
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,340
Bai.

175
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,940
Wu Sanxing?

176
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,300
Mr. Jiao.

177
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,900
We are running out of food.

178
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,460
If we can't find the way to Thunder City,

179
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,580
we will run out of supplies soon.

180
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,380
We'll follow the direction of thunder to find it.

181
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,460
Wherever the thunder goes,

182
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,020
it's where we are going.

183
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,780
Understood.

184
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,100
I spent a few days in the Dumb Village.

185
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,540
It's full moon again tonight.

186
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,340
I don't know why, but it reminds me of the moon I saw in Wuzhou.

187
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,140
Maybe I got homesick.

188
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,220
I didn't expect one day I would

189
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,580
miss home alone in a place far away from home.

190
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,460
The wind is chilling.

191
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,420
I'm going back to sleep.

192
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,100
I dreamt of the whole family last night.

193
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,340
Mom scolded me again in front of everyone.

194
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,300
But I wasn't very upset this time.

195
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,660
I could sense that although she was scolding me,

196
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,460
actually she was just worried about me.

197
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,700
So I didn't say anything.

198
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,900
When I woke up in the morning, it rained again in the Dumb Village.

199
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,180
I even thought of what Mom told me in my dream and

200
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,420
took an umbrella when I went out.

201
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,700
I even obeyed Mom's request in the dream.

202
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,940
Maybe I'm really getting old.

203
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,460
I can't remember

204
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,980
how many years have passed since I was forced to look for Thunder City.

205
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,620
Yang Daguang died of illness.

206
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,060
Mu Xuehai went crazy.

207
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,020
I am the only one left.

208
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,180
I spent the prime of my youth

209
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,340
in such an absurd thing.

210
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,020
This fake weather observation team

211
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,900
has run out of patience, too.

212
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,660
In the afternoon I finally persuaded some villagers

213
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,100
to take me down the underground river.

214
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,460
We rested by the river bank.

215
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,140
I was woken up by the moonlight reflection underwater.

216
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,140
I saw hordes of jellyfish which were very beautiful.

217
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,980
I remembered Wenjin used to say that

218
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,020
she loved watching jellyfish swim.

219
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,340
She thought they were very intelligent creatures.

220
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,180
I didn't expect that today

221
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,860
I saw a fair share of jellyfish alone.

222
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,460
When I go back from Thunder City,

223
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,580
I want to take this experience to show off to her.

224
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,460
Today is Xie's birthday.

225
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,780
Before I left, I promised to celebrate his birthday with him.

226
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,340
I definitely can't make it this time.

227
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,460
Maybe I'll never go back.

228
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,340
That kid must be scolding me in his heart now.

229
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,820
But his Uncle Sanxing has lied to him so many times.

230
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,700
He should be used to it.

231
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,620
He will accept it.

232
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,900
His Uncle Sanxing has experienced too many twists and turns in his life.

233
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,380
I only hope Xie

234
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,500
can stay healthy and peaceful all his life.

235
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,500
Don't end up like me.

236
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,580
It's going to rain.

237
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,740
Now I understand what it is saying.

238
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,340
God is telling us to get into the tent.

239
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,100
Hurry up!

240
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,340
Piaopiao, don't go.

241
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,220
Piaopiao.

242
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,540
Xie.

243
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,780
Go to Thunder City.

244
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,460
Stay alive.

245
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,700
Go away!

246
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:03,900
Come on.

247
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,860
Go away!

248
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,540
Come to me.

249
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,300
Go away!

250
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,540
Go away!

251
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,300
Liu Sang.

252
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,180
Liu Sang.

253
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,700
Mr. Third Junior.

254
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,940
Liu Sang is acting strangely.

255
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,380
He went out by himself.

256
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,140
I called him but he didn't respond.

257
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,140
No response?

258
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,580
Go.

259
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,740
Let's follow him.

260
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,020
Why did he come to the cliff?

261
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,380
Liu Sang!

262
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,100
Mr. Third Junior!

263
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,500
Wu Xie, help me!

264
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,740
Help me.

265
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,700
Liu Sang!

266
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,460
Give me your hand!

267
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,820
Set your feet on the rock.

268
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,340
Where am I?

269
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,500
You just came here like you were sleepwalking.

270
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,900
Don't you remember?

271
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,500
Mr. Fatty is also sleepwalking, too!

272
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,540
Fatty, Fatty!

273
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,740
Mr. Fatty!

274
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,300
Don't move!

275
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:41,900
It's me.

276
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:42,820
Fatty.

277
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,100
Naive?

278
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,660
Bai?

279
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,980
You were acting like this a moment ago.

280
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,020
Fatty.

281
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,700
Do you remember what you did just now?

282
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,340
What did I do?

283
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,380
Bai.

284
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,980
Take Liu Sang back to the tent.

285
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,740
Okay.

286
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:02,900
Go.

287
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,460
Let's go back to the camp first.

288
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,340
We camped by the hot spring.

289
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,980
One after another, people of the fake weather observation team showed

290
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,580
symptoms of sleepwalking.

291
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,500
They would repeat a group of weird movements

292
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,140
of worshipping during sleepwalking.

293
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,860
I looked into some files and

294
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
found that this was a high-level worship etiquette

295
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
in some kind of thunder god worship ceremony.

296
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,460
But why would they

297
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,180
do this kind of worship movements in their dreams?

298
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,300
Come here.

299
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,540
Look.

300
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,700
This line

301
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,460
is the dividing line of geomagnetism.

302
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,060
Usually

303
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,740
the value of geomagnetism is unstable

304
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,700
and it will change

305
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,540
by the cycle of solar activity and as time goes.

306
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,220
This change is irreversible.

307
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,620
But according to my observation,

308
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,140
during the past few decades,

309
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,380
strength of magnetic field will be restored to

310
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,500
its initial state

311
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,460
at this season every year

312
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,420
in this area.

313
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,580
My guess is that

314
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,700
the mountains in this area

315
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,700
contain some special metal substance

316
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,820
and it's quite rich,

317
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,300
which will be activated

318
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,140
during some certain solar cycle

319
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,980
and maintain a stable state of the magnetic field.

320
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,980
The geologist in the observation team speculated that

321
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,940
this may be a projecting phenomenon

322
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,100
caused by geomagnetism.

323
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,260
He said a bunch of scientific principles

324
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,380
which I didn't quite understand.

325
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,300
In layman's terms,

326
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,140
this group of people were

327
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,660
affected by the geomagnetism in this place.

328
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,100
So they were repeating the action of the last group of people

329
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,860
who came here.

330
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,460
So their actions

331
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
were just the projection of movements made by

332
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,220
the last group of people here.

333
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,180
In other words,

334
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,900
the last group of people did some

335
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,540
thunder god worship ceremony here.

336
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,660
Is this kind of worshipping

337
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,460
related to the access to the core of Thunder City?

338
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,100
This place is weird.

339
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,460
Each of us might

340
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,620
sleepwalk when we are here.

341
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,340
We need to watch each other's back.

342
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,940
It doesn't look like she's going to the toilet.

343
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,940
Don't wake them up yet.

344
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,420
What did you find?

345
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,500
Tell me.

346
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,900
Actually the cliff

347
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,620
just stands in the way.

348
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,780
The place they are really going is the place with those bodies we saw.

349
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,820
Uncle Sanxing's guess was that

350
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,500
as long as you worship the statues,

351
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,780
you can reveal the entrance to the city.

352
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,980
But an accident happened.

353
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,380
After the people of the fake weather observation team worshipped the thunder god statues,

354
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,500
they tragically died at the feet of the statues.

355
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,380
He committed suicide because he couldn't bear the pain.

356
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,180
The Dumb Village's villagers told us that

357
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,740
these statues served like a trap.

358
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,900
Only one of them is the entrance.

359
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,100
Worshiping the wrong statues can bring you danger.

360
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,540
No, stop them!

361
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,900
What happened?

362
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,300
Dumbie, you hit me?

363
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,620
I was careless.

364
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,700
These statues

365
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,220
are actually a trap.

366
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,140
The entrance is under only one statue.

367
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,220
To enter, you must worship the right one.

368
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,540
And as long as you worship the wrong ones,

369
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,500
you'll be killed right away.

370
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,100
This sounds too mysterious to be true.

371
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:19,780
Bai.

372
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,740
Wake up!

373
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
If it weren't for my quick reaction,

374
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,300
we would have been dead now.

375
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,740
Since this is so important,

376
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,860
there is no record of it in the notes?

377
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,820
Let me look for some information.

378
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,180
This is gambling.

379
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,860
Let me analyze the situation.

380
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,900
There are eight statues but

381
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,340
only six of us.

382
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,700
There aren't enough people to die.

383
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,340
Give me a break.

384
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,180
Found it.

385
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,860
The entrance is under this statue.

386
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,740
But there is another problem.

387
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,980
We must worship three right statues at the same time

388
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,580
to open this mechanism.

389
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,260
Fatty, look.

390
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,500
These are the movements.

391
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,980
Fatty, come here.

392
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,660
Fatty, you worship this one.

393
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,940
Don't make a mistake.

394
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,340
I'm counting on you.

395
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,460
Bai.

396
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,540
You'll worship this one.

397
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,340
Okay.

398
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,140
Fatty.

399
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:52,860
It's opened!

400
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,380
Let's go.

401
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,020
Hurry and go.

402
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,220
Don't move, don't move at all!

403
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,740
You hit the jackpot again.

404
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,140
It should be a kind of trap.

405
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,660
I'll jam it with a dagger.

406
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,700
Be careful.

407
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,780
Lift your foot very slowly.

408
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,460
OK, it should be fine now.

409
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,220
This is made of gold! Priceless!

410
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,220
Fatty, don't touch it yet.

411
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,100
It's gold.

412
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,140
This is a so-called Vajra Gate.

413
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,380
It indicates a trap.

414
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,500
But it's gold!

415
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,060
Should we worship it too?

416
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,340
Find the switch first.

417
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,060
The Vajra's right hand is at the reverse direction.

418
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,140
It is!

419
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,940
Glasses, you have an eye for details.

420
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,180
I'll make it right for you.

421
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,660
How did it go reversed?

422
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,220
I'll give you another twist.

423
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,660
How about now?

424
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,820
I am awesome, right?

425
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,820
Don't go in there! Run!

426
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,300
What?

427
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,660
Go!

428
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,490
There is no way.

429
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,580
Sang, are they coming soon?

430
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,010
In ten seconds.

431
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,220
This wall seems to be hollow.

432
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,340
They're coming!

433
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,140
Coming soon.

434
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:11,780
How did it go?

435
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,260
Done.

436
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:14,780
Okay.

437
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,820
One, two, go!

438
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,980
Go, go. go!

439
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,300
Come in!

440
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,420
Liu Sang, hurry up!

441
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,660
Block the hole!

442
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,380
Block it!

443
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,340
Let's just blow it up.

444
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,260
Don't!

445
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,100
The explosion will cause a chain reaction.

446
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,980
You know how to tame cicadas?

447
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,900
What is this?

448
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,140
Here is one!

449
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,020
Let me play with it, too.

450
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,220
Hurry up!

451
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,820
Ordinary people can't handle it.

452
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,620
What ordinary people?

453
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,260
I...

454
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,900
I am not ordinary!

455
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,580
It died.

456
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,540
It's a treehopper.

457
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,460
It likes a cold and humid environment and it's

458
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,260
very sensitive to sounds.

459
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,340
Liu Sang.

460
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,940
This is why your whistle sound scared them off.

461
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,340
Listen.

462
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,940
The whistle sound is still there.

463
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:31,220
I want to eat fried cicadas!

464
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,420
Thunder City is like a big language repeater.

465
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,140
I also want to eat grilled kidneys!

466
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,140
Go.

467
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,660
What is this?

468
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,620
A pagoda?

469
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,180
These buildings

470
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,380
are bigger and cruder than a pagoda.

471
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,060
They should belong to

472
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,380
another kind of accessory buildings of Thunder City.

473
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,500
I believe a long time ago

474
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,100
there were a lot of crustal movements.

475
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,140
So some buildings were buried under the ground.

476
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,980
Year after year,

477
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,180
they were covered by a thick layer of soil.

478
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,100
Lie down!

479
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,940
This is it.

480
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,460
The patterns on these pillars are so strange.

481
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,180
They look like those in a bath house.

482
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,260
These pillars should be some kind of device.

483
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,700
Fatty yelled just now

484
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,340
and his voice reverberated around here.

485
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,060
I guess the structure of these pillars

486
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,700
is just like an European pipe organ.

487
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,260
They act like reeds to deliver sounds

488
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,100
by the vibration of the air.

489
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,260
Come on, Liu Sang.

490
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,500
Come over and listen.

491
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,180
Liu Sang?

492
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,300
Are you trying to scam me?

493
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,060
I didn't even touch him!

494
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:04,940
Liu Sang!

495
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,260
Liu Sang.

496
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,820
Liu Sang.

497
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,980
Liu Sang!

498
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:09,940
Look!

499
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,540
A treehopper got into his ear.

500
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,260
In his ear. Where did it come from?

501
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,100
Above.

502
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,580
What?

503
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,740
Above...

504
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,580
Above us!

505
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,460
The whistle!

506
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,500
Blow the whistle!

507
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,580
Who said that I can't handle this whistle?

508
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,940
With this whistle, you shall not pass!

509
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,300
Get it out quickly.

510
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,140
Why are there so many of them?

511
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,020
It doesn't work.

512
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,340
Fatty, it doesn't work anymore.

513
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,300
Why?

514
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,980
They already got used to the sounds?

515
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,020
Fatty.

516
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,100
Let's go.

517
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,020
Sang, are you still alive?

518
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,140
Duh.

519
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,580
Are we going at the right direction?

520
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,500
Yeah.

521
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,700
Go, go!

522
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,220
These insects will bite!

523
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,580
Go, go, go!

524
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:08,980
Move!

525
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:06,860
Sang!

526
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,100
Where is the way out?

527
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,900
There isn't.

528
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,380
Sang, listen!

529
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,260
Where is the way out?

530
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,500
There are too many sounds. I can't tell anymore.

531
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,860
Blow up these insects!

532
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:29,740
Boom!

533
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,660
No.

534
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,300
These sound-transmission pillars will be affected by sounds

535
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,620
and we will be affected, too.

536
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,380
No, it's too late.

537
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,340
The treehoppers are coming.

538
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,180
Kylin, we can only take our chance.

539
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,100
Okay.

540
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,260
Cover your ears.
