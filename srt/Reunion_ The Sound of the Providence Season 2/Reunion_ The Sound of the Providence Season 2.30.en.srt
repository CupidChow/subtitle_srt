Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,650
Episode 30

4
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,779
I found the treasures!

5
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,220
Bring it on.

6
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,059
These treasures are all mine!

7
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,620
Bai.

8
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,940
Bai!

9
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,220
What's going on?

10
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,820
Manager Tong

11
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,620
We got the antidote.

12
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,500
But poisonous fog has begun to appear underground.

13
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,700
We can't let it spread out to Warehouse 11.

14
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,940
The entrance to the section of unredeemable goods must be closed immediately!

15
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,100
Close Warehouse 11!

16
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,780
I am now throwing the antidote to you.

17
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,740
Hurry up!

18
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,620
Catch it!

19
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:02,940
Let's go.

20
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:06,860
The poisonous fog is coming.

21
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,580
Run!

22
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,060
The toxin in the fog exists in the form of dust.

23
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,540
The airflow here changes rapidly.

24
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,940
If we run, we will generate negative pressure

25
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,220
and the dust will rush to us.

26
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:15,780
But we will also be swallowed by it if we stand still.

27
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,660
Feudal superstition kills people.

28
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,900
These people inhaled the poisonous fog.

29
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,740
Soon they will wake up

30
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,140
and start attacking us.

31
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,100
Before they wake up,

32
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,700
smash this loudspeaker now!

33
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,500
Otherwise, we will be the ones lying on the ground in a minute.

34
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,500
Wait, Fatty.

35
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,140
Even if we smash the speaker now,

36
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,140
these poisonous fog in the air

37
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,780
will still exist.

38
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,860
The most important thing now is

39
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,420
to find a way to make the poisonous fog disappear.

40
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,780
Then inform Warehouse 11

41
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,460
to buy a hundred air purifiers now.

42
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,900
It says "Purify".

43
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,300
Let's try our luck.

44
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,660
Roger that!

45
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,700
You want to use an artifact to solve your problem?

46
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,180
Destroy it!

47
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,420
Since there is a way to activate the defense system,

48
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,180
there must be a way to turn it off, too.

49
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,500
They woke up.

50
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,060
What is the rule of the game now?

51
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,540
The rule of the game now is that

52
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,340
we can't turn off the defense system

53
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,540
until this audio clip finishes playing.

54
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:10,020
Are you sure it will work?

55
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,900
We can only take our chance.

56
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,340
My blood

57
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,460
can't last long.

58
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,980
So, we've come to the end of our life

59
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,420
so soon.

60
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,980
I am still unwilling to resign to destiny.

61
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,820
One second of the rest of my life has passed.

62
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,220
Another second has passed.

63
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,940
-Kylin. -Another second…

64
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,580
Who said he wanted to be the savior?

65
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,020
Yeah, who wanted to be the savior?

66
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,460
Which bastard said he wanted to be the savior?

67
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,780
Blow it up!

68
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,700
The shadows are coming. The poisonous fog woke them up.

69
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,020
Bai, Bai!

70
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,900
No, there are shadows in front, too.

71
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,300
What should we do now?

72
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,020
What should we do? We're so screwed.

73
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,340
Is there any enclosed space under the ground?

74
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,500
I know! Come with me.

75
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,500
Let's go.

76
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,620
Go.

77
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,500
Notify everyone.

78
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,500
Blow up all the vents.

79
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,860
Yes, sir!

80
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,540
This won't work. Go.

81
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,820
Liu Sang, over here!

82
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,020
Hurry up!

83
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,660
Come on!

84
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,860
Go, go, go.

85
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,620
Go!

86
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Come on! Come on! Come on!

87
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,180
Come on!

88
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,540
Faster!

89
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,180
It's a dead end.

90
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,500
This is not air-tight enclosed.

91
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,900
They can still come in.

92
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:54,980
Open the coffin!

93
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,260
Come on.

94
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,220
One, two, three.

95
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,060
Come again.

96
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,660
Come again.

97
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
That's too late.

98
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,380
Wu Xie made it!

99
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,220
You two, hurry up.

100
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,020
Or I won't wait for you guys.

101
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,140
Thank you.

102
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:33,980
Go.

103
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,020
Are they still coming back or not?

104
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,260
We have been waiting here for five hours.

105
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,820
Did you hear anything?

106
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,220
Don't tell me they went home without us

107
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,540
after the crisis was over.

108
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:24,980
Such lousy friends.

109
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,340
Can you hear that they are out or not?

110
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,380
Forget it!

111
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,500
I won't wait any longer.

112
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,940
Bai.

113
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,660
What a coincidence.

114
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,060
The bond between us is getting deeper and deeper.

115
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,220
Mr. Third Junior!

116
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,860
You scared me to death!

117
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,300
You have graduated.

118
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,780
Let's go.

119
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,740
Glasses.

120
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,500
Bravo!

121
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,420
Bravo!

122
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,500
Sang!

123
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,900
Bravo!

124
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,060
Your Chief.

125
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,780
Bravo!

126
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,180
Bravo!

127
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,140
Don't forget to call ambulance for the people lying down there.

128
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,820
They can wait for a while.

129
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,580
Like all stories,

130
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,820
when the direction you're going is wrong,

131
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,060
no matter how hard you pursue your target,

132
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,500
it will only become a ridiculous farce.

133
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,540
Erjing's obsession with the treasures was too deep

134
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,580
that he went crazy.

135
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,700
He turned to crime

136
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,580
because of his uncontrolled greed.

137
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,060
If people's desires are not legally bound,

138
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,500
they will devour people's soul and

139
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,900
lead to depravity.

140
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,100
After I've been through so many things,

141
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,660
I realized that

142
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,020
many lost things can't be restored.

143
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,940
Many memories

144
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,780
can no longer be copied.

145
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,940
Cherishing what you have at the moment

146
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,700
is the most important thing.

147
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,300
The reason why I

148
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
could hear repeated thunder in Wuzhou

149
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,860
was actually that

150
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,610
there is a huge cavity under the ground of Warehouse 11.

151
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,460
After the cavity was built,

152
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,740
the audio system inside

153
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,649
can resonate with the thunder

154
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,409
and the reflection will create sounds of same frequency.

155
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,460
Thunder City also has a huge cavity underground.

156
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,409
So when there is thunder,

157
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,649
the cavity will resonate with it and

158
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,180
reflect the thunder sounds to human ears.

159
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,220
At all the places with a thunder-listening device

160
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,740
built by South Sea King,

161
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,300
people can hear

162
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,420
thunder sounds with similar resonation.

163
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,780
Warehouse 11 is one of these cases.

164
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,180
We have submitted the artifact to a related institute

165
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,260
for further study.

166
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,540
But after those two thunder tapes were played,

167
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,060
that artifact

168
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,300
seemed to be self-destructed.

169
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,380
Now there is only a bronze shell left.

170
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,860
It may also be a self-protection mechanism of this artifact.

171
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,300
The archaeological team will conduct a special investigation on it.

172
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,420
Although it was just a camouflage to hide the real treasures,

173
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,060
it was indeed used cleverly.

174
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,300
Okay.

175
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,180
Thank you for the presentation.

176
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,500
We will continue to investigate what you said.

177
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,060
If you have further news,

178
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,940
I will appreciate it if you can inform us.

179
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,260
I will.

180
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,760
<i>Operating Room Blood Purification Center</i>

181
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,380
Anyway these are doctor's orders.

182
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,660
Just listen to the doctor.

183
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,300
Okay.

184
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,980
Are you the patient's family?

185
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,380
Yes.

186
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,940
The operation was very successful.

187
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,540
He will need to be hospitalized for observation for two more nights.

188
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,220
We will see by then

189
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,580
how he's recovered.

190
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,820
Push the patient to the ward.

191
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,860
Okay.

192
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,460
Doctor.

193
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,260
Thank you for taking care of him.

194
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,140
You're welcome.

195
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,900
As his family,

196
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,460
you need to show your support during his rehabilitation.

197
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,380
Senior people tend to

198
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,420
lose passion for life during their rehabilitation.

199
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,980
And sometimes you young people are busy.

200
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,980
So you don't have much time to stay by his bed side.

201
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,500
But the less time you spend with him, the more likely that he can't stand up again.

202
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,340
Yes.

203
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,420
Take my advice.

204
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,460
Go take a look at him later.

205
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,940
Is your uncle okay?

206
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,060
Depends on the recovery situation.

207
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,620
Yes.

208
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,380
Rehabilitation is very important.

209
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,860
I paid the bills for you.

210
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,660
You just need to go over and sign.

211
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,260
Okay.

212
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,500
I also asked the head nurse

213
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,620
to move Mr. Erbai in once a single ward is available.

214
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,100
So that his days in the hospital can be comfier.

215
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,860
Okay.

216
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,580
You're quite familiar with the hospital's procedures.

217
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,460
Sure!

218
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,700
I went through all the procedures

219
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,780
last time Mei had a surgery.

220
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,740
You have to move and talk more when you get to the hospital, you know?

221
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,500
You have to know when to cry and when to smile to people.

222
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,460
You know, smile.

223
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,460
Like this?

224
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,500
Like this?

225
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,300
Your Uncle Erbai

226
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,300
was such a crafty old fox.

227
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,180
How could he let Erjing fool him for so many years?

228
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,940
Erjing

229
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,420
doesn't seem so cunning.

230
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,980
Do you know the animal sloth?

231
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,100
Sloth?

232
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,580
Yes.

233
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,380
Erjing was

234
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,740
just like a sloth.

235
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,980
Its behaviors betray all biological laws of logic

236
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,620
and it only uses its slowness to avoid its natural enemies.

237
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,020
If Erjing was a very smart person,

238
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,740
Uncle Erbai would have seen through him a long time ago.

239
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,260
But just because he was so slow that

240
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,260
he just lurked by Uncle Erbai's side for years

241
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,060
and he never did anything harmful to the Wu family,

242
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,100
how could Uncle Erbai find out he was up to something evil?

243
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,860
Fair enough.

244
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,100
From now on,

245
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,460
I want to be a sloth too.

246
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,140
I'll go get his X-ray films.

247
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,660
You can be the turtle.

248
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,980
Then you will be a bastard.

249
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,980
I'll be a sloth by your side.

250
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,260
After years…

251
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,900
Coming.

252
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,660
You want to see my boss?

253
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,940
He's in the hospital keeping Mr. Erbai company.

254
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,380
I know.

255
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,820
He needs to stay there to look after him for a while.

256
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,020
So he entrusted me to take care of Wushanju

257
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,060
during this period.

258
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,220
Why you?

259
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,740
Why would I know?

260
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,980
Wu Xie is so popular recently

261
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,940
and also he is so close to Warehouse 11.

262
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,100
Maybe

263
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,980
he wants to expand his business landscape. You never know.

264
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,420
No, no.

265
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,300
Wait!

266
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,220
Aren't you a doctor?

267
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,460
What does expanding his business landscape

268
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,140
have to do with you?

269
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,540
I have been working hard here for so many years.

270
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,420
I never asked for an overtime pay

271
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,660
or a pay rise.

272
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,020
If he wants to have an acting manager,

273
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,740
that should be me!

274
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:12,900
I am not convinced!

275
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,380
I'm going to talk to boss.

276
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,380
Wait.

277
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,060
Wu Xie knew you would say that.

278
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,100
So,

279
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,500
starting today,

280
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,740
you are not an employee of Wushanju anymore.

281
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,300
Hey!

282
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,140
What…

283
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,460
I got fired again?

284
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,220
I'm going to burn this shop down!

285
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,900
Don't tell me this time

286
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,860
he found some excuses saying

287
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,500
this is for my own good again.

288
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,060
The key is

289
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,660
I have no other place to go

290
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,980
except for this shop.

291
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,060
You guys can be mean to me as much as you want.

292
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,180
I am not leaving!

293
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,900
I will stay here for the rest of my life!

294
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,900
Tell Wu Xie to come to see me!

295
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,540
He was ashamed so he didn't want to see me, right?

296
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,940
To encourage Party B's

297
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,940
contribution to Wushanju Antique Appraisal Co., Ltd.

298
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,860
in the absence of Party A,

299
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,540
an equity transfer contract is now drafted.

300
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,380
Party A, Wu Xie.

301
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,060
Party B, Wang Meng.

302
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,740
Party A is herein transferring 10% of his equity

303
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,700
to Party B.

304
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,620
The appendix contains three contracts and

305
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,020
twenty-five industrial and commercial change documents.

306
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,340
I am rich!

307
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:34,920
<i>Chuchu's Tomb</i>

308
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,980
Why haven't I seen you recently?

309
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,340
Have you been busy recently?

310
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,260
Yes.

311
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,380
There is a very tricky thing to deal with.

312
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,980
Need any help?

313
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,220
I can give you a discount.

314
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,700
Not at the moment.

315
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,180
Are you still blaming yourself?

316
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:47,780
No.

317
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,980
You don't need to comfort me.

318
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,540
Have you ever thought of the possibility that

319
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,780
maybe she is not dead?

320
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,260
I always have a contingency plan for every situation.

321
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,420
You think I didn't prepare for something like that?

322
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,880
<i>Consulting Room</i>

323
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,140
You're a bit overqualified

324
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,260
for our hospital with your education background.

325
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,020
You should go to a better hospital.

326
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,700
I have a topic of study now

327
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,500
which requires a good science laboratory.

328
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,380
Although you don't have the best general surgery department,

329
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,620
your hospital

330
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,220
has the best science lab.

331
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,300
What is your topic?

332
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,340
I want to study the ingredients of this liquid.

333
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,580
What is this?

334
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,420
I am not sure, not yet.

335
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,620
But I believe

336
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,540
if I can figure it out,

337
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,780
it will be very helpful

338
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,940
to many cases of heavy metal poisoning.

339
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,300
But you still need to be put under a certain department.

340
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,980
Which department do you want to go?

341
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,260
I can help you apply for the qualification.

342
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,460
Speaking of which,

343
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,540
there is just one vacancy

344
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,260
at our ENT department.

345
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:38,860
Sure.

346
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,460
Who are you to Mei?

347
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,060
I am her neighbor. Family next door.

348
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,820
He is my godfather.

349
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,180
I don't understand.

350
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Ma'am.

351
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,220
You should know

352
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,900
Mei's situation.

353
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,860
Didn't she apply for a temporary absence because she was sick?

354
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,540
Later

355
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,380
her mother had an accident

356
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,340
and divorced his father,

357
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,380
her father left them, and we couldn't find him.

358
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,340
No one took care of her so her mother

359
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,780
entrusted me to take care of her.

360
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,140
In other words,

361
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,380
I'll help her decide.

362
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,420
It's just as simple as that.

363
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,340
But we still have to follow the rules.

364
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,740
This must be signed by a relative.

365
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,180
Your signature is invalid

366
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,420
if you are not her relative.

367
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,860
Or you can call and tell her biological father

368
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,620
to come here.

369
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,060
How can her father be qualified to sign here?

370
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,380
Can her father educate her well?

371
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,140
School also needs to be realistic.

372
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,180
You can't always follow the rules.

373
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,260
Right?

374
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,420
The child deserves better than her irresponsible father!

375
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,020
But you may not be able to take care of her, either.

376
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,860
You don't

377
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,820
look like a dad to me.

378
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,660
Which part of me doesn't look like a dad?

379
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,620
No.

380
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,900
That was not what I meant.

381
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,820
You should let her father come here.

382
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,940
Uncle Fatty.

383
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,900
Can you be my father?

384
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,180
This is too difficult for me.

385
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,260
Can I really do it?

386
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,460
Don't say you can't do it.

387
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,460
My mom said that

388
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,020
don't say you can't do it.

389
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,020
You have to say, "I can learn."

390
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,540
Then tell me,

391
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,660
what does a good father look like?

392
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,020
First of all,

393
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,740
you can't do dangerous things.

394
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,220
No one will take care of me if something happens to you.

395
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,940
I'll just stay home all day long?

396
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,100
Am I a pet?

397
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,460
Then you can take me with you.

398
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,420
You think you can handle it?

399
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,820
Have you ever seen a movie called Kick-Ass?

400
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,420
What do you think?

401
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,740
I just quit the job of being your uncle Naive's babysitter.

402
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,260
Uncle Fatty!

403
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,540
Dad!

404
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,340
Wait for me!

405
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,620
So, you realize you can't turn the table, right?

406
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,860
Of course I can.

407
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,260
Why did you move your rook?

408
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,220
What can you do with that rook?

409
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,740
What can you do with it?

410
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,620
Where are you going to move it to?

411
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,700
Where?

412
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,580
You retracted a false move several times.

413
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,580
But I'll let you slide.

414
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,060
When did I retract it?

415
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,100
Bring it on.

416
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,340
I'll let you take my cannon.

417
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,180
Take it.

418
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,300
I'll just block you here.

419
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,300
I'll block you from advancing.

420
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,100
What's the point of blocking there?

421
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,660
Right?

422
00:30:59,340 --> 00:30:59,820
What can you do?

423
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,260
I'll take my deputy back.

424
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,540
You take your deputy back.

425
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,660
Then I will move this piece. Off you go!

426
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,060
Off you go!

427
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,020
Look.

428
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,060
Your move didn't work.

429
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,660
Kylin left.

430
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,300
I said off you go, and then he was gone.

431
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:18,900
Fatty.

432
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,660
Is Kylin dating someone?

433
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,580
I found out that recently he

434
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,260
often left the house sneakily.

435
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,060
Well, that's very likely.

436
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,940
The other day I saw him standing there

437
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,260
watching senior ladies dancing to music in a square.

438
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,980
He just watched them dance for more than an hour.

439
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,500
I guess he was picking the senior lady of his dream.

440
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,020
You know, among that group of ladies.

441
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,420
I don't know if he saw anyone he liked in the end.

442
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,100
Peacetime, right?

443
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,740
Let's play chess.

444
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,780
Let's play chess.

445
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,540
You are such a lousy chess player.

446
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,380
The more I play against you, the more…

447
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,220
Which one of us is the lousy one?

448
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,460
The lousier I become.

449
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,380
But I still have to play with you.

450
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,020
You are the protagonist, right?

451
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,740
Everyone else can go.

452
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,780
But we can't tell the story without you.

453
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,740
As long as you're still here,

454
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,020
this story will carry on.

455
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,180
This is your story.

456
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,340
Come on, come on.

457
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,260
I am the protagonist?

458
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,340
Yes, you are the protagonist.

459
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,100
Then did I start

460
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,460
with the protagonist's persona?

461
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,540
Have you ever seen such a useless protagonist?

462
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,100
Hey! Don't take your gain for granted.

463
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,460
If you are just a supporting actor, what am I?

464
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,500
You are the one who's only next to the supporting actor.

465
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,420
No. I am just an extra.

466
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,020
I'm not important, okay?

467
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,060
Why would you say that?

468
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:16,940
My role is to foil your advantages.

469
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,860
Right, when I stand next to you,

470
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,820
your body looks so prefect and

471
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,780
face so handsome.

472
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,620
You look so smart and

473
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,460
with reliable judgment with the presence of me.

474
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,380
If you really have to think it that way,

475
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,420
you can focus on the field of plays.

476
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,340
That suits you well.

477
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,580
It's true. Let me tell you.

478
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,340
With my strong aura, when I stand on the stage,

479
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:28,980
I always nail the play.

480
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,660
And the focus on me will not be blurred, right?

481
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,940
If I act in a play,

482
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,060
I can be in one this year and then

483
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,180
attend the Avignon Theatre Festival the next year.

484
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,580
I will appear at its "In" Festival, you know?

485
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,500
Bring it on.

486
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,380
Are you hungry?

487
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,540
Get something to eat. Go on.

488
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,020
You go.

489
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,420
I am not going.

490
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,220
I am too hungry that I can't stand up.

491
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,060
Move the knight!

492
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,820
What knight?

493
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,780
Go get us some food now.

494
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,100
How about you order some delivery now?

495
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,700
Order delivery.

496
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,180
My phone is not with me.

497
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,220
You're so shameless.

498
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,100
Is there ever such a shameless protagonist?

499
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,100
I'm telling you, really.

500
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,060
So shameless!

501
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:58,860
No, then you go get the phone.

502
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,260
How about whoever loses this game

503
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,340
will pay for the deliver?

504
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,020
Then of course it will be you.

505
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,380
I have predicted the thirty moves that're going to happen.

506
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,420
Wisdom, you know?

507
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,500
No you really think you're the protagonist.

508
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,020
Let me tell you this.

509
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,700
It doesn't necessarily mean you're also the protagonist in life.

510
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,020
Don't stay in character all the time.

511
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,260
Don't stay in the character too deep, or you won't be able to get out

512
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,220
Hurry up and get our meal.

513
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,180
What's meal?

514
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,580
I will skip this meal, alright?

515
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,460
I'll starve!

516
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,140
So what if I skip a meal?

517
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,220
I can still kick your ass!

518
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,900
I'm going to move…

519
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,900
Kylin?

520
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,300
Our personal delivery guy.

521
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,780
Kylin.

522
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,620
My angel!

523
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,700
You are always so reliable, Kylin.

524
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,620
Don't tell me

525
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900
you hooked up with a senior lady and she cooked for you?

526
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,860
I don't mind though.

527
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,260
Come on. Here you go.

528
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:47,780
Here you go.

529
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,420
Thank you.

530
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,540
Put the chess board away.

531
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,820
Wish us happiness.

532
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,020
August 17th is coming.

533
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,540
Recently, Changbai Mountain Scenic Area

534
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,140
has ushered in a new group of tourists.

535
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,300
Mostly young people.

536
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,620
This is a special annual festival for them.

537
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,220
Wuzhou is also holding

538
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,540
events related to this festival.

539
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,740
Guys.

540
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,820
We can also make plans

541
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,940
about travelling together, right?

542
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:15,820
Where do you want to go?

543
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,100
You see, I checked on Ctrip.com.

544
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,420
Catch.

545
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,780
They have details travel guides of all the destinations for you.

546
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,260
Look at that.

547
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,140
Glasses,

548
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,970
how about you pay, and I will be the tour guide?

549
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,860
I can provide a one-stop service including meals, accommodation and transportation.

550
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,340
Fatty, Kylin.

551
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,530
Come on.

552
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,580
Come on.

553
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,260
Come on!

554
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,140
Bai.

555
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:40,900
Come on.

556
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,620
Hurry up.

557
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,180
Cheers.

558
00:34:59,450 --> 00:34:59,900
Finish your glass!

559
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,930
Yes, this is this momentum to drink.

560
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,620
Glasses, you don't seem to enjoy your wine enough.

561
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,580
You just go ahead and enjoy it.

562
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,180
Where's Sang?

563
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,140
Should we make a toast to him?

564
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,780
To Sang.

565
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,500
To Sang.

566
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,500
To Sang. This is for you.

567
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,980
You are too much.

568
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,780
You really are mean.

569
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,580
So mean.

570
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,260
Come on.

571
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,260
Whoever is not present

572
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,220
will be teased.

573
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:20,660
Wu Xie.

574
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,300
Come on.

575
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,180
Let's clink glasses.

576
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,020
Glasses.

577
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,340
Come on.

578
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,700
Cheers.

579
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,380
Come on, cheers.

580
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,500
Look at Glasses' drinking posture. He must have practiced it.

581
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,340
Cheers!

582
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,900
Our story

583
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,980
began with the three of us.

584
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,220
Now the story ends

585
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,780
with a group of us.

586
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,140
This series of events

587
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,580
which started from a text message,

588
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,660
we're not so complicated

589
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,740
compared to my previous experiences.

590
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,020
I've learned a lot from my adventures.

591
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,380
But then again, it seems that

592
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,900
nothing has changed.

593
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,820
I shall see you guys again.

594
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,020
Until then, take care!
