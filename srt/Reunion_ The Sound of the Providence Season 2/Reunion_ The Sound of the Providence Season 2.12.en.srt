00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,150
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,220
Episode 12

4
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,850
What if I still have a trick up my sleeves?

5
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,250
You are familiar with these people.

6
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,850
Their surname is Wang.

7
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,710
A legendary family

8
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,650
in your business.

9
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,490
Twenty-seven people in total.

10
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,400
Make it quick and don’t be caught up in battle

11
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,430
Regardless of master tomb raiders,

12
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,110
antique merchants

13
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,090
or even brokers,

14
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,240
everyone in this cycle is intimidated

15
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,440
just by their names.

16
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,390
But no one knows

17
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,200
their identity or background.

18
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,770
I spent a lot of money

19
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,990
to get them here to work for me.

20
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,500
Be careful!

21
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,270
Go inside!

22
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,670
Let’s go.

23
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,690
We’re under a surprise attack by some elites!

24
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,090
This is an emergency!

25
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,990
It doesn't seem to be good news.

26
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,110
I didn't expect that Mr. Jiao

27
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,470
was able to get people of the Wang's family.

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,010
At this speed,

29
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,950
the Wu family’s people can't last ten minutes.

30
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,440
How many of them?

31
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,820
There are three in front.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,320
Two snipers are hiding in the distance.

33
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,510
They know I'm listening

34
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,520
so they keep changing positions.

35
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,350
How many did you say?

36
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,730
Our dozens of people are pinned down by so few of them?

37
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,900
Enough talking. I have a way.

38
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,620
Lure them to the third floor.

39
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,020
Wu Erbai has set up a trap causing hallucination on the third floor.

40
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,390
For the remaining snipers,

41
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
Liu Sang, Jia Kezi,

42
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,630
pinpoint their locations and

43
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,870
get them.

44
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,320
Come on. It’s show time!

45
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,670
Let’s go!

46
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,070
Come here.

47
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,230
The door is locked.

48
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,209
Break it open.

49
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:36,880
Damn!

50
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,120
Die!

51
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,260
Come. Hurry up.

52
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,550
Bro, why did you lead us here?

53
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,920
Don't call me bro. You should call me uncle.

54
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,800
How old are you?

55
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,159
I was born in 1969. You?

56
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,000
Grandpa, this way.

57
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:51,980
He’s hit by an arrow!

58
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,330
Hurry up!

59
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:10,990
Move faster.

60
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,659
Give me some time.

61
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,730
Go to the next spot.

62
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,130
Let’s go. Come on!

63
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:46,780
Go.

64
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,770
Let's take a gamble.

65
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,000
In the process,

66
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,360
we can

67
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,990
finish the topic we haven’t finished earlier.

68
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,520
Okay.

69
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,030
I have all the time in the world.

70
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,340
The result will not be changed anyway.

71
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,600
You two and them,

72
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,350
you’re all gonna die.

73
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,880
You seem to forget that you are still in my hands.

74
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,910
If we’re going to die, you’ll die before us.

75
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,870
Go on.

76
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,990
Why do you have to come to Spring of Roar?

77
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,590
Have you heard your brother mention a name

78
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,560
Tian Youjin?

79
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,980
Tian Youjin?

80
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,010
The guy who

81
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,740
stole property of Warehouse 11 and has been missing since then.

82
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:01,940
What?

83
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,890
That’s what he told you?

84
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,840
You know this Tian Youjin?

85
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,150
I’m more than knowing him.

86
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,880
I know him very well,

87
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,520
because

88
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,750
I’m Tian Youjin.

89
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,880
Many years ago…

90
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,110
Kill them all.

91
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,750
Don't.

92
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,670
Wait.

93
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,250
The Providence doesn’t want them to die.

94
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,990
Keep them alive. They will come in handy.

95
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:48,820
Just like that,

96
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,140
me and Wu Sanxing

97
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:52,870
were deposited in the section of unredeemable goods of Warehouse 11.

98
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,080
It was easy to come in here,

99
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,190
but nearly impossible to go out,

100
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,300
until I met that girl in the surveillance room.

101
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,870
I danced for her

102
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,560
and tried everything to attract her attention.

103
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,800
She would give me food from time to time.

104
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,170
I slowly fell in love with her.

105
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,430
Some time later

106
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,340
I found that there were many

107
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,050
unclaimed treasures in the section of unredeemable goods.

108
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,910
I thought, since so,

109
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,860
why not take them all?

110
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,240
So I managed to

111
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,780
bribe the clerks

112
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,990
of Warehouse 11 using these treasures.

113
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,410
And they helped me build a transportation corridor

114
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,650
between our section and Warehouse 11.

115
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,070
But even so

116
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,110
I still couldn't get out from there.

117
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,810
Brother Sanxing.

118
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,020
Wu Sanxing had been acting strangely after he came in Warehouse 11.

119
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,100
He actually found that person

120
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,990
the fake weather observation team asked him to save.

121
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,030
He was willing to do everything

122
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,320
for Chen Wenjin.

123
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,730
He observed and recorded the person’s behaviors

124
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,670
while trying to find a way out.

125
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,320
I kept an eye on him because I couldn’t afford to let him leave.

126
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,270
If he left and

127
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,730
tell Warehouse 11 about what I did,

128
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,180
I would be killed.

129
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,040
Brother Sanxing.

130
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,510
You have a share in the treasures I find.

131
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,610
So don't make a hasty decision of going out.

132
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,190
There are more valuable items deeper in the section.

133
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,650
Let's work together to get them.

134
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,530
Don't do anything stupid.

135
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,550
Let me tell you,

136
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,620
you can’t afford to take things from the Warehouse 11.

137
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,760
Do you hear me?

138
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,490
Youjin,

139
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,910
you are like my brother.

140
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,820
If you really want to get them,

141
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,440
I'll help you.

142
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,820
We’ll face it together if there is any problem.

143
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,760
We’ll go out together when we have found enough treasures.

144
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,990
Really?

145
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,330
Really? Brother Sanxing?

146
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,760
Cheers.

147
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,060
You’ve amassed a fortune for your bro.

148
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,120
Cheers.

149
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,260
Cheers.

150
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,920
Brother Sanxing,

151
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,190
I’m a little sleepy.

152
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,960
I’m going to sleep .

153
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,770
You should go to bed early, too.

154
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,030
Sure.

155
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,680
But in the end

156
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,860
Wu Sanxing escaped the section of unredeemable goods

157
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,030
through the corridor l designed.

158
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,200
Wu Sanxing!

159
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,310
You lied to me!

160
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,340
Wu Sanxing!

161
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,720
You lied to me!

162
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,620
I only understood by then that

163
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,320
Wu Sanxing never regarded me as his friend.

164
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,350
He not only left by himself,

165
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,300
but also tipped Warehouse 11 off about me.

166
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,370
Fortunately,

167
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,200
Director Ding was already on my side at that time.

168
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,280
So he intercepted the tip-off.

169
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,420
<i>Ye who enter Thunder City</i>

170
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,000
<i>can reverse all the past regrets</i>

171
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,080
Wu Sanxing

172
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,350
was such an evil person.

173
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,430
He didn’t take any treasures from Warehouse 11

174
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,800
only because he knew that

175
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,520
things in warehouse 11

176
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,410
were nothing

177
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,400
compared with the ones in Thunder City.

178
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,920
He abandoned me and went to a treasure hunt at Thunder City.

179
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,210
Truth be told,

180
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,560
there are not many valuable stuff left in Warehouse 11

181
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,590
because they had to keep up their impressive appearance.

182
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,620
So I have to have that treasure in

183
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,600
Thunder City.

184
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,110
Wu Sanxing has been humiliating and

185
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,700
teasing me.

186
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,800
I want the Wu family

187
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,670
to taste the same shame as I did.

188
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,490
You, your nephew,

189
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,910
all the people related to the Wu family,

190
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,200
even the unborn descendants of the Wu family

191
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,780
and the generations to come,

192
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,810
I’m going to kill all of you.

193
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,440
Mr. Jiao.

194
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,900
We are under control here.

195
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,190
The people you want

196
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,520
are in my hands.

197
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,430
Do you want me to kill them?

198
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,940
Wait.

199
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,920
I feel much better now.

200
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,430
Now we can negotiate terms.

201
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,540
Yes, we can.

202
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,480
But you have to give me half an hour to think about it,

203
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,640
and inform your people

204
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,540
not to hurt my people, alright?

205
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,980
Kanjian, keep an eye on him.

206
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,480
Xie, come with me.

207
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,079
Uncle Erbai.

208
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,050
Uncle Erbai.

209
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,829
Where are you taking me?

210
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,670
When I’ve come to my age,

211
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,890
I can't even believe anyone around me.

212
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,940
Uncle Erbai,

213
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,660
after you went down to the Spring of Roar,

214
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,980
what happened?

215
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,240
Before the mission

216
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,740
I emphasized again and again that

217
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,950
no one should make any sound.

218
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,320
What happened?

219
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,120
Something’s wrong.

220
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,020
Who is it?

221
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,920
Suddenly one of the walkie-talkies in the team

222
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,380
buzzed itself.

223
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,060
Let’s go!

224
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,770
Get out of here!

225
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,260
Chief!

226
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,740
Get out of here!

227
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,670
-Let’s go!  -Chief!

228
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,060
Hurry up!

229
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,840
Someone wanted us to get killed.

230
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,310
Who do you suspect was the spy?

231
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,200
I didn’t see it coming

232
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,700
about the spy,

233
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,060
and the accident in Spring of Roar.

234
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,630
This mission this time has undermined my foundation.

235
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,930
I wanted to wait for Jiao to leave and then I would take action.

236
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:58,280
But we’re now facing a crisis.

237
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,600
I have to save my people's lives now.

238
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,240
Are you looking for Kylin and others?

239
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,390
I won't stop you.

240
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,240
The tide will ebb soon.

241
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,360
This is my gear.

242
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,150
You need to take it with you.

243
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,780
You will need it down there.

244
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,790
Uncle Erbai, but Jiao…

245
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,730
I'll take care of the rest.

246
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,230
I believe that

247
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,920
the spy will expose himself

248
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,990
when I make a deal with Mr. Jiao.

249
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,360
I will try my best to leave you a message.

250
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,920
If you have a chance,

251
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,380
make sure to get rid of him for me.

252
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,520
And also,

253
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,750
Xie,

254
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,640
we are abroad now,

255
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,850
it’s not as safe as in our own country.

256
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,520
Always tread lightly.

257
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,510
Don't try to track me down after we part ways this time.

258
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,340
Because the whole thing is linked to other things

259
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,280
and has been long overdue.

260
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,020
Even if it’s happening now,

261
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,490
it will happen sometime in the future.

262
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,960
Our Wu family has been staying away from troubles in this cycle for years.

263
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,330
It seems that

264
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,620
our peaceful life is destined to come to an end.

265
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,650
Uncle Erbai

266
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,790
I have been to the section of unredeemable goods.

267
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,900
There I was more certain that

268
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,280
Uncle Sanxing was forced to go to Thunder City .

269
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,730
Tell me the truth.

270
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,010
Is it possible that Uncle Sanxing

271
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,050
is still alive?

272
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,160
No. He’s probably dead.

273
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,470
Someone was deliberately misleading you.

274
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,790
Now that we look back,

275
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,330
it should be that spy.

276
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,920
But when we are not completely sure about that,

277
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,170
we have to try to find him with the smallest probability.

278
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,840
Xie, go to Thunder City.

279
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,020
Find any trace left by your Uncle Sanxing and

280
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,740
reverse your regrets.

281
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,390
Since that spy wants you to go,

282
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,690
you can find him

283
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,980
pretending like you’re acting like he wanted you to.

284
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,560
Uncle Erbai.

285
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,040
Did I make the wrong choices?

286
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,590
Wrong or right,

287
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,750
you’ve already come this far.

288
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,360
Xie,

289
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,780
you’re on your own

290
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,690
from now on.

291
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,550
Come down.

292
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,530
Wu Xie ran away.

293
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,910
Wu Erbai has been controlled by me.

294
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,360
Take them down to Spring of Roar.

295
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,240
Come with me.

296
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,580
Let’s go! Hurry up!

297
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,110
Go.

298
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,450
Move!

299
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,530
Hurry up!.

300
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,200
Come on.

301
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,580
Mr. Erbai!

302
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,550
Mr. Erbai

303
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,170
Hurry up!

304
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:18,830
Go over there.

305
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,230
Mr. Erbai.

306
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,150
Hurry up.

307
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,530
Hurry up, line up.

308
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,410
Stand in a line.

309
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,480
Line up!

310
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,220
Mr. Jiao.

311
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,990
Are you okay?

312
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,750
I was so worried about you.

313
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,420
Let Mr. Erbai go!

314
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,580
Or we will not spare you even if we die!

315
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,830
Don't worry.

316
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,660
Soon your wish will come true.

317
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,770
Come out.

318
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,270
I know some of you

319
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,690
is not so loyal to Wu Erbai.

320
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,770
Wu Erbai is already under my control.

321
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,770
I don't care who you are,

322
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,680
we can cooperate.

323
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,070
Rest assured.

324
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,150
As long as you come forward,

325
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,170
everyone else here today

326
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,650
will die.

327
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,910
No one will go out alive

328
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,030
to tell people what you did.

329
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,890
No one comes out?

330
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,220
Okay.

331
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,750
Then I will get started.

332
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,490
Manager Bai!

333
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:06,840
Bai!

334
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,300
You lunatic!

335
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,250
I'm going to kill you!

336
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,950
Still don’t come forward?

337
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,870
If you don’t show yourself,

338
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,420
I might kill you next.

339
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,960
It's me.

340
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,610
It's you?

341
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,880
Any evidence?

342
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,800
I…

343
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,270
I…

344
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,690
It was me.

345
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,390
I sent the message

346
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,240
to tell you the location of the smelting workshop.

347
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,470
This is great.

348
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,780
Take Wu Erbai to Thunder City.

349
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:07,620
Wait.

350
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,590
Kill Wu Erbai.

351
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,090
I'll take you there.

352
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,290
He still has values to me.

353
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,210
When we arrive at Thunder City,

354
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,140
I will fulfill all your wishes.

355
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,520
Where is Wu Xie?

356
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,440
I made a deal with Wu Erbai.

357
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,030
Let’s go in there first.

358
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,360
What deal?

359
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,470
You don't need to know.

360
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,790
So he is willing to do everything

361
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,780
for Wu Xie.

362
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,300
You have worked for him for so many years.

363
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,520
You should have a deep bond.

364
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,950
Why did you betray him?

365
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,030
Why did you want to find out who the spy is?

366
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,310
You’re wearing a disguise!

367
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,810
You are not Mr. Jiao!

368
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,360
This is not the first time we meet.

369
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,760
You should still be able to recognize me.

370
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,960
I was the man

371
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,650
that two of you wanted to save in the section of unredeemable goods back then.

372
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,350
You know Tian Youjin?

373
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,140
I’m Tian Youjin.

374
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,100
Brother Sanxing!

375
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,850
Who are you?

376
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,870
He’s not Mr. Jiao.

377
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,060
It's him!

378
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,300
Mr. Erbai!

379
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,280
What should we do with him?

380
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,660
Leave the gear here.

381
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,980
You guys go down first.

382
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,650
What do you want?

383
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,940
This is really the last resort.

384
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,980
Wu Erbai.

385
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,930
You tricked me again.

386
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,390
During the past more than twenty years,

387
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,030
I have tricked many people.

388
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,090
I didn’t expect that

389
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,250
I fell into your trick in the end.

390
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,630
More than twenty years

391
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,650
is so long that anything can happen.

392
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,230
Mr. Jiao, Mr. Jiao!

393
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,150
Mr. Jiao.

394
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,650
Jiao!

395
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,910
Are you alright?

396
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,310
So it's you.

397
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,260
You didn’t see it coming, did you?

398
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,640
Didn't you go to Thunder City with Wu Sanxing?

399
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,310
He pretended to join us.

400
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,010
Since he joined our team, he had been looking for opportunities to get rid of us.

401
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,480
In order to gain the trust of my companions,

402
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,530
he set me up and

403
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,290
caused me to be expelled from the team.

404
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,430
So you were deceived by him, too.

405
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,370
We’re both his victims.

406
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,800
Back then

407
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,920
Wu Sanxing took me out of the section of unredeemable goods.

408
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,790
We let Chen Wenjin go.

409
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,300
And we also found the location of South Sea King's Tomb.

410
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,110
The Map to Thunder City

411
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,470
was hidden in the tomb.

412
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,750
Where’s Sanxing?

413
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,390
Where’s he?

414
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,150
Tell me!

415
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,430
Sanxing!

416
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,140
Wu Sanxing!

417
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,160
I’m glad that you guys came back.

418
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,520
Let’s go have a drink.

419
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,220
Let’s go.

420
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,770
Now we’re here.

421
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,350
Obviously,

422
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,630
we will be able to reach the South Sea King's Tomb

423
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,360
following this road.

424
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,920
But this place is surrounded by the ocean.

425
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,610
It’ll be hard for us

426
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,060
walking on the mudflat.

427
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,540
What's more, we still don’t know

428
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,820
how to get down to South Sea King's Tomb.

429
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,020
But I believe

430
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,790
thunder will guide us.

431
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,680
The Providence will help us.

432
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:39,690
Yes.

433
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,530
Yes!

434
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,010
Let's talk about the specific plan now.

435
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,180
But I didn't expect that

436
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,690
Wu Sanxing tracked us down in the evening.

437
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,090
He took our files and

438
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:52,940
reported to the government.

439
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,550
And then he went to South Sea King's Tomb before we did.

440
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,040
The most hateful thing was

441
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,670
I was considered a traitor

442
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,390
because of him

443
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,190
and I was held in captivity.

444
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,760
Come on.

445
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,260
After I escaped,

446
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,060
I asked around and I found that

447
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,350
things didn’t end well for him either.

448
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,030
He was forced to go to Thunder City by the team leader.

449
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,030
They went to Thunder City as they wished.

450
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,200
And I was

451
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,380
locked up for years because of Thunder City

452
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,630
and became such a miserable person.

453
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,360
I wanted to take revenge.

454
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,090
Later I found Wushanju

455
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,780
only to find out that Wu Sanxing had been missing for many years.

456
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,150
There was no news about him ever since.

457
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,310
I didn’t want to give up.

458
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,420
He couldn't disappear forever.

459
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,240
Wushanju was the closest place that I could get in Wu Sanxing’s life.

460
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,310
Wu Erbai was affectionate and loyal.

461
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,140
One day

462
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,700
he was holding a funeral for one of his men

463
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,990
and a group of people coming to the funeral to make troubles.

464
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,580
I took a cut for Wu Erbai.

465
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,830
Since then I gained his trust

466
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,200
and became his personal bodyguard.

467
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,500
He would take me wherever he went.

468
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,690
Listen up, everyone.

469
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,510
From now on he will be one of our people.

470
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:30,650
Call him Brother Erjing.

471
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:32,059
Brother Erjing.

472
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,289
Take him down to custody.

473
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:47,910
Yes.

474
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,430
Let’s go.

475
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,770
You and I live for the same purpose

476
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:08,510
during the past many years.

477
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,110
Leave him to me.

478
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,450
Don't you hate the Wu family to your gut?

479
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,080
I can use him as leverage

480
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,500
to make the Wu family mine.

481
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,430
No way.

482
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,990
I need him to point out the location of Thunder City.

483
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,190
I was there, too.

484
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,390
I can tell you.

485
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,720
This map…

486
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,400
When you showed the map to Wu Erbai,

487
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,510
he already remembered everything by heart.

488
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,510
The location at the angle below the moon,

489
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,160
is where you are looking for.

490
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,670
Here?

491
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,560
Yes.

492
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,450
But this map actually only shows

493
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,720
an approximate location.

494
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,920
After you enter Spring of Roar and find the exit,

495
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,070
you’ll be close to Thunder City.

496
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,270
What should I do after that?

497
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,940
The thunder.

498
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,630
The thunder will enlighten you.

499
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,930
Why should I trust you?

500
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,120
Both of us are the same.

501
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,510
Only the Wu family is our enemy.

502
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,320
Why would I want to hurt you?

503
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,720
You are not going to Thunder City?

504
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,260
I want to find something that belongs to me first.

505
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,140
What is it?

506
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,540
Let's go.

507
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,270
Let’s go.

508
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,630
Go.

509
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,600
I can't figure it out why.

510
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,590
There’re many things I haven't figured out either.

511
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,570
I chose this wheelchair for you

512
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,860
because I really hoped you could get well soon.

513
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,030
I think what you want is me to die.

514
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,450
Mr. Erbai, I won't let you die.

515
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,100
But I want you to be unable to speak or move.

516
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,790
Just spend the rest of your life

517
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,690
on this wheelchair.

518
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,950
I will take care of you.

519
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,590
What are you doing?

520
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,220
What are you doing?

521
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,420
Li Jiale, Li Jiale!

522
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,390
Wake up!

523
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,710
Wake up, Li Jiale!

524
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,330
Huo Daofu!

525
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,650
Wake up.

526
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,310
Liu Sang, wake up.

527
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,020
All of you!

528
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,390
Wake up.

529
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,830
Are you guys okay?

530
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,940
It hurts a little bit.

531
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,780
None of us has a wound.

532
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,960
Mr. Jiao hit us

533
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,110
with fake bullets with fake blood.

534
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,700
But because he aimed at important body parts and

535
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,020
he aimed well,

536
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,090
we passed out by the impact.

537
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,500
Come on.

538
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,910
But why did he want to help us?

539
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,910
That Mr. Jiao just now

540
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,930
was actually Mr. Erbai.

541
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,280
Who is this person we’re looking at?

542
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,650
This is the real Mr. Erbai.

543
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,070
Wait.

544
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,140
Did you forget?

545
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,210
He is a spy.

546
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,550
I’m a spy?

547
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:17,790
If I didn't do that,

548
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,560
how could you guys still be alive?

549
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,240
Mr. Erbai did what he did

550
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,870
to save you all

551
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,010
at the expense of himself.

552
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,080
You are all still young.

553
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,600
If Mr. Erbai dies,

554
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,520
then I will definitely kill myself, too.

555
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,990
What exactly is going on?

556
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,190
It’s an act

557
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,670
for Mr. Jiao to see.

558
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,300
So that he would trust me

559
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,060
and I could give him the fake map.

560
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,350
Mr. Erbai did this

561
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,110
to stall them and

562
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,310
buy more time for Wu Xie.

563
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,500
What about Wu Xie now?

564
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,270
Mr. Erbai told him to go down there first.

565
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:02,820
We have no time.

566
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,880
You guys should also go now.

567
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,680
The diving gear is already at the water inlet.

568
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,190
If Mr. Third Junior bumps into Mr. Jiao and his gang,

569
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,120
things will be bad for him.

570
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,080
Let’s go.

571
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,350
So

572
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,740
how is Mr. Erbai now?

573
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,500
In order to make the act more convincing,

574
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,450
and for me to be trusted by Mr. Jiao,

575
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,540
Mr. Erbai was tortured by them and became what you see now.

576
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,320
He can't talk or walk anymore.

577
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,530
Okay, I'm going to send him up to the ground for treatment.

578
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,560
How is Mr. Erbai?

579
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,030
There are many possible theories.

580
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,320
But right now I can’t tell for sure.

581
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,720
Since he’s in a coma,

582
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,400
of course you can say whatever you want.

583
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,630
What do you mean?

584
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:07,960
I have been working for Mr. Erbai for so many years.

585
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,500
He never doubted me.

586
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,780
What gives you the right to doubt me?

587
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,850
I saved Mr. Erbai’s life.

588
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,480
If you don't believe me,

589
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,810
you can ask him when Mr. Erbai wakes up.

590
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,320
We might have wronged Brother Erjing.

591
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,950
If he is really a spy,

592
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,540
why would he save Mr. Erbai?

593
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:32,920
Calm down.

594
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,860
We’re all working for the same family, right?

595
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,310
You should hurry up to save Wu Xie now.

596
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,450
You have to catch up with him.

597
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,360
Hurry up.

598
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:41,810
Our priority is to save Wu Xie.

599
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:50,700
You stay.
