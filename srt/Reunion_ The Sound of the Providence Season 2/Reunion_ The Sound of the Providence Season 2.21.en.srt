Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,220
Episode 21

4
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,920
Mr. Jiao.

5
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,120
Everyone else has run away.

6
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,920
I'm going home.

7
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,640
You see your master again.

8
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,840
Are you happy?

9
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,360
Mr. Jiao.

10
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:49,760
Go without me

11
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,960
Glasses.

12
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,400
Just do what you want to go.

13
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
We can handle it here.

14
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:00,680
Okay.

15
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,280
You don't deserve such a painless death.

16
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,720
Do you know why I always survive?

17
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,000
Because I

18
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,480
never go against the will of Providence.

19
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,159
Holy Land!

20
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,600
Don't.

21
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,840
Don't.

22
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,240
Bro.

23
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,240
Don't kill me.

24
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,789
I'm begging you.

25
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,000
I

26
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,880
know I did a lot of evil things.

27
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,600
Don't kill me.

28
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,680
I will make it up to you.

29
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,800
Just name a price.

30
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,560
Double the reward they promised you?

31
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,920
Three times?

32
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,360
No, no, no!

33
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,360
Don't!

34
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,040
Please!

35
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,520
My task has completed.

36
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,000
Whether your task or his.

37
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,600
We are even now.

38
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm going to find Mr. Third Junior!

39
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,800
I need you to

40
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,800
take Liu Sang out of here.

41
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,720
I'll go save them.

42
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,600
Come on!

43
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,560
Come get me.

44
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,040
Goodbye.

45
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,480
Go to hell!

46
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,200
Get out of here!

47
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,720
Good marksmanship.

48
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,680
The place has bombs everywhere!

49
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,480
Let's go!

50
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,440
Bombs?

51
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,480
Are they crazy?

52
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,040
They want to blow themselves up?

53
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,360
Glasses, run!

54
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,200
Glasses, there're bombs! Go!

55
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,760
Hurry up!

56
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,880
There's an explosion.

57
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,800
Explosion!

58
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,000
Explosion?

59
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,920
They blew up the place.

60
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,680
It must be those people we saw!

61
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,160
Mr. Third Junior and others are still inside.

62
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,920
Let's go!

63
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,480
Come on!

64
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,920
Let's go!

65
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,580
Kylin.

66
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,620
Fatty.

67
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,860
Fatty.

68
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,900
Fatty.

69
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:44,860
Come on.

70
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,180
Come on.

71
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:49,900
Are you okay?

72
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,420
Let me stay here to take a break for a while.

73
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,860
Where are they? Where's Kylin?

74
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,980
Where's Glasses?

75
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,780
Glasses!

76
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,820
Where are you?

77
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,260
Stop shouting.

78
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,780
I'm not dead yet.

79
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,540
We are so lucky this time.

80
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,820
Such a big explosion didn't kill us.

81
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,340
These idiots.

82
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,140
They planned a suicide bombing but

83
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,060
in the end they only got themselves killed.

84
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,540
It was not done by Mr. Jiao's people.

85
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,180
Another group of people came in here.

86
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,060
Although the explosion didn't blow us up,

87
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,260
it destroyed

88
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,740
the mechanism of preventing the poisonous fog from coming into Thunder City.

89
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,140
Look!

90
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,780
It seems that we are going to die alongside with Mr. Jiao.

91
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,020
Alongside with him?

92
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,020
I will never allow such thing to happen!

93
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,220
Let's leave this place.

94
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,260
Leave?

95
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,740
How?

96
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,220
Just like how we got in here in the first place!

97
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,660
Outside is a forest full of poisonous fog.

98
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,580
We can't go back the same way we came here.

99
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,940
The time we can be exposed to the fog is not long enough to escape.

100
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,660
What should we do then?

101
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,100
We have to find a way to leave anyway.

102
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,780
You guys can't just stand here doing nothing.

103
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,180
Move!

104
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,300
The poisonous fog is coming in.

105
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,540
-Mr. Third Junior. -Go back!

106
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,420
Go back for now.

107
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,620
-Mr. Third Junior. -Hurry up! Just go!

108
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,740
Go!

109
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,980
The pagodas.

110
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,940
That's right!

111
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,020
These heavy-duty bronze pillars

112
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,900
can lead to the pagodas.

113
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,500
There are no pagodas anymore. They all collapsed.

114
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,220
This way won't work.

115
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:44,620
Just take my advice.

116
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,260
We would have found a way out with the time you stood here doing nothing.

117
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,140
There are ninety-nine pagodas.

118
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,660
Then there are also

119
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,700
ninety-nine bronze pillars in total outside.

120
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,260
This might be

121
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,100
the message my Uncle Sanxing tried to leave me.

122
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,260
Hurry! Move!

123
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,740
Hurry up!

124
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,660
Wait a minute, Fatty.

125
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,220
Why?

126
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:39,340
Fatty.

127
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,129
Do you remember that time when I was

128
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,860
almost killed by thunder at the weather observation station?

129
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,660
This is not the good time to tell good old stories.

130
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,940
What did you find this time?

131
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,140
I am drawing

132
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,740
the picture I drew on the ground at that time.

133
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,620
I just realized that it's

134
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,220
basically the same as the one Liu Sang drew.

135
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,620
The only difference is that

136
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,420
there are two lines on the left and right sides of the tomb.

137
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,380
Whether it's an ancient building or

138
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,100
a modern building,

139
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,820
they always have particularly strong load-bearing walls.

140
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,860
To prevent the walls from falling,

141
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,420
ancient artisans

142
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,140
would put particularly hard materials inside the walls

143
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,740
as support.

144
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,100
So I guess that

145
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,980
the artisans of Thunder City

146
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,620
made two sound transmission pillars

147
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,740
inside the walls on both sides.

148
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,260
They are indicated with these two lines.

149
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,820
Well done, Naive.

150
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,020
We found a direction to work on.

151
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:30,860
Find it.

152
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:31,940
Find it.

153
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,500
Glasses.

154
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,340
Find it quickly, or it'll be too late.

155
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:33,900
The clock is ticking!

156
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,260
A line is on the west

157
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,740
while the other is on the east side.

158
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,140
Move! We're running out of time.

159
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,260
Go, Kylin.

160
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,180
Come on.

161
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:45,980
Let's go, Fatty.

162
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,020
You guys go first. I'll cover for you.

163
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,060
Go, go, go.

164
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,340
Go! What are you doing?

165
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,540
Let me stay here.

166
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,460
Time is running out.

167
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,300
Don't touch me. I'm fine. What are you doing?

168
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,940
You just find the way out quickly!

169
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,820
You're acting strange. What happened?

170
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,660
I'm fine.

171
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,700
What can happen to me?

172
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,420
I am fine.

173
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,060
Hurry up.

174
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,220
I broke a leg.

175
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,820
I can't go anymore.

176
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,060
I don't want to become your liability. So go.

177
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,420
Find the way out.

178
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,940
I can't reverse my past regrets anyway.

179
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,900
I have nothing in my life to hope for anyway.

180
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,380
Let me take some rest here.

181
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,620
I think it's quite comfortable here.

182
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,980
Don't waste your time.

183
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,540
After you go out,

184
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,020
get back with an excavator

185
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,540
to dig it through and get me out.

186
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,140
Don't you understand what I say? Naive!

187
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,660
You're so smart. Don't be a stubborn fool.

188
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,500
What you guys doing is taking your chance.

189
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,460
You won't necessarily find it.

190
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:23,900
Come on.

191
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:34,900
Come on.

192
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,860
Go.

193
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,860
Over there.

194
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,340
It's bandaged pretty well.

195
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,700
You did quite a finicky job.

196
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,900
For this I can forget a meal of hot pot which is supposed to be your treat.

197
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,100
Found it.

198
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,220
Hurry up. Leave.

199
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,660
I'm fine.

200
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,540
Come on.

201
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,020
You…

202
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:28,940
Come on.

203
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,740
Hop on my back.

204
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,900
Why?

205
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,660
Are you able to carry me?

206
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:38,500
I…

207
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,460
Let me tell you, Fatty.

208
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,900
Never say such nonsense to me in the future again.

209
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,220
I was your liability so many times.

210
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,980
When did you ever leave me behind?

211
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,980
You think I'll leave you here alone?

212
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,100
You are so thin,

213
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,660
but your body is warm to the touch.

214
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,900
Don't touch my chest.

215
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,980
Kylin.

216
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,020
Found it.

217
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,900
Amazing.

218
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,140
Come on.

219
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:11,820
Come on.

220
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,540
So amazing!

221
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,500
Slowly.

222
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,420
Kylin.

223
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,460
This is awesome.

224
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,620
I sacrificed

225
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,860
the time you gave treatment to my leg

226
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,940
and helped you guy find this way out.

227
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,380
Help me stand.

228
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,060
Okay.

229
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,380
Hurry.

230
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,020
You guys climb up first. I'll be at the end of the line.

231
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,420
Or if I fall

232
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,620
and hit you guys,

233
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,980
we'll all fall.

234
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,380
Slow down.

235
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,180
The patterns on this pillar

236
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,020
is the same as the one in the pagodas.

237
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,260
I guess they can survive!

238
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,020
Let's go!

239
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,260
Mr. Third Junior!

240
00:23:59,380 --> 00:23:59,780
Chief!

241
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,300
Mr. Third Junior. -Wu Xie!

242
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,380
Fatty.

243
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,700
Mr. Third Junior.

244
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,460
They're not here.

245
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,340
Go.

246
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,740
Naive.

247
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,420
What should we do if there is thunder?

248
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,420
We won't be killed by the strike in this tunnel, right?

249
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,460
Shut up!

250
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,100
This pillar is slanted.

251
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,460
It should be fine.

252
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,180
It can't attract thunder, can it?

253
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,860
Mr. Third Junior.

254
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,780
-Fatty! -Chief!

255
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,380
Mr. Third Junior.

256
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,900
Fatty.

257
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,180
Glasses, are you groping me?

258
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,340
How can you take advantage of me when I am injured?

259
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,860
Drag my feet. Drag hard.

260
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,060
Exactly.

261
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,700
Mr. Third Junior.

262
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,300
Mr. Third Junior.

263
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,260
Mr. Third Junior.

264
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,180
Fatty.

265
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,140
Chief!

266
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,220
Mr. Third Junior.

267
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,540
Fatty!

268
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,020
Do you guys hear anything?

269
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,540
Chief!

270
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
It's Bai and Liu Sang!

271
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:52,860
Chief!

272
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,940
I knew that punk is smart.

273
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,500
-Fatty! -Chief!

274
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,300
We are here!

275
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,980
We are here!

276
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,180
We are here!

277
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,860
There's someone's voice!

278
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,540
Mr. Third Junior.

279
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,740
Fatty.

280
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,980
Mr. Third Junior.

281
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,380
Can you hear me?

282
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,500
Yes!

283
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,180
I'm down here!

284
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,340
I hear his voice!

285
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,300
Mr. Third Junior, you guys stay there and wait!

286
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,220
Give me some rope.

287
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,780
Chief!

288
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,340
Rope.

289
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,140
Let's go, Fatty.

290
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,980
Go.

291
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,020
Wu Xie.

292
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,460
Fatty.

293
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,060
Glasses, here you go.

294
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,540
Fatty. Keep up.

295
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,060
Give me your hand, Fatty.

296
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,740
We are out!

297
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,060
We're out!

298
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,540
I was so worried about you.

299
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:44,980
Bai.

300
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,380
I

301
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,060
would never expect that we could actually

302
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,900
get out of there alive.

303
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,580
Thank God that you thought of the pagodas.

304
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,020
Let's go.

305
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,260
Let's take you home.

306
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,780
We don't know whether Li Jiale is dead or not.

307
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,660
We can't leave him here.

308
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,900
Li Jiale!

309
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,020
Jiang Zisuan saved my life.

310
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,260
Let's talk about everything that happened when we go back home.

311
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,060
Look!

312
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,900
He's about to cry.

313
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,620
Look at that.

314
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,940
Someone has an enlightenment about life.

315
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,620
Let's go.

316
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,700
Go home.

317
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,420
Let's go.

318
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:51,740
Let's go.

319
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,940
Reverse all regrets in one's heart.

320
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,780
Fortunately, I have a bad memory.

321
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,540
Goodbye.

322
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:02,940
Mr. Erbai.

323
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,340
I know that you are worried about my boss.

324
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,780
But his biggest wish

325
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,540
is for you to get better.

326
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,900
It was all my fault.

327
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,020
I shouldn't have gone up the mountain to exploit the way.

328
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,980
I should have gone down there with Mr. Third Junior.

329
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,020
At least this way I could protect him.

330
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,740
Mr. Erbai.

331
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,540
Mr. Third Junior calls!

332
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,100
Look, it's him.

333
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,380
Hello? Mr. Third Junior.

334
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,700
You guys are all safe?

335
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,900
Okay. Got it.

336
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,020
I will take good care of him.

337
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,220
Mr. Erbai.

338
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,340
Mr. Third Junior is fine.

339
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,340
He's coming back.

340
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,460
He's safe and sound.

341
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,100
Have some.

342
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,660
Beer, beverage, mineral water.

343
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,260
Peanuts, melon seeds, and mixed porridge.

344
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,180
Peanut and melon seeds.

345
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,420
What are you laughing at?

346
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,300
What did you write?

347
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,220
What do you think?

348
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,300
Talk less

349
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,540
and, and…

350
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,180
lose weight more.

351
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,300
I guess that

352
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,700
I can never reverse my regret.

353
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,140
The adventure of

354
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,060
Thunder City is over.

355
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,700
Maybe because of the fickle finger of fate,

356
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,780
I still haven't found Uncle Sanxing.

357
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,700
Maybe Uncle Erbai is right.

358
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,860
Maybe he is dead.

359
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,580
But somehow, like it's destined,

360
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,060
my disease has been cured.

361
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,300
We left Thunder City.

362
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,180
But this is far from the end of our story.

363
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,340
Uncle Erbai is paralyzed and he can't speak.

364
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,820
But we still haven't found the spy among his people yet.

365
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,740
I believe the new enemies we faced in Thunder City

366
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,620
were sent by that spy.

367
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,340
I don't mind dealing with new mysteries.

368
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,140
I don't want to suspect that person.

369
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,420
I don't want to suspect anyone I know.

370
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,660
But the whole story has

371
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,100
too many unimaginable causes and effects.

372
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,220
Your card is not bigger than mine!

373
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,740
K.

374
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,740
-Can you read the number of cards? -Oh, you got a pair.

375
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:03,980
All in all,

376
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,060
life is a journey

377
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,100
in which we keep searching for the truth and

378
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,060
solving puzzles.

379
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,860
As long as

380
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,100
the journey is not over yet,

381
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,100
our story

382
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,220
will continue.

383
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,490
Big Mac combo.

384
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,490
Fort cod burger combo.

385
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,620
Pork and fried egg combo.

386
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,260
And a fried chicken family big box.

387
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,010
Oh, it's not your product.

388
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,100
Then give me a

389
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,010
spicy chicken drumstick combo.

390
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,420
One large serving of French fries and one large coke.

391
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,300
Hurry up.

392
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,530
You got the address, right?

393
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,820
Don't eat now.

394
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,380
Fortunately, your aorta wasn't hurt.

395
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,450
The operation was very successful.

396
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,740
You will be discharged in three months.

397
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,860
Eighth floor, yes.

398
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,220
You're from the hot pot place, right?

399
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,490
Hurry up. I'm starving!

400
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,380
Eighth floor.

401
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,530
For your own health,

402
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,420
for your Achilles tendon,

403
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,100
and to save your legs

404
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
from the burden of so much gravity,

405
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,900
you should lose some weight.

406
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,860
So you mean my leg

407
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,580
was not broken by the falling pillar, but by my own weight?

408
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,260
Yes, that's what I mean.

409
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,620
Miracle.

410
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,540
A pure miracle.

411
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,380
What was your treatment?

412
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,940
The test results show that

413
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,380
your lungs are perfectly fine.

414
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,060
Maybe I was not sick to begin with.

415
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,580
But that's impossible.

416
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,980
According to your X-ray films earlier

417
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,660
and this inspection report,

418
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,100
your lung disease has reached an advanced stage.

419
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,860
You wouldn't have lived for more three months.

420
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,300
That maybe,

421
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,660
maybe I got lucky.

422
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,220
Lucky?

423
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,700
Come in.

424
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,380
Doctor.

425
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,780
Anyway, thank you.

426
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,980
Sure.

427
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,620
Cherish your healthy body now.

428
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,860
How's Uncle Erbai?

429
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,780
The same as we thought before.

430
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,140
His body is fine.

431
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,620
But his spine and vocal cord nerves are damaged which cause his symptom of

432
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,420
being unable to speak or walk.

433
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,740
To be honest,

434
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,540
only God knows

435
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,980
whether he'll ever recover.

436
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,900
I promised him that

437
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,900
I would definitely find the spy.

438
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,700
I will continue to investigate this matter.

439
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,060
The most important thing for you now

440
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,700
is to recuperate.

441
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,460
My body can wait.

442
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,180
But the spy thing keeps bothering me.

443
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,660
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

444
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,060
Tell me if you have any ideas about it.

445
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
There is another thing.

446
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,540
What's your plan for your family business in the future?

447
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,740
You saw how Mr. Erbai is.

448
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,860
After you are discharged from the hospital,

449
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,020
the whole Wu family is counting on you to lead them.

450
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,020
Me?

451
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,100
I can't be counted on.

452
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,340
With my weak body,

453
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,940
I don't know how long I can stay healthy.

454
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,660
Here's what I think.

455
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,060
I want to reopen Wushanju Antique Shop.

456
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,860
About Uncle Erbai's business,

457
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,540
Uncle Erjing, I need to rely on you to run it.

458
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,540
You are more familiar with the business.

459
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,460
Anyway, the bottom line is that we must keep his business running.

460
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,500
But as you know, Mr. Erbai ordered his men that

461
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,660
they can't take orders from you.

462
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,140
He hasn't taken it back.

463
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,380
I'm afraid

464
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,100
some of his people want to take the opportunity to go solo.

465
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,860
I'm worried that

466
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,660
you will definitely meet a lot of obstacles when you deal with them.

467
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,580
Because after all, those people

468
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,780
worked for Mr. Erbai,

469
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,060
not you.

470
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,100
If you want them to acknowledge

471
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,100
your status as Mr. Erbai's successor,

472
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,420
I think you need to make Mr. Erbai say it to them

473
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,660
clearly personally.

474
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,180
I understand.

475
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,700
It's not easy for me to take over the family business.

476
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,540
I can only calm them down for now.

477
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,780
But you have to think of a way yourself.

478
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,180
Let's take our time to do that,

479
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,820
You have my full support if you meet any difficulty.

480
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,220
Take care of yourself.

481
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,060
I gotta go.

482
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,300
Mr. Erbai.

483
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,780
Guess

484
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,900
what my conversation with Wu Xie was about just now?

485
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,300
We talked about how to catch that spy.

486
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,420
Wu Xie is pretty prudent.

487
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,740
It's a pity that he didn't know what happened.

488
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,780
People of your Wu family

489
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,420
are all tough.

490
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,620
I thought that in the end

491
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,420
Wu Xie would die there, and you were already paralyzed.

492
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,500
So when I came back,

493
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,660
naturally I would

494
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,940
take over your empire.

495
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,820
But I didn't expect that he managed to come back alive.

496
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,500
But that's okay.

497
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,020
I will work harder to send him to hell.

498
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,900
Do you think he will

499
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,780
have a chance to find out I was the spy before he dies?

500
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,220
What did you say, Mr. Erbai?

501
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,660
I know what you want to say.

502
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,180
You're saying that Wu Xie still has friends

503
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,700
such as Kylin, Xie Yuhua, Glasses, and Fatty

504
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,940
to help him.

505
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,980
You are right.

506
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,180
I thought that he is the only one in

507
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,060
your Wu family's younger generation.

508
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,500
Wu Xie only entered our line of business

509
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,660
when he had already been quite old.

510
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,780
He couldn't even run his little shop well.

511
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,980
Such a good-for-nothing

512
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,620
can't do anything well by himself.

513
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,020
But his friends

514
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,700
really helped him a lot.

515
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,740
But that's okay.

516
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,780
Mr. Erbai.

517
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,740
I have arranged for the people in Warehouse 11 to do it.

518
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,300
Soon they

519
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,740
will meet unexplained deaths.

520
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,060
Mr. Erbai.

521
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,460
Have an apple.

522
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,100
Eat it!

523
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,260
Mr. Erbai,

524
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,500
why are you still so stubborn

525
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,420
when you have hit the rock bottom?

526
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,900
I have been working for you for so many years.

527
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,100
I have been watching how you planned schemes against others.

528
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,180
Now it's just tit for tat.

529
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,580
I want you to have the same taste.

530
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,940
You don't say.

531
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,140
It feels really good.

532
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,100
Ready.

533
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,820
Seal the cases!

534
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,220
Ready!

535
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,500
Sink them!

536
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,860
Operation Dandelion,

537
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,620
the winding up for the first batch has completed.

538
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,540
The second batch, begin!

539
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,580
Ready!

540
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,620
Fire!

541
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,060
Right at this spot,

542
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,900
Zhang Fo Ye's team

543
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,020
committed suicide without hesitation.

544
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,940
And no one has ever found

545
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,700
the mysterious objects sinking in the water since.

546
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,260
Sir,

547
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,740
so for an urban legend,

548
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,220
you asked us to stay up all night and

549
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,220
search for them in the water for you?

550
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,140
That's right!

551
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,660
I'm telling you guys,

552
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,340
this is a famous

553
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,020
unsolved mystery in the history of Warehouse 11.

554
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,220
Think about it.

555
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,580
The objects Zhang Fo Ye deposited underwater disappeared.

556
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,540
If we find them,

557
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,100
we will be able to take all the credit.

558
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:21,980
Are you onboard?

559
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,260
Yes!

560
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,380
Are you onboard?

561
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,220
Fine.

562
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,460
Stop whining.

563
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,940
Since we're already here,

564
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,580
why not try our luck?

565
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,220
It's been a long time.

566
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,580
Why haven't them come up yet?

567
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,020
Where are the three guys diving in there earlier?

568
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:45,620
I tell you what,

569
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,100
they've been down there in the water for so long.

570
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,300
They must have gotten something.

571
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,820
Sir! Something happened to them.
