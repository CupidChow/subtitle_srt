00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:37,340
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,200
Episode 8

4
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,270
I'll follow your advice.

5
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,070
I want to read the first half.

6
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,990
What's going on with that girl at the hair salon

7
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,950
you just mentioned?

8
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,950
Was she

9
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,950
Ye Piaopiao?

10
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,710
Yes, that's her

11
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,750
This woman had good antique cleaning skills.

12
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,550
But she secretly targeted at me.

13
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,110
A while ago she tried to steal from me

14
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,510
but was caught by me.

15
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,830
She ran and my men chased after her.

16
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,670
I didn't expect that

17
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,750
when she escaped in a hurry to an intersection,

18
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,990
she was hit by a car

19
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,870
and fell on the ground.

20
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,910
Her body is

21
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,350
still in a freezer in the morgue.

22
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,150
I didn't tell you guys before

23
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,110
because I'm afraid you couldn't take the blow.

24
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,350
I've finished.

25
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,070
Come here.

26
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,350
Have you remembered everything?

27
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,430
Yes.

28
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,350
Wu Xie.

29
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,740
Your name will be written in the Wu family's history.

30
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:48,830
Let's go.

31
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,410
<i>Fatty</i>

32
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,110
<i>Fatty</i>

33
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,400
<i>Fatty</i>

34
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,950
Hello?

35
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,390
Should we go to have hot pot

36
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,790
to celebrate this victory?

37
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,750
Hello, Fatty.

38
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,900
Can she remember all the content?

39
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,030
Earth is the mother of air.

40
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,150
Earth is the reason air was born.

41
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,910
Air is the

42
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,750
mother of water.

43
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,990
Air is the reason water was born.

44
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,110
So when you bury something in a dry environment,

45
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,430
you should bury it deep.

46
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,230
This seems to be nothing but nonsense.

47
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,070
Be patient.

48
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,790
The Book of Changes said that the earth is immersed in air

49
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,790
and everything is born according to them.

50
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,030
If you want to know the fengshui of a mountain, look at its ridge.

51
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,710
Those that are winding from east to west have good fengshui.

52
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,630
The good ones will look like a man of dignity sitting

53
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,190
and waiting for others to pay him respect.

54
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,510
What the hell is this?

55
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,430
Look at the meaningless doodles.

56
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,310
Boss.

57
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,030
Maybe we were fooled by Wu Xie.

58
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,550
You know nothing.

59
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,990
This is called Dragon Cypher Map.

60
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,430
It's an encrypted map generated by text.

61
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,470
According to a certain code book,

62
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,110
finally the encrypted text can be restored into a picture.

63
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,510
Just wait and see.

64
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,950
Earth is the mother of air.

65
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,790
Earth is…

66
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,310
The water runs in wind.

67
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,990
If you deliberately try to find a quiet place and

68
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,990
just choose a random mountain,

69
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,630
you'll only find yourself a bad place for graveyard.

70
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,750
Wu Xie tricked me!

71
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,270
He just wanted to learn it the hard way!

72
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,190
I'm going to kill him!

73
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,350
I wanted to cut him some slack, but he didn't appreciate it.

74
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,110
He'll never see his Uncle Erbai for the last time.

75
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,550
Boss, we've been a bit out of line recently.

76
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,459
Maybe we should stay low for a while.

77
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,550
Stay low my ass!

78
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,190
Find someone to encircle Hao's Antique Shop.

79
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,310
Don't let Wu Xie run away.

80
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,270
Did you hear me?

81
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,270
Wu Xie!

82
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,030
I swear on my family name

83
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,350
that I'm going to kill you!

84
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,750
To what do I owe the pleasure of tax bureau officers' visit today?

85
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,390
I am a law-abiding citizen.

86
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,550
I've never dodged paying my taxes.

87
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,830
Someone reported that you used cash for a large transaction and

88
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,710
the transaction amount exceeded 10 million yuan.

89
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,710
Ten million yuan?

90
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,510
In our antique industry,

91
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,550
transaction in cash is common.

92
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,590
And this is not a transaction really.

93
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,190
This is more like an exchange of things between individuals.

94
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,580
But I heard that

95
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,590
you spent 10 million yuan to buy a notebook.

96
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,910
This is obviously a money laundering behavior.

97
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,510
Please go to the tax bureau with us to make a statement.

98
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,150
My notebook…

99
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,230
Don't worry.

100
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,590
This is not declaring you guilty of charge.

101
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,190
But since someone reported you,

102
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,510
it's our duty to bring you in for inquiry.

103
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,030
This is Wu Xie's revenge on us.

104
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,540
He wants to buy some time.

105
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,190
Do as I told you earlier.

106
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,750
No problem, I will go back with you

107
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,820
to cooperate with your investigation.

108
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,510
Please go with us.

109
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,550
Mom!

110
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,630
Mom!

111
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,710
Mom, wake up.

112
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,310
Mom!

113
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,510
Mom…

114
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,790
Mom, wake up.

115
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,270
Wake up.

116
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,790
Mom.

117
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,700
Mom.

118
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,630
Most of Xue's income

119
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,660
came from selling fake antiques.

120
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,110
He has a complete forgery pipeline behind him.

121
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,230
You have worked with him for so long.

122
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,430
You must also have got involved somehow.

123
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,660
If it weren't for you to push me too hard,

124
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,230
I wouldn't have cut off your source of income.

125
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,150
I think this is karma.

126
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,190
You can't afford to mess up with

127
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,830
dying people like me.

128
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,950
You should understand that

129
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,590
Xue won't plead guilty.

130
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,470
But the tax bureau will

131
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,070
investigate him for his tax issues.

132
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,590
At least within six months

133
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,030
he won't be able to create any benefits for you.

134
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,150
You guys once

135
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,150
turned on him at the auction.

136
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,470
So he will try all kinds of ways

137
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,030
to hurt you.

138
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,030
Your so-called family properties

139
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,180
will be his in the end.

140
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,190
This is a copy of the Grave Robbery Notes.

141
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,590
I'm going to give it to you now.

142
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,310
Just tip the police off about what Xue did.

143
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,830
He won't be able to get out of jail for a lifetime.

144
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,270
After he goes in there,

145
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,830
how you want to use this book is your own business.

146
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,790
But if Xue comes out from prison,

147
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,790
and he knows that you got this book,

148
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,190
he will find a way to kill you.

149
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,470
So

150
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,550
you have to find a way

151
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,580
to keep him behind bars forever.

152
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,350
Do you understand?

153
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,590
It's okay.

154
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,710
If you don't want to accept this copy,

155
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,830
among your people

156
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,270
there will be someone more courageous.

157
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,310
Why did you choose me?

158
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,390
My intuition.

159
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,510
Fatty.

160
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,710
Xue wants to do something against you.

161
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,110
He hasn't suspected me yet.

162
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,670
I will stay by his side to

163
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,630
figure out his plan.

164
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:53,430
<i>Quanting District Police Station</i>

165
00:13:53,430 --> 00:14:00,300
<i>Quanting Police</i>

166
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,270
I used to think that

167
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,150
death isn't scary at all.

168
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,270
But how am I

169
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,180
so sad because of death this time?

170
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,990
Piaopiao

171
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,830
stayed to work for Xue for me.

172
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,310
She died because she wanted to warn me.

173
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,870
She said that she wanted to try to live a new life with me.

174
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,110
I just don't understand.

175
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,190
I wanted to help her but

176
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,710
I got her killed.

177
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,590
I should have listened to you.

178
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,470
I shouldn't have brought her into this industry, right?

179
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,510
Then she would still be alive now.

180
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,190
Fatty.

181
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,910
You didn't do anything wrong.

182
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,750
Because they met you,

183
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,110
because of your help,

184
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,910
Piaopiao and Mei

185
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,070
rekindled their hope for life.

186
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,870
It's just that

187
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,940
not all the things

188
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,670
will go our way.

189
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,950
Sometimes…

190
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,310
Sometimes you have to face

191
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,900
the fact that

192
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,630
life doesn't always go our way.

193
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,190
This may be the so-called destiny.

194
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,950
Should we resign ourselves to destiny or not?

195
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:34,300
God.

196
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,150
Naive.

197
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,590
Can Thunder City really

198
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,270
reverse all the past regrets?

199
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,710
Fatty.

200
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,710
You are right.

201
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,270
I have to try again.

202
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,350
Let's try to live a new life together.

203
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,970
<i>Piaopiao's Hair Salon</i>

204
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,950
Wu Erbai's team has an accident.

205
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,950
The entrance of Thunder City is at Tianlin Hotel.

206
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,080
<i>Jiang Zisuan</i>

207
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,390
Hello.

208
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,310
The vegetable is quite fresh.

209
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,790
Yes.

210
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,230
That's all I need.

211
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,070
He's back.

212
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,270
He's back.

213
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,420
Come on. Take a look.

214
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,710
You…Why are you back?

215
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,070
Have you found a new Job?

216
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,870
How much longer will

217
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,310
Warehouse 11 suspend business?

218
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,990
You

219
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,750
can't find a job in a whole week.

220
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,750
Do you think

221
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,910
you don't need money to provide this family?

222
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,350
Tell me, what should we do?

223
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,710
I will figure something out.

224
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,630
Figure something out?

225
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,870
You say this every time.

226
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,110
Can we…

227
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,150
What else do you want to say?

228
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,110
I have been busy with work before.

229
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,830
This time I can stay at home to keep you company.

230
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,350
Keep me company?

231
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,910
With what?

232
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,710
We don't have any food now.

233
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,470
Do you want me to starve with you

234
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,710
doing nothing but staring at the ceiling every day?

235
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,270
Didn't we still have some savings?

236
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,830
That's all the money we have.

237
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,350
Do you want to sit idle and depend on your little savings?

238
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,430
I don't expect my man to be some rich guy.

239
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,910
But you can't expect me to support you.

240
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,790
Don't you think this is shameful?

241
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,460
Just go out there and think about what you can get home as our dinner,

242
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,030
alright?

243
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,070
Come back when you settle the dinner tonight.

244
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,950
Your husband is really clingy.

245
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,070
It was so hard to let him go.

246
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,750
Come on now, baby.

247
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,350
Keep your voice down!

248
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,710
He has very quick ears.

249
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,140
Do you want to make some extra money?

250
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,420
Come to move some more bricks.

251
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,430
Okay.

252
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,150
Take this cart.

253
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,870
There is another cart here.

254
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,550
Let's go.

255
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,430
I happen to need money today.

256
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,030
Yes.

257
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,230
Paycheck time!

258
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,550
-Be careful.
 -I don't think

259
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,780
this is the right amount.

260
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,590
Don't you guys pay by piece here?

261
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,590
This is not enough.

262
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,150
Alright.

263
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,870
Give it to me.

264
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,790
Okay, come on.

265
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,910
You only moved a little bit more than others.

266
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,150
This is your salary.

267
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,470
If you are not happy with it,

268
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,910
go to move some more bricks.

269
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,820
But count them up clearly this time.

270
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,190
Don't blame me for giving you less than you think you deserve.

271
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:34,900
What?

272
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,590
You want me to give you all the money?

273
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,270
Let me tell you,

274
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,430
I'll call the police if you want to rob me.

275
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,870
Bro, hurry up.

276
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,310
It's good enough that they actually pay us.

277
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,230
Sir.

278
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,830
Who does he think he is?

279
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,310
He deserves to move bricks for a lifetime.

280
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,790
Sixty eight.

281
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,710
Manager Bai?

282
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,950
Want to earn extra money?

283
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,350
Come on.

284
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,630
We've got all the equipment we need.

285
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,510
Now we just need a van full of desperadoes.

286
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,430
No. You still need one more person.

287
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,310
If I don't go with you,

288
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,310
he will die

289
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,830
halfway through on the journey.

290
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,750
You are willing to go with us?

291
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,700
I am a doctor.

292
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,150
Since I undertook this patient,

293
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,630
I will be responsible for his treatment to the end.

294
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,310
Just say it.

295
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,950
What is your purpose?

296
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,710
We don't have much money.

297
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,500
Do you want to hear the truth?

298
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,550
Say it.

299
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,270
I want to be there when you die.

300
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,510
As you wish.

301
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,150
Let's go!

302
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,150
You've just got yourself in trouble.

303
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,990
Get in the car.

304
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,350
Huo Daofu.

305
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,750
What are you reading?

306
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,310
I asked my tutor in Germany.

307
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,830
He gave me some documents.

308
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,670
So is there any new

309
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,470
treatment that we can give it a try?

310
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,550
No.

311
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,630
The doctor read these things in front of his patient

312
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,990
just to give him a little comfort.

313
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,180
You may not know that

314
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,630
before one's death

315
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,430
the strongest feeling for the patient is loneliness.

316
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,910
Even if there are many people around him,

317
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,790
they can't understand the mood of a dying person.

318
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,310
The only way to relieve this loneliness

319
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,990
is to let him know that

320
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,390
there are still people working hard to save him.

321
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,630
You come along just to see me suffer, right?

322
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,670
I have never seen your expression of suffering yet.

323
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,590
I'm waiting for it.

324
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,790
Don't you let me down.

325
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,950
Are you really a doctor?

326
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,870
Will it kill you

327
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,070
to say something auspicious?

328
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,550
I will kill you to keep Naive company. Just try me!

329
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,110
Okay.

330
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,430
Look at your friend.

331
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,470
He can live a long life.

332
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,390
Then he will make other new friends.

333
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,070
After you die,

334
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,830
at the beginning he will visit your grave very often.

335
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,950
Then he'll go once a year.

336
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,230
After that

337
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,830
he'll think of you every year on the Tomb Sweeping Festival.

338
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,270
Then he'll promise to himself that

339
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,630
he'll go visit you next year.

340
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,550
Time can let every relationship fade away.

341
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,550
What are you talking about?

342
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,470
You're so cynical!

343
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,190
Shut up if you don't know what to say.

344
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,190
Let me tell you,

345
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,110
if Naive is really dead,

346
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,590
I'll put his urn on my nightstand.

347
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,110
Every day I'll…

348
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,750
What are you talking about?

349
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,710
Knock on wood.

350
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,470
Why?

351
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:17,870
Bah.

352
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,710
Bah, bah, bah.

353
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,790
I'll hit you three times then.

354
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,430
Naive.

355
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,030
As long as you don't give up,

356
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,950
none of us will ever give up on you.

357
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,870
I'll always be by your side.

358
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,830
I'll just stay with you all the way.

359
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,990
There must be a way.

360
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,190
Don't worry.

361
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,990
If this bastard can't cure you,

362
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,990
I will kill him and

363
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,270
dip a steamed bun in his blood to offer

364
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,900
in front of your grave as

365
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,630
offerings.

366
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:50,870
How about it?

367
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,300
Is there any news from Kantian?

368
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:52,830
No.

369
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,820
This doesn't seem right.

370
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,710
He disappeared after sending us a location.

371
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,870
Could it be something happened during the rescue?

372
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,430
The location Kanjian sent me is

373
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,590
on a mountain.

374
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,550
It's a mountain called Gouzinao or something like that.

375
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,990
It's said that

376
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,590
the forest coverage rate of this mountain is over 80%.

377
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,190
So it's normal that he has a poor reception.

378
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,350
Let's wait.

379
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,590
There's nothing else we can do now.

380
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,470
There is enemy's spy in Uncle Erbai's team.

381
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,830
So anything can happen.

382
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,590
We can only

383
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,030
know what is really going on when we get there.

384
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,710
You never know. Maybe this bastard is also a spy.

385
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,110
Let's ditch him halfway.

386
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,110
He always bugs me.

387
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,670
Fatty, be patient.

388
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,590
Ahead of us is dense mountain forest.

389
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,670
It's still one kilometer away from the location Wu Xie gave us.

390
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,390
I'd suggest everyone walk.

391
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,150
Driving will expose our whereabouts easily.

392
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,700
Wu Xie can't walk.

393
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,310
The mist stimulates his respiratory system.

394
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,750
If he must do everything himself,

395
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,190
what are you guys here for?

396
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,470
If I were Mr. Wu Erbai,

397
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,190
I would set my command post in that place.

398
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,150
You see,

399
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,590
you can get a bird's eye view

400
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,510
with the best view from there.

401
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,150
Okay.

402
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,150
Then let's…

403
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,430
For the sake of safety,

404
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,670
let's split up into two teams

405
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,870
and scout out the lie of the land.

406
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,030
You and this big-ear guy

407
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,980
will go there.

408
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,870
The two of us will be another team.

409
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,910
Bai, you stay

410
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:25,950
to take care of Wu Xie.

411
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:26,700
Okay.

412
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,870
Well arranged!

413
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,950
When we enter the forest, I will serve you as you like.

414
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,150
Let's set off.

415
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,150
Who gave you the right to give the word?

416
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,550
You are also afraid something might happen to me, right?

417
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,870
If something happens to me,

418
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,550
who will save your friend's life?

419
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,230
You are so awesome.

420
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,790
How can I possibly kill you?

421
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,590
But even if I cripple you,

422
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,150
you still have to save my friend's life.

423
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,070
Mr. Third Junior, you're awake.

424
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:11,830
Do you want to drink some water?

425
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,390
Where are they?

426
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,900
We have arrived at

427
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,150
the position Kanjian sent you.

428
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,110
But the car can't get in.

429
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,070
So everyone walked in to scout out the place.

430
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,670
Why didn't these bastards call me?

431
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,990
Kanjian hasn't returned your WeChat message yet?

432
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,990
How can you peek at my phone screen?

433
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,220
I accidentally saw it at a glance.

434
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,100
Someone once camped here.

435
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,910
But now there is no one.

436
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,950
I have heard around.

437
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,630
There is not a single living thing nearby.

438
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:23,750
Wait a minute.

439
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,310
There's some movement.

440
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,230
Go take a look.

441
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,750
Go down there.

442
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:03,870
Who is it? Jiale?

443
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,390
What happened?

444
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,310
We heard something.

445
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,350
We came over and see an exposed hole

446
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,510
without any camouflage.

447
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,630
An exposed hole?

448
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,310
We're now going in to take a look.

449
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,670
Let's go.

450
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:56,019
What is this?

451
00:34:58,499 --> 00:34:59,830
This is the Wu family's token.

452
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,470
This is a confined space.

453
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,830
There is no air movement, so I think

454
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,710
there is no other entrance.

455
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,950
This seems to be a gas bomb.

456
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,310
This is a trap!

457
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,180
Let's get out of here!

458
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,550
The poisonous gas has spread out!

459
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,030
What are you doing?

460
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,550
I want to seal the entrance.

461
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,190
You can't go.

462
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,230
That trap must be designed just to kill you.

463
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,750
I must go now.

464
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,470
Once the poisonous gas leaks,

465
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,830
all the people in a radius of a few kilometers

466
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,870
will be killed!

467
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,190
But you can't go!

468
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:25,870
You cannot go!

469
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,460
You…

470
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,870
Haotian is right.

471
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,470
Keep an eye on him. Don't let him go.

472
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:28,910
You…Fatty!

473
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,110
You can't go.

474
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,790
If you still want to save Kylin and your uncle,

475
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,870
don't go there.

476
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,630
You really can't go!

477
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,590
I got it!

478
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,430
Huo Daofu.

479
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,190
This is a trap.

480
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,390
This is a trap!

481
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,500
What's going on?

482
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,430
Kanjian's phone

483
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,630
is not in his hands.

484
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,630
Don't worry.

485
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,110
The entrance is sealed.

486
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,670
I'm the Prince of Gatekeeping.

487
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,350
The poisonous gas can't come out.

488
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,110
How did it go?

489
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,190
That's mustard gas.

490
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,310
There is no specific treatment for it so far.

491
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,150
But luckily the two of them got out fast.

492
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,390
Their wounds have been treated.

493
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,670
Nothing serious.

494
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,230
Those gas bombs

495
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,190
should be there from the beginning.

496
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,030
Someone used them to make a trap.

497
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,150
That place looks like a smelting workshop.

498
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,870
There are so many bronze fragments in it.

499
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,630
According to Li Jiale's description,

500
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,350
in the smelting workshop

501
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,790
there was my Uncle Erbai's token.

502
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,430
So at least we can be sure that

503
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,510
Uncle Erbai and his people did come here.

504
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,230
Could he be the one who designed the trap

505
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,990
to deal with people following him?

506
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,190
This trap must be designed to aim at me.

507
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,590
It must be the person who has Kanjian's phone.

508
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,620
After Uncle Erbai's team left,

509
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,940
this person secretly set up the trap.

510
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,670
After that

511
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,140
he or she sent me this location

512
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,510
to lure me here.

513
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,780
Mr. Third Junior.

514
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,990
What should we do now?

515
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,470
Where are we heading now?

516
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,830
That is Tianlin Hotel.

517
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,190
It is said that it was just a mound before.

518
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,790
Later, after some Chinese people came to settle down here,

519
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,470
they did some modifications to it

520
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,510
and later it became

521
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,030
quite a distinctive homestay in this area.

522
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,630
And it's also the biggest hotel around here.

523
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,990
We checked before.

524
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,470
There are room booking records

525
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,420
of your uncle Erbai and his people in that hotel.

526
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,590
Book some rooms.

527
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,510
We will stay there tonight.

528
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,260
Okay.

529
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:35,910
Li Jiale.

530
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,940
Go there, and be on guard.

531
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,350
No problem.

532
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,950
That should be the direction of Tianlin Hotel.

533
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,390
Bai.

534
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:48,670
Bring Jia Kezi with you

535
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,230
to observe the surroundings.

536
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,230
Okay.

537
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,390
Let's go.

538
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:53,390
Be careful.

539
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,390
The air here is so good.

540
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,030
Consider it your recuperation.

541
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,030
Have some of these.

542
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,230
Yes.

543
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,070
Listen.

544
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,310
Do you hear anything unusual?

545
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,430
Something is wrong.
