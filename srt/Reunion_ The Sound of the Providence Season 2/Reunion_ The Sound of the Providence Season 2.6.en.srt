Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,320
Episode 6

4
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:57,000
It seems your boyfriend

5
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,800
does love you very much.

6
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,920
I've told you

7
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,700
that I can't help you.

8
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,020
You turned me down when I invited you to snake soup last time

9
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,370
and it was your fault.

10
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,880
You might not know it

11
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,329
but no one dares

12
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,970
to turn me down.

13
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,680
Feed it to her.

14
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,440
Open your mouth.

15
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,429
OK. OK.

16
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,790
That's enough.

17
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,030
That's enough.

18
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,730
So you don't want to do me this little favor.

19
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,510
I want to find him more than you do!

20
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,360
Neither of us knows where he is,

21
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,120
but both of us want to find him.

22
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,200
Make a video

23
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,960
and send it to him,

24
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,920
telling him that you really have to see him right now.

25
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,930
If he has a feeling for you,

26
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,280
he will show up right away

27
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,760
and I'll ask him about it.

28
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,560
What a fool you are!

29
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,540
You know nothing about him.

30
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,280
I'm done with the nice talking.

31
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,660
It seems

32
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,450
I have to try something else.

33
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,040
No! No!

34
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,460
This is the mysterious gift I've prepared for you.

35
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,330
It has nothing to do with Tony!

36
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,220
I'm begging you! Let him go!

37
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,380
It has nothing to do with Tony!

38
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,460
You'll record whatever I tell you.

39
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,010
The second round

40
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:10,970
starts now!

41
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,730
I'll do it.

42
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,310
I'll do it.

43
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,450
You should have agreed earlier.

44
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,600
What a bummer!

45
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,450
You know,

46
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,670
the sooner you make Black Glasses

47
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,340
come here,

48
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,120
the better it is for Tony.

49
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,380
If he comes too late,

50
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,850
I can't ensure that Tony dies a full-body death.

51
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,010
No. Raise your head.

52
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,960
Why are you crying?

53
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,060
You look awful.

54
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,470
Wipe her tears.

55
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:48,920
OK.

56
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,550
OK.

57
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,060
Start it!

58
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,520
With my years of experience,

59
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,660
I knew we would end up like this.

60
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,240
Uncle Erbai is so unreliable.

61
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,880
He prepared diving suits, parachutes

62
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,670
and even sports cameras for us,

63
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,260
but we don't have

64
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,630
the most important fried rice.

65
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,530
This is what we have right now.

66
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,280
It's too tough to chew.

67
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,360
I've sent the message to Wu Xie

68
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,270
and he will take care of it.

69
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,340
Can he?

70
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,450
I don't think so.

71
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,970
Now no one can help us.

72
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,370
Dummy,

73
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,270
you've lived for so long.

74
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,200
Have you ever thought about killing yourself?

75
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,640
You're so calm, Mr. Zhang.

76
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,530
Dummy,

77
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,070
have you checked here?

78
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,680
It's a cavity behind

79
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,720
and this position connects to the weakest part of the cavity.

80
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,190
It can be knocked open, but it's full of water,

81
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,470
so it won't help.

82
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,450
It seems

83
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,010
we really have to stay here for a while.

84
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,860
In a few days,

85
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,720
only after the tide passes, can we pass.

86
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,640
This is good.

87
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,020
There's nothing to eat and nothing to do.

88
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,280
I'm going back to sleep.

89
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,560
<i>Day 1 17:00:11 Golden Age</i>

90
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,670
Mr. Xue's daughter is getting married

91
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,080
and he has taken over Wu family's territory.

92
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,590
What double happiness!

93
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,040
In the future,

94
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,390
we need to rely on Mr. Xue.

95
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,140
Exactly.

96
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,110
What's wrong with your car?

97
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,430
Sorry. I'm a new driver.

98
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,750
Back off. Back off.

99
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,200
OK.

100
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,709
Only those with invitations can get in.

101
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,810
Keep an eye on it.

102
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,790
Don't let Wu Xie and his men inside.

103
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,890
Enjoy yourselves!

104
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,940
Enjoy yourselves!

105
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,060
So?

106
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,410
Isn't this Mr. Third Junior?

107
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,950
What are you two doing here?

108
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,660
Mr. Xue's daughter is getting married today,

109
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,670
so we came to congratulate him.

110
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,480
I don't think Mr. Xue invited you.

111
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,860
Scram right now if you're smart.

112
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,230
I don't care

113
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,680
if Mr. Xue invited me or not,

114
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,260
but I have to

115
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,540
come to congratulate him.

116
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,870
Stop your nonsense.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,050
I don't have time for this. Now scram!

118
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,990
You've taken away our jobs,

119
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,170
so how are we going to make a living?

120
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,370
Please enjoy yourselves

121
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,650
and I'll go and welcome the guests.

122
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,960
I'm starving and I can't stand it!

123
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,600
I will have my fill here today!

124
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,390
On this big day,

125
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,150
can't you behave yourself?

126
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,310
Mr. Xue,

127
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,240
you look so handsome today!

128
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,620
Who's the groom today?

129
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,370
The red envelopes.

130
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,800
We came here

131
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,950
to congratulate you.

132
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,530
Thank you, Fatty.

133
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,070
Take them.

134
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,750
I forgot to put money in them because I left in a hurry.

135
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,060
How could you forget that?

136
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,440
I spent the money on the red envelopes.

137
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,620
How much are they?

138
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,850
One yuan for two.

139
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,430
One yuan?

140
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,010
Why did you buy such expensive red envelopes?

141
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,000
How much did you plan to put in them?

142
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,580
One billion.

143
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,480
OK.

144
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,810
Put it down for Fatty.

145
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,260
Come, put it down.

146
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,280
One billion hell money.

147
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,990
You should keep the hell money for yourself.

148
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,610
Let's spend it together.

149
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,850
I didn't invite you for the wedding,

150
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,310
because I thought you were recovering at home.

151
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,350
I'm sorry for what happened to Mr. Second.

152
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,550
You'll have a funeral and I don't think you want one more.

153
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,340
Stop talking about funerals.

154
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,320
Your daughter is getting married today,

155
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,250
so let's not talk about those sad things.

156
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,229
Even if I'm dying,

157
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,990
I will wait until your daughter's wedding

158
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,580
is completed, OK?

159
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,780
It seems you're really ill,

160
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,290
but you can still make jokes.

161
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,260
OK.

162
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,240
Since you're here, please come inside.

163
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,900
OK. Let's go.

164
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,340
This...

165
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,470
Mr. Fifth, do you really let them stay here?

166
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,190
Let them stay

167
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,900
and I'll see what they can do.

168
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,720
Come. Here's to you.

169
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:05,920
This way, please.

170
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,060
This way, please.

171
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,060
Come.

172
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,160
Come.

173
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,530
OK.

174
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,730
Come. Cheers.

175
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,420
Come. Come.

176
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,390
Get us another bottle, please.

177
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,280
Come, fill it up.

178
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,030
Come. Let's drink it. Let's drink it.

179
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,050
They just ignore us.

180
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,400
Reddy was right about it.

181
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,470
It has been just two days.

182
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,840
Look at them.

183
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,800
They have

184
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,910
betrayed us.

185
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,800
So shameless

186
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,820
and so disgusting.

187
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,260
It's all for money.

188
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,460
Those fence-sitters

189
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,220
only take side with the winners.

190
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,080
Now, let's

191
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,830
Now, let's

192
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,330
welcome Mr. Fifth to give us a speech

193
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,710
with warm applause.

194
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,120
Good!

195
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,660
Good!

196
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,340
Today, my daughter is getting married.

197
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,430
You all came from afar

198
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,810
and I'm grateful.

199
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,260
You're welcome.

200
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,960
I hope you enjoy it today.

201
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,260
Congratulations!

202
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,860
Congratulations on your wedding, Mr. Xue Wu.

203
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,830
I hope you'll be in love forever

204
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,080
and have a baby soon.

205
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,920
I'm sorry that I'm drunk.

206
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,830
You just like making jokes.

207
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,170
I'm also very excited now.

208
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,570
And I'd like to

209
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,200
say something to you kids.

210
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,710
Rich or poor,

211
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,350
cherish each other.

212
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,070
You don't have much time left.

213
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,370
How could you be poor?

214
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,260
Others might now know it, but I do.

215
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,680
You're rich!

216
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,300
Let me introduce myself.

217
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,970
I'm the ex-boyfriend of Xue Wu's daughter.

218
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,770
I'm very lucky

219
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,650
that I'm not the groom today.

220
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,920
They're rich. His daughter told me about it,

221
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,770
because they take the money from others.

222
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,120
I'm sorry that I'm drunk.

223
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,100
Fatty,

224
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,370
it's a big day for Mr. Fifth.

225
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,210
I don't think

226
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,440
it's appropriate for you to do this.

227
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,290
What do you think you are?

228
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,360
I'm happy.

229
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,240
Can't I be happy on this big day?

230
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:26,910
You four-eyes!

231
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,170
Come. Let's drink it.

232
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,510
So? Are you annoyed?

233
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,440
How could you be annoyed on this big day?

234
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,510
You don't want to drink it? What's wrong with you?

235
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,650
Come.

236
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,930
Guys, don't mind it.

237
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,830
Fatty just likes making jokes.

238
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,200
I think Fatty is so starving

239
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,000
that he's talking nonsense.

240
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:46,940
OK.

241
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,530
Please enjoy yourselves

242
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,850
and there will be a show later.

243
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,160
Great! Great!

244
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,800
Great! Great! Great!

245
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,720
Fatty.

246
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,400
What's up?

247
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,380
Who is that man with a pipe in his mouth?

248
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,870
His surname is Liu

249
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,920
and he's a curator

250
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,160
of a small private museum

251
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,910
and he does business.

252
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,680
Our boss invited Mr. Third Junior

253
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,130
to the private room

254
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,680
to talk about something.

255
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,300
Let's go.

256
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,430
Our boss invited Mr. Third Junior only.

257
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,450
None of your business, Fatty.

258
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,650
How could you be so rude?

259
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,520
Come on.

260
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,370
I'll take a look and I'll be back soon.

261
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:37,890
OK.

262
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,650
Let's go.

263
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,020
Come in.

264
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,350
Sir, he's here.

265
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,320
Mr. Third Junior,

266
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,740
come and have a seat.

267
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,410
Mr. Xue,

268
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,100
we're alone here,

269
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,490
so let's be honest with each other

270
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,310
and don't waste our time.

271
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,410
Say it.

272
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,230
As soon as my second uncle had an accident,

273
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,810
you took our territory

274
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,400
and you cut off all my sources of income

275
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,250
in the name of saving my second uncle.

276
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,120
You asked that bastard to smash my shop

277
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,740
and planted stolen goods on me,

278
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,500
so what do you want to do?

279
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,370
You want to destroy me?

280
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,440
So you can take all the property of my family?

281
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,000
Right?

282
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,030
There's something wrong with it.

283
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,270
You shouldn't have done it so quickly.

284
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,790
Did you know it in advance or something?

285
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,210
Who told you?

286
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,920
Well,

287
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,650
I could be

288
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,140
anything

289
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,380
but forgiving.

290
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,430
You destroyed the shop that I just bought before.

291
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,730
If I didn't get back on you,

292
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,600
I would be restless all the time.

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,880
What should I do?

294
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,630
I did burn it down.

295
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,310
Mr. Xue,

296
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,680
I'm really at the end of my resources.

297
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,350
Fine,

298
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,390
you won.

299
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,370
I can't do anything with you.

300
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,030
Today I came here

301
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,920
for two things.

302
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,190
One is

303
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,650
to congratulate you on your daughter's marriage

304
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:34,970
and the other is

305
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,600
to borrow RMB 300,000 from you

306
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,770
to help my second uncle.

307
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,280
You want me to lend you RMB 300,000

308
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,910
to help your second uncle?

309
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:43,690
Yes.

310
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,820
It was you who made him like this.

311
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,280
It has nothing to do with me!

312
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,340
Don't be ridiculous.

313
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,520
Besides,

314
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,810
I don't want him to come back.

315
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,530
If he comes back, where should I be?

316
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,330
You can be wherever you want.

317
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,440
Mr. Third Junior, are you really insane?

318
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,380
How did you come up with such an idea?

319
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,880
What do you mean?

320
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,490
Will you lend it to me or not?

321
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,070
Listen up.

322
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,380
I've spent a lot on my daughter's wedding

323
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,700
and I have no money now.

324
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,750
So?

325
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,850
Do you want me to take a speaker

326
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,600
and tell everyone out there about it?

327
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,240
Well, Wu Xie,

328
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,170
did you come here to amuse me?

329
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,920
Yes, I am.

330
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,470
Or what else do you think I came here for?

331
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,010
Calm down.

332
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,120
Here I am now.

333
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,110
Will you give me the money?

334
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,360
I will die here if you don't give me the money.

335
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,840
So many people out there

336
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,210
saw me come in here by myself.

337
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,980
If I die here,

338
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,240
what will they think?

339
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,510
The heir of the Wu family

340
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,840
die in your place.

341
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,660
How are you going to explain it?

342
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:57,950
Besides,

343
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,840
I've saved the materials

344
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,190
of you faking commodities and selling them.

345
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,470
If anything bad happens to me,

346
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,210
someone will release these materials

347
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,580
and every partner will have one copy.

348
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,460
Then how are you going to stay in this industry?

349
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,970
Actually it's very simple.

350
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,830
RMB 300,000, right?

351
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,410
Give me RMB 300,000

352
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,390
and it's over.

353
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,670
Mr. Third Junior, I say,

354
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,140
how did you fall down to this?

355
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,990
You're being a jerk.

356
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,900
Fine.

357
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,610
I'll give you RMB 300,000,

358
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,050
but I bet you can't live to see your second uncle.

359
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,360
Fine.

360
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,230
I will write you a receipt.

361
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,040
Got the money?

362
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:26,060
Did you suffer?

363
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,240
Just a little.

364
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,360
I really want to see that.

365
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,480
Thank you all for coming to my daughter's wedding today

366
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,440
and you're my honored guests and true friends.

367
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,930
All of you have helped me

368
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,400
become what I am today.

369
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:43,880
Well said!

370
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,330
Well said! Well said!

371
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,350
Well said! Well said!

372
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:46,920
Well said!

373
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,930
Well said! Well said!

374
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,040
I'm from a poor background.

375
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,380
You've helped and supported me

376
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,060
and I won't forget it.

377
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,300
I've always wanted to be successful.

378
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,370
And I know that success won't fall from the sky.

379
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,890
It has to be earned.

380
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,330
I took over the Wu family's property several days ago

381
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,160
and of course

382
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,700
I will try my best to save Mr. Second.

383
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,050
When one's poor, he takes care of only himself,

384
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,930
but when one's rich, he should take care of everyone.

385
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,970
In the future, I will try my best

386
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,360
to take care of anyone in need.

387
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,880
Thank you all!

388
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,510
Well said! What a generous man!

389
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,100
Well said! What a generous man!

390
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,710
Well said! Well said!

391
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,410
Mr. Third Junior came

392
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,550
to my daughter's wedding today,

393
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,840
and I'm really happy about it.

394
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,920
Everyone in our circle

395
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,210
has been taken care of by the Wu family more or less.

396
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,620
As the host today,

397
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,340
I think we should propose a toast

398
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,190
to Mr. Third Junior. What do you say?

399
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,340
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

400
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,690
Yeah! Come!

401
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,600
Here's to Mr. Third Junior!

402
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,400
Come. Mr. Third Junior.

403
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,730
Let me.

404
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,380
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

405
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,530
Thank you, Mr. Third Junior.

406
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,270
Good! Good!

407
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,550
Several days ago, one of my employees told me

408
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,500
that Hao's Antique Shop closed down

409
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,570
due to poor management.

410
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,370
As you know,

411
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,380
I should have

412
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,300
taken care of it for him,

413
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,400
but I didn't expect

414
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,480
that Mr. Third Junior

415
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,270
doesn't even know how to do business.

416
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,200
Well, this...

417
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,390
Really?

418
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,460
After knowing it,

419
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,590
I felt so disappointed.

420
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,060
How could you

421
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,010
open Hao's Antique Shop to imitate Wushanju?

422
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,660
You used Wushanju's connections

423
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,430
and Wushanju's old employees.

424
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,800
You brought shame on Wushanju

425
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,260
and Mr. Second.

426
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,810
Those people make a living on the Wu family.

427
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,620
Do you want to take the bread

428
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,500
out of their mouths?

429
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,700
Come to me if you need help!

430
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,990
Well,

431
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,130
he came to me

432
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,270
and told me that he's in need of money just now in the private room.

433
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,610
Mr. Third Junior, is it true?

434
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,550
Anyone could be in need these days, right?

435
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,110
I'm a loyal and generous man.

436
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,350
When Mr. Third Junior is in need,

437
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,250
I will definitely help him

438
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,190
without second thought!

439
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,990
Carry it over.

440
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,750
Hurry up.

441
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,510
Business is not good these days.

442
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,350
I went to the warehouse just now

443
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,730
and I only have these coins left.

444
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,250
But I have got enough money for Mr. Third Junior.

445
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,660
Coins are money too!

446
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,620
Only those who lend you money these days are your true friends.

447
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,930
Right, Mr. Third Junior?

448
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,560
Mr. Third Junior,

449
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,600
I've got all the money you want,

450
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,770
but my daughter's wedding is about to begin soon.

451
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,360
I've done the thing that you asked me to

452
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,610
and you shouldn't hold up my daughter's wedding.

453
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,370
What do you say?

454
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,640
How about this?

455
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,810
Go with the money now before the wedding begins.

456
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,390
To save his life is the most important.

457
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,540
You did it on purpose!

458
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,670
Hurry up.

459
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,250
You don't have much time left.

460
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:45,740
Naive,

461
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,170
let's not take the money.

462
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,740
I won't let this wedding start!

463
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,740
Fatty,

464
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,810
don't embarrass yourself.

465
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,570
Don't try

466
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,300
to be brave!

467
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,710
It's my daughter's wedding today.

468
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,540
I'll call the police if you make trouble again.

469
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,300
Fatty,

470
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,840
calm down.

471
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,940
Leave the rest to me.

472
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,740
Stand here and don't move.

473
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,210
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

474
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,220
You're welcome.

475
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,150
Here's the bride and the groom!

476
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,410
Someone is secretly filming.

477
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,130
Naive, are you alright?

478
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,020
What can you do

479
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,390
in your health condition?

480
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,410
Come, get on.

481
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:43,930
Hurry up.

482
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,480
You can do nothing

483
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,490
in your health condition. Just rest.

484
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,470
The money here isn't even enough for your medical bill.

485
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,670
You're being over-confident to fight him.

486
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,930
I was wondering

487
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,260
what he was going to do.

488
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,900
What he did is flawless.

489
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,460
While the priest climbs a post, the devil climbs ten.

490
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,220
We should just give it up.

491
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,730
It seems that Wu Xie's lungs are really failing.

492
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,500
<i>Haotianju</i>

493
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,740
You lost this time. What a bummer!

494
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,060
You're on trending news!

495
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:26,670
What trending news?

496
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,160
Look.

497
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,610
How did it go?

498
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,970
If a tiger went down to level land, he would be insulted by dogs.

499
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,140
It went well

500
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,340
and we were pathetic.

501
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,940
Xue Wu was

502
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,580
so despicable.

503
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,650
He did it on purpose.

504
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,410
He deliberately changed the money into coins and asked us to carry them away.

505
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,180
He just wanted to humiliate us.

506
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,270
Now he must have let down his guard

507
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,770
and thought that we're losing it.

508
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,080
Are you sure?

509
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:58,620
Let me sit for a while.

510
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,450
Don't sit on me.

511
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,980
Make some room for me.

512
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,180
I'm too tired to move now.

513
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:04,920
Make some room for me.

514
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,020
Come on.

515
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,690
Make some room.

516
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,540
Anyway,

517
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,740
we've got the money.

518
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:15,750
Fatty,

519
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,720
transfer the money to Red-capped Daffodil

520
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,220
as the first payment.

521
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,820
Life or death depends on tomorrow.

522
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:22,960
OK.

523
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,380
Haotian, did you hear it?

524
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,050
He asked you to transfer

525
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,150
the money to Red-capped Daffodil.

526
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,990
No, he asked you to do it.

527
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,370
Mr. Third Junior, he's slacking off again.

528
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,360
You...

529
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,820
This is too much.

530
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,230
You...

531
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,660
<i>Day 1 14:22:14</i>

532
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,310
Boss.

533
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,790
How is it going?

534
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,760
You were right.

535
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,880
The money has been transferred to the account of Red-capped Daffodil.

536
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,270
Wu Xie is really so desperate.

537
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,000
Boss,

538
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,270
there is something that I really don't understand.

539
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,680
You say, we've already

540
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,040
cornered Wu Xie.

541
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,870
But what is your plan?

542
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,200
What a crappy plan it would be if even you can understand it!

543
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,840
I took Wu Xie's deposit

544
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,750
and you smashed his antiques.

545
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,190
He has been driven into a corner

546
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,950
and he made a scene in my daughter's wedding,

547
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:37,790
right?

548
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,010
Now you've cheated him out of his last money.

549
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,210
If he wants to get money to save his uncle,

550
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,050
he has to use the only thing

551
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,590
left in his hands.

552
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,790
What is it?

553
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,570
It's the heirloom of the Wu family.

554
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,970
Grave Robbery Note.

555
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,220
Grave Robbery Note?

556
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,130
Grave Robbery Note

557
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,330
was written by Wu Xie's grandfather, Wu Laogou.

558
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,980
It records almost

559
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,430
all the great tombs in the legend.

560
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,420
In Wu Xie's hands,

561
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,660
it'll only be a waste.

562
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,360
This time,

563
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,560
I'm bound to take it.

564
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,060
Take care of

565
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,560
Red-capped Daffodil.

566
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,660
No worries.

567
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,730
You want to use me?

568
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,460
Let's see who's going to be used.

569
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,130
Grave Robbery Note...

570
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,420
Sit there.

571
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:16,950
Reddy,

572
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,860
I've transferred the money to you. Why don't you answer the phone?

573
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,510
Let's talk about it.

574
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,620
I don't think you'll run away with the money.

575
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,780
You're not that hard to find.

576
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,950
If you don't answer the phone,

577
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,450
I'll have to go to see you in person.

578
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,550
By then,

579
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,350
I might not be able to stay calm.

580
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,480
Reddy, I will get

581
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,850
the things that I want!

582
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,020
Things have changed.

583
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,330
I'll see you at Jinhui Building.

584
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,270
Your mother hasn't come back?

585
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,260
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

586
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,630
I've been busy recently

587
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,830
and I'll go to see you when I'm done.

588
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,900
Have you eaten?

589
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,730
Listen to the auntie next door, Mei.

590
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,100
-Fatty, help!
 -You...

591
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,580
Fatty, help!

592
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,060
-Reddy!
-Hurry up!

593
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,470
What's going on?

594
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,850
Go after it!

595
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:39,660
Hurry up.

596
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,530
Where is it?

597
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:47,880
I lost it.

598
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,040
How did you lose it?

599
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,670
What were you doing?

600
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,980
What is it ahead?

601
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,470
Jinhui Building.

602
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,350
Stop at Jinhui Building.

603
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,440
Naive,

604
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,980
I'm at Jinhui Building.

605
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,580
Reddy got kidnapped.

606
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,960
It must be Xue Wu.

607
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,210
It seems he will do anything right now

608
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,890
to stop me from saving my second uncle.

609
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,820
Tomorrow is the most critical.

610
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,720
We have to defeat Xue Wu

611
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,360
and set out the day after tomorrow.

612
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,140
Let's go back first.

613
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,680
And we'll figure it out later.

614
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,320
What is it?

615
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,600
I...

616
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,200
Watch out!

617
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,780
Naive!

618
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,330
You have to go to the hospital!

619
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,500
Let's go.

620
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,060
Naive, let's go!

621
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,500
Naive!

622
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,800
Go to the hospital! Now!

623
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,070
No.

624
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,200
I can't go to the hospital.

625
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,570
I can't go to the hospital now.

626
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,610
Why?

627
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,230
I won't be able to get out.

628
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,530
And then I can't save my second uncle.

629
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,180
What to do now?

630
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,300
Hang in there. Hang in there.

631
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,790
Take me to see someone.

632
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,750
Only he can save me now.

633
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,690
Hodroff!

634
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,080
Hodroff!

635
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,050
What are you doing? Get in line!

636
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:48,760
Cut the crap!

637
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,650
It's a life-and-death matter!

638
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,820
Who is Hodroff?

639
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,010
Where is your boss?

640
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,790
Hodroff!

641
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:56,650
I am Hodroff.

642
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,750
Bro,

643
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,920
hurry up.

644
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,160
Wu Xie is dying

645
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,260
Please come and save him!

646
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,090
Hurry up!

647
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,460
Take him to the funeral home.

648
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,520
Why did you bring him here?

649
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,990
Wu Xie said that only you can save him.

650
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,250
We can't go to the hospital.

651
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,490
Otherwise, we wouldn't have come here.

652
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,500
Hurry up!

653
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,260
It's a life-and-death matter, bro!

654
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,150
My fried bread sticks are delicious

655
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,730
but they can't save lives.

656
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,080
No, he is really dying!

657
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,730
Do you want to fold your hands and see him die?

658
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,370
I will kill you, believe it or not?

659
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,960
I can only make fried bread sticks.

660
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,440
I don't know how to save lives.

661
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,300
I'm begging you!

662
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,710
Please help Wu Xie!

663
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,440
I'm telling you!

664
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,020
I will do anything!

665
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,710
I'm willing to kneel and I'm willing to kill!

666
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,050
I'm begging you! Please help Wu Xie!

667
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,300
I'm begging you!

668
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,600
I'm begging you! Please help Wu Xie!

669
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,670
I'm begging you!

670
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,180
I'm begging you!

671
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,120
I'm begging you!

672
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,770
Fatty,

673
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,540
I didn't expect you to be so frank one day.

674
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,890
Come inside.

675
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:35,940
Hurry up.

676
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:36,860
Hurry up. Where?

677
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:37,820
Where?

678
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:50,950
Hurry up.

679
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,630
How is he?

680
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,500
How is he? Say something!

681
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,430
OK. OK.

682
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,400
OK.

683
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,630
Men in white coat can treat.

684
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,600
Pardon?

685
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,530
You can go if you don't believe me.

686
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,060
No.

687
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,600
Naive said you can save him, so you can.

688
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,220
I mean no offense.

689
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,730
Get to the point.

690
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,880
Suspected pulmonary fibrosis.

691
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,840
Look.

692
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,050
He's seriously ill.

693
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,280
And today

694
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,960
we got surrounded by cement trucks

695
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,850
with lots of dust.

696
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,610
He got trapped there for a while

697
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,750
and he vomited blood

698
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,200
when we came out.

699
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,450
Please have a look at him.

700
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,870
His lung function is already weak

701
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,810
without self-purification capacity.

702
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,040
It's easy for him to have asthma.

703
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,210
This disease requires rest

704
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,280
with fresh air for a long time.

705
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:25,580
At this moment,

706
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,780
he shouldn't catch a cold or fever, or inhale dust.

707
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,739
If he inhales dust again,

708
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,290
it will be worse

709
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,520
which can't be cured.

710
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,320
What to do now?

711
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,469
What to do?

712
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,060
His lung function is failing

713
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,960
and there's only one way to help,

714
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,560
which is to perform a lung transplant,

715
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,630
with the five-year survival rate being 35%.

716
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,600
That's not bad.

717
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,400
It's worth it.

718
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,330
His lung function is failing now.

719
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,199
And where can I get him a lung right now?

720
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,270
I have two and I'll give him one.

721
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,200
Calm down.

722
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,960
There's another problem.

723
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,160
What is it?

724
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,940
Even his liver shows a sign of failure.

725
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,230
I don't think he can stand

726
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,930
an operation right now.

727
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,130
His blood

728
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,240
might not be the same as the ordinary people's.

729
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,760
Logically speaking,

730
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,360
he should be waiting for death

731
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,110
in a hospital.

732
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,770
There must be a way!

733
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,370
I have the liver.

734
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,640
Yes!

735
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,000
If I put him on a ventilator now,

736
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:33,940
I'm afraid

737
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,970
he won't be able to live without it.

738
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,640
I'll make a reckless move now,

739
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,680
but don't blame me

740
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,310
if I can't save him.

741
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,050
Anyway, both of us depend on you.

742
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,650
You have to save him.

743
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,390
This is the native method in Borneo diamond mine.

744
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,850
Most workers over there

745
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,300
have severe pneumoconiosis.

746
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,340
The cement tends to cake in the lungs when there's water,

747
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,890
so we have to wash it out with oil quickly.

748
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,420
Naive!

749
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,490
Look! He's vomiting!

750
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,330
Give him a hand!

751
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,090
Wipe it.

752
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,350
Look!

753
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,830
Naive! Naive!

754
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,330
It works! Naive!

755
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,820
You scared me to death!

756
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,600
Naive!

757
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,720
Sir, no, Doctor!

758
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,160
Why can't he wake up?

759
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,540
The next 24 hours are critical.

760
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,900
Take good care of him.

761
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,100
If it happens again,

762
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,700
I'm afraid...

763
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,300
Take him away.

764
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,160
Don't die at my place.

765
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,650
<i>Houquan Action Plan</i>

766
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,580
You wait for me here.

767
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,610
Why are you here?

768
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,880
I...

769
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,210
I'm cleaning.

770
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,320
It's finished.

771
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,730
Come!

772
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,090
Catch that woman!

773
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,270
She works for Wu Xie!

774
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:03,890
Hurry up!

775
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:04,730
Let's go. Hurry!

776
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,640
Stop!

777
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,230
Don't run!

778
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,290
Stop!

779
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:18,540
Don't run!

780
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,330
Stop!

781
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,270
Don't run!

782
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,340
Stop!

783
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,340
Hurry! Stop!

784
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,700
Stop!

785
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,560
Stop!

786
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:28,970
Where do you want to go?

787
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,390
Stop!

788
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:49,670
<i>Day 1 10:41:57</i>

789
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,580
You've finally woken up.

790
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,570
My back...

791
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,330
It must be uncomfortable.

792
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,780
Let me help you.

793
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,340
OK.

794
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,700
What is it?

795
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,700
It's for washing your lungs.

796
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,120
You went to see Hodolf?

797
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,410
I knelt down in front of him.

798
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,890
You owe me a hot pot.

799
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,480
Do you know how many hot pots

800
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,880
you owe me?

801
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,330
This fried bread stick man is a bit interesting.

802
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,570
It really works.

803
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,080
He was an army surgeon before.

804
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,450
An army surgeon?

805
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,400
Then why didn't he agree to save you at the beginning?

806
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,550
There was something between us.

807
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:01,850
You don't want to tell me?

808
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,850
Never mind.

809
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,980
How many days did Hodroff say that I have?

810
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,050
You can

811
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,210
die at any moment.

812
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,630
A sneeze or a cough

813
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,040
can kill you.

814
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,140
But

815
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,690
that was three hours ago.

816
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,660
Hodroff said you would be fine if you could wake up today.

817
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,550
And you just slept for three hours.

818
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,880
But in these three hours,

819
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,510
I got really exhausted.

820
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,690
To carry you,

821
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,160
my back got hurt really bad

822
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,920
and I even washed your diapers

823
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,160
with my hurt back.

824
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,050
I haven't even done this for my own father.

825
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,270
That explains it.

826
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,270
I was wondering why the Hello Kitty

827
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,550
on your chest shrank.

828
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,080
You're making jokes,

829
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,500
which means you're much better now.

830
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:45,910
Fatty,

831
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,490
thank you.

832
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,530
You owe me big.

833
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,230
OK, as long as you're fine.

834
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,700
So it won't be in vain.

835
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,950
What are you thinking about?

836
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,130
What are you thinking about again?

837
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,150
I'm running out of time.

838
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,430
I have to get prepared.

839
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,150
What do you want to prepare?

840
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,290
You haven't got recovered.

841
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:07,960
I have to get prepared.

842
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,830
-You have to rest now.
-Tomorrow is critical.

843
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,340
No, no.

844
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,060
You're crushing me.

845
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,210
My back! This is bad.

846
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,460
I didn't mean to crush you, but I'm heavy.

847
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,030
My back...

848
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,610
Bai...

849
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,020
My...

850
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,070
My back...

851
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,850
Fatty, what did you do?

852
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,990
What do you mean?

853
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,760
Can't you keep a secret?

854
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,480
I didn't tell her about it.

855
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,020
Haotian is smart.

856
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,120
