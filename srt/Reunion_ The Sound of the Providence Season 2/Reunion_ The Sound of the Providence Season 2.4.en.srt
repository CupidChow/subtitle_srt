00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,360
Reunion: The Sound of the Providence Season 2

3
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,520
Episode 4

4
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,170
Here it is.

5
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,560
You actually found it. Amazing.

6
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,690
Cut the crap.

7
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,840
Take it off.

8
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,920
The rascal put it there too early.

9
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:06,800
And then?

10
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,060
Haotian,

11
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,310
you are light, so go up

12
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,140
Cut the crap. Take it off.

13
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,070
Can this bear my weight?

14
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,670
Well, I'll do it.

15
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,820
I, I'll do it myself.

16
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,850
Do it slowly.

17
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,260
Be careful.

18
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,800
Haotian,

19
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,950
I always call you Haotian cordially.

20
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,270
Why don't you call me brother?

21
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,750
Do you know the sound roosters make?

22
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,360
What about the sound hens make?

23
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,230
Fatty!

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,890
What about the sound giraffes make?

25
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,540
-Do you know...
-Hurry!

26
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,700
-Catch it.
 -Coming.

27
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,679
Catch.

28
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,790
Is this the pillar that pacifies the oceans passed down from

29
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,540
your ancestors?

30
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,860
If my family has that pillar,

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,610
Pig,

32
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,730
I'll hit you with it and make you return to your original form.

33
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,840
Awesome.

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,440
Is this a rack for hanging clothes on?

35
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,100
This is a device for listening to thunder.

36
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,380
Why do I feel it is just a rack for hanging clothes on?

37
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,700
It is a device for listening to thunder.

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,890
Bai, ignore what he said.

39
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Give me the drawing of the device for listening to thunder

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,240
-I took out from the section of unredeemable goods.
 -OK.

41
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,750
Take this.

42
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,630
Here.

43
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:39,950
Look.

44
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,410
Now we have the jar.

45
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,350
We also have the lightning rod.

46
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,160
So everything is ready.

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,300
How about

48
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,060
we try to listen to thunder?

49
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,220
Let's be struck by lightning.

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,090
This is the only clue we have.

51
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,880
Besides,

52
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,200
I believe Uncle Sanxing.

53
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,640
Now we just need the last device,

54
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,280
the most important one.

55
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,410
With this device,

56
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,900
we can listen to thunder.

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,810
What is this device?

58
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,880
A Faraday cage.

59
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,140
OK.

60
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,280
I accept the job.

61
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,360
With this work,

62
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,140
I can attend the Venice Biennale.

63
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,910
Fatty,

64
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,400
are you reliable?

65
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,500
I don't know.

66
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,100
Naive.

67
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,020
OK. Naive.

68
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,840
Didn't you say no problem?

69
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,960
Why did you say that you don't know?

70
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,210
I'll suffer because of you sooner or later.

71
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,890
It depends on the heavens.

72
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,300
How about I do it?

73
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,509
It is thundering. Go inside.

74
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,670
OK. Be careful.

75
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,300
You two set up the case.

76
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,830
I'm going inside.

77
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,880
Naive!

78
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,420
Naive!

79
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,140
Here.

80
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,780
Is it OK to flush it?

81
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,280
This is Nongfu Spring.

82
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,000
Nature is curing Naive.

83
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,230
Put up with it.

84
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,220
Is it so painful?

85
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,580
Of course yes.

86
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,850
Flush it again.

87
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,400
OK. OK.

88
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,980
Fortunately, I brought this with me.

89
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,790
Fatty,

90
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,090
the Faraday cage.

91
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,230
I'm going to the bathroom.

92
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:04,900
Take care of him.

93
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,300
Come back.

94
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,510
What Faraday cage did you make?

95
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,740
You thought I've lived for too long, right?

96
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,130
I thought you liked it.

97
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,210
Perhaps what I made

98
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,890
is too artistic.

99
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,450
It is not practical and scientific.

100
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,820
There should have been a ground wire. I'm sorry.

101
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,360
You are too unreliable.

102
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,620
You didn't use such an important thing.

103
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,920
I observed the mountain shapes when I came here.

104
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,990
I always feel that they look familiar.

105
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,610
Later, it occurred to me

106
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,770
that terrain here

107
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,360
looks very similar to

108
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,730
the shape of the iron pendent in the dumb princess' brain I saw.

109
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,140
Is it possible

110
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,710
that the mountains here have been designed?

111
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,770
The repeated thunder has something to do with the mountain shapes.

112
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,470
I got it.

113
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,710
Some of Uncle Sanxing's photos

114
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,050
show the shapes of the mountains around the valley.

115
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,450
Underground Wuzhou, there are karst caves in the section of unredeemable goods.

116
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,610
So is the weather station

117
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,290
and the South Sea King's Tomb.

118
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,880
The terrains are similar.

119
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,620
You can think clearly.

120
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,510
You didn't suffer the strike for nothing this time.

121
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,580
I think,

122
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,540
in Thunder City, there are similar mountain shapes too.

123
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,560
Wherever South Sea King went,

124
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,550
he looked for and renovated a valley,

125
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,530
to make the frequency of thunder reflected convergent

126
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,640
so that the device for listening to thunder can translate.

127
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,170
What is the use of

128
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,650
that thunder?

129
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,910
South Sea King just copied it for fun？

130
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,690
We'll know the details only when we are in Thunder City.

131
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
If so,

132
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,960
under Warehouse 11,

133
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,060
there must be something related to South Sea King.

134
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,400
I neglected the information.

135
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,950
We must get in once again

136
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,410
to investigate it thoroughly.

137
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,560
When it was thundering,

138
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,450
you really didn't see anything?

139
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,960
Did you see anything?

140
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,800
No.

141
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,290
Except that you were almost killed,

142
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,530
we didn't see anything else.

143
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,200
That's impossible.

144
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,480
How about you let lightning strike you once again?

145
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,630
Let it strike you.

146
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,700
I'm scared if I'm to be struck.

147
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,150
Can you be gentler?

148
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,790
I'm hitting your acupoints.

149
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,580
You are hitting me hard.

150
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,340
Bai,

151
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,280
get the camera for me.

152
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,110
I want to watch the recorded video.

153
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,690
OK.

154
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,149
Mr. Third Junior,

155
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:47,230
there is a pattern on the ground.

156
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,340
Slow down. Slow down.

157
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,210
There is actually a pattern after the explosion.

158
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,000
Be careful.

159
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,790
Slow down. Slow down.

160
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,630
This looks like a map.

161
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,300
Fatty.

162
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,780
This is a map.

163
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,110
Perhaps it is related to Thunder City.

164
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,940
The ground here must have been specially processed.

165
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,200
It seems that something like gunpowder has been buried here.

166
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,330
This may be the information Uncle Sanxing wanted to give me.

167
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,850
This is amazing.

168
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,880
This is a mess.

169
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't understand.

170
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,550
I'll take a picture of it and send it to Uncle Erbai.

171
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,290
I think he can tell me something.

172
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,260
Hello?

173
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,750
Hello, Uncle Erbai.

174
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,850
Just now I sent you a map...

175
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,520
I received it.

176
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,140
Stay out of this.

177
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,590
How are you?

178
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,020
I'm in the weather station,

179
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,430
where I found

180
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,910
Yang Daguang's body.

181
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,730
Where are you now?

182
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,210
We haven't gone down yet,

183
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,460
but we've arrived at a key place.

184
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,920
Are you interested in seeing us go down?

185
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,910
Of course yes.

186
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,780
Wait a moment.

187
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:07,870
Where is my battery?

188
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,450
-Kylin.
-Kylin.

189
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,280
Kylin.

190
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:10,890
Kylin.

191
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,340
Long time no see.

192
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,610
This is Kylin.

193
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,100
Look.

194
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,110
The most handsome one.

195
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,910
Uncle Erbai.

196
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,720
How are you now?

197
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,110
He's fine. He's fine.

198
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,400
I'm taking good care of him.

199
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,470
Rest assured.

200
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,880
Don't forget to be checked regularly.

201
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,880
There is no need to be checked.

202
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,250
Just let me live confusedly.

203
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,030
If this continues,

204
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,380
you will...

205
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,230
I know.

206
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,550
You want accurate data

207
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,600
to see when you will make arrangements for my funeral.

208
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,770
But what does it have to do with me?

209
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,600
Uncle Erbai,

210
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,710
let me die in my own way.

211
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,580
OK?

212
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,120
Mr. Third Junior.

213
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,450
Mr. Second,

214
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,620
the pathfinders have cleared the way.

215
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,720
Let's go down.

216
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,110
OK.

217
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,500
When did Kanjian go there?

218
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,380
Kanjian.

219
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,900
Boss.

220
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,070
Uncle Erbai said the situation here is complicated

221
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,110
and asked me to come to help.

222
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,590
I bought you the local specialties.

223
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,470
I'll send them to you when I'm back.

224
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,220
Enough. Enough.

225
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,000
Talk when you meet.

226
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:18,570
Go to work.

227
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,050
OK. OK.

228
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,120
Wait for me to go back.

229
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,430
OK. Bye.

230
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,140
That's unnecessary, Uncle Erbai.

231
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,170
I'm afraid that if you see too much, you'll come here

232
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,700
and then we'll really be in trouble.

233
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:30,720
Bye.

234
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,040
Get ready.

235
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:32,520
OK.

236
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,300
The mountains here are very similar.

237
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,500
Even if Wu Xie sees the whole process,

238
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,450
he won't find this place.

239
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,810
Wu Xie can achieve what he has today

240
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,150
because he not only values the geomancy of mountains and rivers,

241
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,490
but pays more attention to the geomancy of people's mind.

242
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,710
I don't know which one of us

243
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,560
is sending information to him.

244
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,050
Anyway, although he is not here,

245
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,670
his mind is here.

246
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,990
Here is the accumulated water down. Taste it.

247
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,760
Mr. Second, let me.

248
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,860
Seawater.

249
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,460
It is connected to the sea.

250
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,520
Tides affect the water level.

251
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,160
The rocks here have been carved.

252
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,470
The sound is weird.

253
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,240
I'm afraid there is a problem with it.

254
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,110
Everybody, listen.

255
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,040
During the process of our action,

256
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,760
no one is allowed to speak loud.

257
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,910
Let's go.

258
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,630
Mr. Third Junior!

259
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,810
The video is ready.

260
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,770
Move your legs.

261
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,080
Black Glasses.

262
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,560
Welcome to Episode 365

263
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,660
of Adventure in the Ancient Tomb.

264
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,570
Now we arrive at the entrance to Thunder City.

265
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,930
This entrance is hidden.

266
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,910
Audience, you are eager to know where we are,

267
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,850
but we won't tell you.

268
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,880
Look. Look.

269
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,670
What is this?

270
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,580
I find a wild kylin.

271
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,330
Except that this kylin is dirty,

272
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,300
there are no other differences between him

273
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,140
and other kylins.

274
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,010
Actually kylin

275
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,470
is an eatable creature.

276
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,630
As long as you remove its head and internals, you can directly eat it.

277
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,610
It tastes delicious.

278
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,490
Kylin's protein content

279
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,430
is six times that of the beef.

280
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,180
A kylin can provide several days' energy

281
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,500
for human body.

282
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,080
And it tastes crispy.

283
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,900
You are loquacious.

284
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,870
We'll change the channel.

285
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,030
When you are down there, you are more loquacious than him.

286
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,230
I talk about knowledge.

287
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,210
What is he talking about?

288
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,400
What's going on?

289
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,380
Something is wrong.

290
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,750
What's your opinion?

291
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,490
This is artificial,

292
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,030
so sounds can produce such effects.

293
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,780
What's going on there?

294
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,640
Who?

295
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,040
Something is wrong.

296
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,140
Leave!

297
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,200
Leave!

298
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,390
Leave!

299
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,070
Withdraw! Withdraw!

300
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,720
Chief.

301
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,480
Uncle Erbai. Chief.

302
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,750
Hurry! Go! Hurry!

303
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,160
Why...

304
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,840
How come...

305
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,680
Why...

306
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,370
They will be fine, right?

307
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,020
The rate of water flow

308
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,010
was at least 80 km per hour.

309
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,690
Kylin and Black Glasses

310
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,200
jumped below the rocks.

311
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,150
I think they will be fine.

312
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,030
But if the people washed away by the water flow

313
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,220
bump against the rocks,

314
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,580
they'll be done for.

315
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,680
I'm really worried.

316
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,690
What can we do?

317
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,350
We have no choice but wait.

318
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:10,840
Fatty, give the cellphone to me.

319
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:25,110
<i>Xie Yuchen</i>

320
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:22,860
Something happened to Uncle Erbai and the others.

321
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,530
How do you know the password is your birthday?

322
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,920
Excuse me.

323
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,120
Hello. Where is the washroom?

324
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,150
It is one the left hand side at the back door.

325
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:46,900
Thank you.

326
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,200
Here is the dessert for you.

327
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,140
Hello?

328
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:00,760
OK.

329
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,500
I hear that restaurant gives discounts, so the food is very cheap.

330
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,030
I got it.

331
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,380
Really?

332
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,610
Sir, drive fast.

333
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,930
34, Xingyan Road.

334
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,450
Some people are following me.

335
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,740
If I don't go, it will be late.

336
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,050
Kanjian, what happened?

337
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,210
What happened to you guys?

338
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,040
Boss.

339
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,770
That's terrible. That's terrible.

340
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,970
Remember what I've taught you?

341
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,090
Showing feelings is useless.

342
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,930
Showing feelings is useless.

343
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,160
Report to me!

344
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,740
What's going on?

345
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,790
Uncle Erbai is trapped below.

346
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,110
I don't know how he is now.

347
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,030
But, but Mr. Black and Kylin

348
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,360
really disappeared.

349
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,610
What do you mean by "disappeared"?

350
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,200
What happened?

351
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,090
How can you be sure?

352
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,540
Uncle Erjing was the last to come up.

353
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,580
There is all water below.

354
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,060
Water came up from the ditch

355
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,970
and flooded all the places below.

356
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,040
It has been over three hours

357
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,370
and there is no air below at all.

358
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,610
Didn't they take diving equipment with them?

359
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,840
The oxygen in the bottle can be used for only 40 minutes.

360
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,230
After that, nobody can survive.

361
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,070
Kanjian, do as I say.

362
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,040
Pick a rock.

363
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,840
Hold the rock with one hand

364
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,630
and the walkie-talkie with the other.

365
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,000
OK.

366
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,070
Knock as I do.

367
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,560
Use the walkie-talkie

368
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,100
to make white noise of the same frequency.

369
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,730
Come on. Come on.

370
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,830
OK.

371
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,090
Come on.

372
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,140
How are you?

373
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,040
Don't tell others.

374
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,070
I'm fine.

375
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,880
There is something wrong with Uncle Erbai's people.

376
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,310
This is a trap.

377
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,110
Don't come here.

378
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,050
Be safe.

379
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,870
How is your situation?

380
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,670
We still have oxygen.

381
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,820
I can find the exit.

382
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,550
Let's meet after you get rid of

383
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,350
the future trouble.

384
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,280
How come they all died?

385
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,940
Where is Uncle Erbai?

386
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,820
How is he now?

387
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,280
I don't know.

388
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,800
Kanjian,

389
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,680
try to send your location information to me.

390
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,590
Stay aside.

391
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,510
Mr. Second is still trying to come out.

392
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,220
There is all water below.

393
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,080
It is like a roaring spring.

394
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,780
Luckily,

395
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,770
he is stuck in a place with air.

396
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,620
Mr. Third Junior, don't worry.

397
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,250
Whatever happens,

398
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,650
I'll help Mr. Second out.

399
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,080
OK. Let's not talk.

400
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,120
We are going to rescue him.

401
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,580
I'll report to you later.

402
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,420
Let's go.

403
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,540
There is a spy.

404
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,980
Spy?

405
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,640
Hello?

406
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,950
OK.

407
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,020
OK.

408
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,460
I got it.

409
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,180
Wu Erbai finally had an accident.

410
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,780
We can carry out

411
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,980
our plan now.

412
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,110
Before leaving,

413
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,550
Mr. Second has deprived Wu Xie of his power.

414
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,230
He is going to die soon.

415
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,030
We certainly should care about him.

416
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,080
We can't let him go to save Mr. Second and court death.

417
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,160
After Erbai left, Erjing is the most prestigious.

418
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,710
Mrs. Wu ordered

419
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,820
that we must help Erbai out.

420
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,920
But Wu Erbai can't come back within a short time.

421
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,620
Let's make use of this period to do something.

422
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,680
Wu Xie burned my store

423
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,300
and get money from them.

424
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,420
He owes Wu Erbai stores.

425
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,920
Let's get money according to the bill.

426
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,250
Get back all the money we spent on the Wu family.

427
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,950
Let's just say that we need to form a rescue team.

428
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,060
The young master of the Xie family may intervene，

429
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,030
but the Wu family won't believe

430
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,360
the Xie family is helping them.

431
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,850
Remember.

432
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,260
Before the day breaks,

433
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,990
we must collect the seals

434
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,960
of all the stores.

435
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,930
Even if we break their hands,

436
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,730
we must hold the seals in our hands.

437
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,250
Tell them that Mr. Second asked us to do that before he left,

438
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,050
because he worried that Wu Xie would come to power.

439
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,750
We've been waiting for this day

440
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,690
for too long.

441
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,640
Action!

442
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,870
Yes! Yes!

443
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,530
Hurry!

444
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,300
Hurry!

445
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,590
Be quick!

446
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,790
When seawater flew backward to the subterranean river,

447
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,960
Kylin's and the others' walkie-talkies squeaked.

448
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,360
Someone deliberately did that.

449
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,330
Someone controlled the squeak of walkie-talkies.

450
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,860
Uncle Erbai is seriously injured.

451
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,600
Half of the people are trapped inside,

452
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,170
while the other half are safe.

453
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,440
That means the spy

454
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,960
must be

455
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,200
among the half of people who are safe.

456
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,160
But how did he know that?

457
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,670
How did he know

458
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,820
when seawater would flow backward?

459
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,120
Since Uncle Erbai went to Thunder City,

460
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,770
he must have been well prepared.

461
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,260
Since he was well prepared,

462
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,770
and didn't know when seawater would flow backward,

463
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,400
but how could the spy know that?

464
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,630
The spy has been the subterranean river before.

465
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,330
Yes.

466
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,340
He has been there before.

467
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,900
And he has even been to Thunder City before.

468
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,340
Yes. That can make sense.

469
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,700
He has been to Thunder City before.

470
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,840
So when he learned that Uncle Erbai and the others

471
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,210
would go to Thunder City,

472
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
he did everything

473
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,580
to stop them from going to Thunder City.

474
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,130
He doesn't want them to go into Thunder City.

475
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:11,900
Right.

476
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,610
He doesn't want them to go into Thunder City.

477
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,760
That's his purpose.

478
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,700
He doesn't want them to go into Thunder City.

479
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,790
But if he doesn't want

480
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,940
them to go into Thunder City,

481
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,170
why didn't he wait for one more hour?

482
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,540
After one more hours,

483
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,740
when seawater flew backward

484
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,030
and Uncle Erbai's team went deeper,

485
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,270
they would be completely wiped out.

486
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,680
Why did he keep half of the people there?

487
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,050
Why did he keep half of the people outside?

488
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,510
The people he wants to kill

489
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,880
are Uncle Erbai,

490
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,740
Kylin,

491
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,470
and Glasses.

492
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,030
What he did is directed against me.

493
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,940
It is directed against me.

494
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,750
What he did is directed against me.

495
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,840
Let me summarize for you.

496
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,180
There are three points.

497
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,350
First.

498
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,880
The spy indeed exists

499
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,400
and he is among those people

500
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,600
who escaped.

501
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,140
Second.

502
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:45,230
The spy may have been to Thunder City before.

503
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,380
Third.

504
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,650
The spy wants to kill

505
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,440
your uncle, Kylin and Glasses.

506
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,310
Actually he wants to deal with you.

507
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,750
Because you are too famous and a tall tree catches the wind.

508
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,340
When a dragon's head waves,

509
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,480
its tail extends miles away.

510
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,780
All in all,

511
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,380
to protect them,

512
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,720
we can't let the spy know that they are still alive.

513
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,580
We should disguise ourselves

514
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,120
and act,

515
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,720
act secretly.

516
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,540
You are right.

517
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,980
We really should disguise ourselves.

518
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,600
But we can't act secretly.

519
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,770
We need to let everybody know

520
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,610
that we are going to save Uncle Erbai.

521
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,850
We need to let the spy know too.

522
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,780
But

523
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,910
we need to let them know that we are going to save him

524
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,190
not because he is still alive

525
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,750
but I can't accept

526
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,620
the fact.

527
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,910
What brings you here?

528
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,180
You guys are really calm.

529
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,610
After I sneezed, you came.

530
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,540
You guys are really calm.

531
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,340
Hurry. Something happened.

532
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,360
Someone from the bank is coming.

533
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,460
Put on your coat. Hurry.

534
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,850
What is he coming for?

535
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,260
Put on your coats first.

536
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,860
Don't be like that.

537
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,010
Come on. Come on.

538
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,250
Something big happened.

539
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:28,720
What happened?

540
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,650
What is the man from the bank coming for?

541
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,750
Coats. Coats. Hurry.

542
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,720
Come on. Come on.

543
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:32,820
It will be too late.

544
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,560
Let's go.

545
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,710
Let's go. Let's go.

546
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,350
What are you doing?

547
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,190
Why are you taking photos?

548
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,640
Stop it.

549
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,230
The guy presses for payment of debt comes fast.

550
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,090
What are you doing?

551
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,820
Mr. Wu,

552
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,860
this is the notification of freezing your assets.

553
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,020
When you ran Wushanju,

554
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,660
you borrowed RMB 3.7 million from the group.

555
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,590
During the period, Mr. Wu Erbai

556
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,590
was your warrantor.

557
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,400
Wushanju has been taken back by the group.

558
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,520
According to the resolution of the board of directors,

559
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,230
you are requested to pay back the money immediately.

560
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,990
But your partner Mr. Wang

561
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,390
refused to accept the resolution.

562
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,100
So

563
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,860
the bank froze your property.

564
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,720
There will be a court session to deal with

565
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,690
the dispute over assets between you and the group.

566
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,330
Cut the crap.

567
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,020
Tell me what you mean.

568
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,650
What do you mean?

569
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,130
What does he mean?

570
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,360
He means

571
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,990
all your and Fatty's money

572
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,620
has been frozen by the bank.

573
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,990
Why?

574
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,090
That's the money I earned.

575
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,100
What does it have to do with Wushanju?

576
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,450
Mr. Third Junior,

577
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,300
your wrote the IOU to borrow money to run Wushanju.

578
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,850
Isn't that true?

579
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,690
Mr. Wu,

580
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,390
if you don't believe what I said,

581
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,890
you can check the information with your cellphone.

582
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,860
<i>Your account has been frozen, so you can't continue for the time being.</i>

583
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,790
Right?

584
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,350
Mr. Wu, please deal with this matter as soon as possible.

585
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,660
I've got to go.

586
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,200
It came so fast.

587
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,690
Who is in charge of Uncle Erbai's group now?

588
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,090
That's why

589
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,620
I came here.

590
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,460
Now

591
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,630
Xue Wu has the final say.

592
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,000
They are pushing all stores to hand over the seal.

593
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,190
If you don't hand over it,

594
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,440
your bank account will be frozen at once.

595
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,690
I owe your uncle

596
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,700
an amount of money.

597
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,730
But the rule has been changed suddenly.

598
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,530
I can't get so much money

599
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,240
within a short time.

600
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,830
So as soon as I heard the news,

601
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,930
I escaped with the seal.

602
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,260
Tang,

603
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,200
don't just think for yourself.

604
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,140
Say something good to him

605
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,420
and ask him to give us more time

606
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,290
so that we can think of a way.

607
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,200
Can I talk to the guy from the bank?

608
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,070
Will he listen to me?

609
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,640
You are good at talking.

610
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,400
You have to do something at the crucial moment.

611
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,290
Come on. Be polite.

612
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:39,860
Hurry.

613
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,220
Buddy.

614
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,400
Buddy, buddy, wait.

615
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,950
Let's talk.

616
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,790
Xue Wu has taken action.

617
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,600
It seems that he is impatient.

618
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,700
We can put on a big play with him.

619
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,290
You won't go to meet Kylin?

620
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,630
Right. He can stay at Qingtong Sect for another ten years.

621
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,300
I will go to meet him.

622
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,400
Three days.

623
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,630
Let's get rid of Xue Wu within three days

624
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,300
and then go to meet Kylin.

625
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,200
Find a talent for me.

626
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,570
He must be excellent in diving.

627
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,500
We can ask Haotian for help.

628
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,600
Bai.

629
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,460
I'm warning you, Fatty,

630
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,700
don't let Bai know that.

631
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,640
I need a desperado.

632
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,770
A desperado?

633
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,230
There is no desperado in this era.

634
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,280
There are keyboard men nowadays.

635
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,040
You said that intentionally, right?

636
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,470
Let's split up. Come on.

637
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,670
What are you going to do?

638
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,670
Xue Wu!

639
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,670
Xue Wu!

640
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,400
Mr. Third Junior.

641
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,010
Where is Xue Wu?

642
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,160
He is not in.

643
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,180
I know he is inside.

644
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,280
Ask him to come out.

645
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,870
He knew you would come,

646
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,260
so he asked me to wait for you here.

647
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,430
You won't get in today.

648
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,700
Mr. Third Junior,

649
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,540
please go back.

650
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,740
Liu,

651
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,630
get in

652
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,900
and tell that bastard

653
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,930
to hide

654
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,549
and not come out.

655
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,700
Don't let me come across him outside.

656
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,239
-Mr. Fifth.
-Mr. Fifth.

657
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:30,339
-Mr. Fifth.
 -Mr. Fifth.

658
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,270
Hello?

659
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,840
Hello, Uncle Erjing.

660
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,740
How is the situation now?

661
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,470
We haven't helped Mr. Second out.

662
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,700
The situation is not good.

663
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,980
We are trying our best to search and rescue him.

664
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,910
Xue Wu has occupied Uncle Erbai's stores.

665
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,230
Now the whole Wu family....

666
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,200
I've already known that.

667
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,610
Now Mr. Second's life is the most important.

668
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,480
No time to lose.

669
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,210
Mr. Third Junior, take care of yourself.

670
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,040
What do you mean?

671
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,140
Mr. Second didn't want you

672
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,840
to enter the circle.

673
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,880
Now he is in danger.

674
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,570
He certainly doesn't want anything to happen to you.

675
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,380
Try to avoid dealing with Xue Wu.

676
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,620
Don't make things more complicated.

677
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,920
I know.

678
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,280
But I have to do something.

679
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,990
You can't act on impulse this time,

680
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,440
Mr. Third Junior.

681
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,550
Uncle Erjing, something is bad. It collapsed again.

682
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,380
What?

683
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,220
Stop now! Stop digging!

684
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,720
OK.

685
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,850
Try again to find the entrance to the roaring spring.

686
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:53,480
Let's go.

687
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,080
Let's go.

688
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,550
Mr. Third Junior,

689
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,370
don't worry. I'll certainly help Mr. Second out.

690
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,050
If you really want to do something,

691
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,190
let's talk after Mr. Second comes out.

692
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,480
Mr. Third Junior, you are back.

693
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,750
Isn't Fatty in?

694
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,320
Why didn't you get in?

695
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,340
I'm waiting for you.

696
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,750
Why are you waiting for me? You want to talk to me?

697
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,290
Are you going to save people?

698
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,590
Fatty told you that, right?

699
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,010
The place has been flooded.

700
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,680
I'm good at diving, so I can help you.

701
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,750
This time, the task

702
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,880
is too dangerous, so don't go there.

703
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:38,790
I have my plan.

704
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,250
I knew you would say that.

705
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,880
But when we swore to be brothers and sister,

706
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,690
we agreed to share hardships,

707
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,950
so you can't leave me alone.

708
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,750
It is still not the right time to save them.

709
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,390
How about you do me another favor?

710
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,540
Go ahead.

711
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,290
Find a unit for me.

712
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,080
How large do you want?

713
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,720
I want about...

714
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,390
Why don't you ask me about the usage?

715
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,590
No matter what you want to do, I believe you.

716
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,050
Besides, after I do you the favor,

717
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,860
you have to take me with you when you go to save them.

718
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,290
Go back. Let's contact each other by phone.

719
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,720
It's settled.

720
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,090
You are back.

721
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,410
Well.

722
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,190
Didn't I ask you

723
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,130
not to tell Bai that we are going to save them?

724
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,320
Why did you tell her?

725
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,350
She, she came to us.

726
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,930
She is Haotian, our sworn sister, right?

727
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,420
Isn't it natural to talk about our own thing

728
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,750
with her?

729
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:37,620
What? She,

730
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,030
she is just a girl, but you let her...

731
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,530
Haotian is good at diving.

732
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,330
Perhaps she can...

733
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:43,930
You are annoyed.

734
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,030
Look. You are annoyed.

735
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:48,590
Come on.

736
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,290
Lie down.

737
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,080
Come on.

738
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,220
Come on.

739
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,490
Don't be mad.

740
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,380
Don't be mad. Don't be mad.

741
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,620
Your health.

742
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,790
You must have done something big.

743
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,570
How is it going on your side?

744
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,200
Xue Wu, that bastard,

745
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,250
doesn't want to meet me.

746
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,760
He wants to take this chance to deal with me.

747
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,050
He doesn't want me to save Uncle Erbai.

748
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,330
He wants to take this chance

749
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,690
to take possession of the Wu family's assets.

750
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,800
In his dream.

751
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,890
So, if I don't deal with him,

752
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,620
there won't be a way for me to save Uncle Erbai.

753
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,500
How is it going on your side?

754
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,460
I was exhausted.

755
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,060
At present,

756
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,320
those people outside

757
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,300
who are willing to and can help us

758
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,490
ask too high a price.

759
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,600
If you want to inquire more about something,

760
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,100
that will be impossible.

761
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,430
Xue Wu, that bastard, did something cruelly.

762
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,520
But I have made many friends.

763
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,560
I'm well-connected.

764
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,940
So I can always find rescue in desperate circumstances.

765
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:56,880
Look.

766
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,860
Give it to me. Come on.

767
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,860
An internet friend of mine.

768
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,990
He is known as Red-capped Daffodil.

769
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,290
A young man from Sichuan.

770
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,190
He is extremely good at diving.

771
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,970
Fatty, you lied to me.

772
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,390
Didn't you say we are going to find the man in a mahjong school?

773
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,220
Isn't this a hot spring area?

774
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,100
Cut the crap.

775
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,000
Here is the place. I've searched.

776
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,030
It is a good thing to work with me.

777
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,800
We can enjoy it later.

778
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,390
This is really interesting.

779
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,200
A fairyland on earth.

780
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,380
Bathing in hot spring is interesting.

781
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,320
These men and women in the pool

782
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,850
are really enjoying themselves.

783
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,030
Fatty, look.

784
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,970
There are only three people at that table, with one missing.

785
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,250
But they are in high spirits.

786
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:57,790
Get a tile. Get a tile.

787
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,330
Reddy, it's your turn.

788
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,260
You completed a hand again.

789
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,760
And there are seven pairs.

790
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,070
Amazing.

791
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,740
Reddy, here is for you.

792
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,640
Thank you, Li.

793
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,430
Good boy.

794
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,140
Thank you.

795
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,420
Reddy, you are great.

796
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,500
-I want a kiss too.
 -I want a kiss too.

797
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,530
What about me? What about me?

798
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,490
Reddy!

799
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:44,830
Who is that?

800
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:45,790
Reddy!

801
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,410
I'm Fatty.

802
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:47,890
Come here.

803
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,300
Fatty?

804
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,240
That's my net name. Don't laugh.

805
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:51,810
Well.

806
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,320
Three ladies, you guys chat.

807
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,680
A friend is here for me.

808
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,640
I'll be back soon.

809
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,530
Wait a moment.

810
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,940
So this is Red-capped Daffodil?
