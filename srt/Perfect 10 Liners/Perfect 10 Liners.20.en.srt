1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,000
I’ll teach you love.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,600
WITSAWA AND FAIFA
Just give it a try with me,

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,960
and I’ll tell you if it works or not.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,680
So damn cute.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,440
To me,
what you do is really special.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,320
I never understood what “special” means.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,680
If you have a special someone one day,

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,920
you’ll want to do something just for them.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,640
I did this because I wanted to take care of you.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,560
I understand what “special” means now.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,600
I understand that it’s probably you.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,840
♪ Let us try, give this love a try ♪

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,080
Give the opening speech from the script
to kick off the event.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,800
Okay.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,240
How did you convince him to be the MC for the contest?

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,920
Never mind.

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,320
I have my ways.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,440
Hey.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,080
Don’t tell me

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
that you…

21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,160
What?

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,800
Slept with him to get him to do it?

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,240
What? No!

24
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,280
It’s obvious.

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,000
Your puppy ears are standing up.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,240
Ears! Are you really that kind of person now?

27
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,800
No!

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,440
No!

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,440
My innocent puppy.

30
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,840
You're not innocent anymore, are you?

31
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,040
I said I didn’t do it!

32
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,920
I said I didn’t do it!

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,400
You’re playing too rough!

34
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,160
Why?

35
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,120
Take it!

36
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,400
Ouch!

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,040
Ouch!

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,520
Fai!

39
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,720
You’re playing too rough!

40
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,160
I was just messing with his hair.

41
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,880
What’s your problem?

42
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,440
Huh?

43
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,000
Hey, hey, hey.

44
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,000
What? What? What, man?

45
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,440
Come on!

46
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,000
Bring it.

47
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,720
Come on, man!

48
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,400
Why did you come down?

49
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,440
They’re not done with the rehearsal.

50
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,840
Fai was playing too rough.

51
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,160
I do more than that behind your back.

52
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,560
Fai!

53
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,360
Come on!

54
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,880
Come on!

55
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,000
- Bring it!
- 	Calm down.

56
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
- Bring it!
- 	Calm down.

57
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,760
I’m not hurt.

58
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,480
Calm down, Yotha.

59
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,160
Let me see.

60
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,680
Where did he hurt you?

61
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,240
Hmm?

62
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,680
Where did Fai hurt you?

63
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,840
Right here.

64
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,280
It hurts so much.

65
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,520
Oh, it’s swollen.

66
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,040
Come here.

67
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,200
It hurts.

68
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,720
Bullshit!

69
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,440
Hey!

70
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,960
Your boyfriend tried to strangle me

71
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,520
but you didn’t worry about me at all.

72
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,720
I’m your younger brother.

73
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,080
Our blood is the same color, you know?

74
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,920
Fai.

75
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,400
What?

76
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,400
Everyone’s blood is the same color.

77
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,880
There you go.

78
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,720
He’s mocking me.

79
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,640
Do you see that he’s mocking me?

80
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,400
What?

81
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,720
My boyfriend never does that.

82
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,480
Seriously? I’m going crazy.

83
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,400
Are you cursed with black magic or something?

84
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,560
See?

85
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,000
You’re so annoying these days.

86
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,920
Hey!

87
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,640
What?

88
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,280
It’s so loud, Yotha.

89
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,800
Are you crazy?

90
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,960
Hi, guys.

91
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,240
Hi, Wine.

92
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,240
I came to get the lecture notes, Yotha.

93
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,520
The lecture notes?

94
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
Oh, the lecture notes.

95
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,680
Sorry.

96
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,440
Here you go, Wine.

97
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,560
Thank you.

98
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,200
You’re welcome.

99
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,440
These are for Computer Engineering, right?

100
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,600
Don’t look confused.

101
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,120
Come on.

102
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,520
Beagle.

103
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,520
Hmm?

104
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,400
What are you doing?

105
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,680
What do you mean?

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,440
You’re being very suspicious.

107
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
So I’m not being subtle at all?

108
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Those lecture notes you gave Wine,

109
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,240
I already told you they’re not for Computer Engineering.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Oh, I forgot.

111
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,000
I think I forgot.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,800
You’re even more suspicious now.

113
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,520
You know?

114
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,880
Forget it.

115
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,080
I’m hungry.

116
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,840
Let’s go eat.

117
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,080
Hey.

118
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,600
Come on. Let’s go eat.

119
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,200
Come on.

120
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,560
I have to wait for a while before it's my turn.

121
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,280
After they announce the last prize,

122
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,280
it’s the sash presentation.

123
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,200
Okay.

124
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,520
Are you sure you want to wait with me?

125
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,880
Yes.

126
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,880
I don’t have anything else to do anyway.

127
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,160
Why are you so cute?

128
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,040
What did you say?

129
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,240
Oh, I said we have to wait a bit longer for my cue.

130
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,800
Can you come with me to get coffee?

131
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,920
Iced green tea, please.

132
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,120
What do you want to order, Faifa?

133
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,120
I’ll just get the same thing as you.

134
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,640
Excuse me.

135
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,480
Can we get two oat milks instead?

136
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,240
Sure.

137
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,520
Do you usually drink oat milk?

138
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,800
No, regular milk tastes better.

139
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,240
Then why did you order oat milk?

140
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Because you said you wanted the same thing as me,

141
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,600
but you’re allergic to milk.

142
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,880
You're cute again.

143
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,440
Huh?

144
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,120
The face on this cup looks sleepy just like you.

145
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,000
It’s cute.

146
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,640
That cup is the last one in stock.

147
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,320
We won’t be making more.

148
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,200
Then I’ll get it, please.

149
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,560
Sure.

150
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,040
Do you want two stamp cards?

151
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
We can just get one.

152
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,880
We always come here together anyway.

153
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,720
Thank you.

154
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,320
200 baht, right?

155
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,960
Yes, please.

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,080
Thank you.

157
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,400
Do you want both to be regular sweet?

158
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,040
Hmm.

159
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,320
I don’t think you’re just regular sweet.

160
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,000
This cup was the last one in stock.

161
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,520
Why don’t you keep it?

162
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,200
It looks like you.

163
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,400
It suits you more.

164
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,240
It doesn’t even look like me.

165
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,240
It does.

166
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,080
Stay still.

167
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,160
It looks so much like you.

168
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,000
Let me see.

169
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,200
Whoa, I look really bad.

170
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,160
I understand what “special” means now.

171
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,240
Faifa.

172
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,720
That night you said…

173
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,240
What did I say?

174
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,200
You said you understand what “special” means now.

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,880
What else?

176
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,880
Nothing else.

177
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,280
I said I understand what “special” means now.

178
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,440
I understand that it’s probably you.

179
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,960
I was going to teach you love

180
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,120
but it turns out I’m the one…

181
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,800
Can you keep teaching me like this?

182
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,960
Like what?

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
Just go with the flow.

184
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,120
I…

185
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,920
I mean…

186
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,760
Okay.

187
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,840
Let’s keep walking together.

188
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,440
We’ll worry about the destination when the time comes.

189
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,320
Do you know you can get free refills
for this cup for the rest of your life?

190
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
They didn’t tell us that when we bought it.

191
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
It’s true.

192
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,680
You can get as many refills as you want in a day.

193
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,440
Unlimited.

194
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,880
Where’s the coupon?

195
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,080
Here.

196
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,360
It’s so easy to use.

197
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,840
Just take me with you

198
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,400
and it’s free for the rest of your life.

199
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,600
Hey. Do you remember that?

200
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,600
That’s where I bumped into you.

201
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah. You weren’t even looking while walking.

202
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,280
You seemed to be in a hurry.

203
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,520
I might have done it on purpose.

204
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,840
Say that again?

205
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,560
I might have already looked

206
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,240
and when I saw that it was you, I bumped into you.

207
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,520
Why would you bump into me on purpose?

208
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,280
Probably because you’re cute.

209
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,000
I need to go on stage soon.

210
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,920
Then let’s hurry.

211
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,560
Let’s go.

212
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,520
Arm, this is so delicious.

213
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,360
Enjoy.

214
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,480
I didn’t make it. I bought it.

215
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,640
I thought you made it yourself.

216
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,560
Are we here just to eat?

217
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,600
Oh, I forgot.

218
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,240
Oh, right.

219
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,040
Hold on.

220
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,040
Oh wow, Gun!

221
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,200
This is so cute!

222
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,560
Right?

223
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,520
Hey.

224
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,960
Do you two want to talk alone?

225
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I’ll go do something else.

226
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,800
Can we get to the point?

227
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
So,

228
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,880
Warich told me when Faifa was drunk,

229
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,920
he kept talking about Wine.

230
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,160
Wa also said that…

231
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,880
That…?

232
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,400
So damn cute.

233
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,960
His smile lights up the whole world.

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,960
I swear I’m telling the truth and didn’t make any of it up.

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,400
If you don’t believe me, just call Wa.

236
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,000
I don’t think Fai knows how to really love someone.

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,880
Why not?

238
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,520
What is it about Faifa?

239
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,200
Excuse me.

240
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Are we almost done?

241
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,880
Your part is done for today.

242
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,240
Feel free to leave.

243
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,000
There’s nothing else for you today.

244
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,240
Okay.

245
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,960
Thank you.

246
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,800
- Thank you so much.
- Congrats.

247
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,880
- You’re so handsome.
- 	Bye.

248
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,640
Thank you.

249
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,120
If you have a special someone one day,

250
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,680
you’ll want to do something just for them.

251
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,560
Like letting them be the only one to lie on my lap?

252
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,080
Is that special?

253
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,400
I usually don’t let anyone lie on my lap.

254
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,880
Oh.

255
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,480
Are you done?

256
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,600
Just now.

257
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,680
Are you still sleepy?

258
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,960
You can sleep more.

259
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,600
It’s alright.

260
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,280
Let’s go.

261
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,240
Don’t you have a morning class tomorrow?

262
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,640
You remember what time Phi has classes?

263
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,520
Why are you smiling?

264
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,880
Because I don’t usually hear you call yourself Phi.

265
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,120
What do you prefer I call myself?

266
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,280
I’m fine with anything.

267
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,120
No, come on.

268
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,760
Which one makes you feel more special?

269
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,480
Lately, you seem to really be into the word “special.”

270
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,080
I just learned what it means.

271
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,000
Let me be crazy about it a bit.

272
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,720
♪ Just go with the flow, whatever we're feeling ♪

273
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,960
♪ For each other right now, woah oh ♪

274
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,320
When you don’t have to try,

275
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,680
that’s what makes it special.

276
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,040
You’re so good at this.

277
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,600
♪ Let us try, give this love a try ♪

278
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,040
♪ Test it out during a trial ♪

279
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,200
♪ Nothing else but how we feel ♪

280
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Bye-bye.

281
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,440
Keep me posted on any updates.

282
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,160
I will.

283
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,800
See you.

284
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,360
Bye-bye.

285
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,840
Arc!

286
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,600
Love is complicated, isn’t it?

287
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,560
Mm.

288
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,480
It’s only complicated in the beginning.

289
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,880
Once both feel the same,
everything will be easy.

290
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,680
Hey, don’t forget your promise.

291
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,400
Got it.

292
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,120
I have to find out for sure if Faifa really likes Wine

293
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,360
and if Wine really likes Faifa.

294
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,840
If either of them doesn’t have feelings,

295
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,320
the plan is off.

296
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,080
I got it.

297
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,160
Very good.

298
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,560
I know you want everyone around you to be happy,

299
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,240
and that’s what makes me like you, Arm.

300
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,720
Yeah.

301
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,520
Faifa.

302
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,200
Hmm?

303
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,440
Once we tick off everything in the notebook,

304
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,880
what do we do next?

305
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,880
I’ll tell you when we get to that point.

306
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,680
Can’t I ask in advance?

307
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,760
No.

308
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
You’re cute when you’re not stubborn.

309
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,400
So, should I be the one to win your heart,

310
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,960
or should you be the one to win my heart?

311
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,200
What are the criteria for passing the test?

312
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,400
Why?

313
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,720
Do you want this to end so soon?

314
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,000
I don’t want it to end.

315
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,560
What did you say?

316
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:12,040
Actually, being with you feels good.

317
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,200
Wine.

318
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,920
You have a morning class tomorrow.

319
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,400
Don’t forget to set your alarm.

320
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,280
Oh, okay.

321
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,160
Ouch!

322
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,160
Faifa.

323
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,320
I knew you’d cut yourself.

324
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,600
Here I come.

325
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,040
Can I hug you?

326
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,240
Your hair smells good.

327
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,240
My cheeks smell good too.

328
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,920
I don’t believe you.

329
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,880
Let me see.

330
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,880
So?

331
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,880
I didn’t smell anything yet.

332
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,480
Oh?

333
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,640
They really smell good.

334
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,080
You took so long to kiss me.

335
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,120
Let me play with the dolls.

336
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,680
Yotha.

337
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,360
Hmm?

338
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
What do you think about Faifa and Wine?

339
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,480
I’m worried.

340
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,840
Hmm?

341
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,200
Worried about who?

342
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,240
I’m worried about Wine.

343
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,560
You might think Fai is good at taking care of people,

344
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,640
loves pleasing others,

345
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,320
and that anyone who gets to date him would be so lucky.

346
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,560
But he treats everyone in his life the same way

347
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,080
and doesn’t know what should be reserved for someone special.

348
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,800
You’re right.

349
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,600
Besides, he doesn’t know what love is

350
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,600
and I’m not sure if he can ever truly love someone.

351
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,840
But sooner or later, everyone learns.

352
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,000
Aren’t you worried that Wine might get hurt?

353
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
I’m a little worried.

354
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
But looking back,

355
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,240
I was willing to cry and wait for you too.

356
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,080
Beagle.

357
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,760
Let’s not talk about that anymore.

358
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,000
Why not?

359
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,560
It’s true.

360
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,960
If I could turn back time, I’d still choose to cry,

361
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,880
because the outcome of having you beside me is so good.

362
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,680
I want Fai to find good love too.

363
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,240
Not everyone might be born out of love

364
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,040
but everyone deserves beautiful love.

365
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,880
Like Beagle, right?

366
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,080
Yotha’s love.

367
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Don’t do this.

368
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,760
Don’t call yourself Yotha.

369
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,240
Why not?

370
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,960
Because…

371
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,960
it’s cool

372
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,440
and it makes me blush…so much.

373
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,320
But Yotha loves Beagle.

374
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
I said don’t call yourself Yotha.

375
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,600
Hey.

376
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,760
I still remember your promise.

377
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,360
Promise?

378
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,240
What promise?

379
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,720
I can’t remember.

380
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,600
I agreed to be the MC for the star contest

381
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,560
in exchange for…

382
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Ask for it after the contest is over.

383
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,200
I don’t care.

384
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,880
Come here.

385
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,800
Hey!

386
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,160
Don’t.

387
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,920
It’s not written down,

388
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,680
so I don’t care.

389
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,800
Beagle, can Yotha kiss you?

390
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,840
I knew you’d cut yourself.

391
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,160
I haven’t had time to change my screen protector.

392
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,440
Who carries plasters everywhere?

393
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,720
I carry them for someone like you.

394
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,400
Why?

395
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,760
What am I like?

396
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,600
Like this.

397
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,440
Ouch!

398
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,280
That hurt!

399
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,440
In front of the uni,

400
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,880
there are like 10 places that sell cases and repair phones.

401
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,640
You could’ve spent half an hour,

402
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,360
instead of caring for others,

403
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,040
to get your screen protector changed.

404
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,200
Can’t you do that?

405
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,440
Well…

406
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,880
You cut yourself on this finger too, right?

407
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,560
With the way you are, who wouldn’t like you?

408
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,040
I’m supposed to be a coach.

409
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,840
Why am I in the middle of the game now?

410
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,240
Were you with Faifa again?

411
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,400
Yeah.

412
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,680
What’s going on between you two?

413
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,120
What do you mean?

414
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,200
You two seem really close sometimes.

415
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,000
You hang out a lot.

416
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,560
It wouldn’t be weird if he’s your mentor,

417
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,720
but he’s not.

418
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,000
What’s wrong with you?

419
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,520
Did you suddenly become possessive of your friend?

420
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,680
Don’t change the subject.

421
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,000
No.

422
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,000
Nothing is going on.

423
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,000
Are you hiding things from me again?

424
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,560
Don’t tell me you slipped
and fell for his charms like the others did.

425
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,040
Slipped?

426
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,440
What about Tor?

427
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,080
Do you want them both?

428
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,440
I don’t think I have feelings for Tor anymore.

429
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,840
When it comes to Tor, you can confidently say that,

430
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,360
but when it comes to Faifa, you’re confused

431
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,000
Do I look confused?

432
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,120
You’ve fallen for Faifa, haven’t you?

433
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
You just said I look confused.

434
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,400
Why are you pressuring me for an answer now?

435
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,200
You’re contradicting yourself.

436
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,920
WHY ARE YOU STILL AWAKE?
I’M NOT SLEEPY YET.
LET ME LULL YOU TO SLEEP.

437
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,480
You’re full of secrets.

438
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,120
Go to bed, sleepyhead.

439
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,920
(Are you at your condo?)

440
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,840
I got back a long time ago.

441
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,320
I’ve already showered too.

442
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Why did you call me?

443
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
I just called to say good night.

444
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Good night to you too.

445
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,640
Hey, Wine.

446
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,640
Can we keep the call going?

447
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,000
(I’ve never done it before.)

448
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,000
That’s nonsense.

449
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,400
Have you put on the blanket?

450
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,840
Yes.

451
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,400
Let’s sleep at the same time.

452
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,320
See you tomorrow.

453
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,760
Mm.

454
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,680
♪ You might be wondering about our status ♪

455
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,480
♪ And how to act when it comes to us ♪

456
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:15,880
♪ Should we hold back or get closer? ♪

457
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,560
How do we prove it?

458
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,560
Do you have a plan, Arm?

459
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,880
Ah.

460
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,080
Actually…

461
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,080
No.

462
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,280
Huh?

463
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
Oh.

464
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,640
I haven’t thought about it.

465
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,120
How about we start by observing?

466
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,720
Great idea, Yotha.

467
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,840
But how do we do that?

468
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,880
Fai’s here.

469
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,840
Hi.

470
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
Fai.

471
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,400
Hi, everyone.

472
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,120
Come here.

473
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,560
Sit down.

474
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,000
Is something going on?

475
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,640
- No.
- Yes.

476
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,760
Is it a yes or no?

477
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,160
Well…

478
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,960
He has something to say.

479
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,520
Ask Arm.

480
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:06,960
Oh.

481
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,520
Me?

482
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,680
Well…

483
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,120
There’s something.

484
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,480
Did you come here alone?

485
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,280
Yes. I came alone.

486
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,280
Do you see anyone else with me?

487
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,040
I’ve been feeling spooky lately.

488
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,360
Oh, no, I don’t.

489
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,560
(Ask where he’s going next.)

490
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,200
You came here alone.

491
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,000
Where are you going next?

492
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,600
I’m going to class, duh.

493
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,240
You’re right.

494
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,160
You come to uni to study.

495
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,880
Hi, guys.

496
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,920
What are you doing?

497
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,240
Here.

498
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,880
Oh.

499
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,080
I’m going to class now.

500
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,360
Bye.

501
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,640
Was Wine really here?

502
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,480
Or was I seeing things?

503
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,520
He really was here, but he left.

504
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,640
Do you usually take this good care of each other?

505
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,160
Yeah, it’s normal.

506
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,360
Normal, but not quite.

507
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,280
Wine is cute, isn’t he?

508
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,920
Right?

509
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,200
He’s cute, right?

510
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,280
True.

511
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
He’s down bad.

512
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,920
Fai!

513
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,680
What?

514
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:40,960
Uh…

515
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,320
Oh.

516
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,880
No one’s as cute as Beagle, right?

517
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,000
I want to pinch your cheeks.

518
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,720
Hey!

519
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,680
Beagle’s cheeks are only for me.

520
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,720
Right?

521
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,960
Faifa, isn’t it?

522
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,880
Can we talk?

523
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,440
Someone saw you picking my partner up at the condo.

524
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,120
Which one?

525
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,800
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

526
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,600
Hey.

527
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,640
If you can’t talk nicely,

528
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,240
you’d better spend this time taking care of your partner.

529
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,160
Yotha!

530
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,160
Don’t fight at uni.

531
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,480
Don’t mess with my circle again

532
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,880
or don’t say I didn’t warn you.

533
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,440
It’s your kindness again, isn’t it,

534
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,040
that got you here?

535
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,240
Look at that frown.

536
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,880
“From Jan”

537
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,880
“Thank you for tying my shoelace.”

538
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,120
Can you eat that for me?

539
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
Is it a dark night?

540
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,120
Why’s the Electric Boy not shining?

541
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,880
What are you talking about?

542
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,680
Jan said,

543
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,320
“Can I treat you to dinner tonight?”

544
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,360
Why would she treat me?

545
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,520
I don’t know.

546
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,880
Maybe she wants to thank you for tying her shoelace.

547
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,160
Please.

548
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,120
I’ve tied the shoelaces of thousands of pairs of shoes.

549
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,800
You know that.

550
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,200
You know that.

551
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,960
I know that.

552
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,120
But the others don’t.

553
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What are you saying?

554
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,360
I’ve warned you before.

555
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
You don’t remember?

556
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,640
Being a good boy and a good person

557
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,000
will get you in trouble.

558
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,880
You said the same thing as Wine.

559
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,880
Wine said the same thing as I did?

560
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,880
About you being a good boy and a good person?

561
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,280
Hey.

562
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,880
What are you doing here, sleepyhead?

563
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,400
What did you run away from this time?

564
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,520
The question is, what did you run away from?

565
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,240
What are you talking about?

566
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,480
That makes no sense.

567
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Phuri told me everything.

568
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,840
I didn’t run away.

569
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,080
I just…

570
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,200
You just rejected a girl

571
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,840
and you’re feeling really bad about it.

572
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,760
Jan was crying so hard.

573
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,600
She said she thought I was flirting with her.

574
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,880
When I told her I didn’t think of her that way,

575
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,720
she wouldn’t stop crying.

576
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,640
This is exactly why

577
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,200
I don’t like saying no to people.

578
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,880
But why did you reject her this time?

579
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,920
If this was before,

580
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,680
you’d have gone on a dinner date with her

581
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,680
and done what she asked.

582
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,080
It’s because I’m trying to change for someone.

583
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,240
Someone who came into my life out of the blue

584
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,640
and made me realize what it’s like

585
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,360
when someone’s more special than anyone else.

586
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,640
Why wouldn’t you let me give you a ride to your dorm?

587
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,120
You don’t seem okay

588
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,120
so I want to keep you company.

589
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,320
You think I’m not okay?

590
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,840
Mm.

591
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,040
Why are you looking at me?

592
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,800
Are you just going to sit here quietly to keep me company?

593
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
When I’m not okay and you’re there to keep me company,

594
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,600
I feel better.

595
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,520
So I think being here for you right now

596
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,840
should help you feel better too.

597
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,400
But if it doesn’t, I can leave.

598
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,840
Can I hug you?

599
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,200
No.

600
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,760
Faifa.

601
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,400
Hmm?

602
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,880
Can I ask you something?

603
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,960
I have a lot of things to ask you too.

604
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,160
You said you’re trying to change for someone.

605
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,720
And you said

606
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,920
I’m special to you.

607
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,200
Does that mean what I think it means?

608
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
You think I’ve really fallen for you, right?

609
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,280
What if I have?

610
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,200
Would you be okay with that?

611
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,000
You think I wouldn’t be okay with that?

612
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,000
Well, we didn’t start off like that.

613
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
You have someone you’re into

614
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,440
and I’m just here to help.

615
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,280
In your opinion,

616
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,760
how do you think our story should end?

617
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,160
You end up with the person you like,

618
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,520
I guess.

619
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,880
Last night, Jay asked me if I’m still into Tor.

620
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,400
I answered him without hesitation that I’m not.

621
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,840
Then he asked me if I’m into you,

622
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,320
but I couldn’t answer him.

623
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,320
Why couldn’t you?

624
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,480
Maybe because

625
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,800
I’m not sure what the answer is.

626
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,440
How about we figure it out together?

627
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
When I turn around and see you,

628
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,120
I feel so comfortable.

629
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,720
Come on. It’s late.

630
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,360
Go take a shower.

631
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,280
Okay.

632
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,280
Calm down, Wine.

633
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You’ve fallen for Faifa, haven’t you?

634
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,200
You can take time to figure it out.

635
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,200
Take your time, okay?

636
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,200
Come sleep on the bed with me.

637
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,840
It’s fine.

638
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,120
I move around in my sleep.

639
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,600
Me too.

640
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,280
Come on.

641
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,600
Come on!

642
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,440
- Wine.
- Faifa.

643
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,960
- You go first.
- You go first.

644
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,200
You go first.

645
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,000
You’re feeling better now, right?

646
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,880
Yes.

647
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,320
I’m okay.

648
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,840
What were you going to say?

649
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,240
I was going to say

650
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,960
I might seem a bit crazy

651
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,200
and do things without thinking.

652
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,520
If I do something that upsets you,

653
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
you can tell me.

654
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,880
You can be yourself when you’re with me.

655
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,000
Are you sure?

656
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,800
I’m weird, you know?

657
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
I know.

658
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,640
You can be completely yourself too when you’re with me.

659
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,760
What you see is who I am.

660
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,880
It’s no different from this.

661
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,800
Hmm.

662
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
Actually, I want you to always be like this.

663
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,120
♪ From ordinary days, you've made them special now ♪

664
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:29,120
♪ From lonely skies above, I see the stars somehow ♪

665
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,600
♪ From a life so alone, now surrounded by hope ♪

666
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,240
Good night, sleepyhead.

667
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,880
Good night, quirky boy.

668
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,800
♪ 'Cause you have come ♪

669
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,000
♪ To fill all the missing spaces ♪

670
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,120

671
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,360

♪ A love I’d never seen before ♪

673
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
Wa.

674
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,560
It’s my first day of work.

675
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,800
Can I get some encouragement?

676
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,120
It’s your first day of work.

677
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,000
Don’t cause trouble at your dad’s company.

678
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,040
That’s all?

679
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,080
I’m glad to see this better version of you.

680
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,880
And I’m so proud of you, Klao.

681
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,680
Wa.

682
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,840
You should be really proud of yourself too.

683
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,800
Because of you,

684
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,800
I want to be a better person.

685
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,160
When I’m rich,

686
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,000
I’ll ask for your family's blessing to marry you.

687
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,520
Ouch!

688
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,480
Hurry up and go to work.

689
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,480
Being the son of the company owner

690
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,880
doesn’t mean you can be late.

691
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,400
I know.

692
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:57,960
Go.

693
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,240
Why did you button my shirt so high?

694
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,960
What should I do?

695
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,560
What should I do?

696
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,280
What should I do?

697
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,240
Faifa.

698
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,760
Wine.

699
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,720
Please help me. I beg you.

700
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
What’s wrong?

701
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,240
Did you get into an accident?

702
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,840
No.

703
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,520
Do you have a stomachache?

704
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,280
No.

705
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,960
Are you sick?

706
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,480
No.

707
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,080
Did you accidentally kick the bed?

708
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,720
Not really lately.

709
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,200
Did a mosquito bite you?

710
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,360
I already slapped it.

711
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:25,840
Do you have diarrhea?

712
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,360
I’ve already recovered.

713
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:26,760
Did a snake bite you?

714
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,880
I’ll call the rescue team.

715
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,280
Then what’s wrong?

716
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,560
After what happened yesterday,

717
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,240
I’ve been thinking all night

718
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,240
that I’ll completely stop being kind all the time.

719
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,360
How will you do that?

720
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,640
By disappearing.

721
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,840
Are you crazy?

722
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
You can’t just disappear.

723
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,680
You still have to see them at uni.

724
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,560
Your phone is buzzing non-stop right now.

725
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,520
Why?

726
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,840
I have to pick up my friends who live nearby to go to uni together.

727
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,880
How many people?

728
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
About

729
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,600
5 or 6 people.

730
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,040
You can just message them
that you can’t do it anymore.

731
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,640
Will they be okay?

732
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,200
With what?

733
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,720
With being rejected.

734
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
You worry too much.

735
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,120
If you can’t do it, just…

736
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,920
My password is eight 1s.

737
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,240
Can you handle this for me?

738
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,600
Me?

739
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,920
Yes, you.

740
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,480
He pinned my chat.

741
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,600
Why?

742
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,200
How much did the dry cleaning cost?

743
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,520
I’ll transfer the money to you.

744
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,520
Don’t worry about it.

745
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,880
Consider it a thank you for saving my life.

746
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,280
Here you go.

747
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,480
A reward for doing well.

748
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Doing well in what?

749
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,560
Rejecting people.

750
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,520
If you have a good reason, it’s not a bad thing to do.

751
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,720
I just messaged them that from now on,

752
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,280
you won’t have time to give them rides

753
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,120
because you have rehearsals for the star contest.

754
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,880
Everyone understands and has no problem with it.

755
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,480
You’re good.

756
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,800
You’re the one who makes it difficult from the start.

757
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,160
Not everyone will feel bad about being rejected.

758
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,520
Some might even feel good to know the truth.

759
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Why would they feel good?

760
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,240
People who really mean well for you

761
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,880
won’t want to make you feel uncomfortable.

762
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,720
If you’re busy, they’re willing to understand.

763
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,400
You’re not the center of the world for everyone to rely on.

764
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,240
You’re just human

765
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,640
like me and everyone else.

766
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,720
So cute.

767
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,720
You know how I’d solve this problem if you didn’t help me?

768
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,880
How?

769
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,040
I’d buy a motorbike.

770
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,720
The one-seater kind.

771
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,760
Luckily, I came into your life in time.

772
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,920
I’m really lucky you came into my life.

Hey.

779
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,840
Whose car is blocking mine?

780
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,960
They put on the hand brake.

781
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,480
Can you try lifting it?

782
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,400
Are you crazy?

783
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,480
Just kidding.

784
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,360
Let’s wait in the car.

785
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,480
I’ll call the condo staff.

786
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,600
Faifa.

787
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,640
What’s love for you?

788
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,240
Why do you ask?

789
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,880
Just curious

790
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,880
and wanted to chat to kill time.

791
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,760
I have no idea.

792
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,240
What? But you’re teaching me love.

793
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,480
How could you not know?

794
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,480
Haven’t you heard that

795
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
when you’re a coach,
you don’t have to be in the game yourself?

796
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,240
Have you ever wanted to be in the game yourself?

797
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,960
You brought me into the game last night, Wine.

798
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,240
I think I know now.

799
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,080
Sorry?

800
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,360
Love is feeling so damn happy

801
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,600
when I see him rejecting someone else

802
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,000
to be with me.

803
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,960
You like Faifa.

804
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,960
Well done.

805
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,160
Why don’t you guys date already?

806
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,640
I’ve come up with a plan.

807
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,240
Here, Wine.

808
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,240
This is the group bracelet.

809
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,240
I need to get the Perfect 10 Liners bracelet.

810
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,760
Can you come with me?

811
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,520
Sure.

812
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,600
When you were singing and looking down,

813
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,320
you looked so charming.

814
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,960
You felt that way?

815
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,400
♪ Don’t be mad if I catch feelings for you ♪
