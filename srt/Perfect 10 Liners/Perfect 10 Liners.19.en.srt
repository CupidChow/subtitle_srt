1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,685
It seems like he has a problem.

2
00:00:01,853 --> 00:00:04,539
This foster mentor will take care of Wine.

3
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:06,503
You weren’t always afraid of
socializing, were you?

4
00:00:08,165 --> 00:00:09,551
Every problem can be solved.

5
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:11,318
It was solved because of your help.

6
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:14,472
If I can help make everything better for you,

7
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:15,660
I will.

8
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:17,379
I’m heartbroken.

9
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:19,370
I’m into men.

10
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:21,819
Do you hate me

11
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:23,154
for who I am?

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,244
You make my heart flutter so much.

13
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:29,077
How could I hate you?

14
00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:38,927
Did I kiss you that night?

15
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:42,503
Do you want the real answer,
or one to make you feel better?

16
00:00:43,786 --> 00:00:46,841
Do you know what answer
would make me feel better?

17
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:48,037
Hmm.

18
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,063
Probably something like,

19
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,665
“No, you didn’t kiss me.”

20
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:54,223
“It’s just in your dream.”

21
00:00:56,687 --> 00:00:59,303
But you just kissed me.

22
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:01,042
That’s just in my dream too.

23
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,398
I’m sorry

24
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:09,269
if I did something bad that night.

25
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,700
I was really drunk.

26
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:13,102
Never mind what happened between us.

27
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:14,245
Don’t worry too much.

28
00:01:15,645 --> 00:01:16,823
Whatever happens,

29
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:19,296
I’ll never turn my back on you.

30
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:21,506
I already promised you that.

31
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:32,265
Actually, there’s one more thing
I want to tell you.

32
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:15,115
So you broke up with your girlfriend

33
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:18,940
because you realized you had feelings
for her older brother?

34
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,506
I never told anyone that.

35
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:24,405
Not even Toey.

36
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,680
I never told her.

37
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,155
All that time, I felt really good about her.

38
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:33,080
When I broke up with her,

39
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,071
I wasn’t even sure of anything.

40
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,985
I wasn’t sure if I really stopped loving her.

41
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,564
I wasn’t sure if I really liked Tor.

42
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:43,899
But because I wasn’t sure,

43
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,051
I didn’t want her to risk it with me.

44
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,037
Is this why you refuse to meet new people?

45
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:54,428
I guess so.

46
00:03:57,354 --> 00:03:59,093
You’re blaming yourself, you know that?

47
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,398
And you’re scared of things
that haven’t happened.

48
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:06,431
You’re scared Toey will be mad

49
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,783
if she finds out the real reason
you broke up with her.

50
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:10,942
You’re scared to go back to your dorm

51
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:12,789
because you’re scared to face Jay.

52
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:15,725
You’re scared people won’t accept
that you’re into men.

53
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:17,600
Scared that I also won’t, right?

54
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,604
So how do you feel about who I am?

55
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,672
How do you think I should feel?

56
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,911
You probably think that
I’m trying to approach you

57
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,072
and you might hate me.

58
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,505
You’re good at guessing people’s minds.

59
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,395
Does that mean…?

60
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,700
You’re good at guessing, assuming,

61
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,165
and imagining things.

62
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:48,752
You’re also very pessimistic.

63
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:49,278
Ouch!

64
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:51,001
Why did you pinch my cheeks?

65
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:52,974
Love is love, Wine.

66
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:55,802
There are no rules or discrimination.

67
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,150
You can’t worry about
everyone else’s feelings in the world.

68
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,140
But you care about everyone
in the world yourself.

69
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:05,380
No.

70
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:07,862
At first, maybe.

71
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,826
But then there’ll be someone
who feels more special to you.

72
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:14,180
Just one person.

73
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:20,339
Do you think

74
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:23,700
Jay will be able to accept me for who I am?

75
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,186
Before you expect others to accept who you are,

76
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,200
you must accept who you are first.

77
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,426
You’re not different from the others.

78
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:32,958
You’re normal, Wine.

79
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:36,620
Okay.

80
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:38,602
I’ll go back to the dorm

81
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:40,130
and stop running away from my problems.

82
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:42,637
Way to go.

83
00:05:44,463 --> 00:05:45,813
But you have to give me a ride.

84
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:47,840
Let’s go.

85
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,475
If anything is unusual,

86
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:02,801
it’s the fact that I’m somehow happy

87
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,859
to know you’re into men.

88
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:24,900
If you need anything, call me anytime.

89
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:26,525
Okay.

90
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:28,788
Go talk it out with your friend.

91
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:31,078
Just be honest with your feelings, okay?

92
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:36,345
Come on.

93
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:47,964
Faifa.

94
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,499
I’m boosting your energy.

95
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:07,404
All done.

96
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:08,908
I just gave you a blessing

97
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,162
to keep you safe

98
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:12,475
and tear-free.

99
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:17,149
Faifa,

100
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:20,183
are you nice to everyone around you?

101
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:21,828
Hmm?

102
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:23,407
To me,

103
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:25,696
what you do is really special.

104
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:28,682
Hmm.

105
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:32,758
I never understood what “special” means,

106
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:36,607
but I’ll try to understand

107
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,431
and you’ll be the first I use that word with.

108
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,370
I’M GOING TO EAT THEM ALL BUT I’LL KEEP ONE PIECE.
THANK YOU, TOR.

109
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,480
HAPPY BIRTHDAY. STAY FOCUSED ON YOUR STUDIES.
FROM TOR :)

110
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:31,797
I found out for a while
before Wine broke up with me.

111
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:35,672
I accidentally found his memory box

112
00:08:36,228 --> 00:08:37,694
which was full of Tor.

113
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,617
I had hoped that one day
Wine would explain everything to me.

114
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:45,629
Anything, just not staying quiet.

115
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:54,601
I didn’t think Wine would choose
to break up with me.

116
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:00,500
Are you still mad at him?

117
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,700
I was at first.

118
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,697
But my partner said that

119
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:09,204
Wine may have chosen not to tell the truth

120
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:13,856
because he thought that was
the best way to protect my feelings.

121
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:22,237
Jay.

122
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:24,644
So you like Tor?

123
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:27,626
You really have feelings for Toey’s brother?

124
00:09:34,177 --> 00:09:35,906
I’m sorry for hiding this from you all this time

125
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,601
and for not telling you

126
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,357
about who I am.

127
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:46,773
Save that for when you tell me
you have the last stage of cancer.

128
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:48,734
Don’t give me that now.

129
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,305
What do you mean?

130
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,557
Look at your face.

131
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:55,610
You look like you’ve come to say goodbye to me.

132
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,521
I’m just scared you can’t accept that I’m…

133
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:05,697
You’re my friend.

134
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:08,920
Nothing else matters.

135
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,859
Are you crazy, Wine?

136
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,500
How many years have we been friends?

137
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:15,974
Did you really think I can’t accept this?

138
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,500
Seriously.

139
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:18,888
You’re such an idiot.

140
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,416
You haven’t scolded me, right?

141
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:28,503
Not yet.

142
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:29,512
I was just saying.

143
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:31,377
By the way,

144
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:33,191
Toey asked me to tell you something.

145
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:35,936
Is it harsh?

146
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:38,265
My heart is so sensitive right now.

147
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:39,976
She asked me to tell you that

148
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:42,330
Tor is into men too,

149
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,103
and she’s okay if you two want to start talking.

150
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:51,405
Aren’t you happy to hear that?

151
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,608
Should I be happy?

152
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:57,804
You have a chance to be with Tor.

153
00:11:03,216 --> 00:11:03,764
Wine?

154
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:05,933
What’s wrong?

155
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:10,576
Let me hug you again.

156
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,451
Thank you so much for understanding me.

157
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:15,703
Mm.

158
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:17,777
Hey.

159
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,890
You don’t have to love me that much.

160
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:21,122
This is the way to do it.

161
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:22,040
Come on.

162
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:36,445
Are you calling Tor?

163
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,180
Faifa.

164
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,700
(What’s up? How did it go?)

165
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:41,795
Very well.

166
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:43,379
Much better than I expected.

167
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,088
(Really?)

168
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:47,173
Yes.

169
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:49,459
I’ll tell you more when I see you.

170
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:51,377
I don’t want to do this over the phone.

171
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,494
(You want to tell me in person?)

172
00:11:52,508 --> 00:11:54,130
I want to see your face when you hear it.

173
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,906
(There’s an innovation called
video call, you know?)

174
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,706
It’s not the same.

175
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:00,801
(Okay.)

176
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,442
(Tell me when we see each other then.)

177
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,274
(But I bet things are going great.)

178
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,767
Why do you think so?

179
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:06,998
(I can tell from your voice.)

180
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,605
(You’re back to being the cheerful Wine
I met in your school uniform.)

181
00:12:13,296 --> 00:12:15,048
Where are you, by the way?

182
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,524
Did you get to your condo yet?

183
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:17,851
(A long time ago.)

184
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:20,257
(I turned my ringer to the loudest,
waiting for your call.)

185
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:21,657
You were waiting for me to call you?

186
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,840
(I was worried you’d be
a crying baby like this morning.)

187
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:25,971
(I’d rush to take care of you.)

188
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:27,158
I didn’t cry.

189
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:28,416
(Alright.)

190
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:30,130
(You just had tears welling up in your eyes.)

191
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,072
(But if one day you cry,)

192
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,900
(promise me I'll be the first you run to.)

193
00:12:34,564 --> 00:12:35,247
Why?

194
00:12:36,444 --> 00:12:37,829
(Because you’re the only one I want to comfort.)

195
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,174
(Now go to sleep, or you won’t grow up.)

196
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:48,714
Okay.

197
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,306
You should go to sleep too.

198
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:52,965
Good night.

199
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:54,631
(Good night.)

200
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:09,757
♪ You might be unsure about what this could be ♪

201
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:14,521
♪ You might not know what we could be ♪

202
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:16,066
♪ Are we just friends ♪

203
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:19,589
♪ Or something more? ♪

204
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:24,257
♪ Or is there a line that we’re about to cross? ♪

205
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:51,493
Where are you rushing off to?

206
00:13:51,517 --> 00:13:52,324
See you at uni.

207
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:55,115
Aren’t you going with Ben?

208
00:13:57,684 --> 00:13:58,715
What’s up with him?

209
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,536
Someone asked me to talk to you guys.

210
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:05,204
The campus star contest this year is very quiet.

211
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,820
Not many people are interested.

212
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:09,742
I’m not surprised it’s not popular anymore.

213
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,709
There’s so much more to do than watching
good-looking people show their talents.

214
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:14,967
You’re right.

215
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:18,602
I heard this year’s contest will be the last.

216
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,370
I don’t want it to end on a low note.

217
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:22,700
Is there anything we can do?

218
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,522
Well,

219
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:28,638
the head of the contest wants
Yotha and Faifa to help promote it.

220
00:14:31,592 --> 00:14:32,400
I’m good.

221
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:34,400
Faifa is better at that.

222
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,700
Are you throwing this on me?

223
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:36,700
Why won’t you do it?

224
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:39,482
- Don’t you love being with the crowd?
- Why is this any of my business?

225
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:40,957
They asked you too.

226
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:41,739
I don’t like it.

227
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:42,798
Why won’t you do it?

228
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:43,988
You’re my big brother.

229
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:45,214
Come on.

230
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:46,005
Hey, Gun.

231
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,229
I was in the faculty star contest, you know?

232
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,580
- Really?
- Yeah.

233
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:52,770
Then why didn’t you win?

234
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,502
- Uh…
- Uh…

235
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,056
Well…

236
00:14:58,368 --> 00:15:01,499
Arm fell off the stage during the audition round.

237
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:03,802
We almost didn’t get him to the hospital in time.

238
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,041
Really?

239
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,205
Was it so bad that he needed to go to the hospital?

240
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:08,613
It wasn’t serious,

241
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:11,560
but Arc freaked out at the staff

242
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:13,188
and got him out of the contest.

243
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:14,805
I guess he was worried.

244
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,905
Did Arc fall in love with Arm at first sight?

245
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:23,862
Probably the first time they met.

246
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,198
But Arc was being Arc.

247
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:28,757
He hit on Arm the way male leads in the novel do,

248
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,699
- acting cold, pretending not to care, and cute.
- Stop it, Pun.

249
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:33,225
Why?

250
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,420
It’s cute.

251
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:36,405
I want to know

252
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:38,720
what falling in love with someone feels like.

253
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:40,617
What?

254
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,174
A coach like you is going to get into the game?

255
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,697
A coach like me gets lonely too, okay?

256
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:47,238
You’re not the only one who can date.

257
00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:49,801
Hey.

258
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,696
Falling in love with someone is amazing, Faifa.

259
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,835
I want you to give it a try.

260
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:58,210
I’m waiting for heaven to send me someone too.

261
00:15:58,872 --> 00:15:59,440
Amen.

262
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:01,777
Ouch!

263
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,197
Wine!

264
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:04,385
Are you okay?

265
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:06,100
Where are you rushing off to?

266
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:09,878
I rushed here to see Faifa.

267
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:11,194
Come with me.

268
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:11,734
Wait.

269
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,819
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

270
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:14,496
No.

271
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:15,315
Come on. Let’s go.

272
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:15,903
Where?

273
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,282
Come on!

274
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,757
I’ll be back.

275
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:22,463
Heaven was fast.

276
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,774
He rolled in here like a ball.

277
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,862
We’re lucky it started raining just as we entered.

278
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:39,294
What do you want to tell me?

279
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:42,600
It’s my treat today.

280
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:45,837
Just tell me what it is.

281
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:47,337
I’m excited for you.

282
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:49,669
I’ve talked to Jay.

283
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:51,131
He understands me.

284
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:52,595
See?

285
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:54,699
I told you it’s all in your head.

286
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,219
And the second thing is

287
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,645
Toey asked Jay to tell me that

288
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:00,872
she’s not mad at me anymore

289
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:02,800
and she wants us to be friends again.

290
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:04,441
That’s great.

291
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:06,594
The last thing...

292
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:08,890
is about Tor.

293
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:11,042
He told his family

294
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:12,718
he’s not into women.

295
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:21,848
Really?

296
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:22,912
Yeah.

297
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,102
Is something wrong?

298
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:32,211
No.

299
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:35,471
I’m just so happy that I don’t know what to say.

300
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,567
So this means you have a chance, right?

301
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:44,004
Not really.

302
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,142
Just because Tor is into men
doesn’t mean he’s into me.

303
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:50,927
Well…

304
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:56,084
Are you still into him?

305
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,977
Are you still into him or not?

306
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:10,066
I guess I am.

307
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:20,660
If you’re still into him,

308
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:23,940
I’ll help you.

309
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:28,502
I’ll make your wish come true.

310
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:54,053
Ready?

311
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,542
Is this one of the ways to flirt?

312
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:02,002
It’s so romantic to be under
an engineering jacket with someone you like.

313
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,456
Ready?

314
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:28,671
Run!

315
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,342
Tor is not in Engineering.

316
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,512
Why didn’t you tell me that?

317
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:48,302
Oh.

318
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:50,320
You’re a soaked puppy.

319
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:54,531
I can say the same about you.

320
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:56,474
It’s called a wet look.

321
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,010
Can you translate that?

322
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:03,600
I’m bad at English.

323
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:06,127
It means

324
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,014
I look super handsome.

325
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:11,878
I’m going to class.

326
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:13,044
Wait.

327
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,448
Here you go.

328
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:20,834
Why are you giving me this?

329
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,082
I’m flirting.

330
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:27,499
What?

331
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:31,069
I mean this is one of the ways
you try to win someone over.

332
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,045
Give them something to represent your feelings

333
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:34,986
so you’ll miss each other when you’re apart.

334
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,066
A snack?

335
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:38,801
Yeah.

336
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:41,247
When you eat this snack, you’ll think of me.

337
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,845
Don’t leave right after class.

338
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:45,096
I’ll come to pick you up.

339
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:46,965
Why?

340
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,213
Because when you have a big goal,

341
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,774
you can’t go about it randomly.

342
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:55,797
You’re right,

343
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,720
because if you go about it randomly,

344
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:00,911
you’ll become a soaked puppy like this.

345
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:07,263
I’m going to class now.

346
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,600
Pay attention in your class, okay?

347
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:10,360
Mm.

348
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:11,417
I’m going now.

349
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:12,435
Bye.

350
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:20,840
Do you miss me yet?

351
00:21:22,112 --> 00:21:22,585
Mm.

352
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:24,397
I’m going now.

353
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:25,571
Bye-bye.

354
00:21:40,952 --> 00:21:43,183
Why didn’t you wait and come with us today?

355
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,524
Jay was wondering why you were in a rush.

356
00:21:47,402 --> 00:21:48,130
I had an errand to run.

357
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:51,059
Why don’t you tell Ben

358
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,586
you were in a rush to film an MV with Faifa?

359
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:54,961
What MV?

360
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:03,902
I was just…

361
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:12,474
Excuse me.

362
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,054
So what was it?

363
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,813
Was your errand playing in the rain with Faifa?

364
00:22:51,157 --> 00:22:52,074
No.

365
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:53,380
Nothing’s going on.

366
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,705
Pay attention in class.

367
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:55,709
What are you talking about?

368
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,127
The teacher isn’t even here yet.

369
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:58,142
Come on.

370
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:04,503
Your friend’s acting weird.

371
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:05,997
He’s your friend too.

372
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,626
This weather is perfect for sleeping.

373
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:29,441
Hey.

374
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:32,960
Electric Boy.

375
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,370
What happened to you?

376
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:37,182
Why is your shirt so wet like this, man?

377
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,035
Are you fishing for attention?

378
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,974
Showing off your hot body?

379
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:43,471
Fishing for attention, my ass.

380
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:44,520
Are you crazy?

381
00:23:44,897 --> 00:23:46,128
Didn’t you see it was raining earlier?

382
00:23:46,235 --> 00:23:47,125
I was walking in the rain.

383
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:48,574
I saw it was raining.

384
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,278
But why would you be
dumb enough to walk in the rain?

385
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,820
Don’t ask too many questions.

386
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:56,459
By the way, are you going to the cafe today?

387
00:23:56,848 --> 00:23:57,474
Yeah.

388
00:23:57,982 --> 00:23:59,804
Can you book a table for me?

389
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,235
Ah.

390
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:04,322
A big table for a group date like usual, right?

391
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:05,518
You got it.

392
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:06,174
No.

393
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:07,604
A small table will do.

394
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:08,691
It’ll be only two people.

395
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:09,835
Hey.

396
00:24:11,124 --> 00:24:13,533
How can a small table handle you?

397
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:15,576
You should book a big table.

398
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:16,131
Come on.

399
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,743
Just do as I say.

400
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:20,025
A small table is fine, got it?

401
00:24:20,924 --> 00:24:21,365
Okay.

402
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:22,358
Yeah.

403
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,268
Stop with the big table, small table nonsense.

404
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:27,407
Are you cold?

405
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:29,496
Do I look like I’m hot?

406
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,568
Oh, why didn’t you tell me?

407
00:24:30,641 --> 00:24:31,958
I’m worried about you, buddy.

408
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,493
Great.

409
00:24:34,244 --> 00:24:35,482
I’m sleepy.

410
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:36,118
Good night.

411
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:37,130
Enjoy your sleep.

412
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:38,493
Damn it.

413
00:24:38,908 --> 00:24:40,274
I should’ve stopped being friends
with you a long time ago.

414
00:24:47,222 --> 00:24:48,660
Hey, wait a second, guys.

415
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,490
“BROKEN”
DON’T PLAY WITH THE BUTTONS.

416
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,465
Wine, hurry up!

417
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:07,503
Fine.

418
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:09,986
Let’s go.

419
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,678
It’s so damn hot.

420
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:16,145
Why did the AC have to break down today?

421
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,075
You guys can leave without me today.

422
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:18,740
No need to wait.

423
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,715
- Where are you going?
- Hey, kids.

424
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:21,610
Are you done with classes?

425
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:22,835
Can I give you a ride?

426
00:25:23,037 --> 00:25:24,137
Hi, Faifa.

427
00:25:24,185 --> 00:25:25,912
- Hi.
- I’m going with Ben.

428
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:26,841
Oh.

429
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:29,355
Then you two can go ahead and have a meal together.

430
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:31,487
Wine will eat with me.

431
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:32,997
Okay.

432
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,631
Don’t worry.

433
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,842
I’ll drop him off.

434
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:38,745
Okay.

435
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:42,007
Let’s go.

436
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,355
Is that all your friends can say?

437
00:25:44,722 --> 00:25:45,349
See you later.

438
00:25:46,654 --> 00:25:47,376
See you, kids.

439
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:48,752
Okay.

440
00:25:49,136 --> 00:25:49,834
You said that again.

441
00:26:04,748 --> 00:26:05,254
What are you doing?

442
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,908
Preparing lecture notes for Wine?

443
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:08,093
Mm.

444
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,628
I’ll help.

445
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,453
Wait, but you and Wine are in different majors.

446
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,002
So you only have to prepare the notes
for the foundation courses, right?

447
00:26:22,385 --> 00:26:23,102
Mostly.

448
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:29,545
Hey.

449
00:26:35,545 --> 00:26:36,160
Why are you smiling?

450
00:26:38,508 --> 00:26:39,211
We did it.

451
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,480
IF WE GET AN A IN THIS SUBJECT,
WE’LL MOVE TO A CONDO TOGETHER.

452
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,890
GET READY TO PACK YOUR BAGS.

453
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:46,576
I studied so hard back then.

454
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:47,762
It was so exhausting.

455
00:26:48,354 --> 00:26:50,167
It’s not like you had to put in that much effort.

456
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:51,334
You’re really smart in school.

457
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,859
I’m the one who was studying my eyes out.

458
00:26:57,346 --> 00:26:57,962
I’m so happy.

459
00:26:58,591 --> 00:26:59,210
About what?

460
00:26:59,822 --> 00:27:00,979
Happy to know

461
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:02,362
you wanted to move in with me, Beagle.

462
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,333
Of course, I did.

463
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,400
What should be our goal this year?

464
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:12,325
If we get an A,

465
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,562
should we go on vacation to
another city or country?

466
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:18,810
Make sure you can actually do it first.

467
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:21,928
How about a bigger goal than that?

468
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,000
If we graduate with honors,

469
00:27:24,887 --> 00:27:26,096
I’ll move you to my house, Beagle.

470
00:27:27,352 --> 00:27:28,094
What are you talking about?

471
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,001
Do we have a deal?

472
00:27:29,555 --> 00:27:30,928
Get back to preparing the lecture notes.

473
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,397
I want you to move into my house.

474
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,438
I’m so in love with you, Beagle.

475
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:36,527
You know?

476
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,765
I love you so much.

477
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:40,945
I love you too.

478
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,368
Order everything you want now

479
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:49,297
before we start our long tutoring session.

480
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,432
Hey,

481
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:52,457
Phuri.

482
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,137
Hmm?

483
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,194
Get me some Sharpies.

484
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:56,755
Hey, man.

485
00:27:56,869 --> 00:27:57,801
This is a coffee shop.

486
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,216
Electric Boy.

487
00:28:00,162 --> 00:28:01,247
This is not a stationery shop.

488
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,167
I know this is a coffee shop

489
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,961
but I know you have Sharpies here.

490
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:06,771
Fine.

491
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:14,900
Oh, this is my friend Phuri.

492
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:16,299
This is my mentee Wine.

493
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:17,360
Oh.

494
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,983
Why don’t you two Wai first

495
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:26,770
then shake hands afterward?

496
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:29,385
- Hi.
- Hi.

497
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:31,376
Nice to meet you.

498
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:32,838
Are you done?

499
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,611
I thought you said your
“password” mentee was a girl.

500
00:28:39,656 --> 00:28:40,462
“Password”?

501
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,902
Oh, you mean code mentee.

502
00:28:43,072 --> 00:28:43,509
Yeah.

503
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:44,786
Look at you being witty.

504
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:46,900
He’s Yotha’s mentee.

505
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:49,560
Why is he with you?

506
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:51,180
Yotha spends all his time taking care of Gun

507
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:52,906
so he has no time for anything else.

508
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,699
That’s why I’m taking care of him instead.

509
00:28:54,848 --> 00:28:56,802
Oh, I see.

510
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:00,314
You’re taking care of him, huh?

511
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,697
Come on.

512
00:29:04,404 --> 00:29:05,900
Now get me “Crow Mouth.”

513
00:29:06,284 --> 00:29:07,017
Get what?

514
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:07,930
“Crow Mouth”

515
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,802
as in Sharpies, duh!

516
00:29:10,025 --> 00:29:12,445
You need a lot more practice
if you want to be an English boy.

517
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:14,299
Go get me “Crow Mouth” now.

518
00:29:14,448 --> 00:29:15,648
Make yourself at home, Wine.

519
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:17,155
Let me know if you need anything.

520
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:18,748
Thank you, Phuri.

521
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:20,579
Nice to meet you.

522
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:22,776
Later.

523
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,546
What are we doing?

524
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:46,502
Tor was the first guy
you were interested in, right?

525
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:48,708
That’s okay.

526
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:51,296
I’ll teach you love.

527
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:55,254
By drawing on the notebook cover?

528
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:56,112
No.

529
00:29:58,561 --> 00:29:59,801
Let me interview you.

530
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,300
Did you or your most recent ex
make the first move?

531
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:03,829
Toey did.

532
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,980
Have you ever made the first move with anyone?

533
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:08,749
I knew it.

534
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,331
You have a long way to go.

535
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:12,795
Let’s start with the first course.

536
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:14,841
I’ll teach you how to win someone over.

537
00:30:16,268 --> 00:30:17,967
Teach me how to win someone over?

538
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:19,112
We’ll start with this.

539
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,964
Try writing something down.

540
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:24,318
Why should I?

541
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:27,096
To show that it’s yours.

542
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,250
WITSAWA

543
00:30:39,143 --> 00:30:39,634
That’s all?

544
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:41,601
It’s just to show that it’s mine.

545
00:30:43,432 --> 00:30:43,900
Fine.

546
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,490
WITSAWA AND FAIFA

547
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:49,998
Alright.
WITSAWA AND FAIFA

548
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:50,410
WITSAWA AND FAIFA

549
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:52,813
Let’s start.

550
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,256
5 WAYS TO WIN SOMEONE’S HEART (CRASH COURSE)

551
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,393
1. HAVE A MEAL TOGETHER 10 TIMES
2. DO WHAT THEY LIKE 5 TIMES

552
00:30:58,403 --> 00:30:59,370
3. PICK THEM UP - DROP THEM OFF 5 TIMES
4. HANG OUT TOGETHER 3 TIMES

553
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,743
But I...
5. STAY THE NIGHT AT THEIR PLACE 1 TIME

554
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,236
I don’t know how to drive.

555
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,899
I’ll make an exception.

556
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,074
It’s the thought that counts.

557
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:08,404
I’ll drive.

558
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:12,100
Why are we doing this?

559
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,100
Do you really not know anything?

560
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:19,837
Love grows from being close.

561
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:22,991
You slowly get into their life

562
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:25,426
and become more important to them.

563
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:27,520
Before you know it,
you can’t live without each other.

564
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:31,960
Who am I supposed to do this with?

565
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,471
You really are new to this.

566
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:36,706
No one’s asking you to jump into the real thing yet.

567
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:38,245
Just give it a try with me,

568
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,256
and I’ll tell you if it works or not.

569
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:51,871
Are you going anywhere this evening?

570
00:31:53,576 --> 00:31:54,131
No.

571
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:55,010
Let’s go for a run.

572
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:56,271
Go for a run?

573
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:57,231
Let’s work out.

574
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,903
People who are trying to win each other over
do activities together, you know?

575
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,262
But it’s not in your guide.

576
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,336
Come on.

577
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,370
6. WORK OUT TOGETHER 1 TIME

578
00:32:15,945 --> 00:32:17,687
I’ll go change and grab my shoes.

579
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,601
Let’s meet back here in an hour, okay?

580
00:32:22,026 --> 00:32:22,543
Uh…

581
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:23,454
I’ll be back.

582
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:35,780
Let’s get started.

583
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:37,100
How many are we doing?

584
00:32:38,148 --> 00:32:39,767
How many what?

585
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:40,682
Would 10 laps be enough?

586
00:32:41,017 --> 00:32:41,724
- Huh?
- Let’s go.

587
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,008
Come on!

588
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:51,205
10 laps? Really?

589
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,477
You see that bench over there?

590
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,687
I’ll get to sit there, right?

591
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:56,397
I’ll tell people to move it away from you.

592
00:32:57,011 --> 00:32:58,260
Faifa!

593
00:33:02,671 --> 00:33:03,681
Don’t slip already.

594
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:04,364
Come on.

595
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,921
- Do we have to keep going?
- Yeah, let’s go.

596
00:33:06,866 --> 00:33:07,677
Are we really not going to sit down?

597
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,357
No.

598
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:08,931
Let’s go.

599
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:15,339
Here’s your water.

600
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,722
Drink slowly.

601
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,078
You don’t want to get a cramp
when we start running again.

602
00:33:22,945 --> 00:33:24,200
Who said I’ll keep running?

603
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,285
I’ll just die here.

604
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:37,306
Did it hurt when you slipped earlier?

605
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,358
No.

606
00:33:39,776 --> 00:33:40,463
Are you sure?

607
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:42,662
My knees just gave out.

608
00:33:48,002 --> 00:33:48,816
Careful, Jan!

609
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:53,041
Are you okay?

610
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:54,204
I’m fine.

611
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,112
Tie your laces tightly next time so you don’t slip.

612
00:33:58,567 --> 00:33:59,573
Thank you, Faifa.

613
00:34:00,195 --> 00:34:00,761
All done.

614
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,056
Do you come here often?

615
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:03,164
I come here to run alone.

616
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,188
I come here often too.

617
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:05,641
Let’s run together next time.

618
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:06,949
- Sure.
- Cool.

619
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:08,102
Run carefully.

620
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:17,654
Come on. Let me tie that for you.

621
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:19,496
I can tie it myself.

622
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,173
I can tie it tighter.

623
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:22,496
I’m sure you tie it for other people all the time.

624
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,180
Why?

625
00:34:24,715 --> 00:34:26,231
Do I have to tie it for you only?

626
00:34:28,848 --> 00:34:29,374
No.

627
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,029
Normal people just don’t tie
other people’s shoelaces.

628
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:35,354
Feet are considered low.

629
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:38,577
Did you grow up with your grandmother?

630
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,733
You’re so conservative.

631
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:48,748
Earlier,

632
00:34:49,592 --> 00:34:51,431
you bent down to tie that girl’s shoelace.

633
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,625
She might be overthinking it
and assuming you’re flirting with her.

634
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,232
I bent down to tie your shoelace just now.

635
00:34:57,475 --> 00:34:59,354
Do you think that I’m flirting with you?

636
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:06,911
Never mind what anyone thinks.

637
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,617
I know I do it just because I mean well.

638
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,145
It’s great that you mean well for others.

639
00:35:14,023 --> 00:35:15,336
But if you think about it
from another perspective,

640
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:19,345
it means you’re not giving
anyone special attention.

641
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:21,915
I treat everyone equally.

642
00:35:22,385 --> 00:35:23,176
How is that not fair?

643
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,401
If you have a special someone one day,

644
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,700
you’ll want to do something just for them.

645
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,877
Like letting them be the only one to lie on my lap?

646
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,887
Is that special?

647
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:39,703
I usually don’t let anyone lie on my lap.

648
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:45,063
Is this one of the flirting tips
you’re teaching me?

649
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,059
Call it general knowledge
outside of the classroom.

650
00:35:50,368 --> 00:35:51,912
Even though I’m not good in school,

651
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:56,112
I have a pretty good understanding of love.

652
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:59,441
I wonder how good you are.

653
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,059
How about we switch things up?

654
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,518
You don’t have to do all the teaching yourself.

655
00:36:07,891 --> 00:36:09,548
Let’s learn together.

656
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,702
Is that okay?

657
00:36:12,514 --> 00:36:13,640
That sounds like a love confession.

658
00:36:20,924 --> 00:36:21,585
I know, right?

659
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:25,770
The first point

660
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:28,091
goes to me.

661
00:36:36,797 --> 00:36:37,231
Let’s go.

662
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,200
Come on.

663
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:47,845
We’ve arrived.

664
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:49,410
Don’t forget to apply some muscle rub tonight.

665
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:50,637
You don’t want to wake up in pain tomorrow.

666
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:51,528
Okay.

667
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:54,998
I’m going to Newton’s bar later.

668
00:36:55,302 --> 00:36:56,282
There’s a party there.

669
00:36:57,277 --> 00:36:59,394
Why are you telling me this?

670
00:36:59,703 --> 00:37:01,962
We’re in the flirting stage. We should tell
each other what we’re doing, right?

671
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,160
To make the other feel comfortable.

672
00:37:03,748 --> 00:37:05,002
I see.

673
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:08,106
I’m going then.

674
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,090

6 WAYS TO WIN SOMEONE’S HEART (CRASH COURSE)

676
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,610
WORK OUT TOGETHER 1 TIME - CHECK

677
00:37:50,962 --> 00:37:52,056
Whoa.

678
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,345
Your legs are more muscular
than national team athletes.

679
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,537
Take off your shirt.

680
00:37:56,592 --> 00:37:57,441
Let’s see if you have a six-pack yet.

681
00:37:58,368 --> 00:37:59,540
Stop exaggerating, Jay.

682
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:01,037
Where have you been?

683
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:02,429
I went to get something to eat with Ben.

684
00:38:06,082 --> 00:38:06,696
Where’s my food?

685
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,666
Why didn’t you get me anything?

686
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,320
You didn’t even call to ask.

687
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,997
When you’re with Faifa,

688
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,441
you never come home hungry.

689
00:38:15,371 --> 00:38:16,856
He takes really good care of you.

690
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:18,311
We don’t even have to.

691
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,250
Hey.

692
00:38:28,946 --> 00:38:30,140
You froze, buddy.

693
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,290
WITSAWA AND FAIFA

694
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:07,811
Is this my glass?

695
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:08,308
Yeah.

696
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:13,191
Whoa.

697
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,130
Calm down.

698
00:39:15,472 --> 00:39:16,016
What’s wrong?

699
00:39:16,697 --> 00:39:17,299
I’m thirsty.

700
00:39:18,675 --> 00:39:19,328
He’s just like…

701
00:39:19,786 --> 00:39:20,377
Like what?

702
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:23,480
Like me when you broke up with me.

703
00:39:25,389 --> 00:39:25,905
Klao.

704
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:27,776
It’s true.

705
00:39:27,954 --> 00:39:29,287
I got wasted every day,

706
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:30,957
Feeling hurt like crazy.

707
00:39:32,105 --> 00:39:33,355
Scared of losing you to someone else.

708
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,401
If you take care of me well,

709
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:37,100
you won’t lose me to anyone.

710
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:40,534
Hey!

711
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,785
I’m not heartbroken.

712
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:45,651
I’m just thirsty.

713
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:47,915
Fine.

714
00:39:48,743 --> 00:39:50,709
Then just keep drinking, bro.

715
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:52,764
Drink until you throw up.

716
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:00,044
A brother like you is why my bar
keeps going into the red.

717
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:09,838
- Wine! Jay! Open the door! Hurry!
- What’s going on?

718
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:11,244
Wine! Jay!

719
00:40:11,314 --> 00:40:12,093
Hurry!

720
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:13,543
Keep your voice down!

721
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,019
The other rooms are going to scold us.

722
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,500
Pae is possessed by a ghost.

723
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:17,632
What?

724
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:21,051
Look at him.

725
00:40:21,272 --> 00:40:22,108
What the hell?

726
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:25,401
When I turned the lights on,
he was already like this.

727
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:27,943
He also said someone’s on top of the closet.

728
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:30,410
What do we do?

729
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:32,207
Does anyone have Buddhist amulets?

730
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:33,321
Yes, I do.

731
00:40:33,709 --> 00:40:34,257
Where are they?

732
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:35,408
Around his neck.

733
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,906
What?

734
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:03,586
Hello?

735
00:41:03,805 --> 00:41:04,642
He’s secretly smiling.

736
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,908
Don’t forget to stop and throw up.

737
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:07,100
Hello?

738
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:09,192
(Faifa! Help us!)

739
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,447
Why is it so loud on your end?

740
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:15,407
(You’re not drunk, right?)

741
00:41:16,165 --> 00:41:16,777
Not yet.

742
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:19,714
My friend Pae is being possessed by a ghost.

743
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,001
Say again?

744
00:41:23,278 --> 00:41:24,145
He’s laughing.

745
00:41:24,506 --> 00:41:25,284
What should we do?

746
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:27,527
Turn on the video call.

747
00:41:27,727 --> 00:41:28,654
Okay.

748
00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:35,105
Okay, everyone.

749
00:41:36,514 --> 00:41:37,392
Keep calm.

750
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:38,202
Keep calm.

751
00:41:38,903 --> 00:41:39,820
Don’t freak out.

752
00:41:40,484 --> 00:41:42,841
Sit down on your knees
and put your hands together.

753
00:41:43,591 --> 00:41:44,386
Repeat after me.

754
00:41:44,617 --> 00:41:46,183
Namo.

755
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:47,149
Namo.

756
00:41:47,602 --> 00:41:48,201
Let’s start over.

757
00:41:48,468 --> 00:41:49,571
I forgot the “Om.”

758
00:41:49,794 --> 00:41:51,451
Let’s start over.

759
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:53,451
Om.

760
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:54,328
Om.

761
00:41:54,564 --> 00:41:56,613
Umami.

762
00:41:56,816 --> 00:41:58,160
Did you forget “Namo”?

763
00:41:58,508 --> 00:41:59,294
Quiet, Wine.

764
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:00,364
Just repeat after Faifa.

765
00:42:00,598 --> 00:42:01,139
Fine.

766
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:02,484
Umami.

767
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,051
Wasabi.

768
00:42:05,434 --> 00:42:06,241
Wasabi.

769
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:07,644
My nose

770
00:42:08,551 --> 00:42:10,880
Unagi.

771
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,520
Hey.

772
00:42:12,121 --> 00:42:13,983
Did Faifa get ordained in Japan?

773
00:42:14,223 --> 00:42:15,345
Don’t doubt me.

774
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,709
Unagi.

775
00:42:18,207 --> 00:42:18,672
No!

776
00:42:18,979 --> 00:42:19,540
Get out!

777
00:42:19,785 --> 00:42:20,331
Get out!

778
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,685
Don’t come any closer!

779
00:42:23,327 --> 00:42:24,037
What?

780
00:42:24,714 --> 00:42:25,822
Did it really work?

781
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:26,811
Let’s check on him.

782
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:27,576
I thought he made that up.

783
00:42:30,127 --> 00:42:31,182
Stop!

784
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,069
What happened?

785
00:42:35,642 --> 00:42:36,229
Let’s check on him.

786
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:37,936
Are you really Pae?

787
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:38,937
Of course, it’s me.

788
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:41,539
You’re so amazing, Faifa.

789
00:42:42,136 --> 00:42:42,948
You can even exorcise a ghost.

790
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,703
I can do everything.

791
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,400
(Thank you so much.)

792
00:42:47,554 --> 00:42:49,502
Without you, we’d be in big trouble.

793
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,475
Go back to your party.

794
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,705
I won’t keep you anymore.

795
00:42:54,082 --> 00:42:54,847
Go to bed.

796
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,601
You’re just so special to me.

797
00:43:03,405 --> 00:43:04,140
You are to me too.

798
00:43:04,802 --> 00:43:06,711
If you drink, don’t drive.

799
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,278
Where are you staying tonight?

800
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,837
Text me to let me know later, okay?

801
00:43:14,022 --> 00:43:14,985
Got it.

802
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:16,234
Just go.

803
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:18,303
Good night.

804
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:26,548
So this is what “special” means, huh?

805
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,404
Cheers, guys.

806
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,244
Cheers. Come on.

807
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:47,691
Cheers!

808
00:43:55,081 --> 00:43:55,604
Damn.

809
00:43:56,626 --> 00:43:58,318
So damn cute.

810
00:43:59,878 --> 00:44:00,669
Here we go.

811
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,254
His smile lights up the whole world.

812
00:44:06,465 --> 00:44:07,762
I get Yotha now.

813
00:44:08,491 --> 00:44:10,420
I totally get him today.

814
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:11,287
Really?

815
00:44:12,008 --> 00:44:13,063
What do you get?

816
00:44:14,924 --> 00:44:16,705
Klao, don’t tease him.

817
00:44:16,918 --> 00:44:17,555
Come on.

818
00:44:18,082 --> 00:44:19,268
He said

819
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:26,201
when his puppy smiles,
it’s like the whole world lights up.

820
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,477
Now I know what that’s like.

821
00:44:29,072 --> 00:44:29,797
I just got it now.

822
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:32,468
Who are you talking about?

823
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:34,448
Wine.

824
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:35,745
We don’t have wine here.

825
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,762
Wine!

826
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,484
Can you drink some beer instead?

827
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:40,601
Don’t be stupid, Nop.

828
00:44:43,145 --> 00:44:45,134
I’m talking about Wine.

829
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,660
Oh, your junior Wine.

830
00:44:50,322 --> 00:44:50,863
Smart.

831
00:44:52,084 --> 00:44:52,619
Stupid.

832
00:44:53,118 --> 00:44:54,148
Eat some veggies.

833
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:56,586
Who’s that?

834
00:45:04,557 --> 00:45:05,696
Damn.

835
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:08,007
Faifa is freaking amazing.

836
00:45:08,863 --> 00:45:10,601
If you want to compliment him, be polite.

837
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:13,419
Wow. You have good manners now?

838
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:22,414
The video Ben took of Faifa exorcising a ghost

839
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:23,786
has thousands of views already.

840
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:25,251
It’ll probably reach ten thousand tomorrow.

841
00:45:26,856 --> 00:45:28,342
Isn’t he famous enough as it is?

842
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:36,657
It depends on how you ask.

843
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,103
Klao, can I please have that drink?

844
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:39,140
No.

845
00:45:39,157 --> 00:45:39,743
Do you want this?

846
00:45:40,136 --> 00:45:40,811
Give me some alcohol.

847
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:44,708
Hey.

848
00:45:44,834 --> 00:45:45,405
What are you smiling at?

849
00:45:46,445 --> 00:45:47,062
Nothing.

850
00:46:10,558 --> 00:46:11,743
Give me some alcohol!

851
00:46:11,974 --> 00:46:12,862
Where is my alcohol?

852
00:46:13,168 --> 00:46:14,260
Come on!

853
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:17,783
Hey!

854
00:46:18,269 --> 00:46:19,371
Stop watching my clip!

855
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:21,835
I’m going to sue Newton for violating my privacy.

856
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:23,165
I’m his customer.

857
00:46:23,177 --> 00:46:24,325
How could he film me like this?

858
00:46:26,582 --> 00:46:28,505
I always black out before you do.

859
00:46:29,034 --> 00:46:30,376
Can’t you let me watch something fun?

860
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:32,675
If I die, play that at my funeral.

861
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:34,045
I want to die happily.

862
00:46:34,302 --> 00:46:35,314
Do you want to die now?

863
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,160
Sorry.

864
00:46:36,398 --> 00:46:37,106
Do you want to die now?

865
00:46:38,241 --> 00:46:39,451
How did you get that drunk?

866
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:41,182
What’s gotten into you?

867
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,392
I blacked out and knew nothing.

868
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,496
Believe it or not, I don’t even remember
how many drinks I had.

869
00:46:48,154 --> 00:46:48,859
Hi, guys.

870
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:51,328
I’ve come to get your lectures, Yotha.

871
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:52,154
Here you go.

872
00:46:52,174 --> 00:46:52,930
I’ve prepared them for you.

873
00:46:53,928 --> 00:46:54,520
Thank you.

874
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,303
Wine.

875
00:47:01,322 --> 00:47:01,937
Have a seat.

876
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,080
Okay.

877
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,445
How did you get home last night? You didn’t tell me.

878
00:47:13,065 --> 00:47:14,494
I blacked out last night.

879
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:16,900
The next thing I knew, I woke up at my condo.

880
00:47:17,674 --> 00:47:19,200
You didn’t drive home yourself, did you?

881
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:20,776
I didn’t.

882
00:47:21,734 --> 00:47:25,902
I vaguely remember that Newton dropped me off.

883
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,720
I was going to call you this morning

884
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:32,099
but look.

885
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:33,840
I can’t even press anything.

886
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:35,223
I think it’s broken.

887
00:47:36,075 --> 00:47:37,200
I think only the screen protector is broken,

888
00:47:37,423 --> 00:47:38,537
but be careful not to cut yourself.

889
00:47:40,597 --> 00:47:41,961
Why did you drink so much?

890
00:47:47,425 --> 00:47:48,400
They got me drunk.

891
00:47:48,973 --> 00:47:50,611
I’m usually a very good boy.

892
00:47:50,811 --> 00:47:51,579
I don’t really drink.

893
00:47:53,669 --> 00:47:55,597
Cheers!

894
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:02,419
Give me more.

895
00:48:02,703 --> 00:48:03,442
That’s enough.

896
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:05,096
Don’t be stingy.

897
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:06,272
I’m your brother!

898
00:48:08,174 --> 00:48:09,020
This is soda.

899
00:48:09,543 --> 00:48:10,324
Give me more alcohol.

900
00:48:12,235 --> 00:48:13,675
Alright, here you go.

901
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,700
Why did you give me more soda?

902
00:48:15,931 --> 00:48:17,065
Why are you asking me?

903
00:48:17,136 --> 00:48:17,807
Klao.

904
00:48:18,413 --> 00:48:19,431
Give me alcohol.

905
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,019
Don’t ask too often.

906
00:48:21,278 --> 00:48:22,847
Are we fighting over it?

907
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:23,425
Fine!

908
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:29,297
Hey.

909
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,481
You haven’t managed to steal it from me.

910
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,506
Because you weren’t there, Wine.

911
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,685
That’s why they messed with me like that.

912
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,805
You have to keep me company next time, okay?

913
00:48:45,013 --> 00:48:48,000
I was just like you.

914
00:48:48,414 --> 00:48:49,811
But I’m doing better now

915
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,859
because Arc’s taking care of me.

916
00:48:52,133 --> 00:48:54,594
You should find someone to take care of you, Faifa.

917
00:48:55,195 --> 00:48:56,362
Who should it be?

918
00:48:58,865 --> 00:48:59,345
Well,

919
00:48:59,868 --> 00:49:02,240
I should go to class.

920
00:49:02,811 --> 00:49:03,739
Okay.

921
00:49:04,195 --> 00:49:05,082
Pay attention in class.

922
00:49:05,386 --> 00:49:06,642
Let’s drink together sometime.

923
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:10,807
Just hearing that makes me want to throw up.

924
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,561
Hey!

925
00:49:12,585 --> 00:49:13,407
Turn the other way!

926
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,659
That was close.

927
00:49:19,234 --> 00:49:20,847
Don’t forget to change your screen protector.

928
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:21,905
You don’t want to cut your hands.

929
00:49:22,177 --> 00:49:22,720
Noted.

930
00:49:26,081 --> 00:49:26,703
I’m going now.

931
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,805
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

932
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,133
Let’s eat.

933
00:49:40,066 --> 00:49:41,210
Where’s my fork?

934
00:49:48,503 --> 00:49:49,117
(Hello?)

935
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:50,800
My class is over.

936
00:49:51,148 --> 00:49:52,066
Did you park at the same spot?

937
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,617
Can I cancel our class today?

938
00:49:55,045 --> 00:49:56,437
I have a bad headache.

939
00:49:57,377 --> 00:49:58,271
Are you okay?

940
00:49:59,811 --> 00:50:00,687
Where are you now?

941
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,471
(I’m walking to the parking lot.)

942
00:50:03,848 --> 00:50:05,210
You don’t sound okay.

943
00:50:05,623 --> 00:50:06,782
Let me come with you.

944
00:50:07,362 --> 00:50:09,133
It’s okay. I don’t want to trouble you.

945
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,804
- Stay where you are.
- You parked at the same spot, right?

946
00:50:12,437 --> 00:50:13,280
Where are you going, Wine?

947
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:14,831
- Wine?
- See you at the dorm.

948
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,754
I checked number 3 off the list.

949
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:37,120
I dropped you off.

950
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,041
Where’s the notebook?

951
00:50:40,973 --> 00:50:41,755
In my room.

952
00:50:42,168 --> 00:50:42,925
I didn’t bring it.

953
00:50:44,188 --> 00:50:45,302
Since you didn’t bring it, it doesn’t count.

954
00:50:45,896 --> 00:50:46,573
You don’t get a point.

955
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:49,708
Fine.

956
00:50:51,577 --> 00:50:52,198
If you say so.

957
00:50:55,779 --> 00:50:56,454
Ouch!

958
00:50:56,948 --> 00:50:58,977
My head hurts!

959
00:50:59,826 --> 00:51:02,005
I promise I’ll never drink again!

960
00:51:03,077 --> 00:51:04,604
Says everyone when they’re hungover.

961
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:08,176
Are you leaving soon?

962
00:51:09,311 --> 00:51:10,702
You don’t know how to drive.

963
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:12,564
Do you want me to drive you home?

964
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,152
My reason for coming

965
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,500
was so you wouldn’t have to
drive alone while you’re sick.

966
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:20,195
Why would you give me a ride back?

967
00:51:21,173 --> 00:51:23,582
Come on. I know.

968
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,040
Why are you scolding me?

969
00:51:25,885 --> 00:51:27,005
Can you grab me some painkillers?

970
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:28,176
They’re in the medicine cabinet.

971
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:31,037
Then get up so I can get you some medicine.

972
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,059
Alright, I won’t take them anymore.

973
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,448
I want to keep lying on your lap.

974
00:51:46,514 --> 00:51:47,229
Why are you smiling?

975
00:51:47,629 --> 00:51:48,453
Is your headache gone?

976
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:55,931
Are you okay?

977
00:51:57,291 --> 00:51:57,869
Yeah.

978
00:52:11,491 --> 00:52:12,100
Thank you.

979
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,305
Are you leaving now?

980
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,106
You can hang out here.

981
00:52:20,651 --> 00:52:21,527
Make yourself at home.

982
00:52:22,262 --> 00:52:23,120
Go to sleep.

983
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,647
Don’t worry about me.

984
00:52:25,238 --> 00:52:26,108
I can take care of myself.

985
00:52:29,552 --> 00:52:30,634
Thank you for today.

986
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,533
I troubled you again.

987
00:52:33,454 --> 00:52:34,373
It’s no big deal.

988
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,186
I troubled you more.

989
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,346
Consider this practice for
taking care of Tor when he’s hungover.

990
00:52:46,657 --> 00:52:47,490
Tor doesn’t drink.

991
00:52:49,463 --> 00:52:50,985
What is he, a monk?

992
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:03,099
I did this because I wanted to take care of you,

993
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,333
not as practice for taking care of someone else.

994
00:53:11,574 --> 00:53:12,099
Wine.

995
00:53:13,385 --> 00:53:14,318
Why did you call me?

996
00:53:22,842 --> 00:53:24,099
Don’t joke like this.

997
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:27,749
If I really catch feelings, who’ll be responsible?

998
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,102
The one who makes you feel that way

999
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,854
will be the one responsible.

1000
00:54:01,161 --> 00:54:02,170
Would it be wrong to kiss you?

1001
00:54:05,047 --> 00:54:06,082
I…

1002
00:54:06,398 --> 00:54:08,780
♪ 'Cause you have come ♪

1003
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:12,746
♪ To fill all the missing spaces ♪

1004
00:54:13,114 --> 00:54:17,011

♪ A love I’d never seen before ♪

1007
00:54:30,822 --> 00:54:32,234
I understand what “special” means now.

1008
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:38,200
I understand that it’s probably you.

1009
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,869

00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:42,887

♪ You’ve made today perfect ♪

1012
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,185
Once we tick off everything in the notebook,

1013
00:54:51,248 --> 00:54:52,280
what do we do next?

1014
00:54:52,608 --> 00:54:53,994
Do you want this to end so soon?

1015
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,112
I don’t want it to end.

1016
00:54:56,881 --> 00:54:58,948
Love is complicated, isn’t it?

1017
00:54:59,256 --> 00:55:00,551
It’s only complicated in the beginning.

1018
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:02,010
Once both people feel the same,

1019
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:02,973
everything will be easy.

1020
00:55:06,589 --> 00:55:08,899
Can you keep teaching me like this?

1021
00:55:12,536 --> 00:55:13,699
Let’s keep walking together.

1022
00:55:14,096 --> 00:55:16,607
We’ll worry about the destination
when the time comes.
