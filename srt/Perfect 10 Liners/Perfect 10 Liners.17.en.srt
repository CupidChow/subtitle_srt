1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,978
He’s my boyfriend.

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:03,330
Hey.

3
00:00:03,352 --> 00:00:04,974
You’re just the perfect person to complete Yotha’s world.

4
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,970
It has to be you.

5
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:08,909
Thank you for coming into my life
and making it so much brighter.

6
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:11,272
Will you die if you stop loving each other for a second?

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,243
No one feels sorry for a single guy like me.

8
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:17,410
I ran away from you lovebirds
but you had to follow me here and show off your love.

9
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:18,581
I want a partner.

10
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:20,218
I see you enjoy life every day.

11
00:00:20,232 --> 00:00:21,818
I didn’t think you’d want to be with someone too.

12
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:24,370
After seeing people around me
getting into relationships,

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,480
I can’t help but feel lonely.

14
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:30,770
Why hasn’t heaven sent me someone already?

15
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:32,305
Hello.

16
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,785
My name is Warat Oon-arun.

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,967
But if I pass this interview…

18
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,916
Yes?

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,825
Well…

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,996
If I get accepted into this university,

21
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:50,370
I’ll…

22
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,683
change my name to…

23
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,476
I’m already at the Witsawa faculty.

24
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:54,560
- Witsawa.
- 	The engineering faculty!

25
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,381
What?

26
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,160
I prayed to a shrine
that if I got in,

27
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,680
I’d change my name to Witsawa.

28
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:04,850
If the three of you would be so kind as to accept me,

29
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,472
I’d get to change my name.

30
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,585
Our students get weirder every year.

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,261
Agreed.

32
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,260
What have we had the past few years?

33
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:14,007
Anon, the debt-free.

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,956
And Gunyukhol, whose names mean what?

35
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:19,185
Two ears.

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,167
Let’s get to the point.

37
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,469
Studying at our faculty is tough.

38
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:29,069
Almost half the students flunk out every year.

39
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,858
Do you think you’re up for it?

40
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:31,832
I am.

41
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:32,938
I’m totally up for it.

42
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,036
What if you get an F in the first semester?

43
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:37,280
What would you do?

44
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,414
I don’t have a backup plan yet

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,425
because I don’t think that’ll happen.

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,745
I hope you last in the Engineering faculty

47
00:01:53,774 --> 00:01:57,192
like your two seniors with those unusual names.

48
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,694
Does this mean I got in?

49
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:02,560
Yes.

50
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:03,374
Yay!

51
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,807
Thank you.

52
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:11,738
WITSAWA KAP FAIFA

53
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,578
What’s wrong?

54
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,338
Just a sneeze.

55
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,614
Are you allergic to dust?

56
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:07,610
I don’t think so.

57
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,807
More like someone’s gossiping about me.

58
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,861
Here’s a housewarming gift.

59
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,930
Aren’t they cute?

60
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,014
Yes.

61
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,469
This one looks like you.

62
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:28,210
Which one is cuter?

63
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,040
This one is cuter.

64
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,876
This one looks like you.

65
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:33,141
It’s so yellow.

66
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,574
Yellow like your pajamas.

67
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,781
You’re tired, aren’t you?

68
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,225
If you are, you don’t have to arrange things anymore.

69
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:45,774
I’ll ask someone from home to do it.

70
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,938
I’m not tired.

71
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,974
I’m happy.

72
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,687
This is our first home, Yotha.

73
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,650
If we have someone else help us, it won’t be special.

74
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,269
Anywhere with just the two of us is special to me

75
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:13,400
Who taught you to say that?

76
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:17,030
I heard Fai say that to someone.

77
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,181
Someone or some people?

78
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,116
Yotha.

79
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:26,960
Hmm?

80
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,414
Is Fai really happy the way he is?

81
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,367
He once told me he’s not trying or anything.

82
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,389
He just wants the people around him to be happy.

83
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,894
But isn’t that trying?

84
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,778
He’s been sacrificing since he was young.

85
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:53,381
When we got toys,

86
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,458
he’d always let me and Newton pick first.

87
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,978
He’d enjoy whatever was left
without asking for anything.

88
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,200
Do you know why he’s like that?

89
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,560
After Mom took him with her

90
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,370
and he got back,
we were not as close as we used to be.

91
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,054
So, he used his kindness,

92
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,549
always trying to please others and accepting everything.

93
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,901
That was the only way he knew to approach us.

94
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,487
As he kept doing that, it became a habit,

95
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,749
and now he can't break it.

96
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,127
I’ve known Fai for a year now.

97
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,952
I think I can tell.

98
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,730
At first, I thought he was just a kind person.

99
00:06:42,574 --> 00:06:44,570
But after getting to know him for a while,

100
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,378
I realized he cares so much about those around him

101
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,370
that he ignores his own feelings.

102
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,585
I hope someone comes in
to take care of his feelings for him.

103
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,167
Just like how Yotha has Beagle by his side.

104
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:28,720
Jay, are you done?

105
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,283
Yeah, almost.

106
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,541
Why are you rushing me so much?

107
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:32,152
Let’s go.

108
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:32,632
Come on.

109
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,443
Hey, I’m not ready.

110
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,000
You just need to tie your tie.

111
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:39,869
You can do that while walking.

112
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:41,898
Not just that.

113
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:42,632
Look.

114
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,087
Are you going to class or a commercial audition?

115
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:52,414
It’s the peer mentoring group draw today.

116
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:54,349
I have to look handsome, don’t I?

117
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:57,340
It’s not a big deal.

118
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:58,203
Stop being extra.

119
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:00,647
The seniors from many different years will come.

120
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:02,581
This is more than a commercial audition.

121
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,389
I might find myself a sweetheart.

122
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,930
I’m so happy just thinking about it.

123
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,592
Let’s go.

124
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,040
Hi, guys.

125
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,007
We’re back with the Benji Channel.

126
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:20,545
This might look a bit unfamiliar
because we’re not eating something spicy like usual.

127
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:25,338
I’m taking you to see
the peer mentoring group draw.

128
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,989
These are my best friends, Jay and Wine.

129
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,156
Hi, it’s Jay.

130
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:33,374
I’m single and lonely, but not sad.

131
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,200
Where are you going?

132
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:36,516
I haven’t talked about how we met.

133
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:37,730
It’s okay, guys.

134
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:38,632
I’ll talk about it.

135
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,952
Wine and I have been friends since we were kids.

136
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:43,898
But I met this one in front of the interview room
and we hit it off.

137
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,734
It’s more than destiny.

138
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:47,825
Yay!

139
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:48,792
Guys.

140
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,229
Shall we go already?

141
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:52,930
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,916
Hey!

143
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,447
Since when did you start wearing your own jacket?

144
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,061
Oh.

145
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,538
I’ve only worn it a few times.

146
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,847
Only when I have to meet a lot of people
and when I forget to wash yours.

147
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,007
Really?

148
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:22,960
Yeah.

149
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:26,261
Whenever I’m doing activities,
people always ask if I’m in Civil Engineering.

150
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,410
When I say I’m in Electrical Engineering,
they think I got the wrong major embroidered.

151
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:30,916
I’m just too lazy to explain to them.

152
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,261
What’s so hard to explain?

153
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,276
You can just say it’s your boyfriend’s jacket.

154
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:35,694
Fine, it’s not hard,

155
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:37,690
but I’m shy, okay?

156
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:39,970
They’ll all think I’m showing off my boyfriend.

157
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:42,450
Your boyfriend is Beyond the Star.

158
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:43,498
Why not show him off?

159
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,160
Huh?

160
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,905
Come on.

161
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,032
I don’t have to show off.

162
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:51,454
They all know I’m your boyfriend.

163
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:52,690
There, there.

164
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,010
You’re right.

165
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,290
Why are you wearing this outfit though?

166
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,472
Aren’t you going to work?

167
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:02,470
No, I’m not going.

168
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:03,636
I’m free today.

169
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,294
I’ll come with you so you can show off your boyfriend.

170
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,661
You’re coming to the peer mentoring group draw?

171
00:10:08,705 --> 00:10:09,527
Yeah.

172
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,130
Okay.

173
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,789
Then wear this.

174
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,745
Let’s take a photo.

175
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,570
It’s not often we wear couple outfits.

176
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:22,850
What couple outfits?

177
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,407
Couple outfits like this.

178
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,672
Smile.

179
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,338
Use that photo.

180
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,807
Post it and tag me.

181
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:32,116
You want to show off your boyfriend, don’t you?

182
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:43,352
DIDN’T WANT TO SHOW OFF MY BOYFRIEND
BUT HE ORDERED ME TO,

183
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,156
Next up

184
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:50,363
is our first from Computer Engineering.

185
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:51,709
Here you go, Yotha.

186
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:53,418
I’ve prepared these for your mentee.

187
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,829
What do I have to do?

188
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,352
What Arm did for you.

189
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:04,560
Just impress him.

190
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:05,512
That’s it.

191
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,374
I don’t remember.

192
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,487
I’m touched.

193
00:11:10,523 --> 00:11:12,916
You didn’t impress Yotha back then.

194
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:15,300
You impressed me.

195
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,883
Stop it, Arc!

196
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:20,625
There are a lot of people here.

197
00:11:20,661 --> 00:11:21,687
You two.

198
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:23,316
Your honeymoon period is never over, huh?

199
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,298
Please introduce yourself.

200
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,418
Hi.

201
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,280
My name is Witsawa.

202
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:36,785
I used to go by Warat.

203
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,309
You can call me Wine.

204
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,454
Can you and Arm greet my mentee instead?

205
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:46,807
I’m in a hurry to see Gun.

206
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,523
No.

207
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,250
Wine, your code is

208
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:55,883
0682.

209
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:57,316
Hey, Pun!

210
00:11:57,345 --> 00:11:57,963
Hey!

211
00:11:57,978 --> 00:11:58,552
Yotha!

212
00:11:58,574 --> 00:11:59,905
She’s calling you!

213
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,603
Go!

214
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,738
- Make an impression!
- Let’s give it up for them!

215
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,065
It’s the Perfect 10 Liners!

216
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:08,894
I knew it.

217
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,890
I saw his aura as soon as he got on stage.

218
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,981
That’s my friend, everyone!

219
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:15,294
Perfect 10 Liners’ Wine!

220
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,436
What’s that?

221
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,563
I don’t know.

222
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,520
Wine is so cute!

223
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:20,887
I want to get to know him.

224
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,683
Do you think he’s cute, Arc?

225
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,563
A bit less cute than you.

226
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,316
Why are you two so sweet?

227
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,592
Thank you.

228
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:36,350
I’m Yotha from Civil Engineering.

229
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Welcome to Perfect 10 Liners.

230
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,920
Perfect 10 Liners?

231
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,709
I didn’t bring you any gifts.

232
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,901
Sorry.

233
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,770
Let’s grab something to eat later.

234
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,349
You can ask me anything you want to know then.

235
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,818
But I have to stay for the activities.

236
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:56,887
Just skip them.

237
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:57,570
Sorry?

238
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,309
See you, Witsarut.

239
00:12:59,323 --> 00:13:00,429
I’m Witsawa.

240
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:09,250
A round of applause!

241
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,349
Yotha, why didn’t you bring your mentee?

242
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:13,294
Seriously?

243
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,116
We have a welcome party for you tonight.

244
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:23,163
At Bang On.

245
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,509
Okay.

246
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,374
Do you know what Bang On is?

247
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,505
No, I don’t.

248
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,905
Then why didn’t you ask?

249
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,541
Well, what is it?

250
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,574
A bar.

251
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,774
Oh.

252
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,581
I see.

253
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,894
Do you know where it is?

254
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,461
No, I don’t.

255
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,272
Yeepun will probably share the location in the group chat.

256
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:47,825
Okay.

257
00:13:47,854 --> 00:13:48,203
Give me your phone.

258
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:48,858
I’ll add you.

259
00:13:48,872 --> 00:13:49,680
Here you go.

260
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:52,320
I just sent you a sticker.

261
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,974
Where are you guys going now?

262
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,574
What do you want to eat?

263
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,512
Well…

264
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,170
I don’t have any gifts for you,

265
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,610
so I’m treating you to a meal instead.

266
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:03,694
Oh, uh,

267
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,930
you can just treat me tonight.

268
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:23,280
Do you have anything to say?

269
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,083
Uh…

270
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,440
Hey.

271
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:29,440
Wine is losing his breath.

272
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,469
Why is this any of your business, Fai?

273
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,425
I was going to tell you about Gun.

274
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:34,632
I better go.

275
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,116
Come here.

276
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,356
What’s going on with Gun?

277
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,258
Well, his group is unlucky.

278
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:41,992
Huh?

279
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,676
The draw finished before they got to their group code,
so his group got left out.

280
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,930
He and Sam are sitting inside, upset.

281
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:51,789
When I left, I saw tears in his eyes.

282
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:53,578
Beagle is crying?

283
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,800
Yes.

284
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,534
You should go.

285
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:00,218
I’ll…

286
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,363
He’ll have Faifa take care of him.

287
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,265
I’m warning you.

288
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:08,414
He’s my mentee.

289
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,541
Don’t overstep.

290
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:11,374
We’re brothers.

291
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,789
Your peer mentee is like my own.

292
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,367
I’ll take good care of him for you.

293
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,723
Right, Wine?

294
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,080
Uh, yes.

295
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,898
You can go, Yotha.

296
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:25,032
I’ll be fine.

297
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,887
See you tonight at…

298
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,094
Bang On, right?

299
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,090
I’ll give him a ride.

300
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,410
You broke your promise.

301
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,800
What?

302
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:02,021
This is good.

303
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:02,807
Yeah.

304
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:04,261
So many snacks left.

305
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,781
How are we going to finish them?

306
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,869
Did you cry, Beagle?

307
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:18,509
Hmm?

308
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,010
What, Yotha?

309
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,010
Fai said you cried

310
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,156
because you didn’t get a mentee.

311
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,269
What did you say?

312
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,112
What are you upset about?

313
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,614
We promised I’d be the first to congratulate you

314
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:47,112
but you didn’t reach out to me.

315
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,992
We didn’t exchange contacts.

316
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,254
How was I supposed to reach out to you?

317
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:56,989
Oh, you’re right.

318
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,661
I’m not upset anymore.

319
00:16:59,390 --> 00:16:59,796
What would you like?

320
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:00,740
It’s my treat.

321
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,261
Hold on.

322
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,570
I need to use this.

323
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,389
If I get into this uni,

324
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,814
I’ll redeem a reward for myself.

325
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:12,196
Don’t forget to invite me.

326
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,367
Should I invite you?

327
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:16,370
What?

328
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,734
Don’t forget that one of the stickers is mine.

329
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,730
Oh, you’re right.

330
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,356
Don’t forget to invite me then.

331
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:26,350
I want to be the first to congratulate you.

332
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,705
What do you want?

333
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:32,189
Iced fresh milk like usual?

334
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,240
I’m a grownup.

335
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:35,381
I want to drink coffee.

336
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,589
One americano and one iced fresh milk, please.

337
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,381
Latte!

338
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,323
One latte.

339
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:44,014
Sure.

340
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,570
Can I also get this moist chocolate cake
for this cute guy?

341
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,250
Just kidding.

342
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,378
I’ll take this.

343
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,741
Sure.

344
00:17:50,763 --> 00:17:51,774
Thank you.

345
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:56,654
I didn’t cry.

346
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,567
Are you sure?

347
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,145
Right, bro?

348
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:00,945
I didn’t cry.

349
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:02,940
Our group really got left out

350
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,541
so we’re enjoying these snacks ourselves.

351
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,683
Your boyfriend is not sad.

352
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,530
If you see tears,

353
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,407
it’s because he’s so full he’s going to throw up.

354
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,385
Fai got you fooled.

355
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,109
When Fai said you were crying,

356
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:21,876
I couldn’t do anything.

357
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,640
There, there.

358
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,952
Come here. Let’s hug.

359
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,792
Now I feel lonely.

360
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,087
Can I get a hug too?

361
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,040
Hey!

362
00:18:35,396 --> 00:18:36,880
Come on.

363
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:38,305
You’re scarier than a dog.

364
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:39,752
Are you my senior or what?

365
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,541
Don’t you have to take care of your mentee?

366
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,389
I heard Perfect 10 Liners is on a roll again this year.

367
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,178
We left early and didn’t get to see you guys.

368
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,458
What’s your mentee’s name?

369
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:49,352
Is he cute?

370
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,621
I think his name is Wine.

371
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,367
Is he cute?

372
00:18:53,403 --> 00:18:54,509
I don’t know.

373
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:57,963
The cutest thing in the world
is right in front of me.

374
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,290
Can I poke his cheek too?

375
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:00,980
No!

376
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,469
There’s a welcome party at Bang On tonight.

377
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,807
Can I go?

378
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,916
Of course.

379
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:10,058
Why not?

380
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,840
It’s at a bar.

381
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:12,654
I was worried you might be possessive.

382
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,650
How could I not be possessive?

383
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,778
My boyfriend is so handsome.

384
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,207
But you never hurt me, Yotha,

385
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,509
so I trust you.

386
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,807
I want you to come with me, Beagle.

387
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:24,930
No, it’s your group party.

388
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:25,498
I’m an outsider.

389
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:26,043
I shouldn’t go.

390
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,370
You’re not in our group,

391
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,327
but you’re in my heart.

392
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,545
Stop saying Faifa’s lines.

393
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,101
Sometimes, they’re not as romantic as you think.

394
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:40,647
Agreed.

395
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,996
I want you to come with me.

396
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,465
Please, Beagle.

397
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,425
Let me go back to the condo and change first.

398
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:50,407
Got it.

399
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,458
Don’t try to get me drunk.

400
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:57,883
I don’t want to get drunk tonight.

401
00:19:57,912 --> 00:19:59,236
You’re cute when you’re drunk.

402
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,603
What about when I’m not drunk?

403
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:01,658
Am I cute then?

404
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:02,996
You’re cute when you’re not drunk too.

405
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,970
Hey!

406
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:06,909
Whoa.

407
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:10,880
There are a lot of people here.

408
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:13,200
Shall we go?

409
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:13,840
Let’s go.

410
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,694
Wow.

411
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:17,098
You guys are ignoring me.

412
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,669
Do you want to take some snacks?

413
00:20:18,698 --> 00:20:19,476
No, I’m good.

414
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,494
Wow.

415
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,152
Our group got left out.

416
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:29,963
It’s only you and me.

417
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:34,087
How am I going to finish all this?

418
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:36,174
FAIFA

419
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:37,920
Congratulations.

420
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,036
Sorry?

421
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,563
For getting in.

422
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,574
Am I the first to congratulate you?

423
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:49,323
Besides Dad and Mom,
you’re the first.

424
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:50,952
I’m happy.

425
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,578
How are your studies going?

426
00:20:53,614 --> 00:20:54,865
Any problems?

427
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,603
If anyone bullies you, let me know.

428
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:57,810
I’ll deal with them.

429
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,970
I have a lot of connections.

430
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,581
It’s all good.

431
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,494
I’m lucky to have friends from school here,
so I’m not lonely.

432
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,810
Aren’t you going to eat this cake?

433
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,101
We redeemed it with your sticker too.

434
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,367
I am.

435
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,589
Mmm.

436
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,178
It’s good.

437
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,912
Mmm.

438
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,080
So good.

439
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,385
Why are you staring at me like that?

440
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:40,618
Is there something on my face?

441
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:41,854
Or my lips?

442
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,505
Where is it?

443
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,694
No.

444
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,901
I just feel like you get excited easily.

445
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,309
For example, you seem excited to eat this cake,

446
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,952
even though it’s just a normal cake.

447
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,985
I don’t eat this often.

448
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,196
Aren’t you observant?

449
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,323
Did you know that 90% of falling in love
comes from paying attention?

450
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,592
I didn’t know that.

451
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,780
How’s your latte?

452
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,661
Do you want to try it?

453
00:22:16,698 --> 00:22:17,774
No.

454
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:19,025
If I drink it, I’ll die.

455
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,189
Why?

456
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:21,527
I’m allergic to milk.

457
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,330
Faifa, this cake contains milk.

458
00:22:25,352 --> 00:22:26,189
Are you okay?

459
00:22:26,203 --> 00:22:26,952
Can you breathe?

460
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:28,378
How are you feeling right now?

461
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:32,669
In five minutes, I’ll start getting rashes.

462
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:35,076
If I finish the cake, my body will turn red.

463
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,843
If I drink the latte too,

464
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:39,592
please take me to the hospital.

465
00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:40,414
Let’s go now.

466
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:41,810
Calm down.

467
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,087
I have allergy pills in my bag.

468
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:45,890
And I know my limits.

469
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,076
This is totally fine.

470
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:48,181
I have it under control.

471
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,621
Why did you listen to me and eat the cake?

472
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,820
Because this is a special cake.

473
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:57,680
If I didn’t eat it, I’d regret it so much.

474
00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:04,065
Don’t do this again.

475
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,323
What are you, a doctor?

476
00:23:05,345 --> 00:23:06,650
How could you control your allergies?

477
00:23:06,654 --> 00:23:08,610
What if something serious happens?

478
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,320
Even if I had to die, I’d die happily.

479
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,305
What?

480
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,876
You worry so much about me.

481
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,763
I’d die without regrets.

482
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,836
Aren’t you going to help me?

483
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,821
Come on, you're just pretending to worry.

484
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,360
You don’t have to walk with me, Faifa.

485
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:42,727
The on-campus dorm is so close.

486
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,043
I want to take care of you.

487
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:46,290
I promised Yotha I’d take good care of you.

488
00:23:46,494 --> 00:23:48,087
Yotha won’t know.

489
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:49,418
I’m not the type to tell on someone.

490
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:52,516
Alright, this is not about Yotha.

491
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,781
I just want to take care of you.

492
00:24:05,985 --> 00:24:07,170
Hey, Yee.

493
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:08,618
Faifa.

494
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,410
How are you getting home?

495
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,167
Do you need a ride?

496
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,181
It’s okay. I don’t want to trouble you.

497
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,796
Come on, don’t worry.

498
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:15,230
I’m passing your condo anyway.

499
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:16,894
I’ll trouble you then.

500
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:17,650
Okay.

501
00:24:17,694 --> 00:24:18,261
Let’s go, Wine.

502
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,003
Get walking.

503
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,807
Were you in class?

504
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:21,483
Yes.

505
00:24:21,512 --> 00:24:22,305
I’m exhausted.

506
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:22,843
Really?

507
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,072
Aren’t you going to eat?

508
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,916
Hey, Kim!

509
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,832
What’s wrong?

510
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:33,156
I fought with my girlfriend.

511
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,916
She took the car and left me here.

512
00:24:34,938 --> 00:24:35,949
She left me here!

513
00:24:35,978 --> 00:24:37,083
Hey, I get it. It’s okay.

514
00:24:37,112 --> 00:24:37,927
Damn it!

515
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:39,978
I just forgot to close the toilet lid.

516
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,200
I’ll give you a ride
and we can clean up your pee together.

517
00:24:44,247 --> 00:24:45,061
It’s okay.

518
00:24:45,098 --> 00:24:45,549
It’s just a small thing.

519
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,290
I can clean it up.

520
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:47,789
Hygiene is important, Kim.

521
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,574
I know!

522
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,600
Meaw.

523
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,087
Hey.

524
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:50,872
Where are your friends?

525
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:52,087
Why did they make you carry that alone?

526
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,163
It’s my model.

527
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:54,385
No one is going to help me.

528
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:55,127
I will

529
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,050
You’re heading to the car park, right?

530
00:24:58,087 --> 00:24:58,807
I’ll walk you there.

531
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:00,254
No, I didn’t bring my car today.

532
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,112
No worries.

533
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:02,196
You can ride with me.

534
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,101
Let’s go.

535
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:05,083
Thank you.

536
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,210
Does he drive a bus?

537
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,596
Are you guys okay?

538
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:17,454
Yes.

539
00:25:17,665 --> 00:25:18,494
Alright.

540
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,134
What a bummer.

541
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,741
I thought Yotha would bring Wine and introduce us.

542
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:34,029
I can’t believe he let him go home.

543
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,050
Hey, why are you upset?

544
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:39,825
We’ll see him this evening.

545
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:41,236
Come on, Arc.

546
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,127
Don’t we usually give a warm welcome to our new joiners?

547
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:47,990
I don’t want Wine to feel slighted.

548
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,334
I get Yotha, though.

549
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:53,665
He has a cute boyfriend.

550
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:55,660
Of course, he wants to hurry and be with him.

551
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,178
That’s not an excuse.

552
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,880
Let me lie on your lap.

553
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,778
Hey, Arm.

554
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,287
Do you want to get married?

555
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,640
Why do you ask?

556
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,774
Nothing much.

557
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,847
Someone in my office handed out their wedding invites.

558
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:43,367
So I just want to know
if marriage is the end goal of love.

559
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:47,100
What do you think?

560
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,614
Hmm.

561
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,923
To me, I don’t think it is.

562
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,643
Many people don’t get married
but they’re happy.

563
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,109
And many couples who do get married end up divorced.

564
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:06,901
Right?

565
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,192
Yeah.

566
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,200
Probably.

567
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,370
I guess I’m still young.

568
00:27:14,414 --> 00:27:16,370
I might change my mind when I’m older.

569
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,669
That’s true.

570
00:27:19,243 --> 00:27:21,585
When you’re older, I’ll ask you again.

571
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,829
Don’t you want to be with someone else?

572
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,556
Hey, Arm.

573
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,414
Come on.

574
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,320
I’m just kidding.

575
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,225
Why so serious?

576
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:37,287
No.

577
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,280
It must be you.

578
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,941
Fine.

579
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:43,658
I asked just in case.

580
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:46,247
In case you get bored of me after some time.

581
00:27:46,283 --> 00:27:47,185
What would I do then?

582
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:51,290
I’ll never get bored of you.

583
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:54,763
The longer we’re together, the more I love you.

584
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,487
How much do you love me?

585
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:02,560
I’ll show you.

586
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:03,185
Here.

587
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:04,850
Hey!

588
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:05,505
Arc!

589
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:06,821
Here. I love you so much.

590
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,370
Okay. I know!

591
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,298
I love you.

592
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,683
I’ll get you back!

593
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,425
Let’s continue this in the room.

594
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:26,378
Hey.

595
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,738
Hold on, Arc!

596
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,676
Hold on!

597
00:28:28,712 --> 00:28:29,658
Hey!

598
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:30,843
Hold on!

599
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,530
I haven’t taken a shower!

600
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:33,738
Let go of me!

601
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,505
Arc! Don’t!

602
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,778
Wait, Wine.

603
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,160
Give me a second.

604
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,385
Okay, thank you.

605
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,072
Here you go.

606
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:13,512
These are Thai tea and fresh milk.

607
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:16,094
These are green tea and pink milk.

608
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,981
Faifa.

609
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,400
You don’t like them?

610
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,200
The car was packed.

611
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,174
I saw you sweating so I got you sweet drinks.

612
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:33,680
Four cups?

613
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,461
I don’t know what you like,

614
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,163
so I just got them all.

615
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,370
We were together.

616
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:39,694
Why didn’t you ask me?

617
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,556
If I had asked you,

618
00:29:41,585 --> 00:29:45,381
you’d say, “No, I don’t want any.”

619
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,407
“It’s okay.”

620
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,810
Like that.

621
00:29:47,832 --> 00:29:49,280
So I just went ahead and bought them.

622
00:29:49,316 --> 00:29:51,280
You spend money like it grows on trees,

623
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,338
and you’ve done this before.

624
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,538
Here’s a T-shirt.

625
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:57,214
Dry tissues.

626
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:57,876
Wet wipes.

627
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:58,887
I got you a pair of socks.

628
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,952
I wasn’t sure how sweet you liked your drinks,

629
00:30:00,996 --> 00:30:02,683
so I just got you everything.

630
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,396
I had to drink your fresh milk for a whole week, you know?

631
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,938
Didn’t it go bad?

632
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,501
If you do this again,

633
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:15,127
I’ll force you to finish every cup.

634
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,360
But I’m allergic to milk.

635
00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:19,083
I’ll let you be allergic to death.

636
00:30:19,105 --> 00:30:21,120
Hey, why are you so mean?

637
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,585
At home, Yotha threatens to kill me.

638
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:26,174
Now that I met you,
you’re going to kill me in cold blood?

639
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:26,690
Huh?

640
00:30:26,923 --> 00:30:31,454
Maybe it’s time to reflect on yourself
and see why people around you act like this.

641
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,309
Ouch.

642
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,425
That hurts.

643
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,352
The Perfect 10 Liners only passes down good looks.

644
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:44,181
Sweetness, kindness, and generosity?

645
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,505
That’s all Arm.

646
00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:47,200
The rest of you don’t even have half of what he has.

647
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,530
None at all.

648
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,916
Perfect 10 Liners again?

649
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,363
I’m tired of hearing that all day.

650
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,796
Why?

651
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,818
You don’t like it?

652
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,778
I don’t want attention from anyone
and I don’t want to talk to strangers.

653
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,240
What if someone’s already paying attention?

654
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,363
Do they have to stop?

655
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,163
Come in, Jay.

656
00:31:27,192 --> 00:31:28,021
Come in.

657
00:31:28,072 --> 00:31:29,367
Alright, I’m coming in.

658
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,170
Come on.

659
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,287
What’s up,

660
00:31:41,323 --> 00:31:42,770
Perfect 10 Liners?

661
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,760
Why haven’t you gone back to your room, Ben?

662
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,312
Damn.

663
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:50,310
Did you get us drinks, bestie?

664
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:51,178
No.

665
00:31:51,214 --> 00:31:52,545
But you can drink them if you want.

666
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:55,621
I thought you said your mentor wouldn’t take you anywhere.

667
00:31:55,658 --> 00:31:57,330
Why were you the last to come back?

668
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,774
Something urgent came up.

669
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:03,563
Riding in the front seat with the campus star?

670
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,774
What?

671
00:32:05,796 --> 00:32:06,814
Let me see.

672
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,072
Hey, you’re something else.

673
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,567
Look how many people rode with him.

674
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,578
I almost suffocated in his car.

675
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,436
How did you end up in Faifa’s car though?

676
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,145
Aren’t you Yotha’s mentee?

677
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:21,396
It’s a long story.

678
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,000
By the way, I’m going to my group party tonight.

679
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:24,836
I’ll probably be back late.

680
00:32:24,865 --> 00:32:25,890
How are you getting there?

681
00:32:25,912 --> 00:32:27,018
Ben can give you a ride.

682
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:27,985
I can.

683
00:32:28,036 --> 00:32:28,821
It’s okay.

684
00:32:28,843 --> 00:32:30,247
Faifa will pick me up.

685
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:31,970
Hey.

686
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,160
It’s Faifa again.

687
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,105
I’m going to take a shower.

688
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,265
What’s wrong with him?

689
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,763
No idea.

690
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,465
Leave him be.

691
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:55,367
Let’s get back to our game.

692
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:56,770
Yeah, come on.

693
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,163
I’m back.

694
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,501
How was today?

695
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,360
It’s the peer mentoring group draw.

696
00:33:13,396 --> 00:33:14,647
So tiring.

697
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,843
Who’s your mentee?

698
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,392
A little girl,

699
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:21,723
but I’m just her mentor’s mentor,

700
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,032
so I’m not really involved.

701
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:25,927
We’re not as close as Arm and the Perfect 10 Liners.

702
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:29,440
You’re graduating next year.

703
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:31,396
Have you figured out what you want to do?

704
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,498
What are you saying?

705
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,981
You’re graduating next year.

706
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,596
Do you have any plans for what you want to do
or where you want to work?

707
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,745
Why do you ask?

708
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:00,429
I’m thinking of buying a house
or building something for our future.

709
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,792
Our future?

710
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,443
Of course.

711
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,087
Our future.

712
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,974
Before you came into my life,

713
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:15,287
I was just dreaming without a purpose.

714
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,480
But since I had you, I’ve had one more dream,

715
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,178
which is very important.

716
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,185
What is it?

717
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,018
To make you happy.

718
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,072
Pond.

719
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,963
You’re in my every plan, Sand.

720
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,301
I love you.

721
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:49,381
I really love you.

722
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,949
Whatever you want to do from now on,
you can share with me.

723
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:55,940
I’ll be here to support you.

724
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,658
I love you.

725
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,218
You’re looking handsome for the whole world now.

726
00:35:12,232 --> 00:35:13,010
No.

727
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:15,460
I only look handsome for you, Beagle.

728
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,803
You’ve been flirting a lot.

729
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,130
Do you want to wear the same perfume?

730
00:35:24,152 --> 00:35:24,960
Mm.

731
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:27,963
Hmm?

732
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,407
What are you doing?

733
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:35,818
We can save the perfume this way.

734
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,098
Mm.

735
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,909
This smells perfect. Not too strong.

736
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,585
You’re teasing me so much these days.

737
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,701
Come on.

738
00:35:49,723 --> 00:35:50,414
Let’s go.

739
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,963
Hey, Arm.

740
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,992
Why are you eating so much?

741
00:36:06,021 --> 00:36:07,723
You’re going to finish all the pork.

742
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,974
Babe, why are you scolding him?

743
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:11,767
He’s just a kid growing up.

744
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:12,130
Yeah.

745
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:12,800
Eat all you want.

746
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:13,796
Exactly, Pun.

747
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,930
Yeepun,

748
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,981
when will you stop acting like a mom?

749
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:18,923
Arm is a grown-ass idiot.

750
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:21,396
The way we can talk to each other
means we’re all idiots at this table, Jet.

751
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,203
Oh? Me too?

752
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,563
What did you say, Arm?

753
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,145
Nothing.

754
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,669
Yotha and Gun are here.

755
00:36:28,705 --> 00:36:29,570
Hi, guys.

756
00:36:29,614 --> 00:36:30,516
Hey.

757
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:31,440
Hi.

758
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,050
Yo!

759
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:33,054
Have a seat.

760
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,036
Wait.

761
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,200
Where’s Wine?

762
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:36,814
Yotha!

763
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:38,145
We forgot him!

764
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,647
What?

765
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,658
Calm down.

766
00:36:41,672 --> 00:36:42,734
I didn’t forget him.

767
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,730
Here I come, baby.

768
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,730
Thank you for picking me up.

769
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:54,785
No worries.

770
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:56,780
My friends are at the bar next door.

771
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:57,410
Oh.

772
00:36:57,447 --> 00:36:59,585
But if you whine just a little,

773
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,580
I’ll be ready to ditch my friends for you.

774
00:37:01,716 --> 00:37:02,705
You should join your friends.

775
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,192
Let’s go.

776
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,723
What’s wrong with him?

777
00:37:09,752 --> 00:37:11,720
He keeps killing my vibe.

778
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,850
That’s what happened.

779
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:17,840
Wow, your brother is such a good guy.

780
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:19,185
He even takes care of your mentee.

781
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:21,716
Now, that's what I call impressive service.

782
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,978
That’s who Fai is.

783
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:25,840
He loves taking care of people.

784
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:26,989
He can’t change.

785
00:37:27,032 --> 00:37:30,210
I already told Fai not to mess with Wine.

786
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:31,272
Really?

787
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,530
Fai said he just dropped him off in front of the bar.

788
00:37:40,785 --> 00:37:42,581
I’m going to the restroom.

789
00:37:42,632 --> 00:37:43,774
Do you want me to go with you?

790
00:37:43,818 --> 00:37:44,494
No, it’s okay.

791
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:46,320
Stay here and wait for your mentee.

792
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,538
I’ll be right back.

793
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,098
Wine!

794
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,341
Come in!

795
00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:03,083
Hey!

796
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,854
Hi, guys.

797
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,727
Hi.

798
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:11,869
Sit here, Wine.

799
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,185
Welcome to Perfect 10 Liners.

800
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,094
BANG ON POCHANA

801
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,465
As a new joiner,

802
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:23,054
you get a chance to ask us
one question.

803
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,301
Whatever you ask will stay on this table.

804
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:28,290
Why don’t you ask them if I’m cute?

805
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:30,967
I’ll answer that I’m so cute.

806
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,767
Come on.

807
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,636
Hi, everyone.

808
00:38:35,658 --> 00:38:36,501
Hi.

809
00:38:36,538 --> 00:38:39,040
Fai, you said your friends
were at the bar next door.

810
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:43,185
Yes, but my heart led me here.

811
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:43,970
Fai!

812
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:44,894
What?

813
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,010
Go ahead and splash it on me.

814
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,490
Alright, I won’t tease you anymore.

815
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,083
Just ask them what you want to know.

816
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,752
Cheers!

817
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,454
Let’s nuzzle.

818
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,163
I don’t think he’s okay.

819
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,450
We’re leaving, guys.

820
00:39:04,494 --> 00:39:05,621
Enjoy.

821
00:39:05,658 --> 00:39:06,138
Let’s go.

822
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,178
Safe trip home.

823
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:07,956
Bye.

824
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,643
- Bye, Arc. Bye, Arm.
- Are we leaving already?

825
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:10,996
Bye, guys.

826
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:11,890
Bye-bye.

827
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:12,509
Bye.

828
00:39:12,538 --> 00:39:13,469
Safe trip home.

829
00:39:13,483 --> 00:39:13,992
See you soon.

830
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:14,930
Enjoy.

831
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,218
I’ll split the bill and let you know.

832
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:16,763
Okay.

833
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,530
Shall we leave too?

834
00:39:18,574 --> 00:39:19,854
The bar is almost closing.

835
00:39:19,876 --> 00:39:20,909
See you next time, guys.

836
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:21,854
Tonight was so much fun.

837
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,443
Yes.

838
00:39:22,472 --> 00:39:23,367
See you, everyone.

839
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:24,021
Bye.

840
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:25,680
Bye, Jet. Bye, Pun.

841
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,050
Safe trip home.

842
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,923
See you.

843
00:39:28,945 --> 00:39:29,600
Safe trip home.

844
00:39:29,636 --> 00:39:30,690
Bye.

845
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:32,400
Shall we go?

846
00:39:32,443 --> 00:39:35,665
Yes, but I want to buy fried chicken
with sticky rice on our way back.

847
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,810
I’m hungry.

848
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,960
Of course.

849
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,200
By the way, freshmen live in the on-campus dorm, right?

850
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:45,818
I’ll give you a ride.

851
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:46,894
No need.

852
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:47,738
I’m passing the on-campus dorm.

853
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,090
I’ll give him a ride.

854
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,709
Excuse me.

855
00:39:49,738 --> 00:39:51,700
Wine is my peer mentee.

856
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,756
You’re sticking your nose in.

857
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:53,934
Come on.

858
00:39:53,963 --> 00:39:56,749
You guys leave in pairs.

859
00:39:56,763 --> 00:39:58,196
Do you want me to leave alone?

860
00:39:58,225 --> 00:39:59,716
You know I don’t like leaving alone.

861
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:00,894
I’m lonely.

862
00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:03,620
Can I borrow your peer mentee for the night?

863
00:40:03,665 --> 00:40:05,789
Please. Can I?

864
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,780
Well, I can go with Faifa.

865
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,989
You’re the cutest.

866
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,050
Let me kiss you on the forehead.

867
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:12,487
Ouch!

868
00:40:12,516 --> 00:40:13,214
What?

869
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:13,949
Fai!

870
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,538
What?

871
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:16,749
I told you Wine is my peer mentee.

872
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:19,970
He’s not someone you can mess with.

873
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:21,970
Calm down.

874
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:26,334
I promise I won’t treat him
the way I did the others.

875
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:27,687
What do you mean?

876
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,796
He’s not like anyone else.

877
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,887
Right, Wine?

878
00:40:39,374 --> 00:40:41,370
How are we getting home?

879
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:44,080
Driving, of course.

880
00:40:44,385 --> 00:40:45,403
But you were drinking.

881
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,407
How can you drive now?

882
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:47,614
Come on, it’s fine.

883
00:40:47,643 --> 00:40:48,727
I only had a little.

884
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,443
It’s against the law.

885
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,909
Then I’ll need your help.

886
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,574
I can’t.

887
00:40:56,603 --> 00:40:57,876
I drank too.

888
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,850
Besides, I can’t drive.

889
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:06,385
What I mean is, I’ll need you to sit with me
until my blood alcohol level drops.

890
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,574
You look like you want to talk to me about something.

891
00:41:14,007 --> 00:41:15,258
Are you uncomfortable?

892
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:16,683
Huh?

893
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,785
Are you uncomfortable with me bothering you?

894
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,752
No.

895
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:24,996
Really?

896
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,603
That’s a relief.

897
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,650
Why would you think I’m uncomfortable?

898
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:34,312
Because Yotha is so possessive of you.

899
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:35,920
Look at what he said to me.

900
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,447
I’m starting to believe it.

901
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:43,061
Why are you worried I’ll be uncomfortable?

902
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:48,574
Because I always see you looking sleepy, lonely, and down.

903
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,541
I just want you to have fun when you’re with me.

904
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,785
Do I make you feel that way?

905
00:41:58,829 --> 00:41:59,600
Yes.

906
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,934
There’s one more thing I want to ask you.

907
00:42:05,738 --> 00:42:06,734
Is something wrong?

908
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,890
Why do you ask?

909
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:14,356
Because you used to be more cheerful.

910
00:42:14,712 --> 00:42:16,676
Lately, you’ve been looking sad,

911
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,716
like you have something on your mind.

912
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,941
Can you read people’s minds?

913
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,414
So I’m right, aren’t I?

914
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,181
I knew it.

915
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,236
I should’ve bought lottery tickets.

916
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,670
I would’ve won.

917
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,149
I totally forgot that the on-campus dorm
has set opening hours.

918
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,290
It’s almost 4 a.m. now.

919
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,883
Let’s wait here,

920
00:42:53,912 --> 00:42:55,229
so they don’t log your name.

921
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,967
My heart is broken.

922
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:14,989
Huh?

923
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,472
What are you saying?

924
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,240
Answering your question from earlier.

925
00:43:22,283 --> 00:43:24,240
I got my heart broken before starting uni.

926
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:30,000
I heard people say when you’re heartbroken,
you’ll feel pain in your heart

927
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,072
and not be able to eat or sleep.

928
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,996
I didn’t believe it at first.

929
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,105
But now that it’s happened to me,

930
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:40,020
I’m experiencing everything they said.

931
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,000
Are you okay?

932
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:00,000
Not really,

933
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,392
but I guess I’m getting better.

934
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,541
What are you doing?

935
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:28,180
Shh!

936
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,170
I’m using my magical power.

937
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:40,152
Your heart is not broken.

938
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:52,800
There.

939
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:05,840
It’s just a little chipped.

940
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,563
I’ll fix it.

941
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:12,800
♪ Let us try, give this love a try ♪

942
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,221
♪ Test it out during a trial ♪

943
00:45:15,243 --> 00:45:18,494
♪ Nothing else but how we feel ♪

944
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:22,014
♪ Let us try, let go and give it a try ♪

945
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:26,298
♪ No pressure, no worries, let’s fly ♪

946
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,076
♪ Before we turn this into something real ♪

947
00:45:34,254 --> 00:45:36,250
Arc’s body looks so cool.

948
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,854
What are you doing?

949
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,850
I want you to say I’m cool too.

950
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,563
If you can’t find someone as good as Arc,

951
00:45:41,592 --> 00:45:43,541
then just don’t date anyone.

952
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,690
Do you hate me

953
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:48,880
for being like this?

954
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,498
Every problem can be fixed.

955
00:45:51,527 --> 00:45:52,981
Faifa, don’t mess with my head.

956
00:45:53,018 --> 00:45:54,392
Then let me play with your cheeks instead.

957
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:56,390
It can be fixed with your help.

958
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,963
If I can help make everything better for you,

959
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:01,890
I will.
