1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
I really have a boyfriend now.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,360
Faifa is the only one Wine loves now.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,110
I’m going to get the group bracelets for Faifa’s birthday.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,020
Life without you is no fun at all.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,520
You’re lucky you have me as your boyfriend.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,160
That’s why I was brave enough to come here alone.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,880
So I could give you this bracelet.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,030
It feels like a dream

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,030
to have you in front of me like this.

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,100
Faifa.

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,120
You need to take responsibility.

12
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,410
Huh?

13
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,590
You’ve got my body and my heart.

14
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,310
Don’t leave me, okay?

15
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,580
Who’s the one benefitting here?

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,600
I don’t care.

17
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,320
I can’t live without you, babe.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,070
Faifa, I can’t breathe.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,730
Stop being cute for a second, will you?

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,470
My heart is working overtime.

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,010
You know?

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,160
You know?

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,800
I haven’t done anything.

24
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,990
You haven’t done anything, huh?

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,760
There.

26
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,020
You’re being cute again.

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,270
You’re being cute again.

28
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,650
You need to be punished!

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,530
Faifa!

30
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,890
What are you doing?

31
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,890
What?

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,640
What are you doing, Wine?

33
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,960
What are you doing?

34
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,880
Wine!

35
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Faifa, what are you doing?

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,210
Showing off my boyfriend on my IG story.

37
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,750
Sorry.

38
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,820
This is my first time being in a relationship

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,920
and my boyfriend is so cute.

40
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,350
Let me be crazy about him a little.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,500
Do you think I’m annoying?

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,940
No, I think you’re cute.

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,640
Hmm?

44
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,340
What did you just say?

45
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,880
I didn’t hear it. Say it again?

46
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,980
Nothing.

47
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,870
I want to paint.

48
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,920
Let’s go.

49
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,220
Okay.

50
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,050
My baby wants to paint. Let’s go.

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,640
Hi.

52
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,180
This is my last one.

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,640
Can you share with each other?

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,180
This is my boyfriend.

55
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,840
Isn’t he cute?

56
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,120
Faifa!

57
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,370
Thank you.

58
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,320
How much is this?

59
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,940
No worries.

60
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,830
You can have it for free.

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,260
I’m about to close up.

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,000
By the way, what do you think of the music festival this year?

63
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,310
Do you like the songs?

64
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,480
Very much.

65
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,680
Is this your first year here together?

66
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,050
- Yes.
- Yes.

67
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,260
Great. Don’t forget to come again next year.

68
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,560
With the same person.

69
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,760
Of course, I’ll come with the same person.

70
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,030
Who else would I be with?

71
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,280
We just started dating.

72
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,880
Do you want me to break up already?

73
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,760
Faifa.

74
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,470
Give me that.

75
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,480
I’ll pay.

76
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,070
Okay.

77
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,560
Don’t tell me to change partners.

78
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,330
We just started dating.

79
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,790
Let’s go.

80
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,630
Will you come with the same person next time?

81
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,760
Will you?

82
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,660
Of course.

83
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,370
Do you mean it?

84
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,260
Yes!

85
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,050
Go ahead and draw first.

86
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,100
Alright.

87
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,550
There’s something I wanted to ask you.

88
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,230
Hmm?

89
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,870
How was sending your mom off last night?

90
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,370
It was alright.

91
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,120
Dad, Newton, Yotha, and Puppy were there too.

92
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,970
Mom asked why you didn’t come with us.

93
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,880
Did you cry on the way back?

94
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,190
No, but I was going to

95
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,400
when I found out my boyfriend disappeared.

96
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,200
I didn’t disappear.

97
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,200
I just went on an adventure.

98
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,150
So, did you have fun on your adventure?

99
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,890
You looked like you were going to cry last night, you know?

100
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,360
Arm said that if we miss this music festival,

101
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,880
who knows when we could get the bracelets from Tawan.

102
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
I was worried I wouldn’t be able to get one for you.

103
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,320
It’s almost your birthday.

104
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,140
Why did you want to get me
your group bracelet for my birthday?

105
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,980
Because you already have everything else.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,920
You can buy anything you want.

107
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,730
I wanted to get you something special for your birthday.

108
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,040
That’s why I thought of this bracelet

109
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,380
and what Arm told me.

110
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,690
What did he tell you?

111
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,710
Every time I look at it, I think of the first time I wore it.

112
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,440
I love it when they’re on our arms

113
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,340
because every time they come together,

114
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,710
it means Arc and I are together.

115
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,960
I want our love to be as good as Arc and Arm’s

116
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,300
and I want to complete you

117
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,300
the way Gun does in Yotha’s life.

118
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,250
Hey.

119
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,750
You’re already more than what you just said, you know?

120
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,930
My life wasn’t just missing things.

121
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,230
It was broken.

122
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,890
You fixed it, you know?

123
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,890
So you don’t need to get me anything special

124
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,680
for my birthday, anniversary, or any other occasion.

125
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,580
My life is special enough just having you every day.

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,590

127
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,800

Isn’t this cute?

138
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,470
Why did you draw lighting bolts
around this sleepyhead?

139
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,240
You said you wanted me to be with you every day.

140
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,730
I want to have you around me too.

141
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,790
Oh.

142
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,890
Got it?

143
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,600
I’m off.

144
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,080
You mischievous kid!

145
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,410
If I get so shy that my heart stops,

146
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,050
you can’t date someone new, okay?

147
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,050
Love stinks.

148
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,470
Just seeing you walk in,

149
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,160
I'm getting a sugar overload!

150
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,090
Shut up, you two.

151
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,440
You went there alone,

152
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,880
but on your way back,

153
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,700
how come your boyfriend dropped you off?

154
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,410
Why are you smiling?

155
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,130
It’s always been Faifa.

156
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,900
Huh?

157
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,080
Faifa’s had my heart from the start.

158
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,720
I’m glad you’re happy in love again.

159
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,650
Even though I haven’t been friends with you as long as Jay,

160
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,500
I’m happy you found good love.

161
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,200
I hope

162
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,790
I hope this love is the happiest.

163
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,040
Thank you so much, guys,

164
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,370
for always being by my side.

165
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,810
As friends, you’re my best love.

166
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,780
I love you guys.

167
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,900
Oh, you two love me too much.

168
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,710
Anything.

169
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,750
Oh, hey.

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,440
Are you guys done at the auditorium?

171
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,880
Just need to take some group photos

172
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,310
and then we should be done.

173
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,090
Don’t you and Yotha need to stand by for the group photos?

174
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,490
Yeah, Fai.

175
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,270
Don’t you have to take photos with the new campus star?

176
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,500
He actually does.

177
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,560
But I was afraid these brothers would die of broken hearts.

178
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,700
Broken hearts?

179
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,160
Yeah.

180
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,570
You two weren’t in the auditorium

181
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,760
and these two were whining and making a scene.

182
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,520
They couldn’t live without their boyfriends.

183
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,810
It was so annoying, so I took them away.

184
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,030
When I looked down from the stage, I couldn’t see you.

185
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,280
You didn’t tell me where you were going.

186
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,600
I was worried, you know?

187
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,680
Don’t go anywhere again, okay?

188
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,800
I missed you.

189
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,690
Got it?

190
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,290
I asked him to come down with me.

191
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey.

192
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,860
It was chaotic up there.

193
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,320
Besides, someone asked for his LINE ID,

194
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,000
so I…

195
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,080
Did you give it?

196
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,670
Did you give it?

197
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,440
Hey.

198
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,910
Did someone ask you for anything, Beagle?

199
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,500
It seemed like someone did.

200
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,720
Beagle.

201
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,890
Someone did.

202
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,960
Come on!

203
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,800
You guys are too possessive of your boyfriends.

204
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,260
Pun.

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,690
Hi.

206
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,850
Hi, guys.

207
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,610
Hey, babe!

208
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,800
Why is your shirt so thin?

209
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,340
We can see everything underneath.

210
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,050
And why didn’t you button it?

211
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,330
Pun,

212
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,410
you’re so cute when you’re jealous

213
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,640
and you know I love your angry face,

214
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,930
but you don’t have to be angry with me all the time.

215
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,470
You look so much cuter when you smile.

216
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,900
Let me see your smile.

217
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,730
Stop it!

218
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,120
Aren’t you shy in front of your juniors?

219
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,250
No.

220
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,450
I have to go.

221
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,450
My boyfriend has come to pick me up.

222
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,480
`Bye-bye.

223
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,920
- Bye.
- 	Bye, everyone.

224
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,400
Jet, don’t forget to hide those two dots.

225
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,030
Don’t look!

226
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,950
Come on!

227
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,900
Don’t tease them.

228
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,610
Wine, don’t tease others, it’s not nice.

229
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,290
Let me do it alone.

230
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,290
Your group DNA is so strong.

231
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,410
MEET UP TONIGHT FOR THE SPECIAL MISSION!

232
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,640
What mission?

233
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,520
Proposal?

234
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,230
Klao and Warich are getting married?

235
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,860
Yes.

236
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,200
All of us need to make this surprise a success,

237
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,730
okay?

238
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,550
Yes.

239
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,550
Mm.

240
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,350
We’re ready, Klao.

241
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,200
Who’s this idiot?

242
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,560
I told you I couldn’t do this alone.

243
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,940
Why don’t you sit down, Klao?

244
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,540
Sit down.

245
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,840
What have you prepared so far, Klao?

246
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,780
Can you tell us so we know how to help?

247
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,120
A ring.

248
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,730
A ring?

249
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,080
I have a ring.

250
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,390
Come on.

251
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:00,660
Why?

252
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,610
You’re in trouble.

253
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,590
What about the picture in your head?

254
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,610
What do you want it to be like?

255
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,670
Any ideas?

256
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,680
(I guess)

257
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,470
(I want to make Wa the happiest that day.)

258
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,450
(That’s it.)

259
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,400
What are you doing?

260
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,890
Nothing.

261
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,540
Are you free this weekend?

262
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,310
Yeah, why?

263
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,760
Gun invited us to go camping.

264
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,200
He said his seniors just opened a campsite.

265
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,200
Oh.

266
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,710
Are you going?

267
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,590
I don’t mind either way

268
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,400
but I want to take you on vacation

269
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,850
because you’ve been working hard lately.

270
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:54,920
Okay.

271
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,740
Yotha is going though.

272
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,060
Then bring a first-aid kit to dress wounds.

273
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,120
Ouch!

274
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,320
I’m just kidding.

275
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,960
So are we going?

276
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,250
I’ll confirm with Gun.

277
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,000
Mm.

278
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,680
I’m going to take a shower.

279
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,670
Okay.

280
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,430
Don’t take too long or I’ll miss you.

281
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,240
Follow me then.

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,770
Thank you.

283
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,350
I’m so excited.

284
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,870
Arm is making me carry the flower crown.

285
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,680
If I slip and fall, you must help me.

286
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,150
Do you want that too?

287
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,950
Do I want what?

288
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,320
To get married.

289
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,960
What are you talking about?

290
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,650
You’re taken now, Beagle.

291
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,910

Hey, Arc.

307
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,410
I’ve prepared the toothbrush and toothpaste for you.

308
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,820
I’ve also prepared three sets of clothes

309
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,160
in case you want to play in the water.

310
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,880
And…

311
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,630
Arm.

312
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,690
You’re teasing me again.

313
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,090
I’m so happy you came into my life.

314
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,260
Yeah.

315
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,550
I don’t know how many times I’ve said I love you,

316
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,550
but I want to keep saying it.

317
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,840
I love you so much, Arm.

318
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,200
Mm.

319
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,050
I love you too.

320
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,680
And I’ll be here being cute

321
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,680
and making you go crazy.

322
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,900
You’re so cute.

323
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,150
My cheek is all wet!

324
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:31,920
Oh!

325
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,180
Arc!

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,770
You won’t finish packing in time.

327
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,150
Fine.

328
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,610
Come on!

329
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,900
Hmm.

330
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,160
I think this is the best spot for the proposal.

331
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,020
Agreed.

332
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,790
Come here, Wine.

333
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,380
Alright.

334
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,610
Stay here.

335
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,030
What are you doing, Faifa?

336
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,480
Setting up the positions.

337
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,260
We’ll have Klao and Wa stand here.

338
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,430
And Puppy,

339
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,940
once they do,

340
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,400
you put the flower crown on Wa’s head.

341
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,630
Okay?

342
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,230
Oh.

343
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:11,880
Okay.

344
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,610
Okay.

345
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,000
Like this?

346
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,740
Yeah.

347
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,780
Okay.

348
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,890
What’s next, Faifa?

349
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,090
After that, Klao will go down on one knee,

350
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,800
and put a ring on it.

351
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:27,150
Then all of us will say, “Kiss! Kiss!”

352
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,170
“Kiss!”

353
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,880
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

354
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,290
Kiss!

355
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,480
Hey!

356
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,440
Hey, Faifa!

357
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,260
You’re taking advantage of him.

358
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,450
I’m not.

359
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,210
I’m just acting out a scenario.

360
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,400
That’s it, everyone.

361
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,660
That’s all for the proposal.

362
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,720
Let’s clap.

363
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,550
How subtle.

364
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,200
Be careful not to cut your hands, darling.

365
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,880
Got it, darling.

366
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:03,950
Arc.

367
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,600
Hmm?

368
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,520
Do you think I could be a Thai traditional dancer?

369
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,470
Look.

370
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,780
We’re never going to finish this.

371
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,010
Come on!

372
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,850
Am I not cute?

373
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,220
Why aren’t you paying attention?

374
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,680
You’re cute no matter what you do.

375
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,190
But now, give me that flower behind your ear.

376
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,920
Do you see that we’re missing flowers here?

377
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,080
You won’t play with me.

378
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,590
You won’t pay attention to me.

379
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,380
Of course, you’re cute.

380
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,200
If I didn’t love you, I wouldn’t be this crazy about you.

381
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,360
What a dumb question.

382
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,880
You’re so silly.

383
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,210
Bickering and loving.

384
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,620
That’s just how we are, huh?

385
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,550
Mm.

386
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,330
Let’s get back to it.

387
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,010
Hey!

388
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,840
Why is my boyfriend carrying heavy stuff?

389
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,370
Come here.

390
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,910
It’s not that heavy.

391
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,830
I won’t let you do it.

392
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,100
These hands are only for Faifa to hold and guide.

393
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,040
Got it?

394
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,880
Ugh.

395
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,040
I’m going to puke!

396
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,400
What’s wrong, Puppy?

397
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,320
Do you want to scratch your neck with my feet?

398
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,150
Watch what you say to my boyfriend, Fai.

399
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,330
Look at what your boyfriend is doing.

400
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,040
Look at him.

401
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,160
Look!

402
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,640
Look!

403
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,640
They fight every day.

404
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,170
Guys, the food is ready.

405
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,360
Feel free to come eat.

406
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,490
Come on, Arc.

407
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,390
Let’s go.

408
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,620
Let’s go.

409
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,220
Let’s go.

410
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,920
Here you go.

411
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
Whoa, more food?

412
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,370
Hey, Pond.

413
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,570
Did you cook all of this by yourself?

414
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,180
Sand helped me.

415
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,940
Whoa.

416
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,670
Unbelievable.

417
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,010
You’ve changed so much.

418
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,770
Why not?

419
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,880
You’re not the only one love can change.

420
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,890
Look at all of us here.

421
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,890
Didn’t love change us?

422
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,740
Let’s eat quickly and take a shower.

423
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,040
It’s almost time.

424
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,760
Hey!

425
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,330
Klao said they’re arriving in an hour.

426
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,130
I thought they were coming in the evening.

427
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,530
Wa is in a bad mood
and won’t stop anywhere along the way.

428
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,990
That’s why they’re arriving early.

429
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,920
Run!

430
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,560
What are we waiting for?

431
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,270
Come on!

432
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,600
Arc!

433
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,320
Let’s go, Sand!

434
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,450
Take the pork, Sand!

435
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,250
Take the pork!

436
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,250
I said pork!

437
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,830
Why the hell are you taking the chair, Sand?

438
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,070
Take the pork!

439
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,200
Yotha!

440
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,640
Damn it!

441
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,430
Kids are like that.

442
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,430
They’re impatient.

443
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
We can walk and still make it in time.

444
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,020
Yeah.

445
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,360
Let’s go.

446
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,040
Let’s go.

447
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,350
They’re impatient.

448
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,570
Wa!

449
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,540
They’re here!

450
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,230
Please don’t be upset.

451
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,060
Who even wears white outfits to go camping?

452
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,460
Well, the others said…

453
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,430
Stop it.

454
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,120
I’m wearing white.

455
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,320
Are you happy now?

456
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,670
Come on, Wa!

457
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,600
Wa!

458
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,100
Where’s everyone?

459
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,610
Wa’s coming.

460
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,880
Wa!

461
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,440
Can you move away a bit?

462
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,840
The closer I look at you, the cuter you get, Beagle.

463
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,340
This is not the time!

464
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,910
Wa!

465
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,780
Hold your breath, Wine.

466
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,440
Please.

467
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,300
If Wa catches us from our breathing sounds, let him.

468
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,420
Shh!

469
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,570
Wa!

470
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,640
What?

471
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,690
Shh!

472
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,330
Hold your breath.

473
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,400
I said hold your breath.

474
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,540
Wa!

475
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,300
Shh!

476
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,790
That’s enough!

477
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,660
Why do you keep calling me?

478
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,030
Well…

479
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,460
Am I hiding well?

480
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,540
Very.

481
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,160
I thought you were wearing an invisible cloak.

482
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,660
If you walked past Warich now, he wouldn’t see you.

483
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,160
Wa!

484
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,160
See? I told you this plan would go well.

485
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,300
Arm, I’m being sarcastic.

486
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,630
Oh?

487
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,380
Hey, where’s Wa?

488
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,600
Oh?

489
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,600
Hey, Arm.

490
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,570
Why are you carrying those plants?

491
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,470
New fashion?

492
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,820
I knew it.

493
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,870
You saw me?

494
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,360
Wa!

495
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,660
Let’s come this way.

496
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,210
I’ll take you for a walk.

497
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,120
Let’s go.

498
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,880
Please stand here.

499
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,890
Well…

500
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,880
Let’s go.

501
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,550
I….

502
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,080
Huh?

503
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,680
I need to pee.

504
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,650
Wa!

505
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,740
I brought you a crown.

506
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,540
Yes.

507
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,160
Well…

508
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:22,840
Klao.

509
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,530
Wa,

510
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,840
I told you I’d make something of myself and propose to you.

511
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,510
I think I did it.

512
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,900
What are you doing?

513
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,280
I think I’m mature enough to take care of you now.

514
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,870
Will you marry me?

515
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,200
Thank you.

516
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,470
Thank you for making me want to be a better person.

517
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,090
Thank you for waiting,

518
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,890
taking care of me,

519
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,690
and teaching me all this time.

520
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:53,240
I don't know what my life would be

521
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,740
if I didn’t have you in it.

522
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Thank you, too,

523
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,060
for making me realize what true love is.

524
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,050
And thank you

525
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,930
for working on becoming a better person for me.

526
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,340
Kiss!

527
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,460
Kiss!

528
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,520
Kiss!

529
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,540
Kiss!

530
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,460
Kiss!

531
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,460
Kiss!

532
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,390
Kiss!

533
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,310
Kiss!

534
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,160
Kiss!

535
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,980
Kiss!

536
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,880
Kiss!

537
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:33,000
Whoa!

538
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,080
My god!

539
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,710
I love you.

540
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,610
I love you too, Klao.

541
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,000
Here we go.

542
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,160
Get ready to catch it, Wine.

543
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,550
Get ready to catch it.

544
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,430
This way, please!

545
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,640
Don’t be embarrassing!

546
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,620
Oh!

547
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,410
Are you the next couple to marry?

548
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,390
Kiss!

549
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Kiss!

550
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,400
Kiss!

551
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,360
Kiss!

552
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,220
Kiss!

553
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,430
Kiss!

554
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,900
Come on, Arc.

555
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,600
Come on!

556
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,800
Take it!

557
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,690
Kiss!

558
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,440
Kiss!

559
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,160
- Kiss!
- 	Hey!

560
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:26,480
This way!

561
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,760
- Aww.
- Kiss!

562
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,590
Kiss!

563
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,590
Kiss!

564
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,340
Kiss!

565
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,040
Kiss!

566
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,720
Yes!

567
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,100
Where are you going?

568
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,000
Kiss!

569
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,860
Kiss!

570
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,840
Kiss!

571
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,780
Kiss!

572
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,760
Kiss!

573
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,150
Kiss!

574
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,120
Kiss!

575
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,960
Kiss!

576
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,890
That’s enough!

577
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,410
Cheers!

578
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,550
Thank you everyone so much

579
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,040
for agreeing to help with Klao’s crazy plan.

580
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,340
You guys got me completely fooled.

581
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,490
Well done.

582
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,350
Great.

583
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,280
Wait until my turn.

584
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,450
Root for me too.

585
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,220
Oh, Arc.

586
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,680
Your turn?

587
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,900
You’re making me blush.

588
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,650
Congrats again,

589
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,230
Wa and Klao.

590
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,470
Wow, Yotha.

591
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,620
I’m several years older than you.

592
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,350
I’d rather go back to fighting with you
than call you my senior.

593
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,680
Yotha!

594
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,720
Stop it, Yotha.

595
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,780
I’m just kidding, Beagle.

596
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,100
Just kidding.

597
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,920
I’m happy for you too, Yotha.

598
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,440
You and Gun make the best couple, you know?

599
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,990
I know.

600
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,940
Damn.

601
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,600
Before you guys get any more lovey-dovey,

602
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,640
let’s play a game.

603
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,250
Okay.

604
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,880
Let’s play something constructive.

605
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,290
How about Spin the Bottle?

606
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,470
You idiot!

607
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,080
How is that constructive?

608
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,000
I’m going to splash you!

609
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,330
I have an idea.

610
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,490
How about we tell ghost stories?

611
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,240
Yeah.

612
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,780
What do we think?

613
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,870
I love it.

614
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,300
Let’s do it!

615
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,720
Po!

616
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,060
You jerk!

617
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,600
What are you doing here?

618
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,400
I missed you so much!

619
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,980
Po

620
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,030
Why are you hugging me?

621
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,720
I got startled.

622
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,980
Stop it.

623
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,250
You're always sneaking up on me.

624
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,460
Yeah.

625
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,890
Startled.

626
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,430
Have fun, everyone.

627
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,640
Please excuse me.

628
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,040
Where are you going?

629
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,010
Excuse us.

630
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,730
Hey!

631
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,270
Klao. Wa.

632
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,480
Ah!

633
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,730
I get it now.

634
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,650
There they go!

635
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,080
There they go!

636
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,560
There they go!

637
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,560
They’re leaving hand in hand.

638
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,130
Hold on.

639
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,120
Didn’t you say you were going to win your ex back?

640
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,830
How’s it going?

641
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,160
Yeah, how’s it going?

642
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,240
I’ve already done that.

643
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,950
How was it?

644
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:23,880
How was it?

645
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,890
Don’t tell us…

646
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,870
Why are you crying with him?

647
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,880
Damn, Po.

648
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,030
My buddy.

649
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,560
My ex prefers a bad guy.

650
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,880
Aren’t you bad enough?

651
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,800
I tried.

652
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,520
Damn.

653
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,220
It’s okay, buddy.

654
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,500
But my grandma taught me to be a good person.

655
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,530
You’re good enough.

656
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,100
Of course, she did.

657
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,320
I couldn’t do it.

658
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,880
Hold on.

659
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,770
Faifa.

660
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,750
I heard you can fix hearts.

661
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,290
Me?

662
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,220
Yes, you.

663
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,850
I’m in trouble, Wine.

664
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,520
He’s here.

665
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:08,830
Yes?

666
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,670
It hurts so bad here.

667
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,900
Can you fix it?

668
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,180
Look, Po.

669
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,960
I can only fix it if it’s just chipped.

670
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,770
Chipped?

671
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,860
If it’s broken…

672
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,610
It’s broken.

673
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,560
I can’t fix it.

674
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,200
No?

675
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,690
Maybe you can give it a try.

676
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,480
Help me, Wine.

677
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,110
Stop that!

678
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,720
You’re hugging me tightly, Po.

679
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,490
Hey!

680
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,600
Oh my god!

681
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,610
What’s that?

682
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,310
I’m leaving.

683
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,180
Hey, bro!

684
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,570
Po, stop being embarrassing!

685
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,020
You’ve lost your mind, buddy!

686
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,530
You’ve lost your mind, Po!

687
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,160
It can’t be fixed!

688
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,120
Damn it, Po!

689
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,560
Damn it, Po!

690
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,840
Po!

691
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,660
I didn’t come here just to look at the view.

692
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,670
I want to wait and watch the stars.

693
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,160
Stargazing?

694
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,840
Come on, Wa.

695
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,880
If we wait for that, my heart will stop beating first.

696
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,760
Why?

697
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,350
Can’t you wait?

698
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:39,090
I’m so happy to have you here with me.

699
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,120
Wa,

700
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,570
why did you agree to date me

701
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,520
even though back then…?

702
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,490
I like bad guys.

703
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,750
Seriously?

704
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,980
Don’t be crazy.

705
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:58,910
I just trusted my feelings

706
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,160
that you were actually hiding your true self.

707
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,790
Today, I’ve really found him.

708
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,010
I used to think

709
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,240
I didn’t deserve all the love you’ve given me.

710
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:29,560
Thank you for not giving up on loving this bad boy.

711
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,520
I’m glad my love helped you become a better person.

712
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,360
And I’m sorry for…

713
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,580
I love you, Wa.

714
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,820
I love you too, Klao.

715
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,670
Guess we’re not stargazing anymore.

716
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,920
Calm down, Po.

717
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,610
He’s such a lightweight drinker.

718
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,610
Faifa, haven’t you had enough?

719
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,160
Hold my hand, Po.

720
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,330
Hold my hand, Po.

721
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,320
Hold my hand.

722
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,260
Fix my heart.

723
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,280
My god.

724
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,280
Guys, Po is so drunk.

725
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,900
I’ll take him to the tent.

726
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,800
Look at me.

727
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,600
Fix my heart.

728
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,600
Come on, bro.

729
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,530
Let’s go.

730
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,070
Take good care of him, Sand.

731
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,260
Help me, Pond.

732
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,360
Oh, Po.

733
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,840
I can’t.

734
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,210
Come on.

735
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,920
You need to choose if you want to be drunk or funny.

736
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,190
See you later.

737
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:12,910
Yeah.

738
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,010
Be careful.

739
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,320
Bye.

740
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,390
Hey, Arm.

741
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,400
Are you drunk?

742
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,400
Not this time.

743
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,250
Hey, guys.

744
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,550
I can’t believe the Perfect 10 Liners,

745
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,520
which I used to think was total nonsense,

746
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,780
ended up bringing all of us together like this.

747
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,740
That’s true.

748
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,380
I’m sorry

749
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,020
for breaking the tradition of dating within your group.

750
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,290
Thank you so much, Gun,

751
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,290
for being the first to break it

752
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,590
and giving me the chance to join the group.

753
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,960
No need to thank me.

754
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,660
are not pure-blood Perfect 10 Liners,

755
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,660
you’re related to us.

756
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,800
Faifa,

757
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,760
you’re Yotha’s younger brother.

758
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,130
And Gun, you’re in the unusual name family

759
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,880
with me and Wine.

760
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
What does your name Anon mean?

761
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,050
A person who has no debt.

762
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,480
Hello again.

763
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,190
I’m Gunyukhol Jiraroj.

764
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,920
Gunyukhol means two ears.

765
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,610
I prayed to a shrine

766
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,090
that if I got in,

767
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,680
I’d change my name to Witsawa.

768
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,450
I can't believe that those with unusual names
I heard about in the interview room

769
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,700
are here with me now

770
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,470
It’s God’s plan, Wine.

771
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,470
For us to meet?

772
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,200
No.

773
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,790
For me and Arc to be together.

774
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,600
Right, Arc?

775
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,440
Let me kiss you.

776
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,310
If this was before,
I’d be so annoyed with you.

777
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,160
But now I have a boyfriend to kiss too.

778
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,890
On both cheeks.

779
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,890
Please.

780
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,810
Yotha,

781
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,770
are you going to let him outdo you?

782
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,920
One. Two.

783
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,920
That’s it.

784
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,710
Look at that!

785
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,900
That’s my brother.

786
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,910
I miss the first day we met at Bang On.

787
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,700
Wine was still quiet back then.

788
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,140
If Wine were the color white,

789
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,000
Faifa would be the color of a rainbow.

790
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,720
I didn’t expect you’d end up together.

791
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,820
You know nothing.

792
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,210
I had my eyes on him before you guys even met him.

793
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,520
What do you mean?

794
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,870
You and Wine knew each other before?

795
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,920
What were you laughing at?

796
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,120
I’m sorry.

797
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,470
I didn’t mean it.

798
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,910
I fell in love with your smile at first sight.

799
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,820
Even though this coach has been through quite a lot,

800
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,370
he still gets the gold medal.

801
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,350
Whatever.

802
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,310
Kiss me too.

803
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,170
Come on, Arc!

804
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:26,680
Do it again.

805
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,500
Make sure you touch my cheek.

806
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,690
Come on!

807
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,910
Touch it!

808
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,080
Come on, cheers!

809
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,440
One more time.

810
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,620
Cheers!

811
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,420
To Perfect 10 Liners!

812
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,120
Po!

813
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,570
Ugh!

814
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,370
Took you so long to fall asleep!

815
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,370
Ugh!

816
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
This is the most tired I’ve been in my life.

817
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,320
Being heartbroken is scary, isn’t it?

818
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,390
You don’t have to be scared, Sand.

819
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,770
You’ll never experience it.

820
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,880
That better be true.

821
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,180
Hmm.

822
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,870
If that day ever comes,

823
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,320
I’d be the first one dying of heartbreak.

824
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,310
Good night.

825
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
Good night.

826
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,060
Good night, Po.

827
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
You can sleep here with us.

828
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,440
You really can.

829
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,180
You mean it?

830
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:53,960
Mm.

831
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,280
Hey.

832
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,120
Po!

833
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,360
Calm down!

834
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,170
Po!

835
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,010
He’s my boyfriend, Po!

836
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,000
Po!

837
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,860
Get out, Po!

838
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,520
You’re playing like a child.

839
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,430
What are you doing here?

840
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,520
Waiting for Wine to finish his shower.

841
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,640
You?

842
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,200
Waiting for Beagle to finish his shower.

843
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,070
Even though we’re not twins, it feels like we are.

844
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,350
We have a lot in common.

845
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,400
Why didn't you tell me about Mom?

846
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,480
I didn’t know where to start.

847
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,630
If I just walked up and said,

848
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,770
“I think Mom loves you more than me,”

849
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,500
I’d seem like a jealous kid.

850
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,080
But we’re brothers.

851
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,870
You used to confide in me all the time.

852
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,880
Do you mean

853
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,360
before I moved out with Mom,

854
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,550
when I told you I got bullied in kindergarten
and you punched them?

855
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,520
I can’t believe you remember that.

856
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,080
You remember it too.

857
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,300
Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to break it down.

858
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,110
Yotha.

859
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,580
Listen to me.

860
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,940
I want us to go back to the way we were.

861
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,530
I have been for a long time.

862
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,290
I got my closure.

863
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,250
I talked to Mom that day

864
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,800
and I’ve talked to you now.

865
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,920
I really feel like things are the same between us again.

866
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,260
Even though you’re only a little older,

867
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,480
I’m glad I’m your little brother.

868
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,760
Yeah.

869
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,120
Me too.

870
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,850
Oh!

871
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,240
I’m cold!

872
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,440
Hug me, Arc.

873
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,740
How are you feeling now?

874
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,870
Does my hug make you warmer?

875
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,170
This body and this warm hug.

876
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,430
You’re just my type.

877
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,840
You’re my type too, Arm.

878
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,230
You like cute?

879
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,040
No.

880
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,430
I like dumb.

881
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,800
You’re scolding me again.

882
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,950
I’m just kidding.

883
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:13,830
It’s fine.

884
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:14,750
I’m used to it.

885
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
Can I ask you something?

886
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,170
Mm.

887
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,600
I’m being serious.

888
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,070
Mm.

889
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,410
Are you being honest too?

890
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,250
Why did you pursue me?

891
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,520
Why did I pursue you?

892
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,160
Mm.

893
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,780
I just wanted to because I liked you

894
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,470
and I didn’t want you to smile at anyone else.

895
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,820
Oh.

896
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,660
That’s it?

897
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,880
That’s such a small reason.

898
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,780
Well, yes.

899
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,780
That’s all I felt at the time.

900
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:12,920
Right now, my reasons are similar

901
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,880
but there’s more.

902
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,000
Really?

903
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,040
What is it?

904
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
Look, Arm.

905
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:33,200
Now I want you with me through every stage of my life.

906
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,300
From now on and forever.

907
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,300
I’m not smiling.

908
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,840
You are.

909
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,160
Thank you.

910
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:58,400
But I’m not any better than the others.

911
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,150
Arm,

912
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,240
to me, you’re the best.

913
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,720
It’s you.

914
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,890
It’s only you.

915
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,250
Yes, Arc.

916
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,920
♪ You’re the love suspect, hard to crack ♪

917
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:02,710
♪ Got my heart fluttered, fell off track ♪

918
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,770
♪ I think about you till I’m losing my mind ♪

919
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,810
♪ I just thought of you again ♪

920
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,680
♪ If I fall head over heels for you ♪

921
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,540
♪ Then I can point the finger at who? ♪

922
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,300
Aren’t you sleepy?

923
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,790
You asked me to come outside.

924
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,200
I’m not sleepy.

925
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,280
I want to enjoy the atmosphere.

926
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,920
We haven’t been alone all day.

927
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:32,830
Stop being cute, Beagle.

928
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,830
Actually,

929
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,870
you look handsome from every angle.

930
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,680
Are you crazy?

931
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,230
I’m already shy.

932
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:50,950
Really?

933
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:52,050
Beagle.

934
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,600
You really are handsome.

935
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,080
Beagle, stop teasing me.

936
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,850
Stop being cute.

937
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,050
Yotha.

938
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,780
Hmm?

939
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,220
Have you ever thought about

940
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,960
what would happen if we weren't together?

941
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:21,024
If I had decided to stop waiting for you,

942
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,753
what would you do?

943
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,386
Do you…

944
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,620
have the answer for me yet?

945
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:31,906
If someone makes you love them more than me,

946
00:46:31,926 --> 00:46:33,433
you’re free to go.

947
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,013
I guess I'd go back to living my life alone in the dark.

948
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,386
What about you, Beagle?

949
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,593
What would you do?

950
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:00,833
Me?

951
00:47:02,173 --> 00:47:03,460
Hmm.

952
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,246
I guess

953
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:13,640
I’d pray for you to open up your heart

954
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,153
to someone one day.

955
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,440
Anyone who could make you happy.

956
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,486
No one else can.

957
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,346
There might be someone.

958
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:30,660
Beagle,

959
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,500
you didn’t just make it easier for me to open up.

960
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,220
This time, I opened my heart only for you

961
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,906
and I want it to be the last time I do that.

962
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:53,420
Will you be my last?

963
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,306
Of course.

964
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,900
Forever?

965
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:03,906
Yes.

966
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:05,880

00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,073
Don’t you miss that night?

982
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:30,960
Hey.

983
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,720
Why did you slap me?

984
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:37,380
Don’t talk about that.

985
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,713
I mean, I miss when we lay down
and listened to music together.

986
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,266
What were you thinking about, boyfriend?

987
00:49:45,293 --> 00:49:46,613
Quiet.

988
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:47,893
I’m going to sleep.

989
00:49:49,146 --> 00:49:49,913
Hey.

990
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:52,953
Tell me what you were thinking about.

991
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,140
Nothing.

992
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,126
Were you thinking about when we kissed?

993
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,580
That night, we did this

994
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,106
and what else?

995
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,233
Faifa!

996
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,493
You know what?

997
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:27,666
When I’m with you, I don’t have to try.

998
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,013
Just being together,

999
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,813
whether we’re sitting, sleeping, or doing anything,

1000
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:36,540
makes me happy.

1001
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,546
You’re my happiness too.

1002
00:50:43,446 --> 00:50:47,526
Thank you for reducing what I have too much of

1003
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,846
and filling in what I'm missing.

1004
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,486
I love you, Wine.

1005
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,453
I’m so sad I’m missing out.

1006
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,450
I’ll definitely join you guys next time.

1007
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:45,553
Hi, Jet. Hi, Pun.

1008
00:51:45,586 --> 00:51:48,373
Hey, all the Perfect 10 Liners are together.

1009
00:51:48,393 --> 00:51:50,740
Where are your sweethearts?

1010
00:51:50,766 --> 00:51:51,940
Get everyone in the frame.

1011
00:51:51,973 --> 00:51:53,213
I’ll screenshot and post it on my IG story.

1012
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:53,606
Faifa! Gun!

1013
00:51:53,633 --> 00:51:53,990
- Gun!
- 	Faifa!

1014
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,660
Come here!

1015
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,620
Come here!

1016
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:00,306
Now that we’re all together,

1017
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,093
Perfect 10 Liners and their sweethearts, smile.

1018
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:04,406
Cheese.

1019
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,200
Let’s change the pose.

1020
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,520
Pun, make sure you’re free next time.

1021
00:52:11,553 --> 00:52:13,893
If Jet is busy again, just break up with him.

1022
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:16,426
Arm, how can you say that?

1023
00:52:16,446 --> 00:52:17,786
You wanna fight?

1024
00:52:17,806 --> 00:52:18,760
I’m just kidding.

1025
00:52:18,793 --> 00:52:20,153
I won’t keep you any longer.

1026
00:52:20,193 --> 00:52:21,140
Enjoy your vacation, kids.

1027
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:21,926
Bye-bye.

1028
00:52:21,946 --> 00:52:22,806
Bye-bye.

1029
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:23,533
Take care.

1030
00:52:23,553 --> 00:52:24,840
Bye.

1031
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,886
I’m so happy

1032
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:36,373
to be here with you all.

1033
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:49,053
“PERFECT 10 LINERS AND THEIR SWEETHEARTS”

1034
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:51,050
It’s actually fun to be in this peer mentoring group.

1035
00:52:54,853 --> 00:52:56,850
Without Perfect 10 Liners,

1036
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,780
I wouldn’t have met you again, Faifa.

1037
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:00,440
Yeah.

1038
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:02,420
I’m grateful.

1039
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:05,053
It gave me the excuse to approach you.

1040
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:05,926
Aww.

1041
00:53:05,946 --> 00:53:07,066
Even without it, I’d still approach you.

1042
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,453
What?

1043
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,166
Go, Faifa!

1044
00:53:22,186 --> 00:53:23,420
Just you wait!

1045
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:24,186
Faifa!

1046
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:26,480
One!

1047
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:29,473
Two!

1048
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,026
Go!

1049
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:36,753
(This is the weird peer mentoring group I told you all about.)

1050
00:53:36,773 --> 00:53:40,380
(They’re called Perfect 10 Liners.)

1051
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,893
(But remember,)

1052
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:46,653
(everything I’ve told you stays here.)

1053
00:53:46,673 --> 00:53:48,040
One, two, three!

1054
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:48,773
Go!

1055
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,080
One!

1056
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,913
Two!

1057
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,893
Go!

1058
00:54:03,053 --> 00:54:05,050
Go!

1059
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:07,153
One!

1060
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,793
Two!

1061
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,813
Go!

1062
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:20,380
Being single is not a serious disease.

1063
00:54:20,426 --> 00:54:22,966
No one dies from being single.

1064
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,946
Guys!

1065
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,440
They make me work so hard.

1066
00:54:57,473 --> 00:54:57,780
Yes.

1067
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,440
(Think about your first love.)

1068
00:54:59,486 --> 00:55:01,013
Then, as soon as Arm hugs his knees,

1069
00:55:01,046 --> 00:55:02,040
Arc walks up.

1070
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:02,740
(Uh-huh.)

1071
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:03,273
No.

1072
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,113
(What happens next?)

1073
00:55:04,146 --> 00:55:05,886
Arc goes to have lunch.

1074
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,246
Go over the top.

1075
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,580
That’s too much.

1076
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:10,426
That’s too much.

1077
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:13,500
(Who’s that?)

1078
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,480
(How are you feeling?)

1079
00:55:15,633 --> 00:55:16,346
Shy.

1080
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,133
What?

1081
00:55:17,153 --> 00:55:17,900
I bet you want to see it.

1082
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:18,800

(That’s it.)

1089
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,746

1090
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,400

00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,240
