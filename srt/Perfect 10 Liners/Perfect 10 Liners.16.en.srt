1
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:01,134
Let’s go to your house, Beagle.

2
00:00:02,591 --> 00:00:03,626
This is my friend Yotha.

3
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:04,977
Your family is warm.

4
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:06,605
You see that storage room over there?

5
00:00:06,863 --> 00:00:07,758
That’s the reason

6
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:09,404
I’m scared to sleep with the lights off.

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,699
Let’s go in there together.

8
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:14,804
Remember my hug.

9
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:16,383
If you dream of this place again,

10
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:17,401
you’ll be safe.

11
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:19,103
Our fears

12
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:20,308
are gone.

13
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:21,614
Let’s be a couple.

14
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:22,518
Mm.

15
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:23,580
Let’s be a couple.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,078
What?

17
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:49,180
It’s already late morning.

18
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:50,548
I have to help Mom cook.

19
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:51,706
Let me cuddle you for five more minutes.

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,605
Come on.

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,802
You’ve cuddled me all night. Isn’t that enough?

22
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:01,471
No.

23
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:04,937
Yotha.

24
00:01:06,582 --> 00:01:07,810
Kiss me first, then I’ll let you go.

25
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:29,037
Sorry.

26
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:30,998
I didn’t know you were kissing.

27
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:33,357
Mom asked me to get you for breakfast.

28
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:35,460
Wait, Kloy!

29
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,309
Please don’t tell Dad and Mom.

30
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:45,339
Fine.

31
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:46,703
I won’t tell them.

32
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:49,391
Dad!

33
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:51,050
Gun’s been naughty!

34
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:55,173
No!

35
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:57,500
Yotha!

36
00:01:57,814 --> 00:01:58,805
Do you want a big sister?

37
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,671
I don’t want mine anymore. You can have her.

38
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:39,600
I’ll come visit you again, Mom.

39
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,200
Take care of yourself.

40
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:45,130
Don’t forget to eat all meals

41
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,331
and on time.

42
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:47,813
I will.

43
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:49,002
Let me hug you.

44
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:52,112
Dad, too.

45
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,607
Come on, let’s send your brother off.

46
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,524
Okay, that’s enough.

47
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,214
Come on.

48
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,629
You only have one brother.
You should love him a lot, Kloy.

49
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,207
I love you,

50
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:08,503
but I can love you from a distance.

51
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:15,767
Yotha.

52
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,711
Let me give you a hug.

53
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:22,334
Come on.

54
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:23,408
Don’t waste time.

55
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:24,342
Come on.

56
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,001
Thank you.

57
00:04:33,642 --> 00:04:35,325
I should be the one to thank you.

58
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,404
My son is very stubborn.

59
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,362
Please take care of him.

60
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:41,825
I will.

61
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:43,336
Please don’t worry.

62
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:45,029
Thank you.

63
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,207
You know nothing, Mom.

64
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,404
I actually take care of him.

65
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:55,219
You know how to take care of someone?

66
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:57,105
You still trip while walking.

67
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:58,451
Whoa!

68
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,637
Dad!

69
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:01,050
There goes my cool!

70
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:03,709
You guys should hurry and be on your way

71
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:05,711
so you can get to Bangkok before dark.

72
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:06,705
Okay.

73
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:07,906
Let’s go.

74
00:05:08,278 --> 00:05:09,906
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

75
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:10,912
Bye-bye.

76
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:12,096
- Bye.
- Bye.

77
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:12,798
Bye.

78
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,361
Hey!

79
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:18,438
Get in! Get in!

80
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:19,438
Come on!

81
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:20,814
Come on!

82
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:21,860
No!

83
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:24,706
I’m dead again.

84
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:28,299
Aren’t you in the wrong room, Kong?

85
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:30,102
Am I in the wrong room, Yotha?

86
00:05:33,863 --> 00:05:35,708
You left me sleeping here all alone,

87
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,948
so I asked Kong to join me.

88
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:37,697
Yeah.

89
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,235
Right, you lonely boy.

90
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,899
How was meeting Gun’s family, bro?

91
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,044
We’re a couple now.

92
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:56,550
Huh?

93
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:57,805
Seriously?

94
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,805
Hey!

95
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:00,951
Are you dating now?

96
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:09,877
What?

97
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:11,300
They’re dating now?

98
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:13,515
Thanks for the news, Faifa.

99
00:06:13,912 --> 00:06:14,592
Okay.

100
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:15,602
Talk later.

101
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:19,158
Who’s dating who?

102
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:21,229
Yotha and Gun.

103
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,263
They’re a couple now.

104
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:24,641
Why are you so excited?

105
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:26,805
I’ve seen them crushing
on each other since day one.

106
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:29,311
I know, but I didn’t expect them
to get together this fast.

107
00:06:29,902 --> 00:06:30,779
He’s so quiet.

108
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,202
I didn’t know he was the real deal.

109
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:35,979
How am I not the real deal?

110
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,097
You think you’re the real deal?

111
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,001
What kind of real deal are you?

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,400
You had a crush on me for so long
but didn’t give me any signal.

113
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:48,845
You’re lucky no one beat you to hitting on me.

114
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:51,173
Please.

115
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,066
No one hit on you

116
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,607
because the whole uni knew I liked you.

117
00:06:56,314 --> 00:06:58,952
You were the only one who was clueless.

118
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:00,337
Really?

119
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:01,103
Yeah.

120
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,241
But even if you liked someone else,

121
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,105
I’d steal you back.

122
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:10,198
Do you understand, Arm?

123
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:11,998
Yes.

124
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,160
Why don’t you grab more materials so I can help?

125
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,868
Get them from your friends.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,779
It’s so troublesome when our uni is not the host.

127
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,312
What are you talking about, Sam?

128
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,457
What’s the problem with another uni hosting it?

129
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:30,748
What would you know?

130
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:32,931
You were Athlete Support

131
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,878
who only took care of the athlete in your group.

132
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:38,001
You didn’t have to carry stuff,
organize the parade,

133
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,237
or carry food and water around like us.

134
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:41,499
Not this again.

135
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,100
What’s your role again, Arm?

136
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:45,392
Don’t listen to him.

137
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:46,407
He’s just rambling.

138
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:48,103
That was last year.

139
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:50,005
This year, I’m helping every team.

140
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,177
You’re helping every team?

141
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:53,210
Please.

142
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:54,805
Let me tell you something.

143
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:57,001
Last year, our uni was the host.

144
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:58,657
Arm was still dumb then.

145
00:07:58,674 --> 00:07:59,708
What the hell, Sam?

146
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:00,502
Shut up.

147
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:01,811
What’s the story, Sam?

148
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:05,103
Last year, Arc was chasing him non-stop.

149
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:06,940
The whole faculty could see it.

150
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,512
He was the only one dumb enough not to see it.

151
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:12,007
Hey, you’re bashing me so much.

152
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:13,585
You want the juniors to stop respecting me, huh?

153
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,844
One day, we were having a meeting
about our roles for the Engineers Unite.

154
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:19,788
The whole faculty was there.

155
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:21,810
Suddenly, Arc came out of nowhere

156
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:22,900
and said

157
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,903
Arm had to be the athlete support staff,

158
00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:30,287
but only for the athlete from his group.

159
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:32,503
How many times have you told this story, Sam?

160
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,629
I guess you’ll still be telling it after I graduate.

161
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:37,391
Weren’t you shy, Arm?

162
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,910
Shy? Please.

163
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:41,228
He was still clueless back then.

164
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:42,035
Sam, you jerk.

165
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,297
Why don’t you kick my face then

166
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:44,505
if you’re going to scold me this much?

167
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:45,699
- Hey, Yotha.
- Damn it.

168
00:08:45,749 --> 00:08:46,715
Which team are you on?

169
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:48,405
Promotion team.

170
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,924
Your team is taking photos over there.

171
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:53,200
I’m here to see Gunyukhol.

172
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:56,911
Yotha.

173
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:02,795
Hey.

174
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,324
Unbelievable.

175
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:12,522
The Perfect 10 Liners are all posers.

176
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:14,420
Like mentor, like mentee.

177
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:16,592
I’m handsome.

178
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:20,311
I bought you water and snacks.

179
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,582
Thank you.

180
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,371
Don’t you have to get photos taken?

181
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:28,242
I already did.

182
00:09:30,306 --> 00:09:30,896
Just in time.

183
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:34,059
Our art team could use some extra help.

184
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:36,666
The seniors said

185
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:38,985
if I helped with the promotional artwork shoot,

186
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,905
I wouldn’t have to do anything else for the event.

187
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,248
Oh.

188
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:45,402
No wonder you agreed to do the promotion shoot.

189
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,546
You get something in return.

190
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:48,970
You’re sneaky.

191
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:51,869
So you’re not going to help?

192
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:52,623
No.

193
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:53,998
Then why are you here?

194
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,897
I said I’m here to see Gunyukhol.

195
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:09,530
I hope you choke on the water.

196
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,669
Done!

197
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,582
The bed is so small.

198
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:37,703
How can you both sleep on it?

199
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,783
Love makes you tiny.

200
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:41,828
Please!

201
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:49,829
Wait.

202
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,472
Can you turn the lights off for me?

203
00:10:54,678 --> 00:10:55,251
What did you say?

204
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,103
Turn the lights off for me.

205
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,900
You can sleep with the lights off now?

206
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:03,789
Yeah.

207
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:05,986
Don’t tell me

208
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:08,573
this is also because of the power of love.

209
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:11,900
Okay.

210
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:14,502
I’m single, so I don’t get it.

211
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:17,115
I’ve been alone, growing up alone,
and sleeping alone.

212
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,056
I’ll never get it.

213
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:21,051
I’m so tired of you.

214
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,318
You’re all set.

215
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,164
Thank you.

216
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,216
Let me see.

217
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:32,500
How do I look?

218
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:35,365
Hey, you look more handsome with makeup.

219
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:36,810
Now fix your tie.

220
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:38,251
You should try putting makeup on too.

221
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,933
Fix your tie.

222
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,182
Just kidding.

223
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:42,465
By the way,

224
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:46,103
was the event we hosted last year
as grand as this one?

225
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:48,505
Much grander.

226
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:49,354
I’m telling you.

227
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,651
- Really?
- Yeah.

228
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:54,508
What did you do last year, Arm?

229
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:57,349
It was so crazy last year.

230
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:58,934
I had to watch over Arc by the field,

231
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:00,205
and I was dying from the heat.

232
00:12:00,782 --> 00:12:03,041
Good thing Yotha is the university ambassador.

233
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,202
He just has to get his photos taken
in an air-conditioned room.

234
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:06,530
You’re lucky.

235
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:07,602
Yeah.

236
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,845
Did you hear what Arm said?

237
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,401
You’re so lucky to have me as your boyfriend.

238
00:12:12,637 --> 00:12:14,001
You’re the lucky one

239
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,146
for getting me as your boyfriend.

240
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:18,376
Someone like Gun is hard to find.

241
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:20,174
He’s like a secret item.

242
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:23,725
Is that a compliment?

243
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,891
Do you want me to scold you?

244
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:25,964
I could do that all day.

245
00:12:26,102 --> 00:12:27,362
Yotha. Faifa.

246
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:29,044
If you’re ready, please come to the studio.

247
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:29,908
The crew is ready.

248
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:30,508
Okay.

249
00:12:32,678 --> 00:12:33,325
By the way,

250
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:35,411
have you figured out who your buddies are?

251
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:37,411
Yes, we all have,

252
00:12:37,586 --> 00:12:39,158
except Yotha.

253
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:40,028
Oh?

254
00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:41,585
Hurry up and find them.

255
00:12:42,056 --> 00:12:44,186
If you don’t find them,
they’ll take you on stage, you know?

256
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,560
If you don’t want to be embarrassed, hurry up.

257
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:46,204
Okay.

258
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:48,499
Come on. Let me see.

259
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:50,118
Last check.

260
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:51,518
All done.

261
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:54,010
Do I look handsome now?

262
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:55,502
The most handsome.

263
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,660
You’ll definitely stand out
from the other universities.

264
00:12:58,677 --> 00:12:59,311
Come on.

265
00:12:59,823 --> 00:13:01,903
Will you die if you stop loving
each other for a second?

266
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:02,699
Yes.

267
00:13:03,303 --> 00:13:04,297
I’ll lie on the floor.

268
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:06,034
I get you, Gun.

269
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:07,777
You have such a cool boyfriend, right?

270
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,847
How could you not be obsessed with him?

271
00:13:10,644 --> 00:13:11,143
Yeah.

272
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:13,231
No one feels sorry for a single guy like me.

273
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:13,977
Come on.

274
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,702
Let’s go.

275
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:15,432
Let’s get to work.

276
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:16,968
Stop showing off your boyfriend.

277
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:18,700
Aren’t you going to do anything else?

278
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:19,682
Why are you such a nag?

279
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,555
Who said doing the promotion work is easy?

280
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:24,324
They told me to give handsome smiles,

281
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:27,060
but didn’t mention I’d have to smile
at every corner of the uni.

282
00:13:27,177 --> 00:13:28,234
Why are you complaining so much?

283
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:29,564
Think about what we did.

284
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:30,557
We take care of the football players.

285
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,207
We ran around the field so much
that our legs gave out.

286
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:32,776
Yeah.

287
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:33,854
Stop complaining.

288
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:34,764
Yeah,

289
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,210
I ran around handing out water,

290
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,705
which was more than the athletes
were running on the field.

291
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,155
Here’s your food.

292
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:43,022
Enjoy.

293
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:45,302
Ears.

294
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:45,997
Hmm?

295
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:47,580
Why did Yotha get two fried eggs

296
00:13:47,597 --> 00:13:48,851
but I only got one?

297
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:53,100
Oh, I treat my boyfriend
and my friend differently.

298
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:55,450
I’ll take this to the Labor Department.

299
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:57,382
Yotha and I do the same amount of work.

300
00:13:57,591 --> 00:13:59,468
Why did I get less?

301
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:00,404
How could you do this?

302
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:01,271
Listen to me, Fai.

303
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:03,305
Go get a good partner

304
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:04,706
so you can get special treatment like me.

305
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:07,888
Yotha is right.

306
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,912
Go find a partner.

307
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,340
You’re so annoying when you’re lonely.

308
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:12,580
You keep bothering me.

309
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:14,322
Who said I don’t want a partner?

310
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:17,948
I want someone to hug me when I’m cold too.

311
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:23,545
Someone to give me two fried eggs, not just one.

312
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:24,520
You can have the fish sauce.

313
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:28,056
Is that dirty?

314
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:29,155
No!

315
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:34,355
You haven’t found your buddy?

316
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,727
Not yet.

317
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:36,419
I’m too lazy.

318
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:38,939
I'll just ask for them when I'm on stage.

319
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:42,306
I thought you were only
giving your buddy the tote bag.

320
00:14:42,385 --> 00:14:43,620
What’s this blanket?

321
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:46,557
I brought it

322
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:48,343
just in case Beagle gets cold.

323
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:49,407
Of course.

324
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,364
Hey, Arm.

325
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,505
How much longer until we get to join our friends?

326
00:14:55,654 --> 00:14:56,672
Probably a while.

327
00:14:57,075 --> 00:15:00,355
They’ll take photos and give flowers
to the host for next year.

328
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:01,404
Then we’ll probably be done.

329
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:04,557
Can I go to the restroom, Arm?

330
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,302
I’m starting to get nervous.

331
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:07,909
Okay, hurry.

332
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,437
Okay.

333
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,305
What?

334
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,709
Hello again, everyone.

335
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,771
If you haven’t found your buddy,

336
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:21,334
I’ll give you another half an hour.

337
00:15:21,595 --> 00:15:23,914
Without further ado,

338
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,351
let’s invite the representatives
from last year’s host

339
00:15:26,514 --> 00:15:27,928
- to come up and talk.
- Shit.

340
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,035
Our uni is up next.

341
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:32,213
Let’s welcome Faifa Thanawanyotha!

342
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,721
Go and buy us time.

343
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,207
- I don’t know what to say.
- Please.

344
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:37,951
I beg you.

345
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:39,045
Help our peer mentoring group.

346
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:39,869
Go.

347
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:45,361
That’s Yotha.

348
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,248
Yeah.

349
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,183
Where’s Faifa?

350
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:48,525
Hi, Faifa.

351
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:49,708
I’m not Faifa.

352
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:52,505
It’s okay.

353
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,205
Please introduce yourself to let everyone know

354
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,478
who you are and where you came from.

355
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:57,823
My name is Yotha.

356
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:58,896
I’m Faifa’s older brother.

357
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,327
Faifa went to the restroom.

358
00:16:00,905 --> 00:16:02,432
Got it.

359
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,444
Let’s talk to Yotha in the meantime.

360
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,502
Have you found your buddy, Yotha?

361
00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:08,896
Not yet.

362
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,208
Is the stuff in your hand

363
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,607
a treat for your buddy?

364
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:12,718
Yes.

365
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:15,748
Wow, what a cute tote bag.

366
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:16,826
Did you choose it yourself?

367
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:19,105
My partner chose it.

368
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:22,002
Wow, your partner chose it.

369
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:25,016
What about this cute blanket?

370
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,761
Did your partner also choose it?

371
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:29,205
My partner chose this for my buddy

372
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:30,890
but this is for my partner.

373
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,705
Oh, it’s for your partner.

374
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:35,173
You guys must be jealous.

375
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:38,038
You single people are smiling
to hide your jealousy.

376
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:45,583
Hi.

377
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:46,235
Hi.

378
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:47,440
Hi, it’s Faifa.

379
00:16:47,462 --> 00:16:48,109
I’m here.

380
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:49,075
Yay!

381
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:53,308
Faifa.

382
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,856
Yes?

383
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:56,440
Where have you been?

384
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,402
Your friends have been waiting for you.

385
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:58,417
It’s cold in this hall.

386
00:16:58,457 --> 00:16:59,324
This will keep you from getting sick.

387
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:01,240
I’m cold.

388
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:01,995
Are you?

389
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,045
I’m shy.

390
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:09,002
Why are you shy?

391
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:10,253
You don’t want to get sick.

392
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:12,755
Yotha!

393
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:30,922
Hi, it’s Faifa.

394
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:32,943
We meet again.

395
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:35,063
Let’s listen to a beautiful song.

396
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:47,001

397
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:52,533

412
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:01,208
Why did you bring me outside?

413
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:04,299
I have something for you.

414
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:06,398
I haven’t had a chance to give it to you yet.

415
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:07,725
What is it?

416
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:13,702
Hey.

417
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:16,900
A tie?

418
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:17,697
Mm-hmm.

419
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:19,706
This is just like what I did.

420
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:23,201
You know my birthday?

421
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:24,028
Of course.

422
00:19:25,462 --> 00:19:26,128
Of course, you do.

423
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,380
You made that questionnaire
to trick me into giving you my info.

424
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,776
I didn’t know how to approach you back then.

425
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:39,903
Why did you get me a tie?

426
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:43,297
I just wanted to give it to you.

427
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:46,251
Is that all?

428
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:04,149
I want us to tie ties together
for a long time, okay?

429
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:19,773
Forever.

430
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,754
♪ Though time goes on, foreverlong ♪

431
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:30,205
♪ You’ll always have me, forevermore ♪

432
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:35,640

♪ And will be so foreverlong ♪

435
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,666
That’s Arm’s voice.

436
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:53,229
Shall we go inside?

437
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:54,100
Mm.

438
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,462
Follow me.

439
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:02,868
Damn.

440
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:04,325
You sang so beautifully.

441
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,259
Thank you all.

442
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:06,263
Thank you so much.

443
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,765
Where are Yotha and Gun?

444
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:11,522
Oh, here they come.

445
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:12,397
Here they come.

446
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:14,066
Come on!

447
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:16,899
Hey.

448
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:18,537
Hmm?

449
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:20,112
You didn’t watch me sing, did you?

450
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:21,413
I did.

451
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:23,653
I was standing right here.

452
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:25,093
You’re an amazing singer.

453
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,094
Why are your lips swollen, hmm?

454
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:29,709
We didn’t kiss.

455
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:34,202
You’re being very suspicious.

456
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:35,611
What did you do? Tell me.

457
00:21:35,648 --> 00:21:36,694
I didn’t do anything.

458
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,515
Why are your lips swollen?

459
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:38,515
Your lips are red.

460
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,662
What?

461
00:21:39,684 --> 00:21:40,608
Ouch!

462
00:21:41,437 --> 00:21:44,817
The legendary Beyond the Star
is busy with his internship

463
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:45,668
so he couldn’t make it.

464
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,272
He sent me instead.

465
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,783
If you know this song, please sing along.

466
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:50,934
I might not sing as well as the original.

467
00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:52,696
They did too well.

468
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:54,539
If you know this song, please sing along.

469
00:21:59,294 --> 00:22:00,573

Have you done your assignment?

489
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,798
Yes, but the teacher won’t collect it today.

490
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:05,814
- Really?
- Yeah.

491
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:07,380
Hey!

492
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:11,662
You scared me.

493
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:14,813
Wait.

494
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,016
This is a major-specific class.

495
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,401
Why is Yotha here?

496
00:23:22,952 --> 00:23:23,875
To accompany me.

497
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:28,248
Are we not your company?

498
00:23:34,056 --> 00:23:35,662
Oh, right.

499
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:39,117
We don’t have a warm blanket for you.

500
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,497
I’m not his friend.

501
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:43,248
I’m his boyfriend.

502
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,564
My heart!

503
00:23:53,521 --> 00:23:54,062
Help!

504
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:00,976
How are you?

505
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:02,520
How’s the bar doing?

506
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:03,823
We have a lot of customers every night.

507
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:05,097
It’s doing pretty well.

508
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,699
Nice.

509
00:24:12,924 --> 00:24:13,604
Hi.

510
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:14,637
Hi.

511
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:15,994
Ah.

512
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:19,917
It’s been a while, Yotha.

513
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:21,361
I’ve been busy with school, Nop.

514
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,211
Since you guys have been away,

515
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:24,955
my business has been making a lot more profit.

516
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:26,382
Come on.

517
00:24:26,862 --> 00:24:28,580
Can’t you treat a few brothers?

518
00:24:28,604 --> 00:24:30,801
Yes, but they shouldn’t come every night.

519
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,828
Fine.

520
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,674
I’ll drink until the bar goes bankrupt tonight.

521
00:24:33,696 --> 00:24:34,226
Just you wait.

522
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:35,222
Calm down.

523
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:37,481
Calm down, bro.

524
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,299
Here you go.

525
00:24:39,502 --> 00:24:41,435
Anyway, you can go all out tonight.

526
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:43,828
Cheers!

527
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:50,845
So, how’s it going?

528
00:24:51,564 --> 00:24:53,308
Give us an update on your status.

529
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:06,580
He’s my boyfriend.

530
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:08,085
Hey.

531
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,125
Congrats, bro.

532
00:25:13,383 --> 00:25:14,038
Congrats.

533
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,346
Thank you, Wa.

534
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:19,503
I don’t believe you.

535
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:20,902
If you’re really boyfriends,

536
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:22,242
kiss him on the cheek.

537
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:23,866
Nonsense.

538
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,397
What’s wrong with you, New?

539
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:27,162
If they’re boyfriends,
they have no reason to be shy.

540
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:28,730
Can’t you kiss each other on the cheek?

541
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:29,828
Klao.

542
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,611
Show them how it’s done.

543
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:40,965
Yes.

544
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:42,008
Klao!

545
00:25:56,754 --> 00:25:58,131
Keep it coming, Klao!

546
00:25:58,158 --> 00:25:59,099
Don’t let them win.

547
00:26:02,254 --> 00:26:03,700
- Yeah.
- Okay.

548
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,773
Hey!

549
00:26:30,794 --> 00:26:32,365
That’s enough.

550
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:33,610
Don’t get too fired up.

551
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:34,488
Calm down.

552
00:26:34,514 --> 00:26:34,967
Okay?

553
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:35,697
Calm down.

554
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:36,647
Calm down.

555
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:39,598
Come on, let’s drink.

556
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:41,518
You can do something else tonight.

557
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:42,871
Come on.

558
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:43,522
Cheers!

559
00:26:51,205 --> 00:26:52,019
Are you drunk yet?

560
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:53,505
I’m still okay.

561
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:55,410
You’re just the perfect person

562
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:57,454
to complete Yotha’s world.

563
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,013
It has to be you.

564
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:01,251
Thank you.

565
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,204
Ever since I got with Klao,

566
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:05,503
I’ve been feeling guilty towards Yotha.

567
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:09,216
I’d hoped someday he’d find
someone good to take care of him.

568
00:27:10,191 --> 00:27:11,300
Today, he’s really found the one.

569
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:15,115
I promise to take care of Yotha the best I can.

570
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:19,900
There’s something else I want to tell you.

571
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:24,125
I’m not Yotha’s first love.

572
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,407
You are.

573
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,305
You’re taking so long.

574
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,303
What are you doing?

575
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:37,173
Just talking to him.

576
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:38,623
Is something going on?

577
00:27:40,277 --> 00:27:40,800
No.

578
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:42,804
Just wondering what took you so long.

579
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:45,182
Excuse me.

580
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,601
Why are you staring at my face?

581
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,601
I want to kiss you.

582
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:31,297
Just a kiss?

583
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:34,804
You know me.

584
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:01,285
Hey.

585
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,005
Where’s Wa?

586
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,389
In the restroom with Klao.

587
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,500
Oh.

588
00:29:05,106 --> 00:29:06,300
They’ll come out in the morning.

589
00:29:07,336 --> 00:29:08,031
Why?

590
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,614
Beagle.

591
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:11,555
Don’t be curious.

592
00:29:11,568 --> 00:29:13,822
How can they stay in the restroom until morning?

593
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:16,588
They all can.

594
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,525
Why don’t you ask Yotha
to take you to the restroom?

595
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:19,601
Why?

596
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,997
- Shut up.
- You want to take Beagle to the restroom, right?

597
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:24,164
When you’re inside the restroom together,

598
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,622
you get super close.

599
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:42,703
Let’s stay here tonight.

600
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,537
I’m too lazy to go back to the dorm.

601
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:45,903
Okay.

602
00:29:46,237 --> 00:29:47,576
I’ll call and ask Mom.

603
00:29:48,358 --> 00:29:49,072
I already asked her.

604
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:49,905
You don’t have to.

605
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,404
Since when do you have my mom’s number?

606
00:29:55,717 --> 00:29:57,100
Since I got her son to be my boyfriend.

607
00:29:58,365 --> 00:29:59,560
You’re getting carried away these days.

608
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:00,497
A little.

609
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,703
You’re crazy.

610
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:07,217
Go take a shower.

611
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,063
I’ve prepared pajamas for you.

612
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:10,056
Are you okay?

613
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,085
Of course, I am.

614
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:12,620
Do you want me to come in and check on you?

615
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:13,779
You’re crazy.

616
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:14,552
Don’t come in.

617
00:30:22,096 --> 00:30:23,614
Do you keep some of Arm’s pajamas here too?

618
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:26,062
Yeah, I have a lot.

619
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:32,022
When we both wear them,

620
00:30:32,752 --> 00:30:33,503
it’s just so yellow, isn’t it?

621
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:34,776
It’s cute.

622
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:37,500
Arm must be happy

623
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:39,500
to see that you love his gift so much.

624
00:30:39,974 --> 00:30:42,805
I always take good care of what’s mine.

625
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:44,182
Really?

626
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:45,626
It’s true.

627
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:47,700
And…

628
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:56,103
What are you doing?

629
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:57,871
Don’t you want to know

630
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,023
what Klao and Warich did in the restroom?

631
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:04,842
Hmm?

632
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,777
I think I know now.

633
00:31:10,888 --> 00:31:11,626
You still don’t know.

634
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:33,302
I thought you said Arm’s pajama top was cute.

635
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:36,004
You just threw it away like it’s nothing.

636
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,451
You look cute with it on,

637
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,354
and cute without it on.

638
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:54,602
Hey.

639
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,666
You’re getting naughty, Beagle.

640
00:31:57,677 --> 00:31:58,838
Don’t you like it when I’m naughty?

641
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:28,906
Why do you look so sad, Fai?

642
00:32:30,653 --> 00:32:31,805
I want a partner.

643
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,035
You do?

644
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,035
I see you enjoy life every day.

645
00:32:37,377 --> 00:32:39,035
I didn’t think you’d want to be with someone too.

646
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,000
It’s usually fun,

647
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,973
but after seeing people around me
getting into relationships,

648
00:32:46,137 --> 00:32:48,122
I can’t help but feel lonely.

649
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:50,754
You can hang out with me.

650
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:52,099
No.

651
00:32:52,451 --> 00:32:53,211
You’re old.

652
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:53,708
Hey.

653
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:54,777
You jerk.

654
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,308
In our lives,

655
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,897
we just need someone by our side, right?

656
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:02,760
How would you know anything?

657
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:06,302
Every time I see Yotha and Gun cuddle,

658
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:09,177
you don’t know how sad I feel.

659
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:10,991
Hold on.

660
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:13,004
I think you watch too many soap operas.

661
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:16,570
Heaven is too mean.

662
00:33:17,764 --> 00:33:21,582
Why hasn’t it sent me someone already?

663
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:31,601
Hey, Dad.

664
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:34,097
Hi, Dad.

665
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,431
Why are you guys home?

666
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,201
Fai is lonely.

667
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,099
I didn’t know where to bring him,
so I brought him home.

668
00:33:42,315 --> 00:33:43,339
You know, Dad,

669
00:33:43,597 --> 00:33:45,503
I see people in love everywhere I go.

670
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,096
That’s why I came home.

671
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,703
Because I know you love me.

672
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:50,768
No.

673
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,737
Hey.

674
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,645
Don’t do this to me in the morning.

675
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:56,385
How did you know we’d be here?

676
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,808
You prepared breakfast.

677
00:33:58,364 --> 00:33:59,962
Actually, I didn’t prepare it for you guys.

678
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:01,072
What?

679
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,004
There they are.

680
00:34:04,405 --> 00:34:04,980
Hi, Dad.

681
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:06,398
Hi.

682
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:07,416
Hi.

683
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:10,893
Ugh.

684
00:34:11,623 --> 00:34:13,348
I ran away from you lovebirds

685
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,466
but you had to follow me here
and show off your love.

686
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,400
Ugh.

687
00:34:17,914 --> 00:34:18,582
Poor thing.

688
00:34:19,096 --> 00:34:19,802
Hang in there.

689
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,297
Is this the Beagle you told me about?

690
00:34:24,056 --> 00:34:25,005
It’s such an uncommon name

691
00:34:25,091 --> 00:34:25,965
but it’s cute.

692
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:29,174
My name is actually Gun.

693
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:30,445
Gunyukhol.

694
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,208
Tell my dad what it means.

695
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,185
Fai.

696
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:34,014
Come on.

697
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:34,945
What does it mean?

698
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:36,762
It has good meaning, right?

699
00:34:37,497 --> 00:34:38,577
I guess so.

700
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,509
It means two ears.

701
00:34:42,722 --> 00:34:43,635
Two ears.

702
00:34:44,177 --> 00:34:44,665
Yes.

703
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,505
That’s unusual.

704
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:49,779
Very unusual, Dad.

705
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,531
I’ve never heard such an unusual name.

706
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,402
It’s good.

707
00:34:52,736 --> 00:34:53,450
Thank you.

708
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,325
So, how are things going?

709
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:59,054
You’re together, right?

710
00:34:59,368 --> 00:35:00,001
Yes.

711
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:02,202
Good.

712
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:04,903
Come visit me here whenever you have time,

713
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,302
so I won’t be lonely. Come hang out.

714
00:35:06,765 --> 00:35:07,299
Okay.

715
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:14,334
Just in time for breakfast.

716
00:35:15,094 --> 00:35:16,379
Can I join you guys?

717
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:18,791
Hi.

718
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:30,605
I’ll check on him.

719
00:35:45,617 --> 00:35:46,576
Was that your mom?

720
00:35:48,162 --> 00:35:48,674
Mm.

721
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,053
It’s not nice to walk away like that.

722
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,296
I don’t want to see her.

723
00:35:58,475 --> 00:36:00,028
But she came here because she wanted to see you.

724
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:05,007
I told her not to come see me again.

725
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,758
You’ve seen how Dad, Newton, Faifa, and I

726
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,765
have been doing just fine without her.

727
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,903
Especially now that I have you in my life,

728
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:18,564
I’m so happy without her.

729
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:23,097
But your mom is not happy.

730
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:26,170
What do you mean?

731
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:30,400
No mother wants her son to hate her forever.

732
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,065
You’re happy now.

733
00:36:35,047 --> 00:36:36,600
Don’t you want to share that happiness with her?

734
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:13,746
Where’s Yotha?

735
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:15,804
He’s outside.

736
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:19,601
Fai, Yotha wants to talk to you.

737
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,004
Me?

738
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,608
Me again.

739
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:24,761
Damn it.

740
00:37:25,213 --> 00:37:25,906
Outside, right?

741
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:26,441
Yeah.

742
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:33,734
Tell me honestly.

743
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,271
Don’t be scared of hurting anyone.

744
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:38,497
What do you want to ask?

745
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,503
Do you hate her?

746
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,136
Mom?

747
00:37:45,198 --> 00:37:46,451
I was probably just angry with her,

748
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:50,459
but I think everyone was hurt by what happened—

749
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:52,604
Dad, Newton, and Mom.

750
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:54,460
I get Dad and Newton,

751
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,560
but why would she be hurt?

752
00:37:58,072 --> 00:37:59,508
You said it yourself

753
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:02,303
that her new family is great.

754
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,900
Isn’t she happy about leaving us behind?

755
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:09,777
Hey.

756
00:38:10,607 --> 00:38:13,248
No woman wants to get married twice.

757
00:38:15,365 --> 00:38:17,100
If Mom really wanted to abandon us,

758
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:18,805
why would she have taken me with her?

759
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:21,274
She could’ve started over.

760
00:38:21,604 --> 00:38:22,964
You’re too optimistic.

761
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,706
You’re too pessimistic.

762
00:38:27,312 --> 00:38:30,404
I don’t know why she took me with her

763
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:33,231
even though you were the one who wanted to go.

764
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:35,367
Because she loves you more than me.

765
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,078
That’s definitely not the reason.

766
00:38:45,327 --> 00:38:47,699
I was just afraid that if I chose Yotha,

767
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:52,004
we wouldn’t all be together again.

768
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:54,786
What do you mean?

769
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:04,038
I guess I was afraid

770
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:07,108
and selfish at the time.

771
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:08,832
I thought...

772
00:39:11,402 --> 00:39:14,205
if I brought Faifa who loves being
with his Dad and brothers,

773
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:18,103
at least he would ask me

774
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,745
to bring him back to visit everyone often

775
00:39:23,337 --> 00:39:25,908
and we’d all see each other sometimes.

776
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,394
On the other hand,

777
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:32,376
if I’d brought you, Yotha,

778
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,208
we might have been so happy

779
00:39:39,715 --> 00:39:44,405
that we wouldn’t have wanted to come back
and see anyone here again

780
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:52,514
I made all the wrong decisions.

781
00:39:59,002 --> 00:39:59,653
Forget it.

782
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,106
Let’s not talk about it.

783
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,050
It’s all in the past.

784
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:11,274
Yotha.

785
00:40:13,195 --> 00:40:15,063
You don’t have to forgive me now.

786
00:40:18,622 --> 00:40:21,632
You’ve just given me a chance
to explain and that’s good enough.

787
00:40:31,902 --> 00:40:34,367
What’s another important thing
you want to tell us?

788
00:40:35,294 --> 00:40:36,057
I…

789
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:40,702
I’m moving to England

790
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,405
and I don’t know when I’ll be back.

791
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:47,297
You’re moving there?

792
00:40:48,788 --> 00:40:49,397
Yes.

793
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,703
My partner has sold our house and everything.

794
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,176
Actually, I just came to say goodbye to your dad.

795
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:02,297
Luckily, we all got to see each other.

796
00:41:06,814 --> 00:41:09,365
If we go to England, we’ll visit you.

797
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,460
That’d be nice.

798
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:22,017
You’re the big brother, Newton.

799
00:41:22,602 --> 00:41:26,151
Please take care of your brothers and dad.

800
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:28,451
I will.

801
00:41:29,348 --> 00:41:30,642
Take care of yourself too, Mom.

802
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:41,543
Faifa.

803
00:41:42,407 --> 00:41:42,851
Yes?

804
00:41:53,238 --> 00:41:56,402
You know I love you, right?

805
00:41:58,754 --> 00:41:59,223
Yes.

806
00:42:04,474 --> 00:42:05,597
Come visit me sometimes.

807
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:10,300
Your siblings and stepdad
talk about you all the time.

808
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:16,105
I’ll send you off at the airport

809
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:17,802
so I can see everyone.

810
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:20,380
Great.

811
00:42:30,622 --> 00:42:31,269
It’s okay.

812
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:50,702
You’ve grown so much.

813
00:42:53,096 --> 00:42:55,343
How long has it been since we last hugged?

814
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:01,291
I’m sorry.

815
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:04,096
It’s okay.

816
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,782
I’m sorry for being angry with you all this time.

817
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:08,798
It’s okay.

818
00:43:11,201 --> 00:43:12,099
It’s my fault.

819
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:22,005
If you come back to Thailand,

820
00:43:24,194 --> 00:43:25,785
you can always stay here.

821
00:43:33,371 --> 00:43:35,134
Thank you so much, sons.

822
00:43:44,482 --> 00:43:45,004
Wait.

823
00:43:47,247 --> 00:43:49,102
Where’s my other son?

824
00:43:54,146 --> 00:43:54,989
Where is he?

825
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:55,845
Gun.

826
00:44:07,828 --> 00:44:09,047
Let me give you a hug.

827
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,130
Thank you.

828
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:28,072
Now I know who’s the reason
Yotha became so much softer.

829
00:44:29,493 --> 00:44:30,069
No.

830
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:34,499
Yotha has always been like this.

831
00:44:51,131 --> 00:44:53,499
Why didn’t you go to see
your mom off at the airport with Faifa?

832
00:44:54,524 --> 00:44:56,703
I’m not close to her other family like Faifa is.

833
00:44:58,573 --> 00:44:59,601
I’ll only be uncomfortable if I go.

834
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:09,179
You were amazing just now, you know?

835
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:10,497
Amazing?

836
00:45:11,444 --> 00:45:11,930
Yeah.

837
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,478
Your mom must be really happy
to have her son back.

838
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:18,561
I’m happy to have her back too.

839
00:45:20,814 --> 00:45:22,940
Well done, Yotha.

840
00:45:25,253 --> 00:45:26,031
Thank you...

841
00:45:27,373 --> 00:45:29,402
for coming into my life
and making it so much brighter.

842
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,364
Without you,

843
00:45:32,509 --> 00:45:33,960
I don’t know if I could be where I am today.

844
00:45:37,597 --> 00:45:38,565
Of course.

845
00:45:39,463 --> 00:45:42,059
I’m the sunshine of this world.

846
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:47,697
I won’t share you with the world anymore.

847
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:50,379
Gunyukhol belongs only to Yotha.

848
00:45:52,355 --> 00:45:53,894
Okay.

849
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:30,034
Have you been waiting long?

850
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:31,965
No.

851
00:46:33,594 --> 00:46:35,207
I ran into a senior.

852
00:46:35,343 --> 00:46:37,503
They wanted us to fill out this questionnaire.

853
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:38,943
What’s this?

854
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,477
RATE YOUR SATISFACTION
WITH ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES

855
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:42,542
A senior asked me to give this to you.

856
00:46:43,628 --> 00:46:45,373
Who do I hand this to once I finish filling it out?

857
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:46,125
Me.

858
00:46:52,211 --> 00:46:54,376
You’re pulling this trick again.

859
00:46:56,183 --> 00:46:56,902
I don’t believe you.

860
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:04,204
Everyone’s here, right?

861
00:47:04,423 --> 00:47:05,514
Yes.

862
00:47:05,835 --> 00:47:08,423
First of all, I want to thank all of you freshmen

863
00:47:08,445 --> 00:47:11,437
for volunteering to help
with the activities this year.

864
00:47:11,588 --> 00:47:14,201
I gave you a questionnaire earlier.

865
00:47:15,122 --> 00:47:17,201
Now, let’s read the feedback

866
00:47:17,282 --> 00:47:19,197
to see what we should improve for next year.

867
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:21,517
Oh, shit.

868
00:47:22,496 --> 00:47:23,000
What?

869
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:29,600
That questionnaire is real?

870
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:30,828
Mm.

871
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:34,998
You didn’t hand in mine, did you?

872
00:47:36,632 --> 00:47:37,702
I did this morning.

873
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,619
You did?

874
00:47:39,411 --> 00:47:41,102
First suggestion.

875
00:47:41,634 --> 00:47:42,946
Shit.

876
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:44,598
“The peer mentoring group draw

877
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:48,342
was probably the first time
I saw your face clearly.”

878
00:47:51,693 --> 00:47:53,543
Oh.

879
00:47:54,336 --> 00:47:55,702
Whoa.

880
00:48:05,571 --> 00:48:07,014
That’s Yotha.

881
00:48:08,638 --> 00:48:09,840
Does he seem as mysterious as you thought?

882
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,242
The peer mentoring group draw

883
00:48:12,949 --> 00:48:14,922
was probably the first time
I saw your face clearly.

884
00:48:16,054 --> 00:48:17,557
Oh, shit!

885
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,026
Thank you for turning off
the water in the restroom for me.

886
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,930
If it weren’t for you, I’d have been in big trouble.

887
00:48:30,546 --> 00:48:32,328
I’ll call that destiny.

888
00:48:34,614 --> 00:48:36,545
Second, the freshmen-welcoming activity.

889
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,786
We’d grown a bit closer then.

890
00:48:39,608 --> 00:48:41,505
You had it so easy.

891
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:42,955
My friends sent me to make you scream.

892
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:45,607
You just went on stage to speak,
and our friends screamed their lungs out.

893
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:48,699
Meanwhile, I stuck my tongue out playing a dog,

894
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,500
but no one cared.

895
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:57,800
I can’t believe that poser is now my boyfriend.

896
00:48:59,977 --> 00:49:02,071
Third, the Buddy Draw.

897
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,788
I already confirmed with Arm

898
00:49:05,154 --> 00:49:07,432
that you made the number 248 up.

899
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:07,894
Hey.

900
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:08,902
We got the same number.

901
00:49:09,019 --> 00:49:11,795
You were almost subtle, but I’m onto you now.

902
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,908
Fourth, the Engineers Unite event.

903
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,106
Thank you for the tie embroidered with my birthday

904
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,970
and thank you for walking over to give me the blanket.

905
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,517
But can you not do that in front of
so many people next time?

906
00:49:29,004 --> 00:49:30,278
I was so shy.

907
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,930
Last suggestion.

908
00:49:38,028 --> 00:49:41,408
“Please be less possessive of me.”

909
00:49:41,571 --> 00:49:44,616
“You know I never look at anyone else.”

910
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,715
Aww, Ears.

911
00:50:09,069 --> 00:50:10,940
You make me want to become a shipper.

912
00:50:11,654 --> 00:50:14,080
I’m dying of shyness.

913
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,136
Why didn’t you tell me?

914
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:24,339
Now say those things.

915
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:38,598
Will you stop smiling?

916
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:40,112
Am I smiling?

917
00:50:40,442 --> 00:50:40,960
Yes!

918
00:50:41,115 --> 00:50:42,134
I didn’t realize.

919
00:50:43,389 --> 00:50:44,247
I’m going to take a shower.

920
00:50:45,102 --> 00:50:45,924
Feel free to…

921
00:50:46,841 --> 00:50:48,105
love each other.

922
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:50,394
Just go.

923
00:50:51,287 --> 00:50:52,017
You’re the worst.

924
00:50:57,783 --> 00:50:59,802
I didn’t know you had that side.

925
00:51:00,256 --> 00:51:01,308
Who could’ve known?

926
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,148
I thought it was a fake questionnaire
like the one you made last time.

927
00:51:06,214 --> 00:51:07,303
This is cute.

928
00:51:07,637 --> 00:51:10,122
Now the world knows how much you love me, Beagle.

929
00:51:10,182 --> 00:51:11,288
Stop teasing me.

930
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:12,571
- Beagle loves me.
- No.

931
00:51:12,604 --> 00:51:13,290
- Beagle.
- Stop teasing me.

932
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:13,869
Hey!

933
00:51:14,456 --> 00:51:15,004
Oh.

934
00:51:17,848 --> 00:51:18,548
Hi.

935
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:19,894
Yotha.

936
00:51:20,465 --> 00:51:21,456
Are you free this Saturday?

937
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:23,097
I don't think I have
anything planned for Saturday yet.

938
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,768
Arc is going to take photos
in his graduation gown at the uni,

939
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,165
so I’m calling to invite everyone in our group.

940
00:51:29,576 --> 00:51:32,001
Can I bring Gun?

941
00:51:32,576 --> 00:51:33,302
Of course.

942
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,240
That’d be fun.

943
00:51:34,752 --> 00:51:35,905
Let me join you too, Arm.

944
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:37,905
It’s lonely to be in my room alone.

945
00:51:38,077 --> 00:51:39,328
All of you can come.

946
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:41,201
Okay.

947
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:42,300
Bye-bye.

948
00:51:44,426 --> 00:51:45,000
Bye.

949
00:51:50,555 --> 00:51:52,091
I’ve seen you since you were a baby.

950
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,259
I’m going to cry

951
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,868
Stop exaggerating.

952
00:51:56,037 --> 00:51:57,299
You talk like you raised me.

953
00:51:58,734 --> 00:51:59,432
I got carried away.

954
00:51:59,794 --> 00:52:00,570
Let me see.

955
00:52:02,638 --> 00:52:03,885
- What do you think?
- Wow.

956
00:52:04,616 --> 00:52:06,180
You look handsome in this gown.

957
00:52:07,668 --> 00:52:08,111
Hey.

958
00:52:08,731 --> 00:52:10,401
I look handsome in any outfit.

959
00:52:11,398 --> 00:52:12,134
Of course.

960
00:52:12,149 --> 00:52:13,115
I won’t argue with you.

961
00:52:15,401 --> 00:52:17,417
I’m happy you’ve graduated.

962
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:19,068
You’re an adult now, you know?

963
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:23,697
Thank you for making me a better person.

964
00:52:28,296 --> 00:52:29,131
Don’t get emotional.

965
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,740
You’ll cry and your eyes will get puffy.
You won’t look handsome in the photos.

966
00:52:35,977 --> 00:52:36,702
You look handsome.

967
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:37,903
Let me see.

968
00:52:42,582 --> 00:52:43,349
Arc. Arm.

969
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:44,574
We’re here.

970
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,088
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

971
00:52:47,115 --> 00:52:47,795
Congrats, Arc.

972
00:52:47,804 --> 00:52:48,425
Congrats, bro.

973
00:52:48,605 --> 00:52:49,411
Thank you, guys.

974
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,577
Arm said you probably won’t get to join
the actual graduation ceremony,

975
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,434
so we got you this bouquet today.

976
00:52:58,549 --> 00:52:59,453
Round of applause.

977
00:53:00,785 --> 00:53:01,795
Thank you so much.

978
00:53:02,564 --> 00:53:04,708
Now that we’re all here, let’s take photos together.

979
00:53:05,281 --> 00:53:05,820
Come on.

980
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:06,321
Let’s take photos.

981
00:53:06,337 --> 00:53:07,640
I’ll take your couple photos first.

982
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,305
You asked me to earlier. Let me.

983
00:53:09,551 --> 00:53:10,480
Okay.

984
00:53:10,502 --> 00:53:11,047
You sure?

985
00:53:11,071 --> 00:53:11,965
You’re smiling.

986
00:53:11,985 --> 00:53:12,928
You’ve wanted photos together for a long time.

987
00:53:12,942 --> 00:53:13,794
- Come on.
- Okay.

988
00:53:13,808 --> 00:53:14,823
Alright.

989
00:53:15,718 --> 00:53:16,644
Come on.

990
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:19,725
Okay, come on.

991
00:53:20,912 --> 00:53:22,099
Hey, Gun.

992
00:53:22,702 --> 00:53:25,807
Do you know that you’ve broken our tradition?

993
00:53:26,878 --> 00:53:27,702
What tradition?

994
00:53:28,825 --> 00:53:31,660
Perfect 10 Liners has always
dated within the group.

995
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:35,631
You’re the only one who’s broken into our system.

996
00:53:36,788 --> 00:53:37,854
I’m not afraid of the system.

997
00:53:39,988 --> 00:53:40,466
Hey!

998
00:53:41,816 --> 00:53:43,699
I can’t let you do that and not join in.

999
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:49,896
My face is all wet now.

1000
00:53:50,285 --> 00:53:52,099
You two are my role models.

1001
00:53:52,874 --> 00:53:53,936
I want to be as lovey-dovey as you.

1002
00:53:55,422 --> 00:53:57,297
We’ve been through a lot to get here.

1003
00:53:58,882 --> 00:53:59,534
Okay.

1004
00:53:59,657 --> 00:54:00,497
Perfect 10 Liners.

1005
00:54:00,527 --> 00:54:01,339
Please come here.

1006
00:54:01,417 --> 00:54:01,908
Let’s go.

1007
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,801
Come on.

1008
00:54:02,897 --> 00:54:03,539
Okay.

1009
00:54:03,819 --> 00:54:04,314
Come on.

1010
00:54:04,685 --> 00:54:05,438
Okay.

1011
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,604
- One, two.
- Wait.

1012
00:54:07,851 --> 00:54:08,571
Hold on.

1013
00:54:09,048 --> 00:54:10,505
Gun, come take photos with us.

1014
00:54:11,911 --> 00:54:12,505
Me?

1015
00:54:12,894 --> 00:54:14,880
But I’m not in your group.

1016
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:15,389
Just come.

1017
00:54:15,408 --> 00:54:17,835
Dating a member of our group makes you one of us.

1018
00:54:18,082 --> 00:54:18,663
Yeah.

1019
00:54:19,017 --> 00:54:19,696
Stand close.

1020
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:20,238
Okay.

1021
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:23,682
Jet, what about me?

1022
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,663
Take our photos.

1023
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:26,204
I’ll press the shutter now.

1024
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,632
Okay. Come on.

1025
00:54:27,885 --> 00:54:29,142
One, two, three.

1026
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,020
Good.

1027
00:54:31,045 --> 00:54:32,565
Okay. Very nice.

1028
00:54:32,622 --> 00:54:33,604
Let’s change the pose.

1029
00:54:34,096 --> 00:54:35,293
How about kissing each other on the cheek?

1030
00:54:35,317 --> 00:54:36,069
Kissing each other on the cheek?

1031
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:37,023
Yes.

1032
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:38,717
Alright, let’s do it.

1033
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,007
Cheek kiss? Okay.

1034
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:42,585
Come on!

1035
00:54:42,607 --> 00:54:44,114
Kiss each other’s cheek.

1036
00:54:44,145 --> 00:54:45,068
Go ahead.

1037
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:46,456
One, two, three.

1038
00:54:47,561 --> 00:54:49,204
So cute!

1039
00:54:49,263 --> 00:54:50,881
I’m the only single one here.

1040
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:52,170
Very good.

1041
00:54:52,186 --> 00:54:53,182
- How about we carry each other?
- Yes.

1042
00:54:53,202 --> 00:54:54,231
Let’s do it.

1043
00:54:54,277 --> 00:54:56,060
Okay. Faifa is not in the frame yet.

1044
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,131
Go ahead.

1045
00:54:57,155 --> 00:54:58,678
Okay, cute.

1046
00:54:59,752 --> 00:55:00,407
Yes.

1047
00:55:00,971 --> 00:55:01,758
Beautiful.

1048
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,500
Beautiful.

1049
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:07,780
♪ You’ve made today perfect ♪

1050
00:55:11,665 --> 00:55:13,137
Wine, your code is

1051
00:55:13,362 --> 00:55:16,982
0682.

1052
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:18,030
Go.

1053
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:18,804
She’s calling for you.

1054
00:55:19,397 --> 00:55:21,005
Welcome to Perfect 10 Liners.

1055
00:55:21,182 --> 00:55:22,182
Perfect 10 Liners?

1056
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,854
Your peer mentee is like my own.

1057
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:26,480
I’ll take good care of him for you.

1058
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,601
I hope someday

1059
00:55:28,917 --> 00:55:30,854
someone takes care of his feelings

1060
00:55:30,992 --> 00:55:31,838
so he doesn’t have to do that on his own.

1061
00:55:31,983 --> 00:55:33,583
You don’t have to walk with me, Faifa.

1062
00:55:33,988 --> 00:55:35,105
The on-campus dorm is so close.

1063
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:36,588
I just want to take care of you.
