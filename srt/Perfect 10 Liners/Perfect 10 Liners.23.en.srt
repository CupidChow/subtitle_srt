1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
Don’t tell me
you’re in love.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,860
Surprise!

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,880
Tor.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,220
Faifa!

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,840
I’m sorry.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,530
I wanted to be near you, Faifa.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,010
I get it now.

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,110
We love each other so much, don’t we?

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,270
Let’s be a couple.

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,850
Let’s be a couple.

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,270
Woo!

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,270
Whoa!

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:28,920
Wow!

14
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,600
Woo!

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,210
Was it a dream?

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,210
It wasn’t a dream.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,850
I really have a boyfriend now.

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,890
Why is my boyfriend so cute?

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,040
Is it morning already?

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,320
My boyfriend is awake.

21
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,830
Morning kiss.

22
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,860
Morning kiss.

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,080
Morning kiss.

24
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,770
Thank you.

25
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,080
Hey.

26
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,000
Feel free to get out.

27
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,230
Hi.

28
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,430
Hi, Wine.

29
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,160
How was your first night having a boyfriend?

30
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,490
Do you want to break up with him yet?

31
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,540
I’m going to kick you, puppy!

32
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:53,900
Hey!

33
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,020
What are you doing?

34
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,240
He’s copying us.

35
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,890
You think I can’t do that?

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,920
Faifa!

37
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,420
Can you do this though?

38
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,090
Let’s go.

39
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,550
Let’s go.

40
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,760
Wine,

41
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,780
I want that too!

42
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,010
I want that!

43
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,960
Can you do it with me?

44
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,180
Now!

45
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,940
Don’t let them outdo us!

46
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,680
I want that too!

47
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,550
I want that!

48
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,280
Alright.

49
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,290
Can we go to class now?

50
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,640
Cutie!

51
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,240
Oh, I’m so shy!

52
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,370
Hi, Faifa.

53
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,860
Hi, guys.

54
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,680
Please take care of Wine.

55
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,860
I’ll pick him up in two hours.

56
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,200
Faifa!

57
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,200
I’m a grown-up, not a kindergarten kid.

58
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,860
If I could watch you in front of your class, I would.

59
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,770
Behave yourself.

60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,630
Come on.

61
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,230
Ever since we became boyfriends,

62
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,660
I haven’t left your side for more than 20 minutes.

63
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,550
Boyfriends?

64
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,110
Keep it down!

65
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,900
Shh!

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,600
Yes.

67
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,940
This is my boyfriend.

68
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,280
Hey, this is my boyfriend.

69
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,580
This is my boyfriend.

70
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,900
Stop it, Faifa!

71
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,040
You’re embarrassing me.

72
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,040
Fine, I’ll stop teasing you.

73
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,040
I’m going now.

74
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,910
Mm.

75
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,990
I miss you.

76
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,080
Kisses.

77
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:34,840
Kisses.

78
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,840
Kisses to my boyfriend.

79
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,260
Muah.

80
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,260
I love you.

81
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,200
I love you.

82
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,240
He’s my boyfriend.

83
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,350
Look at him.

84
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,780
What do you think? Isn’t he cute?

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,500
He’s so cute.

86
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,860
It’s crazy!

87
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,700
Well…

88
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,760
You sneaky thing!

89
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,570
Tell us everything.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,260
Hello!

91
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,860
Faifa’s here!

92
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,520
How’s everyone?

93
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,500
Are you doing well?

94
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you paying attention in class?

95
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,770
Oh!

96
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,030
My bro!

97
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,930
What’s up, man?

98
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,530
Hey.

99
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,390
It’s a good day and good weather, bro.

100
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,200
Are you in the same country as me?

101
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,670
What’s gotten into you, buddy?

102
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,000
You said the weather is good?

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,000
Doi Suthep is so hot,
like it’s about to erupt lava like a volcano!

104
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,300
Good weather, my ass.

105
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,060
The AC is working so hard.

106
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,280

Nothing.

I’m just in a good mood.

115
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,540
Why were you dancing with me?

116
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,730
I'm in a good mood too.

117
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,540
Oh, yeah?

118
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,610

125

When?

126
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,360
What time?

127
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,360
We became a couple yesterday.

128
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,440
Faifa asked and I said yes.

129
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,460
I love him.

130
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,690
You guys know it.

131
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,070
Ugh.

132
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,370
Look at your friend.

133
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,230
He’s your friend.

134
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:18,500
He’s your friend too.

135
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,060
TOR

136
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,510
Who’s calling you?

137
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,730
This is the last rehearsal.

138
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,060
Please take it seriously.

139
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,140
Hey.

140
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,580
Hmm?

141
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,960
Should we warn our friend?

142
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,720
What?

143
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,880
Look at him.

144
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,540
This is the star contest, not a military training camp.

145
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,600
Why is he acting so mean?

146
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,110
Let him be.

147
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,850
You know how he is.

148
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,690
He’s a bit nuts.

149
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,090
Hey, Arm.

150
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,680
Why is Po suddenly head of the star contest?

151
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,200
I’ll tell you why.

152
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,830
Okay.

153
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,120
Once you know, keep it on the down low.

154
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,920
On it.

155
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,090
Whoa!

156
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,560
His nails!

157
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,290
I’m sorry.

158
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,460
- I’m sorry.
- 	It’s fine.

159
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,340
Here’s the thing.

160
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,360
Okay?

161
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,410
Tell him, Arm.

162
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,600
Well,

163
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,430
Po broke up with his partner.

164
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,300
Huh?

165
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,440
Yeah.

166
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,660
So he’s heartbroken?

167
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:27,706
Yeah, he’s heartbroken.

168
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,553
That’s why he’s going crazy right now.

169
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,166
He’s doing this to distract himself.

170
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:34,573
He can’t sleep or eat.

171
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,780
How did he get his heart broken?

172
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,753
His ex said he’s too nice.

173
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:45,406
Yeah.

174
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,486
Are all the juniors here?

175
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:07,846
Do you know a barber?

176
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:08,346
Yes.

177
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:09,880
My go-to place is just outside.

178
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,280
I’m working.

179
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:16,053
Why are you guys talking so loud?

180
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:16,573
Huh?

181
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,300
Let me pick this up for you.

182
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,186
No need.

183
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,333
What’s wrong?

184
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,073
Nothing.

185
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,560
Fai.

186
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:33,860
Fine.

187
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,706
Wine is meeting Tor today.

188
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,913
Tor asked to see Wine

189
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,386
and Wine wanted to talk it out with him too.

190
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,240
Tor?

191
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:43,360
Is that Wine’s first love?

192
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,320
Hey.

193
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:47,173
Don’t talk about the past.

194
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:49,646
Right now, I’m Wine’s only love.

195
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,713
Get that into your head, okay?

196
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,710
Then why are you nervous like this?

197
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,820
Did Wine do something to make you not trust him?

198
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,006
I JUST ARRIVED AT THE RESTAURANT.

199
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:00,753
I’M TALKING TO TOR NOW.

200
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:01,613
WE JUST ORDERED DESSERT.

201
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:02,593
I’M ON MY WAY BACK.

202
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,273
My boyfriend does this much.

203
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,066
If I still don't trust him, I might as well die.

204
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,100
Wine is so cute, huh?

205
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,040
Right?

206
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,040
Isn’t he cute, Yotha?

207
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,720
You’re down bad.

208
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:15,660
You too.

209
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,006
So what’s wrong?

210
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,813
He’s so cute, so I’m possessive.

211
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,813
Even though I’m sure he loves me very much,

212
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,980
I don’t want him to be alone with Tor.

213
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:27,940
I’m possessive, jealous,

214
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,326
upset, down,

215
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:30,446
and sad like a puppy.

216
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,540
Got it, Yotha?

217
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:33,700
You’re down bad.

218
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,000
Faifa.

219
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,366
I’ve missed you so bad.

220
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:41,280
Where have you been?

221
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,820
Did you miss me at all?

222
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:44,226
I missed you too.

223
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,906
Mom invited you to dinner at home tonight.

224
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:51,853
I’ll…

225
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:53,046
Okay, Yotha.

226
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,946
See you in the evening.

227
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:55,870
See you.

228
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,913
I don’t want to go.

229
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,233
You told me yourself

230
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:04,393
that every problem can be solved.

231
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,780
I told you every problem can be solved.

232
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,573
If you can’t solve it yourself,

233
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,646
I’m here to help you.

234
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,853
♪ When we’re side by side, when you’re by my side ♪

235
00:11:21,406 --> 00:11:23,400
But if you can’t solve it yourself,

236
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,633
I’m here to help you too.

237
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,106
Okay?

238
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,600
My heart can’t take it.

239
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,406
My boyfriend is too cute.

240
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,480
You’re too much.

241
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,913
How was talking to Tor?

242
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,953
I’m sorry about yesterday.

243
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,933
I disappeared without answering your question.

244
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,406
Do you still have feelings for me?

245
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,866
The show is about to start.

246
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,200
Let’s go.

247
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,260
It’s okay.

248
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:17,746
Shall we order food?

249
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,720
I used to have feelings for you.

250
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,966
I really did.

251
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,053
Used to?

252
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:38,640
But I’m not into you like that anymore.

253
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,460
Do you already have someone in your heart?

254
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,300
Is that…

255
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,480
The singer on stage?

256
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,333
Yes.

257
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,400
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner.

258
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,900
It’s alright.

259
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,506
Being yourself is the best, Wine.

260
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
Thank you for understanding me.

261
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,153
Being brothers is good.

262
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,200
This way, we won’t break up.

263
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,160
We won’t break up as boyfriends either.

264
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:15,806
Tor should mind his own business.

265
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,553
What’s wrong?

266
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,613
Are you jealous?

267
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
So bad.

268
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,246
Tor and I are over.

269
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,326
Faifa is the only one Wine loves now.

270
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,393
Don’t you have the rehearsal?

271
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,333
Let’s go.

272
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,193
I lost my heart again.

273
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,406
Completely.

274
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,546
Let me hug you!

275
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:45,913
You’re so cute!

276
00:13:45,946 --> 00:13:47,520
Okay, pose.

277
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,706
Great.

278
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:49,380
Now, go.

279
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:50,186
Perfect.

280
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:51,146
Gun,

281
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,526
do you know about Yotha and Faifa’s mom?

282
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,320
Of course.

283
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,580
It was a big issue in the past.

284
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,513
Yotha wouldn’t talk to his mom for years.

285
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,566
At first, I thought there was no way they could make up.

286
00:14:14,906 --> 00:14:16,900
Luckily, Yotha agreed to give in.

287
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:18,900
Because of your help,

288
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Yotha agreed to give in.

289
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,893
Did Faifa tell you that?

290
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,530
Yotha and Faifa are like that.

291
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:32,710
People think their lives are perfect.

292
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,093
They have money and everything else.

293
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,673
Who would’ve known what they’ve been through

294
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:42,230
before they could smile like they do today.

295
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,713
Does anyone know Faifa is still not okay?

296
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,673
What did you say?

297
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,360
Mom!

298
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,966
I’ve missed you.

299
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:14,460
I’ve missed you too, Gun.

300
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,693
You’re doing well, right?

301
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:16,353
Yeah.

302
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,700
We’re all together.

303
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,106
Let’s eat.

304
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:21,153
- Come on.
- 	Let’s eat.

305
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,953
You must be starving.

306
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:22,520
Yes.

307
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,906
Yes?

308
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,360
Thank you for making this visit home not lonely for me.

309
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,066
Come on.

310
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,226
You know what, Wine?

311
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,926
Faifa was once drunk and kept talking about you.

312
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:46,500
He was wasted.

313
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:47,900
I’m going to slap you.

314
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,900
Why didn’t you film it, New?

315
00:15:49,926 --> 00:15:50,686
I wish I could’ve seen it.

316
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:51,913
Not you too.

317
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:54,640
I’ll ask my staff to recover the CCTV footage.

318
00:15:54,886 --> 00:15:55,720
It’s so funny.

319
00:15:55,753 --> 00:15:58,000
Don’t make me share your naked clip.

320
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,046
There’s none.

321
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,870
I could expose you too.

322
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,713
Hey, Wine.

323
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,986
How did you and Faifa get together?

324
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,180
Well…

325
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,373
Right, I forgot.

326
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,640
I thought Faifa didn’t know how to love.

327
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,573
That’s not true.

328
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,766
Faifa knows what love is

329
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,493
and he does it very well.

330
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,693
Mm.

331
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,093
Thank you, Wine,
for helping my son open up.

332
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,446
I’m his mom but I couldn’t even do it.

333
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,653
Why are you being emotional?

334
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:34,566
I don’t get it.

335
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,066
Hey, don’t think I didn’t know.

336
00:16:38,086 --> 00:16:40,720
You were unhappy the whole time you were with me

337
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,053
because you felt guilty you were chosen, right?

338
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,473
Mom!

339
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,900
Fai,

340
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,360
you think you’re good at hiding your feelings, don’t you?

341
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,533
You’ve always thought other people believe you’re okay.

342
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,953
I’m sorry

343
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,830
for only being brave enough to talk about this now.

344
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,360
I let you live with this trauma for so long.

345
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,906
Well…

346
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,690
I just want you to love me.

347
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:45,370
No need to love me as much as the others.

348
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,913
Just half as much as you love Yotha would be enough.

349
00:17:55,773 --> 00:18:01,160
I admit that I worry about you the least

350
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:08,960
because your kindness will always make people love you.

351
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,760
But I don’t love you any less than anyone else.

352
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,393
I love you, Mom.

353
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:26,266
I’m sorry, son.

354
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,133
It’s okay.

355
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,926
You and I are really bad parents.

356
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,173
Thank you both

357
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,860
for loving our sons

358
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,233
So you’re Mom’s no. 1 favorite son now?

359
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:26,386
What?

360
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,273
I didn’t do anything.

361
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,973
Hmm?

362
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,580
Confess.

363
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,373
Hey.

364
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:33,486
Don’t!

365
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,553
Are you going to confess or not?

366
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,880
Don’t!

367
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:37,440
Are you going to confess or not?

368
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:38,006
Stop it.

369
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:38,600
Don’t.

370
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,526
Hey!

371
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,640
Are you going to confess or not?

372
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,400
Don’t!

373
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:42,286
Don’t!

374
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,560
Come on!

375
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,580
Don’t!

376
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,386
Don’t!

377
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:47,460
Come on!

378
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,053
Don’t!

379
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:48,753
Stop it!

380
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,313
I give up!

381
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,093
Are you going to answer or not?

382
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,713
Yes.

383
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,233
Actually, Mom had something unresolved
with Faifa for a long time.

384
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,226
What?

385
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:06,220
I didn’t do anything.

386
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,746
I just dug up some secrets

387
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,140
and gave Mom the confidence to talk with Faifa.

388
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,540
You’re mischievous.

389
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,406
What are you doing?

390
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,660
Anything my heart wants.

391
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,173
Thank you for doing so much for my family.

392
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,313
I’m the sunshine of this world.

393
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,900
Can I?

394
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:14,680
I told you before.

395
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:17,520
No one asks something like that.

396
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,600
Thank you.

397
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,000
If I could exchange your thanks for money,

398
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:13,133
I’d be rich by now.

399
00:22:13,153 --> 00:22:14,546
How much do you want?

400
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,886
I’m ready to make the transfer.

401
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,406
You’re rich.

402
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,900
I’m glad to be by your side at a time like this.

403
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,893
You can’t go anywhere now.

404
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,646
I love you, Faifa.

405
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,066
I love you the same.

406
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:38,040
Not the same.

407
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:39,180
Why not?

408
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:40,540
Because I love you more.

409
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,113
Where are you going, you cheeky thing?

410
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,540
Do you really love me more?

411
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,900
I don’t believe you.

412
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:01,030
I love you more every day.

413
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:37,946
Here are the tickets for the music festival.

414
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,700
Tawan’s booth is there.

415
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,866
Thank you, Arm.

416
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:43,860
The music there is a bit indie though.

417
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,720
I don’t know if you’ll get it.

418
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,106
I’ll be fine.

419
00:23:47,146 --> 00:23:49,200
I usually listen to different kinds of music.

420
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:51,546
I gave two other tickets to Yotha.

421
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:53,313
These are for you and Faifa.

422
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:02,466
Is something wrong?

423
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,773
No.

424
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:08,450
By the way, Arm,

425
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
I want to know about the group bracelets.

426
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,866
Yotha didn’t tell me.

427
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,200
What do they represent?

428
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:20,406
Actually, they’re not that important.

429
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:22,280
We just came up with an activity

430
00:24:22,313 --> 00:24:24,280
to help the new joiners bond with the group faster.

431
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
But if you ask me,

432
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,760
they’re really important.

433
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,253
I don’t just wear this with Arc,

434
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,420
Every time I look at it, I think of the first time I wore it.

435
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,300
I love it when they’re on our arms

436
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,933
because every time they come together,

437
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,613
it means Arc and I are together.

438
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,406
That’s great.

439
00:24:54,153 --> 00:24:56,150
What’s great?

440
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:58,906
The love between you and Arc.

441
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,906
AM:	Do you remember the first time you hung out with the group?

442
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,886
You asked me how Arc and I got together.

443
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,253
I didn’t tell you the whole story.

444
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,040
What is it?

445
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,353
Have you ever read novels or articles about love?

446
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,333
They say when you’re with someone you love,

447
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:25,473
you feel butterflies in your stomach.

448
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,326
You want to take care of them.

449
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:32,850
You want to be in their sight all the time.

450
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,046
I used to think it was an exaggeration,

451
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,173
but since I met Arc, I’ve experienced all of that.

452
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,900
What’s wrong?

453
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Are you going to the Music Camp Festival?

454
00:26:05,793 --> 00:26:07,186
Probably not anymore.

455
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,433
Why not?

456
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,006
I can ask Yotha to give her a ride.

457
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:19,700
I want to go to the music festival with you.

458
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,873
No, definitely not.

459
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:23,870
You have to see your mom off at the airport.

460
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,800
But I can actually ask Yotha…

461
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,133
No buts.

462
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,013
We can go together some other time.

463
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,066
Your mom won’t be back for a month.

464
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,046
Yotha said Tawan is hard to track down.

465
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:37,620
Not to mention the group bracelet thing.

466
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,540
I want to wear one already.

467
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,540
With or without the bracelet,

468
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,540
it doesn’t make me love you less.

469
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,873
Fine, I give in.

470
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:50,473
Do you want to come send my mom off with me?

471
00:26:51,766 --> 00:26:56,326
Oh, it’s the only week I’m free.

472
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,726
I already told my family I’d visit.

473
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,420
So I won’t get to see your parents.

474
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:04,546
We can go another time.

475
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,893
You promise?

476
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,166
You’re the cutest.

477
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,033
Come on. Let me feed you.

478
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,720
Nom!

479
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,946
Shall we go?

480
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:29,873
I’m done with work now.

481
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,853
Sure.

482
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,866
You weren’t smoking?

483
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,873
Just getting some fresh air.

484
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,870
I’m going to quit smoking.

485
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:42,946
Why?

486
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,980
I don’t want to die too soon.

487
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:49,106
I want to be with you for a long time.

488
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,433
Whose words are those?

489
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:53,800
I came up with them myself.

490
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:57,420
You’ve grown up a lot, kid.

491
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:03,086
It’s because…

492
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,486
I’m not a kid anymore.

493
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:07,880
Really?

494
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,280
Is Yotha’s room upstairs still available?

495
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,700
Why do you ask?

496
00:28:47,106 --> 00:28:47,906
Wa,

497
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:54,100
I told you I want to be with you until we’re old.

498
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,400
I meant it.

499
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:04,670
Why are you being emotional now?

500
00:29:06,586 --> 00:29:08,580
Do you want to start a family with me?

501
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,260
What are you talking about?

502
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,233
How do you picture our love?

503
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,813
From now on.

504
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,620
Tomorrow.

505
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,966
In one year, or ten.

506
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,800
How far do you see us going?

507
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,806
You can’t die before me.

508
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:53,540
Did you lie to Faifa?

509
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:55,640
Are you sure you can go alone?

510
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,660
Even when you walk to the 7-11 on the main road,

511
00:29:57,686 --> 00:29:58,826
the dogs bark at you.

512
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,273
Yeah. You can’t live alone, Wine.

513
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:03,446
Do you want me to come with you?

514
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,506
I’m going to get the group bracelets
for Faifa’s birthday.

515
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,886
I can go alone.

516
00:30:07,913 --> 00:30:09,286
Trust me.

517
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,906
Love makes you stronger.

518
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,546
I should get going.

519
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,600
So cringy.

520
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,873
Eat carefully.

521
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,306
It might be hot.

522
00:31:35,746 --> 00:31:36,693
Excuse me.

523
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,926
Excuse me.

524
00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:39,666
Yes?

525
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,040
Are these seats available?

526
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,500
Yes.

527
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,886
Hey, come on.

528
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:44,900
They’re free.

529
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:48,546
Can I join you?

530
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,600
Sure.

531
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,333
Are you here alone?

532
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,160
Yes.

(Are you home yet?)

548
00:33:05,086 --> 00:33:05,880
(How are you?)

549
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,673
I’m lonely.

550
00:33:09,246 --> 00:33:10,026
(What did you say?)

551
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,773
Oh, I’m home already.

552
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:13,920
(Really?)

553
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,240
(When did you arrive?)

554
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:18,746
A while ago.

555
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,400
(Have you eaten?)

556
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,706
Yes.

557
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,106
(Is it cold over there?)

558
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:27,880
No.

559
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
(Then why are you rubbing your arm with your hand?)

560
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,353
Sorry?

561
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,053
(Next time you travel to the mountains,
bring a jacket, okay?)

562
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,906
(A T-shirt does nothing but add weight to your bag.)

563
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,086
(Luckily, it’s that T-shirt.)

564
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:45,080
(The owner has come to hug and keep you warm.)

571
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,420
I’ve been worried sick.

572
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,893
What are you doing here?

573
00:34:36,253 --> 00:34:38,250
To catch a liar.

574
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,893
Jay and Ben told you, didn’t they?

575
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:44,206
Don’t do this again, okay?

576
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,533
I won’t.

577
00:34:46,953 --> 00:34:50,946
Life without you is no fun at all.

578
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:52,413
I wouldn’t be able to live.

579
00:34:52,446 --> 00:34:53,866
I really wouldn’t.

580
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,746

Fai said he found Wine.

590
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,760
Wine is so brave.

591
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,833
I didn’t expect him to go there alone.

592
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,293
What did Tawan say about the bracelets?

593
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,093
Yotha,

594
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,873
I’m glad you’re here.

595
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:37,773
What is it?

596
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,886
I need to talk to you.

597
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,253
Follow me.

598
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,053
Don’t get into a fight, Yotha.

599
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,640
Get ready to dress my wounds, Beagle.

600
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,853
But…

601
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:56,540
They won’t punch each other.

602
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:57,133
Come on.

603
00:35:57,153 --> 00:35:57,800
Really, New?

604
00:35:57,826 --> 00:35:58,540
Come on.

605
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,413
Cheers!

606
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:00,506
Cheers!

607
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:01,666
Cheers!

608
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,880
Come on!

609
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,526
What is it?

610
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,360
I need your help.

611
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:18,400
You do?

612
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,606
I’m going to propose to Wa.

613
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:25,940
And?

614
00:36:26,693 --> 00:36:27,486
Shit.

615
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,893
You know I only have thug friends.

616
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,006
Wa doesn’t like that.

617
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,420
Besides, I’m no longer close to them.

618
00:36:36,453 --> 00:36:37,200
So?

619
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,600
Fine.

620
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,120
I don’t have any friends now.

621
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,806
Are you asking me, Wa’s ex,

622
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,606
to help you, his new boyfriend,

623
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,213
propose to him?

624
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,086
Yeah.

625
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,480
I have no one left.

626
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:57,273
I only have you.

627
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:02,280
I won’t be able to do it alone.

628
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,340
Help, Arm!

629
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,353
Huh?

630
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,480
What?

631
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,873
They’re getting married?

632
00:37:12,893 --> 00:37:13,840
Who’s getting married?

633
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:14,720
Sure.

634
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,413
You can trust my team.

635
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,086
Okay.

636
00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:19,080
Talk later.

637
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,233
What’s going on?

638
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,213
Klao asked for help

639
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,620
to give a surprise proposal to Warich.

640
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:28,293
Okay.

641
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:30,286
Who’s in your team?

642
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,380
Well…

643
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,020
We are.

644
00:37:39,446 --> 00:37:40,240
What?

645
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,666
That sounds fun.

646
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:43,333
I’m in.

647
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:43,860
Right?

648
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,593
Let’s start by finding the location.

649
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:48,286
Ah!

650
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,140
Pond, we have guests for our campsite soft opening.

651
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,013
Are you sure you want to do that?

652
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:56,213
Yes.

653
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:00,753
Hmm?

654
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,006
Whose voice is that?

655
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,886
Sand, did you not close the door fully?

656
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:06,380
No.

657
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,333
You did not, Arc.

658
00:38:07,366 --> 00:38:07,900
It’s your room.

659
00:38:07,926 --> 00:38:08,706
Hey, Arc!

660
00:38:08,726 --> 00:38:09,593
Who are you hiding?

661
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,446
I’m not!

662
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:11,333
Pond!

663
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,806
Is someone there?

664
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,493
Go check, Sand.

665
00:38:14,513 --> 00:38:15,900
Listen, guys.

666
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:17,900
I think the voice is coming from the sofa.

667
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,453
Your room has…

668
00:38:22,606 --> 00:38:23,326
It’s…

669
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,253
No.

670
00:38:24,266 --> 00:38:25,166
It’s….

671
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:25,693
It’s….

672
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,540
It’s….

673
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,006
Po!

674
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:32,793
What’s wrong, buddy?

675
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:36,706
Po!

676
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:38,426
What’s wrong, Po?

677
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,960
My ex and I….

678
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,320
I was going to propose too!

679
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,333
Don’t cry, Po.

680
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,980
I’ll keep you company.

681
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,606
Po!

682
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:53,366
Po!

683
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,700
Po!

684
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,726
What’s wrong?

685
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,080
Po, I’ll keep you company!

686
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,533
Po!

687
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,493
You changed into just this T-shirt.

688
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:21,626
Aren’t you cold?

689
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,260
I want to wear matching T-shirts with you.

690
00:39:28,073 --> 00:39:30,070
You didn’t buy a plane ticket.

691
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:31,586
You didn’t book a hotel.

692
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,320
You didn’t rent a car.

693
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,280
I don’t know how to drive.

694
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:37,760
What else?

695
00:39:37,786 --> 00:39:39,760
Tell me your plan.

696
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,806
My plan was just to get here.

697
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,306
You’re lucky you have me as your boyfriend.

698
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,120
Say that again?

699
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:55,426
I said you’re lucky

700
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:57,153
you have me as your boyfriend

701
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,900
because I’ll take the best care of your life from now on.

702
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,060
Come on.

703
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,006
I’ll help.

704
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,973
I’ll just watch, I mean.

705
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,613
Hey, Arm.

706
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,340
Abou Warich and Klao getting married…

707
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,480
Yeah.

708
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,753
It sounds fun, right?

709
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,593
I’ll organize it.

710
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,826
What about you?

711
00:40:33,153 --> 00:40:34,400
Do you want to get married at all?

712
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,426
Whoa, Arc.

713
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,746
What are you asking?

714
00:40:41,113 --> 00:40:42,740
Can we wait until I graduate?

715
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,906
I haven’t thought about it yet.

716
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,980
Let me tell you first

717
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:49,373
that you’re in every part of my future plans.

718
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,886
Okay.

719
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,860
So, don’t leave me.

720
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,066
You love me so much.

721
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,453
Who’d dare leave you?

722
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,833
Say you love me.

723
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,613
You hear it every day.

724
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:07,260
Don’t you get tired of it?

725
00:41:07,286 --> 00:41:08,580
Please tell me.

726
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,253
I’ll listen to it for the rest of my life.

727
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,740
Come on.

728
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,760
I love you the most in the world, Arm.

729
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,440
Yeah.

730
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,793
♪ I want you to know ♪

731
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,126
♪ You’re so beautiful ♪

732
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,546
♪ I can get through hardship because of you ♪

733
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:27,053
♪ I want you to know ♪

734
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,940
♪ You stay so beautiful ♪

735
00:41:27,966 --> 00:41:30,686
Now will you tell me why you came here alone?

736
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,253
I wanted to give you this bracelet.

737
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,846
I was going to keep it for your birthday,

738
00:41:44,393 --> 00:41:46,200
but the vibe is good,

739
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,880
so I’m giving you now.

740
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,533
You said you wanted it, remember?

741
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,766
I was drunk

742
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,186
so I pretended to talk loudly,

743
00:42:13,213 --> 00:42:14,310
hoping you’d hear me.

744
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,306
That’s why I was brave enough to come here alone.

745
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,906
So I could give you this bracelet.

746
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,473
Can I put it on for you too?

747
00:42:25,286 --> 00:42:25,886
Mm.

748
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,120
Now will you tell me

749
00:42:39,146 --> 00:42:41,120
how you got these bracelets?

750
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,506
Didn’t Yotha tell you

751
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:50,500
that you need to bring your mentor?

752
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,946
I won't give these to you if you're here alone.

753
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,373
I’ll come back another day then.

754
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,813
Tawan is strict like a ….

755
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:04,886
Like what?

756
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,226
Like a dog.

757
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,113
Now I believe he’s really strict.

758
00:43:10,146 --> 00:43:13,573
He should reflect on himself for getting scolded by you.

759
00:43:13,606 --> 00:43:15,573
Before he gave me the bracelets,

760
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:18,400
he made me do so many things.

761
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:21,546
Aww, thank you.

762
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,886
This bracelet is the most important.

763
00:43:24,013 --> 00:43:25,360
I’ll take good care of it.

764
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,713
But you’re more important.

765
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,026
Cheesy.

766
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,926
Even though it’s cheesy, you can see my love.

767
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,873
That’s such a great-grandpa joke.

768
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,926
Stop saying it, Uncle.

769
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:39,393
Try looking closer.

770
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,446
You’ll really see it.

771
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,100
Try looking closer and you’ll see it.

772
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,266
Can we get even closer?

773
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,406
How can you see it with your eyes closed?

774
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,633
Do you see what I told you about now?

775
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,933
I only see you stealing my kisses.

776
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,240
You know too much.

777
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,626
Do you use this trick often?

778
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:06,393
Never.

779
00:45:06,426 --> 00:45:08,946
I’ve just practiced in case I have a partner one day.

780
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,153
You happen to be my first.

781
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,233
Loser.

782
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,230
You’re sharp-tongued these days.

783
00:45:16,493 --> 00:45:21,100
Don’t tell me I’m your first kiss.

784
00:45:22,206 --> 00:45:24,200
If we don’t count my mom and my dog,

785
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:25,113
then yes.

786
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,320
This is so embarrassing.

787
00:45:28,346 --> 00:45:30,713
You look like a real casanova

788
00:45:30,753 --> 00:45:32,710
but only got your first kiss at 20.

789
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,180
Even though it’s my first kiss,

790
00:45:35,206 --> 00:45:36,606
I did well, right?

791
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,673
You know what, Faifa?

792
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,220
When I’m near you,

793
00:45:44,606 --> 00:45:47,360
I feel this happiness I can’t explain.

794
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,806
This doesn’t only happen to me

795
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,840
but to everyone around you.

796
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,840
I intend for it to happen.

797
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,266
You try to make it happen?

798
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:04,020
Mm.

799
00:46:04,586 --> 00:46:10,686
Since I was a kid, I’ve expected to be loved.

800
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,553
I can’t accept being hated.

801
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:17,553
That’s why I try to do everything
to make the people around me happy

802
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,873
so they’ll love me.

803
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,360
Are you tired of doing that?

804
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:29,306
I’m not tired of making other people happy.

805
00:46:29,326 --> 00:46:31,853
I’m tired of dealing with their expectations.

806
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:36,313
If one day, you get enough love,

807
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,820
will you get some rest?

808
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,586
I mean,

809
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,500
if I love you enough.

810
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:50,390
It has been enough for a long time now.

811
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,306
You complete everything I’m missing.

812
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,066
Everything.

813
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,273
I used to think there’s nothing good about me.

814
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,253
I can only do things halfway.

815
00:47:09,286 --> 00:47:12,106
Plus, I’m into men.

816
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:18,340
But meeting you made me want to be better

817
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,220
and more talented,

818
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:23,430
so I can stand out in your eyes.

819
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,620
You don’t have to try anymore.

820
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,600
Just being who you are

821
00:47:30,153 --> 00:47:32,200
is special enough for me.

823
00:47:37,373 --> 00:47:41,513

824
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,200
Let’s get inside the tent.

825
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,740
Will the musicians be upset

826
00:47:54,766 --> 00:47:56,266
that we ran away like this?

827
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,013
No, they take turns performing.

828
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,486
Some have gone to bed already.

829
00:48:00,513 --> 00:48:01,120
Mm.

830
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,500
I can still hear the music from here.

831
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,666
Love music.

832
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,226
So romantic, isn’t it?

833
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,966
It feels like a dream

834
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,560
to have you in front of me like this.

835
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,386
I’ve always wanted it to be you.

836
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,606
If you’re cold…

837
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,360
You’ll stop?

838
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,406
I’ll hug you tighter.

839
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,906
Propose?

840
00:50:08,933 --> 00:50:09,413
Yeah.

841
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:10,886
Cheers!

842
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,826
I can’t believe Perfect 10 Liners

843
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:15,866
brought all of us together like this.

844
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,586
My life is special enough
just having you every day.

845
00:50:21,533 --> 00:50:24,206
I want you with me in every stage of my life.

846
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,406
From now on and forever.

847
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,220
