1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
Yotha.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:01,420
Mom.

3
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,290
We’re very happy here.

4
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,410
It’s best if you leave us alone.

5
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,980
Cry it out.

6
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,730
What the hell are you doing?

7
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,300
Let’s break up, Klao.

8
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,980
Can I ask you not to go there tonight?

9
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,520
I don’t want you to do anything bad again.

10
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:13,770
Yotha!

11
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,900
I want Yotha to be the Yotha I know all the time.

12
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,160
What are you doing?

13
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,250
I’m sorry.

14
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,890
Do you like the sea?

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,230
I don’t know.

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,870
How come you don’t know what you like?

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,690
I don’t know what liking feels like.

18
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,320
It’s not hard.

19
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,800
You’re probably happy to see it
and never get tired of looking at it.

20
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,040
Then I guess I like it.

21
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,330
I like the sea too.

22
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,300
I like it too.

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,860
You got splashed!

24
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,580

Of course, I know!

37
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,360
I wouldn’t have left the door unlocked
for them to be together every night otherwise.

38
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,010
Huh?

39
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,400
Does he think I’m dumb or what?

40
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,900
And look at your friend.

41
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,280
He says he’s mad but now he’s on a beach trip with him.

42
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,100
All I’ve done was for nothing!

43
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,190
Can I get an iced americano?

44
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,290
Are you studying?

45
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,200
You remember me?

46
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,520
Of course.

47
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,410
You’re the clumsy kid I knocked over.

48
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,080
Then you probably remember the wrong person.

49
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,880
I remember it wasn’t that serious.

50
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,970
I’m just kidding.

51
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:04,790
Oh.

52
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,590
My name is Faifa.

53
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,410
Oh, okay.

54
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,640
I’m trying to get you to tell me your name.

55
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,000
Don’t you realize that at all?

56
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,450
My name is Wine.

57
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,800
See you next year, then, Junior.

58
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,000
My ride is here.

59
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,000
I should go.

60
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,560
WINE

61
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,360
Have you redeemed the old card?

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,130
The old card?

63
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,900
The one I put my sticker on.

64
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,340
You remember?

65
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,300
Of course.

66
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,460
Why?

67
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,390
Are you happy that I remember?

68
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,080
No.

69
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,840
So, have you redeemed it yet?

70
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,670
Not yet.

71
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,930
You should hurry before it expires.

72
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,410
It’s valid for a year.

73
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,120
If I get into this uni,

74
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,450
I’ll redeem a reward for myself.

75
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,730
Hmm.

76
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,070
Interesting.

77
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,320
Don’t forget to invite me.

78
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,740
Should I invite you?

79
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,320
What? Of course.

80
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,710
Don’t forget that one of the stickers is mine.

81
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,170
Oh, you’re right.

82
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,150
Don’t forget to invite me then.

83
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,990
I want to be the first to congratulate you.

84
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,430
Okay.

85
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,710
Which one of you is in Perfect 10 Liners?

86
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,120
Me.

87
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,480
Then why are you here?

88
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,100
Oh.

89
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,420
Well…

90
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,500
Come on, Tawan.

91
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,300
Don’t tease him.

92
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,280
He’s all scared now.

93
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,330
Hey.

94
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,140
You’re not opening your shop today?

95
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,960
I moved my shop to Nan.

96
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,930
I'm just here to run errands and relax.

97
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,230
Nan?

98
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,880
That sounds like a great place to visit.

99
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,060
Thank you.

100
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,180
Do you have a partner to wear these with?

101
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,080
Not yet.

102
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,220
I thought it was the one you brought.

103
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,780
I think you’re misunderstanding.

104
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,980
I don’t think I’m mistaken.

105
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,490
You two are the only ones having a misunderstanding.

106
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,880
Here.

107
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,320
Thank you.

108
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,730
Yay!

109
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,490
You’re now verified, Yotha.

110
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,490
You’re officially a member of the Perfect 10 Liners.

111
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,540
Come on.

112
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,180
Cheers to that!

113
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,130
Cheers!

114
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,230
Cheers!

115
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,570
Don't drink too much
or you won't be able to talk it out.

116
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,750
Arc, let me kiss you.

117
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,360
It’s late.

118
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,700
Shall we call it a night?

119
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,280
Are you sleepy?

120
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,030
A little.

121
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,530
Don't forget to update me
on whether it was me or you guys who misunderstood.

122
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,600
I’m fine!

123
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,600
Why don’t we go back to drinking?

124
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,650
Hey, Yotha.

125
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,320
The sunrise at the beach is beautiful.

126
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,680
If you guys can, I want you to wait and see it.

127
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,000
I’ve seen it before, though,

128
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,160
so count me out.

129
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,700
Let’s split up here.

130
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,880
See you guys at checkout.

131
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,430
Okay.

132
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,890
It’s really beautiful.

133
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,890
Wait and see it if you can.

134
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,090
Beagle.

135
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,460
Do you want to wait and see the sunrise?

136
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,460
I’m sorry I put you in danger that day.

137
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,930
It’s fine.

138
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,660
I don’t know what to do
to bring us back to the way we were.

139
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,380
Do you want to ask me anything?

140
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,590
If what I want to ask
is something you don’t want to answer,

141
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,200
I’m afraid it’ll just hurt me more.

142
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,130
Today, I’ll answer everything.

143
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,700
I saw you

144
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,600
kissing Wa.

145
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,890
Warich is my ex.

146
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,250
We got close after he broke up with his first partner.

147
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,710
Wa is kind.

148
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,720
He understands everything about me.

149
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,580
After that, we decided to date.

150
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,460
I’m not sure if that was love.

151
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,380
I just feel like

152
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,240
he was the only one I felt good about back then.

153
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,280
But after only a year,

154
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,310
Wa thought that what we had wasn’t love,

155
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,440
but a brotherly bond.

156
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,000
At the time, I didn’t get it at all.

157
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,330
Since then, I’ve believed that love doesn’t exist.

158
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,040
So you go to the bar often

159
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,040
because you want to see him?

160
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,610
Even though we broke up,

161
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,960
just seeing Wa’s face

162
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,320
makes me feel safe.

163
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,880
Mm.

164
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,530
But since I met you,

165
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,720
I don’t need to go to the bar anymore.

166
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,850
Just staying in the room with you

167
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,570
makes me feel safe.

168
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,250
Really?

169
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,690
It’s over between me and Wa.

170
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,580
Right now, there’s only us.

171
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,240
Right now, what am I to you?

172
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,810
I don’t know.

173
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,180
You’re just so special to me

174
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,090
and I want to be with you always,

175
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,670
but…

176
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,260
But you’re not sure if it’s love.

177
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,730
Then I won’t rush you for an answer.

178
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,770
Think it over until you’re sure,

179
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,890
because if it’s not love,

180
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,890
I don’t want your world to come crashing down again.

181
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,710
You’ll wait for me, right?

182
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,180
Mm.

183
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,130
I’ll wait.

184
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,200
It could take a day,

185
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,120
a month,

186
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,450
or even a year.

187
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,910
I can wait.

Look at them, Arc.

195
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,440
Hey.

196
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,440
Keep cool, little matchmaker.

197
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,900
How can I not be happy?

198
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,870
My plan worked.

199
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,630
Hey.

200
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,720
Safe trip back.

201
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,220
I will.

202
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,880
Pay attention in class
and don’t forget to eat.

203
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,930
Yes, Dad.

204
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,490
If something happens,

205
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,400
I should be the first one you call. Got it?

206
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,600
Yes, Uncle.

207
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:31,820
Come on.

208
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,370
One kiss on my cheek.

209
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,490
Yes, Grandpa.

210
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,530
I’m your boyfriend.

211
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,130
I know.

212
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,400
Alright.

213
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,730
Drive safe, Yotha.

214
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,610
Thank you, Arc.

215
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,150
Bye, Arc.

216
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,740
Alright.

217
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,540
See you.

218
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,290
- See you.
- 	Bye.

219
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,000
Let’s go.

220
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,840
Thank you so much.

221
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,240
Thank you both for going on the trip with me.

222
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,220
Let’s do this again.

223
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,370
Sure.

224
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,440
This trip was so much fun.

225
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:27,880
Alright.

226
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,210
Go get some rest.

227
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:29,970
I’m heading out.

228
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,660
Okay.

229
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,090
Bye.

230
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,070
I’m going now. Bye.

231
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,800
See you.

232
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,500
Do you want me to help you
move your stuff back to our room now?

233
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,520
Can I not move back?

234
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,580
Why not?

235
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,190
I don’t want to trouble Kong and Faifa.

236
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,730
They’ve switched rooms for me a few times already.

237
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,160
So staying with Faifa is better?

238
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,040
No.

239
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,130
I just really don’t want to trouble him.

240
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,830
Okay.

241
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,900
As you wish.

242
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,890
Are you mad?

243
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,530
No,

244
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,060
because from now on,

245
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,070
I’ll squeeze up next to you every night.

246
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,600
Is that okay?

247
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,850
Wait up!

248
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,800
What’s wrong with you guys?

249
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,510
Hey!

250
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,880
Stop it, guys!

251
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,900
Stop it!

252
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,190
Stop it now!

253
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,050
Stop it!

254
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:47,960
You too!

255
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,530
Stop it!

256
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,530
Stop it!

257
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,880
Stop it now!

258
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,820
What’s wrong with you guys?

259
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,120
You left the two of us here like abandoned dogs!

260
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,120
Yeah. We don’t know how to speak anymore.

261
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,290
Stop exaggerating.

262
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,930
I was just accompanying Arm.

263
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,810
Really?

264
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,180
This is for you, Beagle.

265
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,880
Aren’t you supposed to give this to your partner?

266
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,410
I don’t know.

267
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,200
I just know that right now,

268
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,330
it should be yours.

269
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,310
What are you daydreaming about, Ears?

270
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840
You got Yotha’s bracelet.

271
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,890
Don’t tell us you two

272
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,890
are dating now.

273
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,800
How do you guys know this is Yotha’s bracelet?

274
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,080
Please.

275
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,290
It couldn’t have been from Arc.

276
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,350
I might have bought the same one by chance.

277
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,740
Come on.

278
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,560
This bracelet is not for sale.

279
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,010
Beagles are smart.

280
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,210
Please don’t just look like them,

281
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,370
but adopt their brains too.

282
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,360
Hey.

283
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,670
You’re telling me off so much.

284
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Why don’t you just stop being friends with me?

285
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,450
Can we?

286
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:42,930
No.

287
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,370
Oh?

288
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,130
I’ll admit that I got this bracelet from Yotha.

289
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,660
There you go.

290
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,970
I knew it.

291
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,610
Mm.

292
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,000
But he just asked me to keep it for him.

293
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,980
His bracelet or his heart?

294
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,770
His bracelet.

295
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,830
What haven’t you told us?

296
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,490
Spill everything.

297
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,630
Spill everything.

298
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
If the answer is no,

299
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,760
you can get your bracelet back.

300
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,730
If the answer is no,

301
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,290
will you be sad?

302
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,030
No,

303
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,120
because I’m the sunshine of this world.

304
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,360
You really won’t be sad?

305
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,120
No, I really won’t be sad.

306
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,810
At least, it’s better than saying the word love
and realizing later that it’s not.

307
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,500
Don’t you think?

308
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,120
Beagle, do you know what love is?

309
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,820
I think I do.

310
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,340
Do you love me, Beagle?

311
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
If I tell you now, I’ll be at a disadvantage.

312
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,840
Once you have your answer,

313
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,280
we can tell each other then.

314
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,870
What if

315
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,340
I never figure out the answer

316
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,860
for the rest of my life, whether I love you or not?

317
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,880
How would you feel?

318
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Hmm.

319
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,690
I guess I’d be a little sad.

320
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,660
But don’t think that far ahead.

321
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,340
You might find your answer tomorrow.

322
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,310
I hope so.

323
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,080

I brought breakfast for my buddy.

332
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,460
Buddy?

333
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,080
Mm.

334
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,660
Please.

335
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,380
People forgot about the buddy thing
since the first week of the activity.

336
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,890
You guys are still doing it?

337
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:24,920
No.

338
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,730
Then why are you in my room?

339
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,040
No more sticking your nose in my business.

340
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,300
Okay.

341
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,220
I’ll stay out of it,

342
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,020
but you should be grateful to me

343
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,080
for leaving the door unlocked
and letting the puppy’s owner come hug it every night.

344
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,510
I’m leaving.

345
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,780
I won’t get in your business.

346
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,490
You don’t want me to, so I won’t,

347
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,000
and I won’t interrupt you.

348
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,120
Make yourself at home in my room.

349
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,410
Do whatever you want.

350
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,900
I’m leaving now.

351
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,240
Bye.

352
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,900
Okay, fine.

353
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,780
You’re playing buddies?

354
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,990
No, I just wanted to see you,

355
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,610
but couldn’t think of an excuse.

356
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,670
Now that you’re wearing the jacket
and don’t need the tie,

357
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,550
you’re out of excuses.

358
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,410
Do I look handsome?

359
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,660
I’ve seen you in this before.

360
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,370
I’m asking if I look handsome.

361
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,770
So?

362
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,480
Pretty good.

363
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,800
Are you staying to drink that with me?

364
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,240
I’ll get you a glass.

365
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,650
Mm, we can go to class together.

366
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,890
I have a car.

367
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,090
But if you take my car, you’ll get a free driver.

368
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,710
Fine.

369
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,760
I’d better save on gas.

370
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:10,890
Here.

371
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,110
Help me take it out.

372
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,810
Thank you.

373
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,030
But you don’t need to give me anything next year.

374
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,720
I don’t want to trouble you.

375
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,910
Just a card would be enough.

376
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,210
It’s your birthday, Faifa.

377
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,810
How could I not get you anything?

378
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,420
Thank you.

379
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,720
I wish you lots of happiness, Faifa.

380
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,660
I baked this cake myself.

381
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,850
Wow, I can tell it’s delicious just by looking at it.

382
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,940
Then please enjoy it.

383
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,340
I will. Thank you.

384
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,520
You got so many gifts.

385
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,820
Why? Are you jealous?

386
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,760
Hey, what are these?

387
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,760
Faifa’s birthday gifts.

388
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,650
Is it your birthday today?

389
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,490
Yes, dude.

390
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,240
No need to order lunch.

391
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,990
My fans are bringing a set of Japanese food.

392
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,820
Whoa.

393
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,610
Who are you?

394
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,560
How are you going to bring all these gifts back?

395
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,160
I have you guys,

396
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,510
so I’ll be fine.

397
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,360
Wait, are you going to carry all this to your room?

398
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,900
Am I supposed to sleep in the bathroom?

399
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,330
Come on.

400
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,130
I’m going home today.

401
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,250
It’s a tradition.

402
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,580
I’ll have dinner with my dad.

403
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,850
Wow, what a good kid.

404
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,060
Hey.

405
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,840
When is Yotha’s birthday?

406
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,330
Why do you ask?

407
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,380
No reason.

408
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,370
I’m just curious.

409
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,640
You’re brothers
and you’re close in age.

410
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,550
I just thought that was kind of unusual.

411
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,740
Stop lying.

412
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,520
Fine, I’ll tell you.

413
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,820
Yotha’s birthday is April 8.

414
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:47,900
Write it down.

415
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,900
Oh, okay.

416
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,900
I’ll already forget it tomorrow.

417
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,420
No one has teased you about it.

418
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,560
I don't think you’ll see him today, though.

419
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,120
He’s having dinner with me, Dad, and Newton.

420
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,880
Oh? Why?

421
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,790
Why do you ask?

422
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,900
Do you want to come with us?

423
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,880
Fine, I don’t want to know anymore.

424
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,900
It’s our tradition.

425
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,030
We have a meal with Dad on our birthday.

426
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,660
Newton and I were born on the same day,

427
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,950
so we always go together.

428
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,390
But Yotha never remembers his birthday,

429
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,050
so Dad makes the three of us celebrate together.

430
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,930
So today is like another birthday for Yotha?

431
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,860
I guess you could say that.

432
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
He probably remembers that today is his birthday.

433
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,620
Are you done with classes?

434
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,800
Yes.

435
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,490
What are you doing?

436
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,280
Well,

437
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,730
I’m missing you, Arc.

438
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,020
Where are you going?

439
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,490
Hmm.

440
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,890
I’m probably going to keep missing you.

441
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,330
Hey!

442
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,550
If you’re going to be like this,

443
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,970
why don’t you move to the Rayong campus?

444
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,450
Can I?

445
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,010
I’m being sarcastic!

446
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,080
He’s being sarcastic!

447
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,340
Come on.

448
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,810
We’re going to work on our project at your place.

449
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,500
I hope that’s okay.

450
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,750
Go ahead.

451
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,990
Take care of each other.

452
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,870
Oh, no one takes better care of me than you.

453
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,520
Please hurry back.

454
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,590
I miss you.

455
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,420
Yeah.

456
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,480
Kisses.

457
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,810
Talk tonight.

458
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,280
Yes, babe.

459
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,180
See you soon.

460
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,710
Muah.

461
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,380
I’ll talk to you tonight, babe.

462
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,680
Hey, I have my sweetheart.

463
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,500
I can’t talk to you.

464
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,350
You’re doing this to me?

465
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:40,600
Look at you.

466
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,900
Oh, no.

467
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,040
You must be lonely.

468
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,370
I’m itchy.

469
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,280
Hey, Yotha.

470
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,710
What are you doing here?

471
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,660
Here.

472
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,040
Happy Shared Birthday.

473
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,880
Faifa told you, didn’t he?

474
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,330
Open it.

475
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,020
A necktie?

476
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,760
Yeah.

477
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,570
I didn’t know what to get you.

478
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,370
You already have everything

479
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,060
and are probably rich enough to buy anything you want.

480
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
Why did you embroider my real birthday on this?

481
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,280
Well,

482
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,110
Faifa told me you’ve probably forgotten your birthday.

483
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,140
I don’t want you to forget it.

484
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,150
Even if you’ve made today your special day instead,

485
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,250
your real birthday still matters.

486
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,620
And know that you have me,

487
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,370
who remembers your birthday is April 8.

488
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,860
From now on, every April 8,

489
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,290
you’ll celebrate with me, Beagle.

490
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,470
What?

491
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,000
Let me hug you.

492
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,660
Thank you.

493
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,290
From now on, I’ll probably remember my birthday

494
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,740
and I’ll remember

495
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,620
that you’re the first to treat it as important.

496
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,130
Don’t get emotional.

497
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,120
I’m not used to it.

498
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,750
Aren’t you going to dinner with your family?

499
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,640
You should hurry.

500
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,170
Do you want to come with me?

501
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,450
No, it’ll be weird.

502
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,900
But I’m staying home tonight.

503
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,580
Fai already told me that.

504
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:40,210
But that means
no one will hug you while you sleep tonight.

505
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,770
Are you sure you’ll be okay?

506
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,470
Stop it.

507
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,750
Just go.

508
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,480
Hurry.

509
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,380
I’m going then.

510
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,090
Mm.

511
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,180
Drive safe.

512
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,920
♪ No one else, just you ♪

513
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,320
Last year, we were still eating food and cake.

514
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,290
This year, we’re already drinking together.

515
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,700
Well said.

516
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,710
Bottoms up?

517
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,250
Yes.

518
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:11,890
Come on.

519
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,400
Before we get drunk,

520
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,470
fill me in on each of your lives this year.

521
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,140
I’m just running my bar.

522
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,880
Sales go up and down.

523
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,100
Don’t worry, Dad.

524
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,890
If his bar goes bankrupt, you’ll be the first to know.

525
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,470
Yes, Dad,

526
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,650
because I’ll come back and live off of you.

527
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,310
Hey!

528
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,200
Fai!

529
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,220
Why do you keep cursing my business?

530
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,890
That’s great.

531
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,090
How about you, Faifa?

532
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,610
I’m the faculty star.

533
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,260
And I’m about to compete in the campus star contest.

534
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,530
I just sit around being handsome.

535
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,820
Awesome.

536
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,100
My son sounds really handsome.

537
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,300
I got it from you, Dad.

538
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,040
That’s amazing, son.

539
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,320
And you, Yotha?

540
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,760
So-so.

541
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,920
Nothing special.

542
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,560
Why don’t you tell Dad about that guy?

543
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,880
I’m still trying to figure it out.

544
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,800
I should be able to tell you on our birthday next year.

545
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,860
Dad probably won’t remember then.

546
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,680
Hey!

547
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,930
Are you making fun of me?

548
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,680
I forgot my place.

549
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,190
Come on, let’s drink.

550
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,900
Cheers!

551
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,330
Come on.

552
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,210
What are you doing outside?

553
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,920
Faifa asked Dad for a new car, you know?

554
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:28,800
New.

555
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,000
Watch your tone.

556
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,880
I’m your big brother.

557
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,700
New, you jerk.

558
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,270
You’re confused about that guy, right?

559
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,360
You know?

560
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,650
You say you’re friends
but your actions are far more than that.

561
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,420
I’m your brother.

562
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,480
How could I not know how you feel?

563
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,690
You know how I feel?

564
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,690
Are you kidding or serious?

565
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,100
Maybe our parents’ divorce
really traumatized us.

566
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,010
How?

567
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,240
Dad said he’ll never find someone else to replace Mom
because he’s done with love.

568
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,100
He’s scared of hurting someone new
and making them walk away like Mom did.

569
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,290
I play around

570
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,970
but when it starts getting serious with someone,

571
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,560
I always get scared.

572
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,060
And look at Fai.

573
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:37,110
He’s nice to everyone
because he’s scared people won’t love him

574
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:40,630
but he actually doesn't even know how to love.

575
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,090
What about me?

576
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,330
You’re the only brave one.

577
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,110
You took a chance with Warich

578
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,430
but in the end,

579
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,400
you got hurt.

580
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,500
What do you think I should do now?

581
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,430
Right now, Gun is taking a risk with you.

582
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,180
I’ll only take that risk

583
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,900
if I’m sure it’s love.

584
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,100
Isn’t that too selfish?

585
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,760
I don’t want to end up like Dad,

586
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,840
watching Mom leave with someone else.

587
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,110
I don’t want Gun to get hurt like I did

588
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,680
when Warich said what we had wasn’t love.

589
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,500
Hi, Mom.

590
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,490
What’s up, son?

591
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,000
I’m sleeping alone tonight.

592
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,080
My friend went home.

593
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,480
You’re allowed to go home?

594
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,660
I thought it was against the dorm rules.

595
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,080
You can come home and visit me then.

596
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,320
My friend just doesn’t care about the rules.

597
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,890
He’s a bad boy.

598
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,630
Really?

599
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,110
I miss you.

600
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,450
Come visit me on some weekends.

601
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,690
Hey, Mom.

602
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,160
Can I bring my friend to visit?

603
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,200
Friend or partner?

604
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,440
Friend.

605
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,400
Either way, you can bring them.

606
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,310
But you have to let me know in advance
so I can get ready.

607
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,010
How about next weekend?

608
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,650
Okay.

609
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,290
I’ll be waiting.

610
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,170
I miss you so much.

611
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,880
I miss you too.

612
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,810
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU FREE TO TALK?

613
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,411
Tell me honestly,

614
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,011
have you ever really loved me?

615
00:35:59,114 --> 00:36:03,080
I’m sorry that I’m only sure about this now.

616
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,268
Then remember

617
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,617
that your uncertainty hurt me so much.

618
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,228
Yotha.

619
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:19,251
Thank you

620
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:22,860
for breaking another world of mine.

621
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,497
Can I stay with you tonight?

622
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,337
It’s been so long since I’ve slept in a dark room like this.

623
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,525
I’m not really used to it anymore.

624
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,885
Why are you sleeping here tonight?

625
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,028
Why?

626
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,457
Can’t I stay the night with my dear brother?

627
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,434
Alright, I just wanted to apologize
for meddling in your business with Gun.

628
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,520
Once we go back to the dorm, I’ll switch rooms back.

629
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,502
It’s better for him to stay with you.

630
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,102
Why?

631
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,748
What’s wrong?

632
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,314
I’m too lazy to explain right now.

633
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:05,131
I’m sleepy.

634
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,765
Yo, what’s going on between you and Gun?

635
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,491
I’m figuring it out.

636
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,240
What do you mean?

637
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,337
In the meantime, please take care of him.

638
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,605
Yotha.

639
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,017
Aren’t you going to class?

640
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,605
I’m about to.

641
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,605
How was dinner with your family last night?

642
00:37:56,822 --> 00:37:58,582
Isn’t that too selfish?

643
00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:05,897
You have the right to protect your feelings, Yotha,

644
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,165
but think carefully before you do anything.

645
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,908
And please protect the feelings
of the one by your side, too.

646
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,114
Same as usual.

647
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,897
Faifa said you guys drank until late.

648
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:27,697
No wonder you didn’t reply to my text.

649
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,405
I didn’t see it.

650
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,777
Is something the matter?

651
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,451
Are you free next weekend?

652
00:38:37,257 --> 00:38:39,250
I’ll take you to my house like I promised.

653
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,937
Your house?

654
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:41,908
Yeah.

655
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,194
In Chantaburi.

656
00:38:43,702 --> 00:38:46,542
I already told my mom I’m bringing my friend.

657
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,165
She’s okay with it

658
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,600
and will prepare delicious food for us.

659
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,542
I’m busy.

660
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,062
Oh?

661
00:38:57,497 --> 00:38:58,222
Really?

662
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,222
I’m sorry.

663
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,982
I forgot to ask you first.

664
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:07,640
I’m sorry.

665
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,485
No worries.

666
00:39:11,325 --> 00:39:13,320
I’ll go alone this time.

667
00:39:13,577 --> 00:39:15,320
Next time, we can go together.

668
00:39:15,908 --> 00:39:16,908
Let’s hurry to class.

669
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,314
I need to check my attendance.

670
00:39:25,342 --> 00:39:26,702
What can I get for you?

671
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,994
Hey!

672
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:33,451
Oh.

673
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,251
Can I get rice noodles?

674
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,171
I sell rice and curry.

675
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:39,885
Oh.

676
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,937
Then I'll have minced pork with basil.

677
00:39:41,954 --> 00:39:42,702
Sure.

678
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,165
Just that.

679
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:43,714
Okay.

680
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,154
Here you go.

681
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,114
40 baht, please.

682
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,531
Gun.

683
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,262
Are you not feeling well?

684
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,085
I probably have a bit of a headache.

685
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,662
Do you, or do you probably have a headache?

686
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,525
I do, a bit.

687
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,628
Then after you’re done eating,

688
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:14,620
go buy some medicine before you go to class, okay?

689
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,251
Hey, Ears.

690
00:40:16,274 --> 00:40:18,800
You can tell us anything.

691
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,451
Look.

692
00:40:23,217 --> 00:40:24,897
I really have a headache.

693
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,200
I’m probably about to get sick.

694
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,388
Why? Can’t I feel a bit down?

695
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:34,640
You’re usually the sunshine of this world.

696
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,897
When you’re down, it’s kinda weird.

697
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,422
If the answer is no,

698
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,205
will you be sad?

699
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:46,960
No,

700
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,897
because I’m the sunshine of this world.

701
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,302
Alright, let me get sick for just a little while.

702
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,977
I’ll be your sunshine again soon.

703
00:40:57,994 --> 00:40:59,857
Don’t be annoyed with me later.

704
00:41:02,102 --> 00:41:03,897
I’d rather be annoyed than worried about you.

705
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,600
That’s so touching

706
00:41:06,628 --> 00:41:07,977
I could cry.

707
00:41:07,994 --> 00:41:09,062
What’s wrong with you?

708
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,108
Hey!

709
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,171
Chew before you speak!

710
00:41:15,188 --> 00:41:16,405
You slapped him so hard.

711
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,891
Book, give me your fried rice.

712
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:19,851
Then get my fried rice,

713
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,657
but give me your pork!

714
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:34,211
Go ahead.

715
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,422
Let me drink some water first.

716
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,834
I’m going to faint.

717
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,862
You’re almost there, Fai.

718
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,348
Almost there.

719
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:44,508
Almost there.

720
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,714
It’s closed.

721
00:41:48,217 --> 00:41:49,177
Closed.

722
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,211
The drink shop is closed.

723
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,131
I can’t take it anymore.

724
00:41:55,885 --> 00:41:56,897
I need some water right now.

725
00:41:56,902 --> 00:41:58,234
Are you okay?

726
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,114
Water.

727
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,377
Water.

728
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,714
I’m so thirsty.

729
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:08,211
I drank a bit already.

730
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,565
You don’t need to use the straw.

731
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,805
Drink slowly.

732
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,108
You don’t want to choke.

733
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:24,194
If I had to choose between choking to death

734
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,660
and dehydrating to death,
I’d rather choke than not drink water.

735
00:42:26,668 --> 00:42:27,588
You’re weird.

736
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,080
How?

737
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,457
You came to work out.

738
00:42:31,474 --> 00:42:33,234
Why didn’t you bring water?

739
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,577
It’s important.

740
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,497
I brought it,

741
00:42:36,508 --> 00:42:37,771
but I already gave it to someone else.

742
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:38,971
That doesn’t count.

743
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,765
You’re such a nag, water boy.

744
00:42:41,782 --> 00:42:42,740
My name is not Water.

745
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,977
Your name is Wine.

746
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,280
I know.

747
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:46,805
I’m just kidding.

748
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,691
What are you doing here?

749
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,805
Tutoring class?

750
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:51,697
Yes.

751
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,765
But I’m done and about to go home.

752
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,017
Do you want me to tutor you?

753
00:42:57,017 --> 00:42:59,010
Despite how I look, I’m a bright student.

754
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:00,971
It’s okay.

755
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,102
My mom already paid for my classes.

756
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,617
Thank you, by the way.

757
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,411
If it wasn’t for you, I’d have died back there.

758
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,400
I should go.

759
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:12,982
Hey.

760
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,314
Have you eaten?

761
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:19,582
If not, can I treat you to a meal
as a thank you for the water?

762
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,800
Don’t worry about it.

763
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,085
Come on.

764
00:43:22,114 --> 00:43:24,851
If I get accepted to this uni,

765
00:43:25,462 --> 00:43:27,460
you can treat me then.

766
00:43:30,645 --> 00:43:31,222
Fine.

767
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,382
I owe you two things now.

768
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,760
Don’t forget.

769
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:54,468
Oh.

770
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:58,977
You’re back.

771
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,605
Mm.

772
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,114
Have you eaten?

773
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:05,857
Yes.

774
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:09,891
Oh.

775
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,102
Do you want to go upstairs now?

776
00:44:12,131 --> 00:44:13,097
We can go together.

777
00:44:31,314 --> 00:44:33,310
Is Fai back?

778
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:35,902
Not yet.

779
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,445
He said he had practice for the contest.

780
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:43,702
You should go inside.

781
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,765
Get a lot of rest.

782
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,022
Yotha.

783
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:57,880
Hmm?

784
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,411
Tonight…

785
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,222
Nothing.

786
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,388
You should go take a shower and sleep.

787
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,240
I’ll come down to stay the night with you.

788
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,040
The practice for the contest is something else.

789
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,285
It’s more tiring than reserve officer training.

790
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,657
Puppy,

791
00:46:16,605 --> 00:46:17,582
what’s wrong?

792
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:22,731
I’m just being silly.

793
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,268
I said I could wait,

794
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:27,834
but I’m scared of the answer.

795
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,331
What’s wrong? Tell me.

796
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,228
Yotha said he’s not sure

797
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,297
if what we’ve had is love.

798
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,382
I said I could wait.

799
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,297
That I’d wait no matter how long it takes.

800
00:46:47,885 --> 00:46:50,788
Did he tell you how long you have to wait?

801
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,120
It could be a day,

802
00:46:54,017 --> 00:46:54,960
a month,

803
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:58,297
or a year.

804
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,285
He said that?

805
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:07,868
But he’s not wrong.

806
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:12,302
It’s good that he’s honest with me.

807
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,011
It’s good,

808
00:47:14,662 --> 00:47:16,931
but you’re feeling bad?

809
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,862
I’m just scared, Faifa.

810
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,554
What are you scared of?

811
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,634
I’m scared that it’s not love.

812
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,125
I’m scared that he doesn’t love me.

813
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:40,691
Oh, puppy.

814
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,548
Yotha is not wrong for taking his time

815
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,440
and you’re not wrong for waiting,

816
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:50,462
but it’s also not wrong to ask while waiting.

817
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:54,285
Can I ask him?

818
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,474
Of course, you can.

819
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,422
At least you’ll make him realize

820
00:48:03,405 --> 00:48:05,400
that you’re waiting for his answer.

821
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,154
Don’t cry.

822
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,291
Don’t cry.

823
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:39,948
Don’t have nightmares, Beagle.

824
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:58,405
That sounds delicious!

825
00:48:58,422 --> 00:49:00,594
It’s limited, you know?

826
00:49:00,622 --> 00:49:02,051
They only sell 50 per day.

827
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,571
Let’s go.

828
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,074
Hey.

829
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,497
It seemed like you were having a nightmare last night

830
00:49:14,514 --> 00:49:15,885
and you were crying,

831
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:17,617
even though the lights were on.

832
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,234
I didn’t know that.

833
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,182
Do you remember what you dreamed about?

834
00:49:26,645 --> 00:49:27,582
Yotha.

835
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,371
Do you…

836
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,194
have the answer for me yet?

837
00:49:46,891 --> 00:49:47,880
I’m sorry.

838
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,000
It’s okay.

839
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,400
I said I could wait,

840
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,388
but I pressured you for an answer.

841
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,154
I should be the one to apologize.

842
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,422
If someone makes you love them more than me,

843
00:50:09,097 --> 00:50:10,388
you’re free to go.

844
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:22,611
I gotta go.

845
00:52:02,731 --> 00:52:07,897
♪ No worries, give me a chance to try ♪

846
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,982
♪ I’ll open up your heart to a new light inside ♪

847
00:52:16,017 --> 00:52:23,034

848
00:52:23,051 --> 00:52:27,868
♪ I’m reaching for you, believe me, won’t you? ♪

849
00:52:56,794 --> 00:52:58,790
I’ll go smoke outside.

850
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:00,520
Okay.

851
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,600
I got back with Klao.

852
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:21,971
Yeah.

853
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,400
I’m happy for you.

854
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,228
What’s wrong?

855
00:53:28,245 --> 00:53:29,480
Why are you sitting here alone?

856
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,925
Are you done smoking?

857
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:02,330
No, I just didn’t want you to smell it.

858
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,245
Let’s go inside.

859
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,491
Are you done talking to him?

860
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,680
Yotha already left.

861
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,897
Doesn’t he usually get beaten up before leaving?

862
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,331
You really reek of cigarettes.

863
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,491
You started this.

864
00:55:08,148 --> 00:55:09,000
Why are you smiling?

865
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,537
Are you tired tonight?

866
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:39,045
If I say I’m tired,

867
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,297
will you let me sleep?

868
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,211
I’ll let you

869
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,102
lie still.

870
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,297
You smell bad.

871
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,182
And taste bitter.

872
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,331
When will you let me take a shower then?

873
00:57:07,268 --> 00:57:08,874
Did I say I don’t like it?

874
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,388
Do you give him these eyes when you talk to him?

875
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,131
If you’re going to talk about Yotha again…

876
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,691
I’m not jealous anymore.

877
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:33,377
I’m just possessive.

878
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,291
Especially these eyes of yours…

879
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,291
I’m so possessive of them.

880
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,028
You’re crazy.

881
00:57:46,468 --> 00:57:48,460
Yes, and you’re crazy.

882
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:57,440
♪ I won't believe in love they say is true ♪

883
00:58:57,468 --> 00:59:03,548
♪ Each time it comes, it never feels right ♪

884
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:11,902
♪ Chance is getting slim, I’m closing up inside ♪

885
00:59:20,165 --> 00:59:21,900
I thought you were going home this weekend.

886
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,600
I have a headache.

887
00:59:23,622 --> 00:59:24,794
I can’t drive.

888
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:26,211
What’s wrong?

889
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,645
Do you have any medicine?

890
00:59:28,057 --> 00:59:28,994
Yes.

891
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,365
Here it is.

892
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:31,897
You can go.

893
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,588
Call me if you need anything.

894
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,914
I’ll turn the ringer on.

895
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:36,531
Okay.

896
00:59:36,548 --> 00:59:37,302
See you.

897
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,120
Get well soon.

898
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,222
Mm.

899
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,520
Gun!

900
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:21,897
Are you okay?

901
01:00:24,817 --> 01:00:25,714
I’m fine.

902
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,542
Whoa.

903
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,417
You’re not fine.

904
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:32,851
You’re burning up.

905
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,417
I can take care of myself.

906
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,685
I’m just going to buy some medicine.

907
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,554
I don’t want to eat congee.

908
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,160
Then what do you want to eat?

909
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:58,394
Takoyaki.

910
01:00:58,577 --> 01:00:59,634
No.

911
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,491
Can I have cold water?

912
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,142
Also no.

913
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,480
I’m full.

914
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,897
That’s all you’re going to eat?

915
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,034
I’ll give you a pass this time,

916
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,577
but next meal, you have to eat at least half a bowl.

917
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,502
Have you swallowed the pills?

918
01:01:55,782 --> 01:01:56,617
Yes.

919
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,542
Do you want me to hug you?

920
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:12,205
No, it’s fine.

921
01:02:14,554 --> 01:02:15,885
Let me rephrase that.

922
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:21,405
Can I hug you?

923
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:45,920
You might get sick too.

924
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:47,114
I’m not afraid.

925
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,662
Yotha.

926
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:55,988
Hmm?

927
01:02:59,897 --> 01:03:01,890
You haven’t figured out the answer, have you?

928
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,148
Mm.

929
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,771
It’s okay.

930
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,028
But can I take back what I said?

931
01:03:17,725 --> 01:03:18,731
I said that

932
01:03:22,834 --> 01:03:25,154
if someone makes you love them more than me,

933
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:27,714
you’re free to go.

934
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:31,885
