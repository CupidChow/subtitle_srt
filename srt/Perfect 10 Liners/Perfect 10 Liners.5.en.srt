1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,000
Every member of the Perfect 10 Liners
has a pair of symbolic magnetic bracelets.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,680
If Arc still has both bracelets,

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,560
it means he’s not taken.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
You both are getting a partner!

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,400
Who’s Tawan?

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,400
He’s just the first member of Perfect 10 Liners.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,720
Anyone who hurts you,

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,760
I’ll make them pay.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,800
You mean I’m your person?

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,320
Do you want to be?

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,960
If you don’t answer,

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,840
I’ll take that as a yes.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,960
Is every major here?

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,520
Okay. I’ve called you all here today

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,920
because I have an important announcement.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,240
About the Engineers Unite event we mentioned before,

17
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,360
I have two updates for you.

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,960
I’ll do anything,

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,040
but I’m definitely not playing football.

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,160
Over my dead body.

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,120
Calm down, Po.

22
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,480
The faculty already has their competing team,

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,800
like Arc and Pond.

24
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,800
It won’t affect us.

25
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,160
Po!

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,480
Don’t beg me.

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,360
Get the ball.

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,680
Right, Arm?

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,280
It won’t affect us, will it?

30
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,480
Arm?

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,920
If you don’t answer,

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,720
I’ll take that as a yes.

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,840
You’ll get it soon.

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,520
No need to rush.

35
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,680
Arm?

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,280
- Arm!
- What?

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,200
I didn’t kiss.

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,720
I only touched.

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,640
Huh?

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,640
Kiss what?

41
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
I didn’t kiss.

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,080
Oh, he didn’t kiss.

43
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,320
It’s nothing.

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
What did you touch?

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,440
I want to eat rice with fish.

46
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,960
What does rice with fish
have to do with what you said earlier?

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,160
I’ll take you to eat it after this meeting.

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,160
Okay.

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,760
Guys,

50
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,840
let me remind you again

51
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,400
that all first-year students must join the activities.

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,240
I’ll let Jet and Arc explain the details.

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,400
Go ahead.

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,440
Me?

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,080
Let’s go.

56
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,960
Hi, all first-year students.

57
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,760
I want to announce that

58
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,320
our team is now accepting applications
for football tryouts

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,440
If anyone’s interested,
meet us in front of the stage after this meeting.

60
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,400
Sound good?

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,560
Yes.

62
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,560
Damn it, Po!

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,200
You should join them!

64
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,720
Hey!

65
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,160
Our friend has fainted.

66
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,760
It’s okay.

67
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,680
The important thing is, as Yeepun said,

68
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
all first-year students must join the activities this year.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,920
There are many other tasks and responsibilities
you can choose from,

70
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
so pick what you like or what you're good at,
and don’t forget to sign up.

71
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,880
Okay.

72
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Arc, do you have anything to say?

73
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,880
No, I don’t.

74
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
Come on, say something.

75
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,600
Everyone’s waiting to hear from you.

76
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,280
No, you talk to them.

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,160
Everyone, please listen to Arc.

78
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,040
Jet! You’re crazy!

79
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,520
Arm.

80
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,400
What are you doing for the event?

81
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,160
I asked what you’re doing.

82
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,600
Nothing yet.

83
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,040
Then you’ll take care of the athletes.

84
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,920
Oh,

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,880
you’ll take care of the athletes, right, Arm?

86
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,960
Let me put his name down.

87
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,640
There’s no need.

88
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,080
He’ll only take care of
the one in his peer mentoring group.

89
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,560
Damn it!

90
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,640
Alright, everyone.

91
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,040
Can I have your attention again?

92
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,920
I have another announcement.

93
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,520
Since we’re drawing secret buddies,

94
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,160
I want you to take care of your buddy from another university.

95
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Okay?

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,800
I’ve already sent the hints for the names
to the faculty’s group chat.

97
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,880
You can check them out.

98
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,880
Enjoy your weekend
and make sure you find out who your buddy is.

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,440
Yay!

100
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

101
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,400
Let’s go. Damn it!

102
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,760
Let’s go.

103
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,400
Come on, Sand!

104
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
If anyone’s interested, don’t forget to sign up.

105
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,480
Bye.

106
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,320
Hey, take your friend with you.

107
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
I don’t see him.

108
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,680
Po.

109
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,320
Po.

110
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,920
Po!

111
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,280
The name is related to nature.

112
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,480
The size is vast.

113
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,760
It’s on top of the world.

114
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,880
What the hell is this?

115
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,320
Your hints are so exaggerated.

116
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,440
Related to nature?

117
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,960
Yeah.

118
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,240
On top of the world?

119
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah.

120
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,960
Oh!

121
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,600
I know who it is.

122
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,360
Hungry ghost.

123
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,240
You’re better off not knowing.

124
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,920
Who would actually go by the name ‘hungry ghost’?

125
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,800
You’re right.

126
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
What could it be?

127
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,760
Oh, I know what it is, Po!

128
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,680
This time, I won’t get it wrong.

129
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,520
He’s confident now.

130
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,400
Himalayas.

131
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,440
That’s too much of nature.

132
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,840
What on earth could it be?

133
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,480
Hey!

134
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,240
It’s Arc.

135
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,320
Come on, Po.

136
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,320
You idiot.

137
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,320
How can my buddy from another university be Arc?

138
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,800
Besides, his name doesn’t even match the hints.

139
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,640
Nature?

140
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,760
He’s more like a natural disaster.

141
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,680
Damn, that’s so clever.

142
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,760
A natural disaster.

143
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,280
Arm.

144
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,240
Tone it down.

145
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,280
A natural disaster has come to you.

146
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,760
Is my timing from hell again?

147
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah.

148
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,120
Hell must be giving me a death stare.

149
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
Damn it.

150
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,280
Why is it always me?

151
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,320
Hell probably likes you.

152
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,840
Yeah.

153
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,720
I think so too.

154
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,000
Hell probably wants us gone.

155
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,040
Sand.

156
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,440
It’s hot here.

157
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,160
It’s like I’m in hell.

158
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,000
You came all the way to see me.

159
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
Is there anything you want to talk about,
peer mentor’s mentor?

160
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,880
Are you avoiding me?

161
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,520
No.

162
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,360
Who would do that?

163
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
When have I ever done that?

164
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,840
You know what you’re doing.

165
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,760
Excuse me.

166
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,160
When did I avoid you?

167
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,320
You didn’t have practice today, did you?

168
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,720
You didn’t call, so I went back to my dorm.

169
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,240
Are you confused?

170
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,240
Hey.

171
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,040
Aren’t you going to take responsibility
for what happened?

172
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,280
Huh, Arm?

173
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,560
Hey!

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,680
Who exactly should be the one
taking responsibility here?

175
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,120
I was just sitting there and you kissed…

176
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,000
What did he say?

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,560
Yeah, what?

178
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,760
No, no, no.

179
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,720
You touched your lips to mine first.

180
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,600
How do you want me to take responsibility?

181
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,040
Do you want to kiss me back?

182
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,680
Here you go.

183
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,240
Hey!

184
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,600
Stop it!

185
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,880
No!

186
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,520
Go away!

187
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,720
Do what back?

188
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,200
What are they talking about?

189
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,320
The table is not in the right spot.

190
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,600
I won’t hold it against you.

191
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,680
I’ll just think that we were drunk that day.

192
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,000
Drunk on the chemicals in the lab.

193
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,880
But I mind.

194
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,760
I’m not letting this go, Arm.

195
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,920
Are you out of your mind?

196
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,120
I should be the one not willing to let it slide.

197
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,200
If we really think about it,

198
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,880
I’m the victim here.

199
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,240
I’m affected too.

200
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
What do you mean you’re affected?

201
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,720
You’re not.

202
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
You’re the one who kissed me!

203
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,240
You made me catch feelings.

204
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,760
I’m affected.

205
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,240
My heart is.

206
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,360
What are you doing?

207
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,560
Do you have a fever?

208
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,080
You don’t sound like the Arc I know.

209
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,760
Pun sent me Tawan’s address.

210
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,960
It’s on a beach near Bangkok.

211
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,480
I’ll pick you up from the dorm at 7 a.m. tomorrow.

212
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,800
We’ll stay there for one night.

213
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,960
Pack your clothes.

214
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,880
I’m leaving.

215
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,040
I can’t believe I said that.

216
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,360
Was that really Arc?

217
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,080
Was it his avatar?

218
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,160
Or am I the avatar?

219
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,280
Ouch!

220
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,520
It hurts.

221
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,000
What?

222
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,560
No. It can’t be true.

223
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
How can it be true?

224
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,480
Am I haunted by a ghost?

225
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,640
No!

226
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,640
Eat it and grow up.

227
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,640
Hey, Warm.

228
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,880
Hey.

229
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,280
Forcing me to come to your room like this

230
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,840
means you have something important.

231
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,840
I’ll get to the point then.

232
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,240
Okay.

233
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,360
I kissed him.

234
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,760
Just a kiss?

235
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,800
Yes, just a kiss.

236
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,080
But a kiss is already too much.

237
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,440
We’re not anything yet.

238
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Besides, I didn’t ask for permission to kiss him.

239
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
You took advantage of him?

240
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,760
Not really.

241
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,280
When I kissed him, he wasn’t sleeping or drunk.

242
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,680
He was just drowsy from waking up.

243
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,360
What were you thinking when you kissed him?

244
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,160
I didn’t think.

245
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
If I had, I wouldn’t have done it.

246
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,400
Right.

247
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,520
No one uses their brain
when it comes to matters of the heart.

248
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,480
What else are you worried about?

249
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,840
I’m worried he might not like it

250
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,760
and distance himself from me.

251
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,360
I’m worried he didn’t feel anything and…

252
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,720
Did he show you that?

253
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,120
No.

254
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,240
He’s still trying to get on my nerves like usual.

255
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,360
He talks to me nicely

256
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,160
and even agreed to go on an errand out of town with me.

257
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,440
What errand?

258
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,920
We’re going to see Tawan.

259
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,160
Oh.

260
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,880
For the bracelet thing you never cared about?

261
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,480
Yeah.

262
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,680
Isn’t Yeepun supposed to be the one taking Arm there?

263
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,440
She asked me to go with him.

264
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,760
The whole world already knows how you feel.

265
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,400
How?

266
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,960
I’ve never told anyone.

267
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,040
I know love is hard,

268
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,400
but you’ve come to the right person for advice.

269
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,440
Hi, Pun.

270
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,960
Can you send me a cute photo?

271
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,000
My photo?

272
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Yes.

273
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,680
The Engineer Cute Boy page has been quiet lately.

274
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,680
I haven’t had time to take photos of anyone.

275
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,480
Have you taken any photos of anyone, Arm?

276
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,080
Hmm, no.

277
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,040
Can I post your photo then?

278
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,960
I’ll take more of the others at Engineers Unite for stock.

279
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,200
Alright, I’ll find one for you.

280
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,560
Thanks.

281
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,120
Bye.

282
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,680
My photo?

283
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,760
Which one should I send?

284
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,200
Why do I look boring in all these photos?

285
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,040
Let me take a new one.

286
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,800
DON’T FORGET TO SEND ME YOUR PHOTO.

287
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,200
ARM FROM ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
SAYS GOODNIGHT >_<
/ ADMIN FROM THE LAND OF RISING SUN

288
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,520
Not this freaking page again.

289
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Are you going to sleep already?

290
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,600
Yeah.

291
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,240
Damn.

292
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,840
Without Po, the beds are so spacious.

293
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,880
Yeah, that’s true.

294
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,680
But isn’t he coming back on Monday?

295
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:25,960
Yeah.

296
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,600
What about you?

297
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,760
Aren’t you going home this weekend?

298
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,160
No.

299
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,200
I have plans.

300
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,400
Plus, my mom doesn’t really want me to go home

301
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,360
because it’d mean more money spent on food.

302
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,880
I agree with her.

303
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,200
Excuse me?

304
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,880
By the way, Sand.

305
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,120
I’m going out of town tomorrow.

306
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,200
I should be back around Sunday evening.

307
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,000
Where are you going?

308
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,000
To the beach.

309
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
Are you going with Arc?

310
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,960
I have to get…

311
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,720
Whoa, why is your chat blowing up like that?

312
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,960
Who did you piss off this time?

313
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,400
It’s just like when Arc was scolding you.

314
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,440
It’s nothing like that.

315
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,360
Pun just posted my photo on her page.

316
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,200
It’s probably the like notifications.

317
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,200
Anol.

318
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,080
It’s Arc.

319
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,080
Damn. Here we go.

320
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,200
DELETE THIS.

321
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,840
Answer him.

322
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,120
Okay.

323
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,760
WHY?

324
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,960
WE GOT PERMISSION
FROM THE PERSON IN THE PHOTO.

325
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,880
THERE SHOULDN’T BE ANY PROBLEMS.

326
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,760
I’M ARM’S PEER MENTORING GROUP.

327
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,720
PLEASE DELETE THE PHOTO.

328
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,440
What’s gotten into him now?

329
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
THIS PERSON IS NOT PUBLIC PROPERTY.

330
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,640
HE’S IN MY GROUP.

331
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,760
I’M POSSESSIVE OF MY PERSON.

332
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,760
Oh.

333
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,200
Come on.

334
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,080
I haven’t finished reading what Arc sent.

335
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,000
Let me read it.

336
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,080
It’s nothing.

337
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,200
Let me read it.

338
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,880
I’ll be right back.

339
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,600
Let me read it.

340
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,680
Arm!

341
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,960
Hey! Let me read it.

342
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,520
Hey! Arm!

343
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,080
I need to pee.

344
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,920
Pee?

345
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,200
You can just go here.

346
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,880
Wow.

347
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,520
Oh, he’s keeping secrets from his friend these days.

348
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,360
The collar on your T-shirt is so loose.

349
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,600
Why haven’t you thrown it out?

350
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,000
What’s your problem?

351
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,680
Where did they get that photo?

352
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:30,880
Photo?

353
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,160
What photo?

354
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,560
I have no idea.

355
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,520
The one on that Cute page.

356
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,840
Oh,

357
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,160
uh,

358
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,360
I sent it to them myself.

359
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,720
A senior asked me for it.

360
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,560
A senior?

361
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,120
Who?

362
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,480
A senior.

363
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,680
I don’t know the name.

364
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,480
But they already deleted it, didn’t they?

365
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,120
Just forget about it.

366
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:02,880
Really?

367
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,680
Yeah.

368
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,080
Okay.

369
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,640
Fine.

370
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
It’s a good thing they deleted it.

371
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,920
It was hurting people’s eyes.

372
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,360
Is that all you called to say?

373
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,080
Wait.

374
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,160
Promise me

375
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,920
you won’t send your photos to anyone again.

376
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Why should I promise you that?

377
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,760
Because I’m telling you not to send them.

378
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,600
Hold on.

379
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,480
They’re my photos.

380
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,720
And it’s not even your face.

381
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,200
What’s wrong with you?

382
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,920
I’m telling you not to send them.

383
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,880
Don’t you get it?

384
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,520
Why?

385
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
Are you worried about people's eyes?

386
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,440
I might not be handsome,
but I’m charming.

387
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,400
It’s my photos and my face.

388
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,200
The loose pajama top is mine too.

389
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,040
It’s really comfortable to sleep in.

390
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,600
It’s my right to send my photos to whoever I want,
or post whatever I want.

391
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,440
Huh?

392
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,120
You’re an adult.

393
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,360
Stop being unreasonable.

394
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,160
I’m possessive of you.

395
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,320
Is that enough of a reason?

396
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,880
Alright, I have to go.

397
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,400
I’m going to sleep now.

398
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,440
Don’t we have to wake up early tomorrow?

399
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,960
Wait.

400
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,080
You haven’t answered me.

401
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,200
Answer what?

402
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,480
I asked if that’s enough of a reason.

403
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,560
If not, I’ll find more reasons for you.

404
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,960
For example, you’re too cute.

405
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,120
I don't want anyone else looking at you.

406
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,440
Or maybe….

407
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,880
Alright, I have to go.

408
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,600
I’m going to sleep now.

409
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,600
Bye.

410
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,880
See you tomorrow.

411
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,160
Good night, Arm.

412
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,800
Oh.

413
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Did Arc make you so angry you’re blushing?

414
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,640
I’m not blushing.

415
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,560
It was windy.

416
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,160
I put my face against the wind.

417
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,200
That’s why my face is red.

418
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,120
Right.

419
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,000
You’re not blushing because you’re shy talking to Arc.

420
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,880
Shut up, Sand!

421
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,280
He likes you.

422
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,440
He likes you!

423
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,320
Damn it!

424
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,840
Damn!

425
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,960
Sand, do you think I like him at all?

426
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,720
Come on.

427
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,520
You should be asking yourself that, not me.

428
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,600
You know that I have my answer.

429
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,920
Listen to me, Arm.

430
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,840
Other people have chosen to be happy.

431
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,120
Look around you.

432
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,920
Right now, you're the only one too afraid to move on.

433
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,800
But I think…

434
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,640
I want you

435
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,800
to open up to love again.

436
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,360
It can be anyone.

437
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,800
It doesn’t have to be Arc.

438
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,360
I just want you to start over with someone

439
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,200
and learn to love again.

440
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,680
Being in love is good.

441
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,800
Alright.

442
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,760
Is he really coming

443
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,320
or is he just messing with me?

444
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,920
Honestly, I don’t even want to go.

445
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,360
I’ve already been waiting for so long.

446
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,080
Oh.

447
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,280
Was the guy I met from a parallel universe?

448
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,400
Damn it.

449
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,520
I better go to sleep.

450
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,120
Oh, shit!

451
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,160
Get in.

452
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,000
From what you’ve told me,

453
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,560
I can see two main points.

454
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,320
One,

455
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,480
you’re worrying too much about everything.

456
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,720
Two,

457
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,760
he doesn’t realize anything.

458
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,880
Then what should I do

459
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,480
to make him realize?

460
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,200
You have to make him feel special.

461
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,440
I thought you weren’t going to show up.

462
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,120
I said I would, so here I am.

463
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,520
How is what I’m doing not special?

464
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,120
It has to feel even more special.

465
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,800
Like take care of him, pay attention to him,

466
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,120
and talk nicely to him.

467
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,720
Where should I put this bag?

468
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,200
On your head, maybe.

469
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,880
Like this?

470
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,960
It’ll be heavy.

471
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,160
The trunk is so spacious.

472
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,880
Can I sleep here instead of sitting next to you?

473
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,000
Just kidding.

474
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,840
By the way, where are you taking me?

475
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,560
You haven’t told me.

476
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,080
I already told you we’re going to the beach.

477
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,440
I know we’re going to the beach,

478
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,560
but if you’re taking me to the Maldives,

479
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,760
I’ll need to go upstairs and grab my passport.
Who knows?

480
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,280
You’re crazy.

481
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,160
So, are we going to the Maldives?

482
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,680
Your two rooms are ready.

483
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,000
Thank you.

484
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,200
Booking two rooms in a situation like this

485
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,680
doesn’t make you look rich.

486
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,920
It makes you look stupid.

487
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,680
I just don’t want him to feel uncomfortable.

488
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,720
How do you know when you’ll get another chance
to go to another city with him?

489
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,840
A chance like this might not come again.

490
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,440
You have to live every day like it’s your last.

491
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,400
Here.

492
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,440
You can keep the keycard.

493
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,360
I always lose it.

494
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,080
Okay.

495
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,880
Where’s the room?

496
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,000
Lead the way.

497
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,640
Wow!

498
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,880
This is so soft!

499
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,520
Lying on this reminds me of home.

500
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,200
Why?

501
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,280
Is the bed at your dorm that bad?

502
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,360
Oh, it’s terrible.

503
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,920
It’s like sleeping on a mat.

504
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,560
You were on it before.

505
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,160
Did you forget?

506
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,440
Mm, right.

507
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,040
I guess I forgot.

508
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
But it’s okay.

509
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,440
I’ll make time to sleep there with you more often.

510
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,480
Where’s Tawan?

511
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,160
Can we go get my bracelets made now?

512
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,640
I want to be a verified member of the Perfect 10 Liners.

513
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,640
If you go to his shop now, you won’t find him.

514
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,800
He opens at night.

515
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,480
How mysterious.

516
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,040
Are you sure he’s not doing something illegal
or shady business?

517
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,480
No idea.

518
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,200
I don’t know him personally.

519
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,200
How come you don’t know him?

520
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,680
Didn’t you get your bracelets made with him?

521
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,320
No.

522
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,720
Jet gave them to me.

523
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,440
Oh, why did you get them so easily?

524
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,880
Why did I have to come all the way here?

525
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,040
You’re just normal.

526
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,400
Are you saying you’re more privileged than others?

527
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,720
Go wherever you want.

528
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,520
I’m going to sleep.

529
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,440
Hey, Arc!

530
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,120
You can sleep at home.

531
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,680
Let’s go play in the water. Come on!

532
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,280
No, it’s hot.

533
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,320
I brought sunscreen.

534
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,080
Hey. You’re not being polite with me again, Arm.

535
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,720
Sorry.

536
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,520
I’m normally a rude person,

537
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,360
but I’ll try to be better for you.

538
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,960
Come on! Let’s play in the water!

539
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,640
I’m not going!

540
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,480
Come on!

541
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:49,960
No!

542
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,000
Come on!

543
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,280
Arc.

544
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Speak nicely

545
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
then I’ll go play with you.

546
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Phi Arc.

547
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,000
Can you go play in the water with Nong Arm?

548
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,920
Now that makes me want to indulge you.

549
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,280
Let me change my outfit first.

550
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
Stop beating so fast!

551
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,120
Whoa!

552
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,480
Let’s go!

553
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,040
Come on, Arc!

554
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,720
You’re going to get it!

555
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,000
Stop it, Arm!

556
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,960
Go!

557
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,000
♪ Then I can point the finger at who? ♪

558
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,880
I’m so tired.

559
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,160
I can’t remember the last time
I went into the sea.

560
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,360
It’s been so long.

561
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,000
I remember.

562
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,360
What?

563
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,280
I said I remember the last time I ran into the sea.

564
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,160
I broke up with my partner in the sea.

565
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,160
How romantic is that?

566
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,960
I thought it was love, but I was told it wasn’t.

567
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,120
Listen, kid.

568
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,160
People get their hearts broken many times
before they find true love.

569
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,040
Don’t look at it as a bad thing just yet.

570
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,640
But it was my first love.

571
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,080
It made me tell myself that….

572
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,160
Tell yourself what?

573
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,240
That I won’t love anyone else again.

574
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,600
♪ I always thought something’s missing in my life ♪

575
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,040
♪ Living through each day, feeling empty inside ♪

576
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,480
♪ There’s only loneliness ♪

577
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,480
Forget it.

578
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,800
Is Tawan’s shop open yet?

579
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,760
Let’s hurry there.

580
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,120
Let’s go before it’s too late.

581
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,200
I’m out of materials.

582
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,160
We can’t make your bracelets.

583
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,480
What?

584
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,400
Didn’t Pun tell you
we were coming to get my group bracelets?

585
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,080
She did.

586
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,040
What, Uncle?

587
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,000
Then why didn’t you prepare the materials for us?

588
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,920
Don’t call me Uncle!

589
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,040
She said you guys would come but didn’t tell me when.

590
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,480
Alright.

591
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,560
We’ll come back another day.

592
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Let’s go, Arm.

593
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,400
Hey!

594
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,200
Wait, Arc!

595
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,520
Uncle!

596
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,480
We’ve come all the way here.

597
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,560
Do you want us to leave already?

598
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,520
Are you the newest member of Perfect 10 Liners?

599
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,600
Yes. I am.

600
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,720
I know I make your angel group look bad.

601
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,200
What can I do?

602
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,960
It’s just my luck.

603
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,000
Sit down and let’s talk.

604
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,560
Here.

605
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,360
One, two.

606
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,400
Go!

607
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,520
Wait.

608
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,760
Whose card is this?

609
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,240
Damn it!

610
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,120
It’s yours again?

611
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,840
If you’re going to keep winning like this,
just play by yourself.

612
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,080
I can’t help it.

613
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,880
I’m just too good.

614
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,560
You’re too good at this, Warm.

615
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
I surrender.

616
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
Don’t get discouraged.

617
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,680
You’ll get better the more you play.

618
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,480
Yes.

619
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,800
I’ll bring you here again.

620
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,040
Sounds good.

621
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,720
It’s late. Let’s go.

622
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,920
We should leave.

623
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,320
Wait.

624
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,600
Are you going back to your condo

625
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,720
or are you going somewhere else?

626
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,240
Why ask if you already know?

627
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,960
Sand, you’re getting a good one from our group.

628
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,840
- I’m leaving.
- Let’s go.

629
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,600
Oh.

630
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,280
Take care of Copp.

631
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,960
What do you mean by a ‘good one’, Warm?

632
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,840
Be careful.

633
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,560
I will.

634
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,680
What’s the ‘good one’?

635
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,760
It’s right in front of you.

636
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,360
What kind of crazy person praises himself?

637
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,880
I’m not praising myself.

638
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,480
Warm did.

639
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,680
Let’s go.

640
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,000
Mm.

641
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,440
Are you hungry?

642
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,480
Or do you want to go home right away?

643
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,200
I want to eat at…

644
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,040
Our usual place.

645
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,240
Yeah.

646
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,000
Then let’s go.

647
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,280
Let’s go.

648
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,800
Come on.

649
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,280
Let’s go.

650
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,520
Okay.

651
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,480
Sorry, we’re closed.

652
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:48,960
Oh?

653
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,320
But the shop is still open.

654
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,640
It’s closed.

655
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,680
Wow.

656
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,000
You really don’t care.

657
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,000
Even more than I heard people say about you.

658
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,800
What did you hear?

659
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,160
A lot.

660
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,680
Can I ask you something?

661
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,960
What’s the story behind the group bracelets?

662
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,640
Not much.

663
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,760
I just wanted the seniors and juniors to bond quickly.

664
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,640
And why do we only recruit good-looking people?

665
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,080
Everyone draws lots to get in.

666
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,880
How’s that recruiting?

667
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,760
People just keep saying that we’re good-looking.

668
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,200
No matter what you look like, you’re all my juniors.

669
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,960
Wow, that’s so deep.

670
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,360
I’m so unlucky though.

671
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,440
I didn’t get my gear or my pin.

672
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,160
Now, I can’t get my group bracelets either.

673
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,840
Say that again.

674
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,480
It’s the pin-receiving ceremony today.

675
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,120
You can stop being sad now.

676
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,400
Hey, Arm!

677
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,640
Oh, I got a pin.

678
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,800
I just didn’t join the pinning ceremony.

679
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,240
They just do a ceremony
to make it feel sacred when you get it.

680
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,600
If you’ve been in any situation more sacred than that,
I think that’s way cooler.

681
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,000
Really?

682
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,520
Next time you come, I can pin it for you.

683
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,920
Getting pinned by the first member of your group,

684
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,280
by the sea,

685
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,280
is way cooler than in the auditorium if you ask me.

686
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,640
My friends said the pins aren’t for sale yet.

687
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,760
It’s my pin.

688
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,040
Huh?

689
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,000
Now that you know, don’t lose it.

690
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,760
The way you got it was quite sacred.

691
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
Why don’t you tell him about it?

692
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,280
Really?

693
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,680
How?

694
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,520
Oh,

695
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,360
it’s nothing, Tawan.

696
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,320
Let’s drink.

697
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Cheers.

698
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:23,960
Cheers, guys.

699
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,440
Cheers.

700
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,200
Cheers!

701
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,040
Hey, are you dehydrated, Arc?

702
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,880
Does my liquor taste better than in Bangkok or what?

703
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,600
Hey.

704
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,880
If you didn’t tell me you’re single,

705
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,080
I’d think you’re heartbroken, drinking so much like that.

706
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,440
You like him, don’t you?

707
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,000
Yes.

708
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,240
But…

709
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,880
But what?

710
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,120
But it feels like he doesn’t like me.

711
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,480
Come on.

712
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,080
Jet didn’t tell me anything emotional like this.

713
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,160
Arc knows how to love someone?

714
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,560
Exactly.

715
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,760
I couldn’t believe it at first,

716
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,960
but this kid has made him hold back his smile
that his face kept contorting.

717
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,400
Has he really fallen that hard?

718
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,760
Yes.

719
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,920
Not only does he smile,

720
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,640
but he keeps following him around to take care of him.

721
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,920
The whole university seems to have caught onto it by now.

722
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,600
That’s good.

723
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,760
Only the two of them don’t know.

724
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,480
How?

725
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,120
Arc is being tight-lipped as usual.

726
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,520
All he does all day is scolding Arm

727
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,800
and the kid just can’t keep up.

728
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,640
So, I think I’m going to need your help.

729
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,880
Hey.

730
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,360
What’s the deal?

731
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,120
Am I watching the wrong TV channel?

732
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,160
Why does this feel like a totally different drama?

733
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,760
It’s not fun like Jet said it’d be.

734
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,280
It’s the same channel.

735
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,800
The ending just might not be a happy one.

736
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,520
What?

737
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,320
It’s a series, not a short film.

738
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,960
Why are you rushing it to end?

739
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,680
Do you really think so?

740
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,000
You write your own script.

741
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,400
So just write a new one

742
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
to keep it from ending.

751

Can I enter your room?

752
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,080
Come in.

753
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,880
Don’t forget to close the door.

754
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,280
Where are your friends?

755
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,920
Pipo went home

756
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,280
and Arm is with Arc.

757
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,360
There’s something going on between Arm and Arc,
don’t you think?

758
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,280
I want to ask you something.

759
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,760
Sure.

760
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,280
Do you think Arc likes Arm
more than just as a junior in his group?

761
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,240
Yes.

762
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,760
Is he serious about him?

763
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,240
Why do you ask that?

764
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,560
I’ll admit

765
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,240
I’m worried about Arm.

766
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,760
Even though he’s cheerful and dumb,

767
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,640
he’s not good at love.

768
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,520
He’s been hurt badly before.

769
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,560
I don’t want him to get hurt again.

770
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,600
Arc is not good at it either.

771
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,240
Really?

772
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,120
Yeah.

773
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,920
Despite how he looks,

774
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,800
he’s only dated a few people.

775
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,080
He rarely gets involved with anyone.

776
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,560
Only Arm can mess with his heart like that.

777
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,280
I feel much more relieved to hear that.

778
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,640
Let them slowly get to know each other.

779
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,360
Okay.

780
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,920
Just like how we’re getting to know each other.

781
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,520
Hey!

782
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,560
What do you mean by getting to know each other?

783
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,440
I’m hitting on you.
Don’t you realize it at all?

784
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,880
You’re hitting on me?

785
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,680
Yes, I’m hitting on you.

786
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,400
You’re hitting on me

787
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,160
and we’re…?

788
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,840
We’re flirting…?

789
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,680
Do you want to skip this step
and get together already?

790
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,440
- It’s late. You should go.
- Huh?

791
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,200
You should go.

792
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,800
Just go.

793
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,400
It’s lonely to sleep alone.

794
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,640
I can sleep alone just fine.

795
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,320
I can keep you company for free.

796
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,080
No, thanks.

797
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,280
You're really not giving in, huh?

798
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,320
Good night.

799
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,080
It’s time for you to leave.

800
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,880
Hey.

801
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,280
I’ll definitely have a good night.

802
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,120
Just go.

803
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,280
Off you go.

804
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,520
Off you go.

805
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,680
Yay! Off you go!

806
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,400
Bye!

807
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,520
Now I understand how Arm feels.

808
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,400
I should’ve let him stay over.

809
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,400
Hey!

810
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,760
I got drunk and sobered up,
but you guys are still not drunk?

811
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,480
I was waiting for you to wake up.

812
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,400
If I didn’t wake up,

813
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,280
were you just going to keep drinking
until the sun came up?

814
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,000
You’re sober now.

815
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,480
Do you want to leave

816
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,680
or do you want to wait to see the sunrise?

817
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,040
No, I can watch it on YouTube.

818
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,760
It’s just as beautiful there.

819
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,760
Let’s go.

820
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,480
Tomorrow, you have to drive back to Bangkok.

821
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,080
We’re leaving, Tawan.

822
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,720
Next time, don’t forget my group bracelets.

823
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,200
I want to be verified.

824
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,760
See you next time.

825
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,440
Okay.

826
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,360
See you.

827
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,960
- Safe trip back.
- Bye.

828
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,360
Take care of him.

829
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,720
Damn it!

830
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,680
Walk properly.
Come here!

831
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,840
Walk properly.

832
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,000
Oh, I swear

833
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,960
I won’t get drunk again!

834
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,720
Arm.

835
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,080
Hmm?

836
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,440
The real sunrise is more beautiful than on YouTube.

837
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,200
Wow.

838
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,320
It’s really more beautiful than on YouTube.

839
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,440
Arm.

840
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:47,920
Hmm?

841
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,600
You said

842
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,520
you broke up with your ex in the sea.

843
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,680
Why?

844
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,960
Are you going to mock me?

845
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,120
Was I rambling about it last night?

846
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,480
Just forget it.

847
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,400
Don’t pay attention.

848
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,400
But I want to pay attention.

849
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:30,920
Let’s break up.

850
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,360
You think I can’t live without you, Arm.

851
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,160
It feels like you only feel sorry for me.

852
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,400
I don’t think you should love anyone else,

853
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,280
because you’re only going to hurt them
like you’re hurting me now.

854
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,200
That last thing she said to me

855
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,600
feels like a curse.

856
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,280
Whenever I start to catch feelings for someone,

857
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,280
I keep replaying that sentence in my head.

858
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,440
I shouldn’t love anyone else.

859
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,040
I’m only going to hurt them.

860
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,200
That’s why I’m scared.

861
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,120
I’m too scared to open up to love again.

862
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,600
Sand told me

863
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,880
that everyone else has moved on

864
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,480
and I’m the only one stuck in the same place.

865
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,520
But what can I do?

866
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,680
I still can’t move forward.

867
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,200
Arm,

868
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,160
do you trust me?

869
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,240
What do you say?

870
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,760
Trust you with what?

871
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,960
Breaking the curse.

872
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,600
I’ll lead you forward.

873
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,280
Is that okay?

874
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,520
I’m going to kiss you, okay?

875
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,960
Are you asking for permission,
or just telling me what you're going to do?

876
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,920
Do you trust me?

877
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,200
Trust you with what?

878
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,920
Arm.

879
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:01,920
Yes,

880
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,920

Where did you get it?

891
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,120
It’s mine.

892
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,080
Don’t you want to keep it for someone you like?

00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,760

Well, you didn’t tell me.

896
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,160
You’re not speaking politely.

897
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,560
I didn’t say anything.

898
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,520
I just wanted to kiss you.

899
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,520
You’re so demanding.

900
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,960
I can be even more demanding than you think.

901
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,760
Arm,

902
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,280
you said you won’t love anyone else again,

903

but now,

904
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,080
you’re not stopping anyone from loving you, right?

905
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,800
I’m not sure.

906
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,440
It’s okay.

907
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,640
Trusting me now

908
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,200

917
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,480
I like you.

918
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,040
Huh?

919
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,360
Who are you leaving with?

920
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,720
Arc’s condo!

921
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,120
I’m leaving with Arc!

922
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,560
How did you know my class was here?

923
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,360
I pay attention.

924
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,160
Isn’t that too much?

925
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,880
I know, right?

926
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,760
Being taken care of like this by you

927
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,000
feels good.

928
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,480
What are you doing here?

929
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,120
Oh.

930
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,600
Pond is here to hit on Sand.

931
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,280
