1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,828
Which one of you is in Perfect 10 Liners?

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,091
Me.

3
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:04,240
Yay!

4
00:00:04,268 --> 00:00:05,988
You’re officially a member of the Perfect 10 Liners.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,920
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:10,274
If it wasn’t for you,

7
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:11,668
I’d have died back there.

8
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:12,960
Do you want to ask me anything?

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,565
Today, I’ll answer everything.

10
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:16,268
What am I to you?

11
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:17,880
I don’t know.

12
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:19,600
You’re just so special to me.

13
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:22,211
Then
I won’t rush you for an answer.

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,337
Think it over until you’re sure,

15
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:25,451
because if it’s not love,

16
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,342
I don’t want your world to come crashing down again.

17
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,474
You’ll wait for me, right?

18
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,714
Mm.

19
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,320
This is for you, Beagle.

20
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,051
You’re confused about that guy, right?

21
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:38,268
Maybe our parents’ divorce
really traumatized us.

22
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,371
I said I could wait,

23
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,662
but I’m scared of the answer.

24
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,765
Do you…

25
00:00:42,788 --> 00:00:43,920
have the answer for me yet?

26
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:47,840
If someone makes you love them more than me,

27
00:00:47,862 --> 00:00:49,245
you’re free to go.

28
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,491
Can I take back what I said?

29
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,280
Can I ask you not to go anymore?

30
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,554
I don’t plan on going anywhere.

31
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,514
I told Gun to leave

32
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,697
if he found someone else he felt good with.

33
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,354
Even though he said he’d wait for me,

34
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,702
I pushed him away.

35
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,571
Why did you say that?

36
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,525
I’m just scared I’ll never figure out the answer for him.

37
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,588
I don’t want to keep him waiting.

38
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,285
But you’re hurting yourself.

39
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,931
Yotha, I won’t tell you or force you to believe
that you’re already in love with Gun,

40
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,862
but think carefully.

41
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,502
Can you go back to living your life without him?

42
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,531
What should I do?

43
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,120
If you don’t want him to leave, ask him to stay.

44
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:58,782
But I pushed him away.

45
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,780
If you don’t hurry and go now,

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,577
he’ll leave for real.

47
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,102
How long did I sleep?

48
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,857
A little over three hours.

49
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:32,011
Three hours?

50
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:32,725
Mm.

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,474
You let me sleep on your arm for three hours?

52
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:37,428
Isn’t it sore?

53
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,685
I got lost in my thoughts.

54
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,120
What were you thinking about?

55
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:49,902
About you, Beagle.

56
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:53,405
Do you still have a headache?

57
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,354
I’m feeling much better than this morning.

58
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,188
After you eat and take your medicine,

59
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:00,274
you should recover.

60
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:04,820
I don’t want to eat sick people food anymore.

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,742
Then what do you want to eat?

62
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,902
Can we eat out?

63
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,697
Hey.

64
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,708
You’re sick.

65
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,480
You can’t go outside, right?

66
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,908
Yeah.

67
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,908
But if I’m stuck in this room eating congee,

68
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,080
I’ll die of sadness, Yotha.

69
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,165
Please, Yotha.

70
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,291
Please.

71
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,628
Mm.

72
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,194
Alright.

73
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,880
Where do you want to go?

74
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:40,651
Can we please go to the mall nearby?

75
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,771
Don’t try to be so polite now.

76
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:44,634
No.

77
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,902
This is just how I talk.

78
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,885
Beagle.

79
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,714
Well, this is because you’re being kind.

80
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,457
Come on. Let’s get changed.

81
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,982
Get up slowly.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,291
You’re sick.

83
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,434
Beagle!

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,760
Takoyaki.

85
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,205
It’s hot.

86
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:53,937
Hmm?

87
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,154
Open your mouth.

88
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,034
What?

89
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:56,748
Open your mouth.

90
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,702
Ah.

91
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,188
Is it good?

92
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,514
Yes.

93
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,800
So refreshing.

94
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,554
Sorry.

95
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:22,400
Hmm?

96
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,194
For what?

97
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,097
For making the sunshine of this world cry.

98
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,428
Just eat.

99
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,902
You talk too much.

100
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,725
Eat.

101
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,125
Eat.

102
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:46,600
Here.

103
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,051
Nom.

104
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,862
Once the song stops,
count 3, 2, 1 in your head and start walking.

105
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,422
Very good.

106
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:18,371
Babe, are you tired?

107
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,651
A little.

108
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,605
Drink some water.

109
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:21,891
Thank you.

110
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,885
Babe, as the most handsome campus star,

111
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:30,668
who do you think is likely to win this year?

112
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,605
Tough one.

113
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,434
The most handsome campus star?

114
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,622
Who said that?

115
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,902
Arm!

116
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:39,354
Watch it.

117
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:40,971
Let me shine.

118
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,885
I said it myself.

119
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,880
My boyfriend is the most handsome.

120
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:48,628
Right?

121
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:49,502
Yes.

122
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,102
Why are you here, though?

123
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:54,714
You’re not the campus star.

124
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:56,348
Not even the faculty star.

125
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,474
At least, I auditioned for it.

126
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,354
Please.

127
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:02,851
You fell off the stage in the first round.

128
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:03,891
It doesn’t count.

129
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,920
- Babe, don’t tease him.
- at him, Pun.

130
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,160
I invited him to come.

131
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:11,160
He’s been lonely lately,

132
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:12,188
so I asked him to help out.

133
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,251
Lonely?

134
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:14,062
Why?

135
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,217
Are you the type who can’t be alone?

136
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,594
Does being alone make your mind go crazy?

137
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,222
Babe!

138
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,845
I’m leaving.

139
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:22,360
Hey, Arm.

140
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:23,720
I’m just kidding.

141
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:25,154
Just kidding.

142
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,097
Where are you going after this?

143
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,731
How about dinner?

144
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:30,554
Where?

145
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,765
A fine dining restaurant,

146
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:33,782
but I booked it for a date night with Pun.

147
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,308
Why the hell did you invite me then?

148
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,611
I was just being polite.

149
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,348
It’s tough when you don’t have a campus star boyfriend.

150
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,662
But his boyfriend is beyond the star.

151
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,331
Hey.

152
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,851
Arc!

153
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:53,850
When did you get back?

154
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,480
It’s all because I missed you.

155
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,428
Whoa.

156
00:08:58,445 --> 00:08:59,685
What a sight.

157
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,497
Do you have to do anything else?

158
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,040
No.

159
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,697
Shall we leave then?

160
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:05,428
Okay.

161
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,634
We’re off.

162
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:08,754
Let’s grab something to eat.

163
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:11,731
See you, Pun.

164
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,422
- Bye, Jet.
- 	Bye.

165
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:13,060
Bye.

166
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:15,650
Don’t choke on your food.

167
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,365
I still remember the first day
they almost tore each other’s hair out.

168
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,948
Somehow, Arc changed so much.

169
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,257
They’re so cute, aren’t they?

170
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:27,680
Not as cute as you.

171
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:31,108
You’re the cutest.

172
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,685
Beagle.

173
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:45,708
Hmm?

174
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,491
What is it?

175
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,200
You remember what we talked about this morning, right?

176
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,697
Can I ask you not to go anymore?

177
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,188
I don’t plan on going anywhere.

178
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,474
I have a fever, not dementia.

179
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,205
In that case,

180
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,280
Let’s go to your house this weekend, Beagle.

181
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:14,262
What?

182
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,840
Let’s keep our promise.

183
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,205
It’s not too late, right?

184
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,817
Of course not.

185
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:38,280
I thought you said you wouldn’t come this week.

186
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,217
I didn’t plan to.

187
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,400
Don’t tell me you came back just because you missed me?

188
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:51,702
Yes, I just missed you.

189
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,348
You’re stubborn.

190
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,268
Hey!

191
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,177
I missed you.

192
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,691
I know.

193
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,885
It’s only been a week.

194
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,171
I missed you so much.

195
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,342
I missed you too.

196
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,182
Come here!

197
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,131
Ugh!

198
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,748
It’s so damn tiring
to get through each day.

199
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:39,337
Ugh!

200
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,674
What the hell is wrong with you?

201
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,394
I’m just smiling at you.

202
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:51,062
Why are you scolding me?

203
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:54,188
This morning,
you were completely different from now.

204
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:54,914
Why?

205
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,137
Did you overdose on antihistamines?

206
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,674
No, I’m just feeling better.

207
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,731
How was your practice?

208
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:03,320
So damn tiring.

209
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,234
It’ll be over this Wednesday
and I’ll finally get my freedom.

210
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,451
Is the contest this Wednesday?

211
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:09,211
Yes.

212
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,502
Don’t forget to come and cheer for me.

213
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,634
What if I don’t go watch you?

214
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:16,140
You’re going to get this!

215
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:17,594
I’ll go.

216
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:20,925
Yotha,

217
00:12:20,954 --> 00:12:22,045
I haven’t gone to bed yet.

218
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:22,982
Why did you come in?

219
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:23,662
I wanted to come in now.

220
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:24,570
What’s your problem?

221
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,828
Ugh! You’re getting on my nerves!

222
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,177
Just bring him to your room!

223
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:29,771
Let’s go, Beagle.

224
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:30,360
Pack your stuff.

225
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:30,897
I’ll help you.

226
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:32,000
I’m being sarcastic!

227
00:12:32,022 --> 00:12:32,702
Let’s sleep.

228
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:33,531
I’m sleepy.

229
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,594
Hello?

230
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:43,360
Does anyone see me?

231
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,200
Just keep pretending not to see us.

232
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,822
You’re so annoying!

233
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:55,188
This is my room!

234
00:12:57,965 --> 00:12:59,217
Let’s sleep, Beagle.

235
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:00,634
Fine, I’ll take a shower!

236
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:14,405
BOOST YOUR ENERGY THIS MORNING.
GOOD LUCK TODAY.

237
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,902
Hello.

238
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,417
Are you busy?

239
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:34,754
I’m not busy.

240
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:36,617
I just called to compliment you.

241
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,760
The food is so delicious,
even though I haven’t eaten it yet.

242
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,891
Eat up.

243
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,891
I’ll pick you up at uni this evening.

244
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:45,320
Okay.

245
00:13:45,348 --> 00:13:46,600
See you this evening.

246
00:13:46,988 --> 00:13:47,737
See you.

247
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:48,954
Pay attention in class.

248
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,257
Love you.

249
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,800
You said something came up and bailed on our meal

250
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:09,411
because you didn’t want me to see your wound, right?

251
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,057
I was scared you’d be angry
that I got into a fight.

252
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:17,240
Of course, I’m angry.

253
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:18,257
Don’t worry about that.

254
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,594
You said you wouldn’t be hot-headed again.

255
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,834
If you can’t stick to that, don’t say it next time.

256
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:24,365
It was unavoidable.

257
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:25,885
That’s not an excuse, Klao.

258
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,474
It’s those guys who picked a fight with Yotha that night.

259
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,697
I ran into them,

260
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,954
so we fought a bit.

261
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,360
Will you stop using your emotions to solve problems?

262
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,250
If you don’t worry about yourself, think about me.

263
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,480
I still want you in my life.

264
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,257
Wa.

265
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,994
I’m sorry.

266
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,480
I’ll be more careful for you.

267
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,885
Ouch!

268
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:35,080
I won’t get into fights again.

269
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,457
Now, can you dress my wound?

270
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,565
It hurts so bad.

271
00:15:38,594 --> 00:15:40,188
Ouch!

272
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,154
Wait here.

273
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:48,977
BANG ON POCHANA

274
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:50,868
Congrats, Faifa,

275
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,302
for winning the campus star title for our faculty!

276
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,120
Woo!

277
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:58,017
That’s amazing!

278
00:15:58,028 --> 00:15:58,988
Thank you.

279
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,068
Thank you.

280
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:01,565
Don’t hold back tonight, guys.

281
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,560
It’s Jet’s treat!

282
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:07,171
Drink up!

283
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:08,628
Fine, it’s my treat.

284
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:09,748
Thank you.

285
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,542
Cheers!

286
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:13,885
Cheers!

287
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,691
Drink up!

288
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,342
WARICH

289
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,491
Hello, Wa.

290
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:35,302
Yotha,

291
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:36,720
do you have any idea

292
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:38,720
who those guys who attacked you that night were?

293
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:42,080
What happened?

294
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:45,211
Klao got into a fight with them the other day.

295
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:48,165
I haven’t been able to get hold of him for an hour now.

296
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:49,182
Calm down, Wa.

297
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,091
Who are you with?

298
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,845
I’m with Nop and Newton.

299
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,880
I’ll be there right away.

300
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,634
Gun.

301
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,005
What’s going on?

302
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:04,314
There’s a problem.

303
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,028
If I’m not back to pick you up in time,

304
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,977
leave with Faifa.

305
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:09,222
Can’t you stay?

306
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,182
No.

307
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,200
Is it that important?

308
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:19,320
Beagle.

309
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,902
Just hurry.

310
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,005
Come with me.

311
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,708
But if things get dangerous,

312
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,302
don’t try to help,

313
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:54,260
don’t do anything on your own

314
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,337
and don’t get hurt.

315
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,680
Okay.

316
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,788
I won’t be stubborn this time.

317
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:04,302
Do you promise?

318
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,257
I promise.

319
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,440
Calm down.

320
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:24,822
I’m worried something bad might happen to him.

321
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:26,600
I can’t live without him.

322
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,120
I’ve already asked people to look for him.

323
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,880
Do whatever you want to me

324
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:37,880
but this ends today.

325
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,680
I don’t want you to get hurt again.

326
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,622
Will you stop using your emotions to solve problems?

327
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,342
If you don’t worry about yourself, think about me.

328
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I still want you in my life.

329
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:57,188
Yotha!

330
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,577
Huh?

331
00:18:57,588 --> 00:18:58,582
Is that Klao?

332
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,834
Please stop here.

333
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,600
It’s Klao.

334
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:04,840
Beagle, listen carefully.

335
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:07,285
Call Newton for help.

336
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:08,657
Do not get out of the car.

337
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:09,520
But you…

338
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:10,651
What did you promise?

339
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,485
Hey!

340
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:13,331
Hey!

341
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,822
What do you think you’re doing, assholes?

342
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,737
What the hell are you doing here, Yotha?

343
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:21,582
This is none of your business.

344
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:23,011
You’re almost done for and still want to talk like that?

345
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:23,725
You idiot.

346
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:25,720
Did you come to let me beat you up too?

347
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,702
Yotha, he has a knife!

348
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,691
Hey.

349
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,617
You have a problem with me,

350
00:19:57,634 --> 00:19:58,988
so settle it with me.

351
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:00,571
My friend has nothing to do with it.

352
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,508
So this is it.

353
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,177
He’s your weakness, huh?

354
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,451
Hey!

355
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:45,474
Klao!

356
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:46,257
This is not the end of it!

357
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:46,897
Klao!

358
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,051
Klao.

359
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,720
Wa.

360
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,422
I’m fine.

361
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,897
Hang in there, Klao.

362
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,097
Wa, I ended it.

363
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,742
Klao.

364
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:09,902
Klao.

365
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,217
Klao.

366
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:12,017
Wake up, Klao.

367
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:12,628
Klao.

368
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,600
Klao.

369
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:14,302
Gun.

370
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,057
Yotha.

371
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:19,622
Yotha.

372
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,748
Are you okay?

373
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,165
Are you okay?

374
00:21:24,748 --> 00:21:25,822
Are you hurt anywhere?

375
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,165
What about you?

376
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:32,451
Are you hurt?

377
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,445
You’re okay, right?

378
00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:35,880
No more crying.

379
00:21:41,971 --> 00:21:43,971
Don’t get hurt anymore.

380
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:44,788
Stop crying.

381
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,131
You have to be okay.

382
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,502
The answer you’re waiting for,

383
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,582
I’ve figured it out.

384
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,325
Thank you.

385
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,982
You got both the pills and the cream.

386
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,194
Luckily, you don’t need to be admitted.

387
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,491
You have a bruise too.

388
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:19,434
Why not let the doctor take a look?

389
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,348
It’s just a punch.

390
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:24,340
I can just use your cream.

391
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,005
Nop said the police have arrested all of them.

392
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,120
I’ll make sure they’re dealt with completely
so this will finally be over.

393
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,600
I’m sorry for getting you in trouble.

394
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,428
Don’t do it again.

395
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:40,700
How’s Klao?

396
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:55,010
Oh.

397
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,400
Am I dead?

398
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,125
Why am I seeing the person of my dreams?

399
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,834
You’re not dead,

400
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:04,830
and I’m not the person of your dreams.

401
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:06,308
I’m your karmic enemy.

402
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:07,451
Oh.

403
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,857
If my karmic enemy is this cute,

404
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:14,460
he can follow me for the rest of my life.

405
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,725
Ouch!

406
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,177
Not funny, Klao.

407
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:21,891
You almost got stabbed to death
and you’re not scared yet?

408
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,302
I’m not scared of getting stabbed,

409
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,017
but I’m scared of not being with you.

410
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,205
How are you feeling?

411
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,600
He can go home tomorrow
but his bruises will probably stay for a week.

412
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,194
Oh.

413
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:45,702
So I get to stay in your room for a while then.

414
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:47,142
I’ll have someone to take care of me.

415
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:48,634
Who said I’ll take care of you?

416
00:24:48,874 --> 00:24:49,537
Oh?

417
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,954
I never thanked you

418
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,965
for saving me that night.

419
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,600
Forget it.

420
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,428
Consider us even.

421
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,874
You saved me this time.

422
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,822
What a loser.

423
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,680
That little fight got you admitted already.

424
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,485
Oh, you’re asking for trouble again!

425
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:09,354
Klao!

426
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,411
Look what he said!

427
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,582
Thank you, everyone,

428
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,491
and sorry for all the trouble.

429
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:19,800
Why don’t you take Gun home to rest?

430
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:21,160
You guys must be tired.

431
00:25:21,194 --> 00:25:22,257
I’m alright.

432
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,971
I’ll head out then.

433
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,102
You didn’t bring your car, right?

434
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:27,937
I’ll give you a ride.

435
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,194
Thank you, Wa.

436
00:25:30,217 --> 00:25:30,880
No worries.

437
00:25:30,902 --> 00:25:31,845
Good luck.

438
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,468
Don’t step on anyone’s toes.

439
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,742
If no one watches over me tonight,

440
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:48,520
my wounds will get really inflamed.

441
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,417
Ouch!

442
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:50,611
Give me a break.

443
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,897
That hurts!

444
00:25:51,908 --> 00:25:53,617
Be gentle.

445
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,291
Something this serious happened.

446
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:09,902
Why didn’t anyone tell me anything?

447
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,640
Take a shower, Beagle.

448
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,891
I didn’t want to ruin your fun.

449
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,400
Thank you.

450
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:28,880
Next time, don’t bother.

451
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,765
It’s over now.

452
00:26:32,085 --> 00:26:33,520
Don’t think too much about it.

453
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,800
I’m sorry.

454
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,388
Is it over for you?

455
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,610
Nop and Newton reported it to the police.

456
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,651
No, I mean from now on,

457
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,377
will you still go to the bar?

458
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:49,897
I quit.

459
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,874
I’m done with all of it.

460
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:52,994
Because of the puppy?

461
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,600
Mm.

462
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,891
I don’t want Gun to go through what he did again today.

463
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:03,605
Why do you love him so much?

464
00:27:16,537 --> 00:27:17,897
Gun is cute.

465
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,714
He’s the sunshine I’ve never experienced.

466
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,891
He makes me smile and laugh.

467
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,240
He makes me happy with what’s around me.

468
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,965
I want to take care of him.

469
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,268
I want him to smile every day.

470
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,297
There you go.

471
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,885
Now you know you love him.

472
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,428
Alright.

473
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,302
I’ll sleep in your room tonight.

474
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:53,931
You can do whatever you want.

475
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,234
Do what?

476
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,908
Don’t think that far ahead.

477
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:01,257
I just want you two to talk things through.

478
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,268
I wasn’t thinking that far ahead.

479
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,005
Go ahead, Mr. Yotha.

480
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:10,845
I’m going now.

481
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,765
Tonight,
you’re going to be devoured.

482
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,268
What are you talking about?

483
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,160
The puppy’s going to be devoured tonight.

484
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,188
Is Fai going to eat a puppy?

485
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,708
His friend’s name is Puppy.

486
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,045
I’ll take a shower upstairs
and come down to cuddle you.

487
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:38,411
Okay.

488
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:46,588
His friend’s name is Puppy
so he’s going to eat a puppy?

489
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,885
Faifa is staying with Kong tonight.

490
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,108
Why?

491
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,771
I don’t know.

492
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,348
Have you taken your pills?

493
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,811
Yes, but I haven’t applied the cream yet.

494
00:29:06,314 --> 00:29:06,800
Come on.

495
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,902
Let me apply it for you.

496
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,560
Does it still hurt?

497
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:15,211
Mm.

498
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,388
This will hurt a bit, okay?

499
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,365
I’ll be gentle.

500
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,274
Warich’s tattoo translates to his name.

501
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,914
What does your tattoo mean?

502
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,605
1403.

503
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,811
It’s the date my parents broke up.

504
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:39,611
I’m sorry.

505
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,097
I shouldn’t have asked.

506
00:29:41,628 --> 00:29:42,702
You can ask.

507
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,137
I’ll answer everything.

508
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:52,222
Is this another reason you’re scared to love?

509
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,462
Yes.

510
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,582
But I’m brave now.

511
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:02,325
Huh?

512
00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:06,022
I’m brave enough to love you, Beagle.

513
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,891
Are you happy with my answer?

514
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,434
Can I ask

515
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,074
why you love me?

516
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,914
Because, to me,

517
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,662
no one is as cute as you.

518
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:48,660
Give me a good answer.

519
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,205
It’s a good answer.

520
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,891
You’re cute, Beagle.

521
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,451
How could I not love you?

522
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,697
Yotha.

523
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,314
Look, Beagle.

524
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:08,960
Do you realize that
our relationship has been unbalanced from the start?

525
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,257
Mm.

526
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:19,028
Being in a relationship takes a lot of understanding.

527
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,725
We can’t just focus on each other’s good sides.

528
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,600
We have to accept the bad sides too.

529
00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:29,868
From now on,

530
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,360
how about we learn more about each other?

531
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,160
That sounds complicated.

532
00:31:41,182 --> 00:31:42,388
In short,

533
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,914
I’ll win you over again.

534
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,462
Let’s start over like couples do.

535
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,777
This is not fair.

536
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:53,874
How?

537
00:31:54,428 --> 00:31:56,782
It’s fairer if we win each other over.

538
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:01,491
Deal.

539
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,222
Yotha.

540
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:06,560
We’re just getting started.

541
00:32:06,582 --> 00:32:07,697
Why did you kiss me?

542
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,171
That’s not a kiss.

543
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,411
Is that a kiss?

544
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Just almost.

545
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:42,405
Just almost?

546
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,085
Mm.

547
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,777
Mom!

548
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:15,862
Mom!

549
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,045
Hi, Dad!

550
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,125
I missed you!

551
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,737
How are you?

552
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:25,428
Are you doing well?

553
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,457
I am.

554
00:33:26,474 --> 00:33:27,131
And you?

555
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:28,720
I’m good.

556
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,542
G:	Oh, this is my friend Yotha.

557
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,988
Hi.

558
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,428
Take your friend to get some rest upstairs.

559
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:39,097
I’ll come get you once I finish cooking.

560
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,262
Okay.

561
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:41,851
Let’s go.

562
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:49,388
Make yourself at home.

563
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,830
Your dad is not as kind as you said.

564
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,051
You haven’t talked to him yet.

565
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:00,982
How do you know he’s not?

566
00:34:03,102 --> 00:34:05,217
He won’t talk to me.

567
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:06,868
I can already tell he’s strict.

568
00:34:12,662 --> 00:34:16,285
Aww, your ears are down, puppy Yotha.

569
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,788
You’re the puppy.

570
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,428
You are.

571
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:24,420
You looked like a puppy just now.

572
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:25,291
Hey!

573
00:34:25,325 --> 00:34:25,697
There, there.

574
00:34:25,714 --> 00:34:26,497
Don’t be sad.

575
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:28,108
There, there.

576
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,342
Let me scratch your chin.

577
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,354
Once you get to know my dad,

578
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:37,428
you’ll know he’s kind.

579
00:34:39,931 --> 00:34:41,302
I hope so.

580
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,868
Let me officially introduce him again.

581
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,337
This is my friend Yotha.

582
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,131
Yotha, this is my dad,

583
00:34:55,154 --> 00:34:56,217
my mom, and Kloy.

584
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,120
Thank you for having me.

585
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,240
Be honest.

586
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,217
Is he your friend or your boyfriend?

587
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:08,782
Kloy!

588
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,217
Yothin.

589
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,434
Yotha!

590
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,902
It’s the same.

591
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,148
You’re a man, so be honest.

592
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,982
We’re really friends

593
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:29,611
but

594
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,874
I’m trying to win Gun’s heart.

595
00:35:36,074 --> 00:35:37,870
I knew I was right.

596
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:41,885
But are you cursed by black magic?

597
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,777
Or do you like the puppy face?

598
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:46,788
Sis!

599
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,742
You’re right, Kloy.

600
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:52,028
I like the puppy face.

601
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,897
Hey!

602
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:55,342
I’m a human!

603
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,057
Come on.

604
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,240
I’m glad you’re being honest.

605
00:35:58,274 --> 00:35:59,120
I like it.

606
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,531
Dad.

607
00:36:01,554 --> 00:36:03,550
Let’s start eating.

608
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,205
I’ll get this for you.

609
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,290
Yotha, come on.

610
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:07,885
Pass me your plate.
Yotha, come on.

611
00:36:07,885 --> 00:36:09,714
Pass me your plate.

612
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,885
Enjoy.

613
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,897
Kloy.

614
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,268
Thank you.

615
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,668
Do you want some, hun?

616
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,068
Here.

617
00:36:19,097 --> 00:36:20,097
Thanks, dear.

618
00:36:20,108 --> 00:36:21,914
You’re unusually nice today.

619
00:36:21,948 --> 00:36:22,657
I’m not giving you that.

620
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,285
Hey.

621
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,160
Look at her, Mom!

622
00:36:25,691 --> 00:36:27,160
Stop teasing each other.

623
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,571
What’s wrong?

624
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,228
Nothing.

625
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,828
Your family is warm.

626
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:37,820
Not just my family.

627
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:39,085
Our family.

628
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:40,560
I’m sharing my whole family with you.

629
00:36:40,605 --> 00:36:41,880
Dad, Mom,

630
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,885
and my sister.

631
00:36:44,988 --> 00:36:46,062
Great.

632
00:36:46,097 --> 00:36:48,228
Join our family

633
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,628
and help us with the utility bills.

634
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,697
Give me some money.

635
00:36:59,137 --> 00:36:59,908
Let’s eat.

636
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:00,737
Okay.

637
00:37:20,914 --> 00:37:21,651
How is it?

638
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,200
So good.

639
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,777
You’re excited
like you’ve never had banana sticky rice before.

640
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,308
This is my first time.

641
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,194
Seriously?

642
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,320
Mm.

643
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,565
Your mom makes such delicious food

644
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:39,771
and desserts too.

645
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,770
I want to live here every day.

646
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,845
You’re exaggerating.

647
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:44,834
I’m serious.

648
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,720
You see that storage room over there?

649
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:12,622
That’s the reason
I’m scared to sleep with the lights off.

650
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,302
Let’s go in there together.

651
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,251
No.

652
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,320
Just walking near it
already makes it hard for me to breathe.

653
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:40,560
We made a deal to overcome our fears together.

654
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,205
It won’t go away.

655
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,680
If you don’t believe me,
try turning the lights off tonight.

656
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,114
I’ll have a nightmare again.

657
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:27,880
I don’t believe that.

658
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,628
Remember this moment.

659
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,697
Remember my hug.

660
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,931
If you dream of this place again,

661
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,051
you’ll be safe.

662
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,354
I’m always with you.

663
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,428
Thank you, Yotha.

664
00:41:48,828 --> 00:41:49,582
This seems fun.

665
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:50,302
Yeah.

666
00:41:50,331 --> 00:41:51,885
That girl kinda looks like you.

667
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,434
I wonder how many guys are on this show.

668
00:41:54,457 --> 00:41:55,897
Probably a lot.

669
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,520
Hey.

670
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,102
You’re into cute things, huh?

671
00:42:10,685 --> 00:42:12,525
Come watch TV with us, Yotha.

672
00:42:12,548 --> 00:42:12,708
Come.

673
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,434
Come here.

674
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:14,457
I’ll make some room for you.

675
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,662
Have a seat.

676
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,845
Look at the color of your pajama set.

677
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:22,611
Not bad at all.

678
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,902
Are you going to
wear Arm’s pajama set for the rest of your life?

679
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,394
You don’t like it?

680
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,674
It’s not that.

681
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,188
It’s cute.

682
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,285
I want you to wear it every day.

683
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,217
Please.

684
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,125
Love stinks.

685
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,405
Just say you’re jealous.

686
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,028
Fine, I’m jealous.

687
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,514
It’s normal for a single person.

688
00:42:43,537 --> 00:42:44,508
Right.

689
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,874
Are you ready?

690
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:03,720
Mm.

691
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,125
Go ahead.

692
00:43:23,457 --> 00:43:24,188
I’m ready.

693
00:43:43,171 --> 00:43:44,051
Sleep.

694
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,114
Don’t have nightmares.

695
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,817
Mm.

696
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,468
No!

697
00:44:18,588 --> 00:44:19,577
Help me!

698
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,565
Help me!

699
00:44:22,057 --> 00:44:22,537
Is anyone out there?

700
00:44:22,548 --> 00:44:23,440
Help me!

701
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:23,857
Help me!

702
00:44:23,885 --> 00:44:24,651
Help me!

703
00:44:24,685 --> 00:44:25,297
Help me!

704
00:44:25,325 --> 00:44:26,394
Help me!

705
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:27,594
Help me!

706
00:44:28,902 --> 00:44:29,657
Help me!

707
00:44:57,885 --> 00:44:58,668
Yotha.

708
00:45:17,554 --> 00:45:18,542
It’s okay now.

709
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,388
I’m here.

710
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,702
Thank you.

711
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,360
It’s okay.

712
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,502
Let’s try again.

713
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,680
It’s not a bad dream anymore, Yotha.

714
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,994
What did you say?

715
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,788
In my dream,

716
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,000
you came to save me.

717
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,897
I’m not afraid anymore.

718
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:22,177
Our fears
are gone.

719
00:46:26,194 --> 00:46:27,108
Well done.

720
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,342
Thank you, Yotha.

721
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,697
Thank you for staying by my side.

722
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,371
Thank you, too.

723
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,051
Is it okay

724
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,771
to go further?

725
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,411
We’re still trying to win each other over.

726
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,285
We can only kiss, right?

727
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,800
Then…

728
00:47:58,822 --> 00:48:00,205
can we stop trying to win each other over?

729
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:02,114
Why?

730
00:48:04,074 --> 00:48:05,885
Let’s be a couple now.

731
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,131
Can we?

732
00:48:09,405 --> 00:48:10,325
Yotha.

733
00:48:16,434 --> 00:48:18,320
Being impatient like this isn’t good.

734
00:48:23,285 --> 00:48:24,011
Beagle,

735
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,274
let’s be a couple.

736
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:34,588
Mm.

737
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:36,845
Let’s be a couple.

738
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:09,548
Now that we’re a couple,

739
00:49:11,017 --> 00:49:12,194
can we do more?

740
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,720
I don’t know.

741
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,514
“I don’t know”

742
00:49:25,434 --> 00:49:26,400
means yes.

743
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:30,090
Who even asks something like this?

744
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,794
Then I won’t ask anymore.

745
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,405
I love you, Yotha.

746
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,657
I love you, too.

747
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,320
You went to see Gun’s family.

748
00:50:59,354 --> 00:51:00,862
How was it, bro?

749
00:51:00,885 --> 00:51:01,502
We’re a couple.

750
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,137
Huh?

751
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,245
Come on!

752
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:05,400
I want a partner.

753
00:51:05,422 --> 00:51:07,011
I see you enjoy life every day.

754
00:51:07,034 --> 00:51:08,880
I didn’t think you’d want to be with someone too.

755
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,954
No mother wants her son to hate her forever.

756
00:51:12,977 --> 00:51:14,194
