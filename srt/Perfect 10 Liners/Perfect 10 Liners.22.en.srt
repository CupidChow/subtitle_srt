1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,680
Now you have me.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,280
The world brought two people with problems together

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,280
to share them with each other.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,480
We’ll get through it all together.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,760
He has one too.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,960
And he has one too.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,240
I want to wear it too!

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,160
You’ve done so much for other people.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,080
Don’t forget to do things for yourself too.
I’m doing that now.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,520
Just walk up, smile,

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,520
and people will already be falling hard for your charm.

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,840
I couldn’t take my eyes off you.

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,560
Faifa,

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
I told you to look up, not to the side.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,200
I can’t take my eyes off him.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,360
Stop talking.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,680
I’m glad you walked over.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
Be my focus.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,440
Huh?

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,160
Okay.

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,480
I’m ready to look up.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,480
I could do this for the rest of my life.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,480
Faifa.

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,840
Yes, Mim?

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,640
On the event day, you’ll perform in the evening.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,960
The last to go before the dean gives the wrap-up speech.

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,120
The last to go?

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,400
Will anyone even stick around to watch me?

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,040
You have to wait to watch me, okay?

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,880
Mm.

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,760
We want people to stay and watch.

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,640
That’s why we’re having you draw them in.

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,680
I’m not that interesting.

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,520
You are that interesting.

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,720
Come on.

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,080
You’re funny.

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,360
Do you need time for a sound check?

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,160
No, I’ll be fine.

39
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,160
I rehearsed on stage already.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,160
Were there any issues?

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,880
Wine?

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,240
Huh?

43
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,640
Were there any issues with the sound?

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,360
You’re asking me?

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Yeah, you were the only one watching my rehearsal.

46
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
So what do you think?

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
Am I a good singer?

48
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,960
I’m so honored to be photographed
by the Engineer Cute Boy page admin.

49
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,560
Please, Faifa.

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,120
You’re too kind.

51
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,920
If it weren’t for you and Wine, I wouldn’t have come.

52
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,480
I’d rather be on a date with Jet.

53
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,560
Yeah.

54
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,240
I know you two are so in love.

55
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,280
Come on.

56
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,400
Ready?

57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,360
1, 2, 3.

58
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
Get closer.

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,280
You look so distant.

60
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,880
That’s it.

61
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,880
1, 2, 3.

62
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,880
1, 2, 3.

63
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,320
Okay.

64
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,280
Why are you nervous?

65
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,720
I don’t know how to do this.

66
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,240
I don’t know how to pose.

67
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
Just relax.

68
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,240
Keep changing your poses.

69
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,240
How is this pose presenting the T-shirts?

70
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,200
We’ve done enough presenting the T-shirts.

71
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,240
Let’s present the models for a change.

72
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Smile.

73
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,640
You’re not presenting the T-shirts right now.

74
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,000
This is more like a pre-wedding shoot.

75
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,640
But keep doing that.

76
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,840
I love it.

77
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,960
Look into each other’s eyes.

78
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,960
Perfect.

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,280
The closer I look, the cuter you get.

80
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,680
Faifa, you’re such a pro.

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,520
Look.

82
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,480
Oh, that shot is too close.

83
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,840
This will sell well.

84
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,080
Let me.

85
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,880
Hey, Wine.

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,320
How are you doing?

87
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,600
I haven’t really been taking care of you.

88
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,240
I’m sorry.

89
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,760
Senior year is very tough.

90
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,720
No worries at all.

91
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,880
Arm and Yotha take very good care of me.

92
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
I do too.

93
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,920
I’m his foster mentor who takes very good care of him.

94
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,280
Foster mentor?

95
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,040
Yes.

96
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,520
You know how clingy Yotha is to his boyfriend.

97
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,280
But actually, all the Perfect 10 Liners are like that.

98
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,080
That’s why I adopted this sleepyhead.

99
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,080
Oh.

100
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
You have to take care of him that much?

101
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,360
A little bit.

102
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,120
Hey, Mim.

103
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,920
Here are some gifts
to thank you both for helping us.

104
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,400
And this is your special order, Faifa.

105
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,920
Thank you.

106
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,560
I have to go.

107
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,080
Okay.

108
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,960
Good luck with your work.

109
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,280
This is cute.

110
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
You had it custom-made?

111
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,200
Pun, are you going anywhere after this?

112
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,800
Are they selling these T-shirts at the event too?

113
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,520
No.

114
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,200
Then why did you order them?

115
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,200
I ordered them for you.

116
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,560
I wanted to wear matching T-shirts.

117
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,680
Matching with me?

118
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,640
Smile.

119
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,400
Good.

120
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,120
That’s cute.

121
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,000
That’s it.

122
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,880
Yes, now poke his cheek.

123
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,440
Turn around.

124
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,640
Hey, do you want to lie on his lap?

125
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,840
I’ll find a blanket.

126
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,680
- Huh?
- Yes

127
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,920
So good.

128
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
That’s it.

129
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,520
Wow.

130
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,120
You guys are so sweet.

131
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,000
You don’t need to pay me for doing this,

132
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,520
but can I post one of your photos on my page?

133
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,640
You can post 10.

134
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,160
Come on.

135
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
The likes will blow up for sure.

136
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,800
Smile, Wine.

It wasn’t fun at all.

144
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,880
My face feels so tired after all that smiling.

145
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,640
I’ll wash this and give it back later.

146
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,560
Why would you give it back?

147
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,040
You had it custom-made, didn’t you?

148
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,280
I made a special order for my special someone.

149
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
I ordered them so we could match.

150
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,960
Why do I have to explain so much?

151
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
I’m shy, you know?

152
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,120
You want us to match?

153
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,360
I don’t see anything that represents me.

154
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,320
There is.

155
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,240
Right here.

156
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,600
That’s a heart.

157
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,440
Why did you bring me here?

158
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,120
You’re trying to change the subject.

159
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
You get shy easily, don’t you?

160
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,120
If you don’t answer, I’ll leave.

161
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,680
Alright.

162
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,600
I asked if you wanted to go back to your dorm
or come to my condo,

163
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,160
but you didn’t answer.

164
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,520
When did you ask me that?

165
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,320
While you were sleeping.

166
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,440
You’re cheating.

167
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Go take a shower.

168
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,240
I’ll order food for you.

169
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,040
Mm.

170
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,000
Don’t forget to use the cleansing water.

171
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes, sir.

172
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,880
Why so polite?

173
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,240
You’re crazy.

174
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,160
Here you go.

175
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,640
You can grab anything you want from the fridge.

176
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,880
Make yourself at home.

177
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,680
Thank you.

178
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,480
Faifa.

179
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:00,760
Hmm?

180
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,880
Aren’t you allergic to milk?

181
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,560
Oh, I’m only drinking a little.

182
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,680
I’ll be fine.

183
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,600
This is delicious.

184
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,160
Do you want to say something?

185
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,120
Stay here tonight.

186
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,720
Mm.

187
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,280
You’re cute when you listen and aren’t being stubborn.

188
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,400
Did you order anything else?

189
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,600
No.

190
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,240
Give me a second.

191
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,280
This is Wine, my junior at uni.

192
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,000
Hi.

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,960
Hi.

194
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,600
What’s Faifa like at uni?

195
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,000
Does he give people headaches?

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,240
No, he’s very kind.

197
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,640
He has a lot of friends

198
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
and they all love him.

199
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,160
My son is so nice.

200
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,480
Of course, everyone loves him.

201
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,240
Hey.

202
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,000
What are you doing here so late?

203
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Someone’s been avoiding me,

204
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,880
so I had to come here.

205
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,520
I haven’t been avoiding you.

206
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,920
I’m just busy with so many activities at uni.

207
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,280
If you don’t believe me, ask Wine.

208
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
If you’re not avoiding me, then you’re sulking with me.

209
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,880
Why would I be sulking with you?

210
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,880
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you I changed my flight.

211
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,280
Actually, I already told your dad,

212
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,120
but he didn’t tell everyone.

213
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,520
He only has 3 kids.

214
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,880
He shouldn’t have missed anyone.

215
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,160
I always get left out.

216
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,080
You really are sulking with me.

217
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,480
Just get to the point.

218
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,560
I know you didn’t come here just to make up with me.

219
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,960
Should I go outside?

220
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,880
No.

221
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,960
You can hear it.

222
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,480
What is it?

223
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
I’m flying back next week.

224
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,400
But you said you were staying for a month.

225
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,440
Do Dad, Newton, and Yotha know?

226
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,440
Everyone knows.

227
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,040
We’re planning a get-together to cook and eat.

228
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,280
Gun is joining too.

229
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,160
What about you, Faifa?

230
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,400
When are you free?

231
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,320
I’m the last to know again.

232
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
What’s going on with you lately?

233
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,360
Why are you so sulky?

234
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,280
I’m just kidding.

235
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,760
I’ll go if I’m free.

236
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,920
Tell Yotha to ask me again.

237
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
I didn’t mean it like that.

238
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,400
I want all of us to get together.

239
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,600
When will you be back again?

240
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,720
Next month?

241
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,040
I’m not sure yet.

242
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,280
Tell your favorite son Yotha to call and let me know.

243
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,520
I won’t keep you any longer.

244
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,680
Come home sometimes.

245
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,400
Okay.

246
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
I’ll walk you out.

247
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,160
Bye.

248
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,000
Bye.

249
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,120
Let me know which day works for you.

250
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,480
I will.

251
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
I was going to pretend to sulk
and make her try to make up with me,

252
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,000
but she ran away first.

253
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Let’s hug.

254
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
I don’t like when Mom goes back there.

255
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,280
It makes me feel like when she brought me back here.

256
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,400
Like I’m being abandoned over and over.

257
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,520
Faifa.

258
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,280
But everything’s getting better.

259
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Because you’re always here to hug me.

260
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,280
Do you feel this way every time your Mom leaves?

261
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,840
I prefer sending her off alone.

262
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,320
Every time Dad and Newton ask to come along,

263
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,320
I find an excuse to stop them,

264
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,560
because every time Mom walks through the gate,

265
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,720
I cry.

266
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,720
I cry all the way home and stop just when I arrive.

267
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,360
Have you ever thought about
how to move past these feelings?

268
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,960
Never.

269
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,520
Maybe you need someone by your side to comfort you.

270
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,120
At least, you’ll stop crying sooner.

271
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,920
I already have that someone.

272
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,520
I’m glad I get to be that for you.

273
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,080
Thank you.

274
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,040
Cheers!

275
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
What brings you guys here?

276
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,960
Nothing for me.

277
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,840
I’m just lonely.

278
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,040
This is our bar too.

279
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,040
You haven’t left Klao’s side recently.

280
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,600
You probably go to bed at 8 p.m.

281
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,240
He just started working.

282
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,960
He’s adjusting,

283
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,280
so I have to take care of him.

284
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,200
Klao is working?

285
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,920
Yeah.

286
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,720
At his family’s company.

287
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,160
He’s grown up now.

288
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,040
I can’t imagine.

289
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,200
If his staff did something he didn’t like,

290
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,200
wouldn’t he punch their faces?

291
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,120
Klao is not like that anymore.

292
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,920
Hi, Mom.

293
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,240
Mom went to see Fai at his condo?

294
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,480
(Yes, but that’s not the shocking part.)

295
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,880
She saw Wine with him.

296
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,520
That’s not shocking.

297
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,560
Yotha, fill me in right now.

298
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,640
What’s going on between Wine and Faifa?

299
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,320
As far as I know,

300
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,640
they’re not together yet,

301
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,480
but they probably will be soon.

302
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,160
Faifa’s brave enough to love someone now?

303
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,520
We should be happy for him, shouldn’t we?

304
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,760
(Of course.)

305
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,760
(If this love goes smoothly)

306
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,520
and nothing goes wrong.

307
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,280
Mm.

308
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,520
I’ll keep watch.

309
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,720
(Mm.)

310
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,920
You fell asleep.

311
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,760
Are you done with your call?

312
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,600
Yes.

313
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,040
Do you want to sleep properly in the bedroom?

314
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,320
Yeah.

315
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,480
Come on.

316
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,680
- Bring the tiger.
- 	I’m sleepy.

317
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,680
Okay, let’s go.

318
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,840
Are you okay?

319
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,560
Of course.

320
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,600
Hi, guys.

321
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,360
Hey.

322
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,440
How are you?

323
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,720
Was it a tiring day at work?

324
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,280
A bit.

325
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
What can I get you tonight?

326
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,920
What kind of drinks?

327
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,920
I’m not drinking tonight.

328
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,960
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

329
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,760
Shall we leave then?

330
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,840
So you can rest.

331
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,440
Mm.

332
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,400
Okay.

333
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,240
Please excuse us.

334
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,640
Love really changes you for the better, huh?

335
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,040
Now this makes me want to fall in love too.

336
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,960
But definitely not with you.

337
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,440
It’s not like I even want you.

338
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,400
I’m going to puke.

339
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,880
What’s up, Mr. Model?

340
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,840
Were you so tired
you couldn’t find a way back to the dorm?

341
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,440
Jay, why do you keep telling on me?

342
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,240
Where’s the cup I asked you to bring from the dorm?

343
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,920
Here it is.

344
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,000
I didn’t forget.

345
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,680
Thanks.

346
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,040
Wait.

347
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,440
Toey said you didn’t reply to Tor’s chat.

348
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,880
Did he message me?

349
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,640
I might have missed it.

350
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,080
You didn’t see it
or you didn’t reply on purpose?

351
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,680
I don’t know what to say.

352
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,320
There you go.

353
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,080
That means you saw it.

354
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Don’t leave this hanging.

355
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,240
Tor still thinks you’re into him.

356
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,080
And Toey said he wants to pursue you.

357
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,120
Alright, I’ll deal with it soon.

358
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,800
Thanks so much for worrying about me.

359
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,320
You made me wait so long
just because you went to get this cup?

360
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,440
This is a refillable cup, right?

361
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,320
That’s just my excuse.

362
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,040
Order what you want to drink.

363
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,440
I can always treat you.

364
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,440
That’s another excuse.

365
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,040
What did you say, stubborn boy?

366
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,760
Hmm?

367
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,120
What did you just say?

368
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,160
We’re close to getting a free drink.

369
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,240
Please.

370
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,960
We can just buy whatever we want.

371
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,280
No need to wait for the free one.

372
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,000
But if we finish this card,

373
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,560
it’ll be the second time
we redeem a drink together.

374
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,800
If I get into this uni,

375
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,360
I’ll redeem a reward for myself.

376
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,880
Don’t forget to invite me.

377
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,600
What would you like?

378
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,360
It’s my treat.

379
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,520
I need to use this.

380
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,520
How romantic.

381
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,440
You think this is romantic already?

382
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,080
How much more romantic do you think it should be?

383
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,480
It should be something very special.

384
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
A surprise.

385
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Like what?

386
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
It depends on the situation.

387
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,640
I can’t think of anything right now.

388
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,440
Hmm.

389
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,000
Let me ask you something.

390
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,880
If one wanted to ask someone to be in a relationship,

391
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,200
what do you think they should do to impress the person?

392
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,200
Give them a bouquet

393
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,880
and tell the whole world how much you love that person.

394
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,520
Tell the whole world?

395
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,440
Mm.

396
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,880
Make it loud.

397
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,880
I’ll shout it from the stage.

398
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,920
Say that again?

399
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,360
When you watch me tomorrow,

400
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,720
be at the front.

401
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,080
Sure.

402
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,280
You promise?

403
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,040
Mm.

404
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,480
I promise.

405
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,640
Hey.

406
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,240
What’s gotten into you?

407
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,880
Why are you chilling and playing the guitar like this?

408
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,840
I’m rehearsing for my performance.

409
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,200
Oh.

410
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,280
Do you really have to smile so much while rehearsing?

411
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,520
You’re crazy.

412
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,320
Am I smiling?

413
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,840
I didn’t realize.

414
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,640
Oh, you didn’t realize?

415
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Anyone could see from up there you’re smiling.

416
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,880
Don’t tell me you’re in love.

417
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,120
What are you talking about?

418
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,360
Can you take a photo of me?

419
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,200
Make me look handsome.

420
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,520
Wine?

421
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,920
Is something wrong?

422
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
No.

423
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,440
Wanna check out our friendship T-shirts?

424
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,240
Do you want one?

425
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,640
Feel free to try them on.

426
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,280
Check them out.

427
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,000
Go change your shirt.

428
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,880
Faifa.

429
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,200
I want you to wear this.

430
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,240
Please wear it with me.

431
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Please.

432
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,920
I’ll take you to change in the bathroom.

433
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,320
Come on.

434
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,880
Wait.

435
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,640
Come on.

436
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,320
Faifa!

437
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,400
Come on.

438
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,160
This way.

439
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,760
If they announce they’re dating,

440
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,320
I won’t be surprised.

441
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,120
Can I get more red meatballs?

442
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,000
No.

443
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,280
Alright, here you go.

444
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Stop playing.

445
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,080
Oh.

446
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,800
Your cheeks are hot.

447
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,760
Take some rest.

448
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,120
No.

449
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,440
I’m still enjoying this.

450
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,320
Arc and Arm are waiting at the faculty building.

451
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,480
Arc is here too?

452
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,200
Mm.

453
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,200
Arm dragged him to be a witness.

454
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,640
A witness?

455
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,400
To what?

456
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,760
Faifa and Wine.

457
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,480
If you want to keep grilling meatballs, fine.

458
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,120
Kong.

459
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,400
Hmm? What is it?

460
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,240
Come here.

461
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,160
What is it?

462
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,560
I’ll leave this to you.

463
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,120
Hey!

464
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,560
Hey!

465
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,080
Gun!

466
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,840
Gun!

467
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,480
Seriously!

468
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,400
Huh?

469
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,720
He’s asking him to be his boyfriend?

470
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,280
In the middle of the stage?

471
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,800
From what Faifa told me,

472
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,240
if nothing goes wrong, it should go well.

473
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,720
Wow.

474
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,280
Faifa is so romantic.

475
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,080
Hey.

476
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,040
How am I not romantic?

477
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,400
Oh, big boy.

478
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,920
Why are you sulking?

479
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,880
I love you the most no matter what.

480
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,240
Hey.

481
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,760
Do you want me to help with anything?

482
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
It’s almost time.

483
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,160
If Wine doesn’t reject him

484
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,240
and we don’t have to carry Faifa down from the stage,

485
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,880
we won’t need to trouble you.

486
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:25,880
Mm.

487
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,640
Why do you want me to wear this T-shirt?

488
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,000
It’s not for sale.

489
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,160
It's a matching T-shirt.

490
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,680
The seniors already told me

491
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,760
you made them create the vinyl banner to promote these T-shirts.

492
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,640
They’re not even for sale.

493
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,440
Why did you make a banner to promote them?

494
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,400
Do you know how many times
I’ve had to turn down people who were interested?

495
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,520
Your photos are cute.

496
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,800
I didn’t want to keep them to myself.

497
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,600
Come on.

498
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,320
Let’s check out the event.

499
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,080
Hey.

500
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,880
Let’s get those meatballs.

501
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,600
Excuse me.

502
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Can we get 10 skewers?

503
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,680
Hi, Arc. Hi, Arm.

504
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,280
Hey.

505
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,040
Hi.

506
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,600
10 skewers?

507
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,240
Yes.

508
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,440
I could even finish 20 skewers.

509
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,120
Okay.

510
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,440
What?

511
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,280
How’s it going?

512
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,400
Is everything going well?

513
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
News travels fast, huh?

514
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,760
I’m rooting for you.

515
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,240
I’ll lead the cheering.

516
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,960
Okay.

517
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,360
Are you doing anything else?

518
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,040
I’m going to the flower booth.

519
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,200
Oh, you've got it all planned.

520
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,080
Shh!

521
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,080
Wine, let’s check out the other booths.

522
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,800
I should get going.

523
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,440
Don’t forget to come watch me perform, everyone.

524
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,000
Okay?

525
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,760
Wait.

526
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,320
- Bye-bye.
- 	Hey.

527
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,880
What about the meatballs?

528
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,680
Hey!

529
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,080
Don’t mind him.

530
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,200
He’s not thinking straight.

531
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,960
Love makes him blind.

532
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,720
Come on.

533
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,920
Hi, Kwan.

534
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,080
Hi, Faifa.

535
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
Any flowers you want in particular?

536
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,600
What flowers do you like?

537
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,440
I’ll get them for you.

538
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,880
What’s going on with you today?

539
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,160
Why?

540
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,000
You seem unusually happy.

541
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,760
No, I’m my usual self.

542
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,880
Why?

543
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,360
Hmm.

544
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,640
Do you have any flowers that represent love?

545
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,600
Yes.

546
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Give me a moment to find them.

547
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,000
Here.

548
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,520
These are gerberas.

549
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,080
They have a very good meaning.

550
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,360
They symbolize love that’s honest,

551
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,240
strong, and loyal.

552
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,240
Thank you.

553
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,240
Surprise!

554
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,400
Tor.

555
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,280
My friends are studying here too,

556
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,680
so they invited me to check out the event.

557
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,240
Tor is free, so I invited him too.

558
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,280
I was hoping we’d see you, Wine.

559
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,240
It’s been a while.

560
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,600
How are you?

561
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,080
I’m good.

562
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,160
And you?

563
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,440
I need to get ready for my performance.

564
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,720
Do you want me to come with you?

565
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,320
No, it’s fine.

566
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,080
Stay with your friends.

567
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,440
I’ll see you in front of the stage then.

568
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
Oh, Toey.

569
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,960
She invited me, but now she’s gone with her boyfriend.

570
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
I’m sorry to bother you by walking with me.

571
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,440
You’re not bothering me.

572
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I’m free anyway.

573
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,440
Shall we find somewhere to talk?

574
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,480
That’d be good.

575
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,280
Yotha.

576
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,880
Hmm?

577
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,200
Where’s Faifa?

578
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,880
I wanted to talk to you about something too.

579
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
Who’s with Wine?

580
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,000
I don’t know.

581
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,120
Faifa turned off his phone.

582
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,200
What’s going on?

583
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,280
Yeah, tell us.

584
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,040
I just saw Wine walking with someone

585
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,360
and I can’t get a hold of Faifa.

586
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,800
But isn’t Faifa supposed to perform soon?

587
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,640
Yes.

588
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,040
I don’t think he’d ditch work.

589
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,880
What time is he going to perform?

590
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,360
In 15 minutes.

591
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,840
Then…

592
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,040
Should we go wait at the stage?

593
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,600
Yeah.

594
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,680
Let’s go, Arc.

595
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,640
We should go.

596
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,160
Yotha, Faifa forgot his bouquet at my booth.

597
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Can you give this to him?

598
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,320
Oh, sure.

599
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,320
Have you been busy with school?

600
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,840
Kind of.

601
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,400
No wonder you rarely reply to my messages.

602
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,520
I’m sorry.

603
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,720
Toey told me everything.

604
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,280
She told you everything?

605
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,440
Yeah.

606
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,640
Did she tell you anything?

607
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,320
About what?

608
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,240
Well, about my feelings.

609
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,960
I’ve heard something.

610
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,120
Then can I ask you honestly?

611
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,880
Yes.

612
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,400
In the past, we couldn’t be together.

613
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,880
But I’ve talked to Toey now.

614
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,840
You’ve also talked it out with her, right?

615
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,920
Do you still have feelings for me?

616
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Don’t leave this hanging.

617
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,880
Tor still thinks you’re into him.

618
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,840
And Toey said he wants to pursue you.

619
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,720
Faifa is not here.

620
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,160
It’s almost his turn to perform.

621
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,040
Hey, that’s Wine.
Who is he with?

622
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,680
Hey, Fai!

623
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,160
Oh.

624
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,080
Fai!

625
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,840
Where have you been?

626
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,520
Around here.

627
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,600
Is everything alright?

628
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,520
But Wine…

629
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,600
I need to get ready.

630
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,560
Are you ready?

631
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,480
Yes.

632
00:33:59,520 --> 00:33:59,840
Okay.

633
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,560
Let’s give it up for our last performer!

634
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,240
The one you’ve all been waiting for.

635
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,600
I’ll go stand at the front.

636
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,680
You didn’t like being in the crowd before.

637
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,240
Have you changed?

638
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,120
Enjoy this special performance
from Faifa of Electrical Engineering!

639
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,880
Someone changed me.

640
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,240
Excuse me.

641
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,360

Faifa!

664
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,320
Faifa!

665
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,080
Oh?

666
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,640
Where’s the surprise you told me about, Yotha?

667
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,480
Let’s follow them.

668
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,520
Come on, Arc.

669
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,040
Faifa!

670
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
Faifa!

671
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,040
I’m a coward.

672
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,400
Faifa.

673
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,920
I’m sorry.

674
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,960
What’s wrong?

675
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,800
I’m just scared.

676
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
Scared that if you and Tor reconnect,

677
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,280
everything would be just a dream.

678
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,120
Scared that I’m actually not the one for you.

679
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,840
Are you still unsure about how I feel?

680
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,960
I still can’t make you believe that I really love you.

681
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,320
I hate that notebook.

682
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,240
I hate counting how many times we’ve done things together.

683
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,760
I hate counting down for our story to slowly end.

684
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
I leave it in my room on purpose.

685
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,720
I keep it in a box on purpose so I can’t see it.

686
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Because you said it won’t count If I didn’t bring it.

687
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,280
I don’t want to have a meal with you for just 10 times.

688
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,840
I don’t want…

689
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:13,440
♪ So I ask you, let’s not worry, don’t overthink ♪

690
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,680
♪ Just go with the flow, whatever we're feeling ♪

691
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,640
♪ For each other right now, woah oh ♪

692
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,840
I get it now.

693
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,600
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you honestly

694
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,840
that I agreed to try your flirting tips

695
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,360
not because I wanted to win someone else’s heart

696
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,720
but because

697
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,720
I wanted to be near you, Faifa.

698
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,040
Say no more.

699
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,840
I’m so relieved.

700
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,920
I was so damn stupid.

701
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,320
It was all in my head.

702
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,920
We love each other so much, don’t we?

703
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
What the hell was I doing?

704
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,280
I’m sorry.

705
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,920
I shouldn’t have left the bouquet at the booth.

706
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,280
Why not?

707
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,120
Because if I had that bouquet,

708
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,840
I’d ask you to be my boyfriend right here.

709
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,120
What?

710
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,120
Don’t look at me like that.

711
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,520
Beagle.

712
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,880
Can I throw it in?

713
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,720
They might think it fell from the sky.

714
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,520
Hurry.

715
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,320
What should I do, Yotha?

716
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,200
Up to you, Beagle.

717
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,160
This moment, Gun!

718
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
Arm!

719
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,320
Oops.

720
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,960
I brought you the bouquet.

721
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,080
Continue.

722
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,120
How was it?

723
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,880
Okay?

724
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,200
Come out, all of you.

725
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,440
Let’s go.

726
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
You saw us?

727
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,400
We tried to hide.

728
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,080
Please continue.

729
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,400
We can’t see anything.

730
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,840
I never understood why people fall in love

731
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,440
until it happened to me.

732
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,200
Now I realize how much happiness it brings.

733
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,200
Faifa.

734
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,680
Are you ready to have a meal with me a thousand more times,

735
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,360
let me give you a ride everywhere in the world,

736
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,400
and go running with me at the park for the rest of our lives?

737
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,160
Let’s be a couple.

738
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,800
Let’s be a couple.

739
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,440
Wow!

740
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,040
Whoa! Your lips must be swollen now!

741
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,600
- Whoa!
- That’s enough!

742
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,280
Woo!

743
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,200
That’s enough.

744
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,440
Go.

745
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,200
Fai.

746
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,840
That’s enough.

747
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,840
They’re about to get cramps.

748
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,240
How is this any of your business?

749
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,280
I never bothered you when you got with him!

750
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:00,840
Hey!

751
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,240
Don’t scold my brother!

752
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,480
Go, Arm!

753
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,480
Fai is defying you!

754
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,040
Get him!

755
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,520
You’re getting too sweet!

756
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,600
You’re getting too sweet, huh?

757
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,760
You’re getting too sweet, huh?

758
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,760
Get it!

759
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,160
You’re too sweet!

760
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:16,920
Arm!

761
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,880
Get him too!

762
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
You’re getting too sweet!

763
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,520
This is my boyfriend.

764
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,320
Boyfriend?

765
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,920
When you’re with someone you love,

766
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,840
you feel butterflies in your stomach.

767
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,320
You’re in every part
of my future plans.

768
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,000
Mom invited you to dinner at our place.

769
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,880
I’m glad to be by your side at a time like this.

770
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:44,720
What?

771
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,600
Getting married?

772
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,440
Who’s getting married?

773
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,400
I was going to propose too!

774
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,960
This feels like a dream.
