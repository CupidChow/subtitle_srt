1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
Why did you jump into my car?

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,760
You said you wouldn’t hurt me again, didn’t you?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Why did you take a photo shirtless?

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,120
Are you possessive of me?

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,920
It’s definitely the hidden gem you said it would be.

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,360
I’ll take you there often.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,840
You only got a pin and you’re this flustered.

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,600
If you get your gear,
don’t have a heart attack.

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,720
Your gear is meant for your partner,
not your peer mentee’s mentee.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,960
Do you want to be?

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,040
What do you mean?

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,280
Let’s not rush it.

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,720
Let me keep flirting with you for a little longer.

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,920
♪ If I fall head over heels for you ♪

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,560
♪ Then I can point the finger at who? ♪

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,200
Let’s put money on the line.

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,160
Let’s see why they called us here.

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,320
I bet 2 baht.

19
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,200
This is about the university games.

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,440
Wow, you’re betting big, huh?

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,280
I’ll put in 20 baht.

22
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,440
I bet they want us to clean the courtyard.

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,920
I heard it from insiders.

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,520
Oh.

25
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,080
Get ready to pay.

26
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,480
Everyone, can you keep quiet?

27
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,760
We didn’t call you here to clean
the courtyard like the rumor says.

28
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
That’s fake news.

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,760
Insiders, huh?

30
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,640
How’s that for insiders?

31
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,080
Damn, they’re really humiliating me.

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,240
What we want to announce today is
we’re hosting Engineers Unite this year.

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,520
What’s that?

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,520
Engineers Unite?

35
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,240
What’s that?

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,960
I don’t know.

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,720
I have no idea.

38
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,240
It’s an event where engineering students
from other universities will compete with us in football.

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,720
There’ll also be other activities,
secret buddies across universities,

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,480
and games. Something like that.

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,400
Hi, Pond.

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,440
Why are you here?

44
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,200
To take care of…

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,640
To take care of you juniors.

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,120
Oh, he’s here to take care of us juniors.

47
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,640
Oh.

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,520
He’s here to take care of us juniors.

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,520
But why are you here alone?

50
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,800
Where are your friends?

51
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,480
Warm and Copp are practicing football for this event.

52
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,040
As for Arc,

53
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,800
he doesn’t care about these things.

54
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,400
He doesn’t even take care of himself,

55
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,960
let alone anyone else.

56
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,120
It’s my pin.

57
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,080
Huh?

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,800
Now that you know, don’t lose it.

59
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,600
Oh,

60
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,480
Arc is here.

61
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,800
I thought you said he wouldn’t come.

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,680
Oh, I forgot.

63
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,200
There’s an exception now.

64
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,120
Have you come to welcome your junior again?

65
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,920
No.

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,120
Then why are you here?

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,080
Arm!

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,560
Huh?

69
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,280
Why didn’t you pick up my calls?

70
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,760
Me?

71
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,760
Yes.

72
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,920
Oh.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,880
I forgot to turn on the sound.

74
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,640
I didn’t hear it ring.

75
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,360
What did you say?

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,960
I said I forgot to turn on the sound.

77
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,680
I didn’t hear it ring.

78
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,280
What did you want to talk about?

79
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,960
Meet me at the field after this meeting.

80
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,440
Why?

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,360
I have practice.

82
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,520
Fine, I’ll be there.

83
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,480
See you later.

84
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,160
Yeah.

85
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,800
I’ll catch up with you.

86
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,000
You’re done flirting, right?

87
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,640
Please continue, Pun.

88
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,120
Hurry!

89
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,840
We don’t want to be late for the first half!

90
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,880
What’s going on with you, Sand?

91
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,400
We don’t want to be late for the first half!

92
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,560
Stop it, Sand!

93
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,360
Damn it!

94
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,960
Sand!

95
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,800
We don’t want to be late for the first half.

96
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,920
Stop it!

97
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,040
What’s the hurry?

98
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,440
It’s just practice.

99
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,680
What’s going with you, Sand?

100
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,080
Nothing.

101
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,160
I…I…

102
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,800
I don’t want Arc to make a scene.

103
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,840
Why would he?

104
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,640
Oh, right.

105
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,760
We don’t want your sweetheart

106
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,880
to miss you.

107
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,960
Yeah, he’ll miss you.

108
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,840
We should hurry there.

109
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,960
He’s waiting.

110
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,720
Alright, then.

111
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,520
Let’s go.

112
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,440
Run!

113
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,520
Hey, hold on!

114
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,920
Hey!

115
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,960
Whoa!

116
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,600
They’re so good!

117
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,720
So cool!

118
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,520
Well-played!

119
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,240
Amazing.

120
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,000
Hey, kids.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,480
- Hi.
- Hi.

122
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,920
Wow, with overflowing support like this,

123
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,400
my team is definitely going to win.

124
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,080
You mean from me?

125
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,760
What are you talking about?

126
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,600
What are you doing?

127
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,320
Let’s keep watching them.

128
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,920
Come on!

129
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,400
Oh, shit!

130
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,120
Arc.

131
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,840
Arc!

132
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,120
Stop!

133
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,800
Arc!

134
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,680
Damn.

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,880
One, two, three.

136
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
Slowly.

137
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,320
Can you please make some room?

138
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,560
One, two, three.

139
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,400
Damn.

140
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,440
Guys.

141
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,160
He’s bleeding.

142
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,040
I can’t.

143
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,880
Hey.

144
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
Don’t look.

145
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,040
It’s okay.

146
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,160
I have someone to help.

147
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,040
Okay, then I’ll leave the equipment here.

148
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,760
Alright.

149
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,240
Arm, dress my wound.

150
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,520
Me?

151
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,960
Yes, you.

152
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
I’m not good at dressing wounds.

153
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,400
I know.

154
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,600
You’re in engineering, not med school.

155
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,840
Just do it. Come on.

156
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,280
Oh.

157
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Damn it.

158
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,040
Why didn’t you let the experts do this?

159
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,400
Why did you send them away?

160
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,800
Don’t ask. Just do it.

161
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
It hurts so bad.

162
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,640
Let me clean the wound first.

163
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,400
Let’s go back to playing.

164
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,120
Yeah.

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Do your best.

166
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,560
I’m rooting for you guys.

167
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,040
Hey.

168
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,160
We’re missing one player.

169
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,240
Yeah, Copp.

170
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
I think he has potential.

171
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,760
Everyone says that
but I play basketball.

172
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,840
Hey, but you seem to have potential.

173
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,440
Come on.

174
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,320
Let’s play football, bro.

175
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,320
Hey.

176
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,720
I’m not your bro.

177
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,600
Come on.

178
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,480
Hey.
What are you doing?

179
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:35,960
No.

180
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,560
Come with us.

181
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,920
- It’s okay. We’ll help you.
- Hey!

182
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,800
Can you still move your knee?

183
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,080
No.

184
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,160
Does it sting?

185
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,120
Be gentle.

186
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360
I know.

187
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,480
What to do next?

188
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,840
Don’t put your weight on your left foot.

189
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,520
Do you know nothing?

190
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,160
Go wash yourself

191
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,720
so we can hurry up and dress your wound.

192
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,840
Here.

193
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,480
Now, grab the towel for me.

194
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,480
‘ 	Alright.

195
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,720
Here you go.

196
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,760
Don’t let your wound get wet.

197
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,680
I know.

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,360
Ugh, this freaking stinks.

199
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,600
It smells so sour.

200
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,520
Arc!

201
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,200
What?

202
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,960
Do you have another shirt to change into?

203
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
This one freaking stinks.

204
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,840
It’s in locker number 14.

205
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Go ahead and grab it.

206
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay.

207
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,520
Ugh.

208
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,440
Does he ever wash his clothes?

209
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,280
Hey!

210
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,000
I told you to wash yourself,
not get a spa treatment.

211
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,240
You’re taking so long.

212
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
Here, I only found this one.

213
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,480
Okay.

214
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,880
Go change properly

215
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,480
so we can hurry up and dress your wound

216
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,840
before you get infected and die.

217
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,720
I’m not dying anytime soon.

218
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,880
Why not?

219
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,760
Are you scared of going to hell?

220
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,240
Hey.

221
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,320
I don’t want you to die single,

222
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,520
Nong Arm.

223
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,760
Ouch!

224
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,040
Stop overreacting.

225
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,640
You can drive, right?

226
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,440
Drive me to my condo.

227
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,000
I spent so long dressing your wound

228
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,000
and not even a thank you.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,680
Damn it!

230
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,080
Thanks.

231
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,720
Leave it there.

232
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,160
Where?

233
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,200
In your heart?

234
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,400
But I guess that’s not possible.

235
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,080
Your heart is probably cluttered.

236
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,720
Yes.

237
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,480
It’s cluttered and cramped.

238
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,160
Don’t accidentally get in there.

239
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,640
I’m not claustrophobic.

240
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Drive me.

241
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,360
Have you stopped being scared?

242
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,400
I’m actually not that scared.

243
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,640
Oh?

244
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,200
You looked pale, so I brought you away.

245
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,720
Shall we go back to the field?

246
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,120
Our friends must be waiting.

247
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,160
Oh.

248
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,720
Arm is driving Arc to his place,

249
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,480
Pipo is having fun playing football with Warm,

250
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,440
and I’ve already told your friends

251
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,040
I’ll give you a ride to your dorm.

252
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,760
But I’m so hungry.

253
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,480
Oh!

254
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,440
Um, I…

255
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,960
Oh, I’m so hungry.

256
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,840
I’m hungry too.

257
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,880
Po!

258
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,480
Come on!

259
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,800
Go! Run!

260
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,000
Keep going.

261
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,240
Yes!

262
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,120
Let’s go.

263
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,720
Come on!

264
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,640
Grab it!

265
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,520
Dribble it!

266
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,720
Not like that!

267
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,320
Get up!

268
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,120
Kick it to the goal!

269
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,040
Yes!

270
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Whoa, you ordered all this?

271
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,720
It’s late, so I figured

272
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,080
I should order the food in advance.

273
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,360
Not sure if you’ll like it though.

274
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,960
You read my mind.

275
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,720
How do you know what I want to eat?

276
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,560
I won’t hold back then.

277
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,480
Go ahead.

278
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,160
Mm.

279
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,440
Yummy.

280
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
You’re so good at this.

281
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,200
I’m good?

282
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,480
Is something wrong?

283
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,880
Not many people say I’m good at anything.

284
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,240
Since childhood, I’ve not been good at anything.

285
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,280
I can play many sports

286
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,080
but I can’t excel in any.

287
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,920
I play music, but I don’t know what kind I like.

288
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,960
I’m studying engineering just because I got in.

289
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,800
I don’t know how to do any of the things you said.

290
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
To me,

291
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,240
you’re so talented, Pond.

292
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,160
Really?

293
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,200
Of course.

294
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,400
You’re my talented person.

295
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,760
Your talented person, Sand?

296
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,480
Just eat.

297
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,160
Okay, talented person.

298
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,360
Don’t make me poke you.

299
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,000
Do you want anything else?

300
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,840
I’m heading out.

301
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,000
No,

302
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,360
but aren’t you staying to eat with me?

303
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,600
I didn’t think you’d ask.

304
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,160
I’m ready.

305
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,720
Yes.

306
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,360
These are all my favorites.

307
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,360
Go ahead. Don’t hold back.

308
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
I’m so full.

309
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,000
Go take a shower and sleep.

310
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,880
Let me clean up.

311
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,640
You can leave it here.

312
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,440
The maid is coming tomorrow.

313
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,760
Come on. We don’t need to bother her.

314
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,640
Go take a shower.

315
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,240
Oh, don’t let your wound get wet.

316
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,360
Got it?

317
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,440
Hey.

318
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,400
Why are you zoning out?

319
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,960
Go take a shower.

320
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,920
Thanks for the meal

321
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,640
but next time let me treat you for a change.

322
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,480
Sure.

323
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,880
I’ll pick out somewhere fancy in advance.

324
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,320
That’s so mean.

325
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,240
Just kidding.

326
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,120
It’s time to head up to your room.

327
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,320
I’m going then.

328
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,640
Good night.

329
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,640
Good night.

330
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,160
Hey!

331
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,760
I’m still here.

332
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,120
Were you looking for me?

333
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,280
I wasn’t looking for you.

334
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,880
Oh, really?

335
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,920
You just don’t want to admit it.

336
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,360
I was just going to turn off the lights.

337
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,680
I left many on.

338
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,320
Oh.

339
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,440
I see.

340
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,040
I’m really leaving now.

341
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,880
Bye.

342
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,680
Wait.

343
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,640
Hmm?

344
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,440
Thank you.

345
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,920
Text me when you get to your room.

346
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,240
Okay?

347
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,720
I will

348
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,720
if you don’t block me.

349
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,160
I won’t.

350
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,040
That better be true.

351
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,120
I won’t block someone I’m getting to know.

352
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,800
Yeah, well, I’m leaving.

353
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,880
Bye.

354
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,560
IF YOU GET A FEVER, TAKE THE MEDICINE.
BUT IF YOU MISS ME, DRINK THIS.

355
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,080
DUTCH MILL 4 IN 1

356
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,560
Hey, you’re back.

357
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,240
Yeah.

358
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,160
How’s Arc?

359
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,200
He has a wound.

360
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,000
Don’t get on my nerves.

361
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,920
By the way, Sand,

362
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,720
I think Arc is acting weird.

363
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,040
How?

364
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,680
It seems like he…

365
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,200
Shit!

366
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,280
Sand!

367
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,480
Help me.

368
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,280
Help.

369
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,480
Po!

370
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,320
Who did this to you?

371
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,320
How are you feeling?

372
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,040
Do you want to go to the hospital?

373
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,880
Don’t act like you care about me now.

374
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,800
When you guys left me,
neither of you gave a damn.

375
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,240
No, Pond told me you were enjoying football,

376
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,200
so I didn’t want to interrupt.

377
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,720
Yeah.

378
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,520
You think I was enjoying that?

379
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,440
I had fun?

380
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,360
Yeah, right!

381
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,800
We’ve studied together since kindergarten.

382
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,880
Have you ever seen me play football?

383
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,080
What about you?

384
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,440
Do you have any excuses?

385
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,120
Come on, Po.

386
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,560
You saw that Arc hurt his knee.

387
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,400
How could I have left him?

388
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,360
At the end of the day, it's all the same reason.

389
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
What reason?

390
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,120
You both are getting a partner!

391
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,240
Okay?

392
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,000
I don’t think that’s the case for me.

393
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,320
I don’t think so.

394
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,960
But you said yourself that Arc is acting weird.

395
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,160
Yes, he is, but it doesn’t mean he likes me.

396
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,240
We must find a way to prove it.

397
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,440
Really?

398
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,320
What do we do?

399
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,840
What do we do, Po?

400
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,440
What? Hey!

401
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Ouch!

402
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,000
Why are we crouching?

403
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,720
What?

404
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,480
Hey, Arm!

405
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,200
What are you doing there?

406
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,280
Oh.

407
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,840
You saw me.

408
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,640
I’m glad I ran into you.

409
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,440
Can we talk?

410
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,440
It’s about Arc.

411
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,560
I’m sorry, A-ngun.

412
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,480
He hasn’t accepted your friend request, right?

413
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,440
I tried my best, but he won’t accept anyone.

414
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,680
I’m sorry.

415
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,160
Arm, I’m not mad at you about that.

416
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,920
Oh?

417
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,040
If not that, what are you mad at me about?

418
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,680
Well,
you wouldn’t tell me Arc likes you.

419
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,160
That’s crazy, A-ngun.

420
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,720
That’s impossible.

421
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,040
How can Arc like me?

422
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,800
Besides, Arc is so handsome and cool.

423
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,120
He might already be dating someone

424
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,720
but just doesn’t want to tell people

425
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,320
because he’s scared of losing popularity.

426
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
Hmm.

427
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,160
But I’ve never seen him close with anyone

428
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,000
like he’s with you, Arm.

429
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,640
That’s because I’m in his peer mentoring group.

430
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,640
You don’t have to believe me

431
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,600
but it doesn’t hurt to prove it.

432
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,640
Every member of the Perfect 10 Liners
has a pair of symbolic magnetic bracelets.

433
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,720
Can I have some?

434
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,640
Yes, this is too much.

435
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,840
They can give one to the person they like.

436
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,640
If Arc still has both bracelets,

437
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,880
it means he’s not taken.

438
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,360
Arm.

439
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,480
Is something wrong?

440
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,280
Oh, nothing.

441
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,640
Nice bracelet.

442
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,520
This one?

443
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,880
Shit!

444
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,640
Oh, no!

445
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,520
What’s wrong, Pun?

446
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,880
I forgot to take Arm to get his group bracelet.

447
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,240
Oh.

448
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Group bracelet?

449
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,480
It’s a tradition that’s been passed down in our group.

450
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,560
As a senior, I need to get you one
to show that you’re fully part of the group.

451
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,440
I forgot.

452
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,200
Is it that serious?

453
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,720
Yeah.

454
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,520
Stop exaggerating, Pun.

455
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,520
Come on.

456
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,600
By the way, where’s Tawan?

457
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,080
Is he out of the forest?

458
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,840
I heard he opened a place by the sea near Rayong.

459
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,640
Once I’m free, I’ll take you there
so you can get yours.

460
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,840
Can’t we order it online?

461
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,520
No, it won’t be sacred.

462
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,320
Oh.

463
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,000
What are you daydreaming about?

464
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,440
Are you done practicing?

465
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,840
I have somewhere to be after this.

466
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,120
Where are you hurrying off to?

467
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,600
The Bang On bar.

468
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,120
I’m meeting my classmates there.

469
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,400
Come on.

470
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,120
It’s just practice
and you’re already out of breath.

471
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,560
I guess there’s no way you’re going to win.

472
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,320
I should practice how to lose face.

473
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,000
What pose should I strike?

474
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,480
Oh, we lost.

475
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:10,960
Oh.

476
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
What if I win?

477
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,560
What will you give me?

478
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,720
If you win, you can have anything.

479
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,520
Ask away.

480
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,880
Just make sure you win.

481
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,800
Okay.

482
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,600
Once I know what I want, I’ll tell you.

483
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,440
Hey, are you leaving already?

484
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,320
No, I’m going to buy you some tissues.

485
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,520
No need.

486
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,040
I have a towel in my bag.

487
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,240
If Arc still has both bracelets,

488
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,440
it means he’s not taken.

489
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,560
But even if he has both bracelets,

490
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,240
it doesn’t mean he likes me.

491
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,240
Once you’ve proved it,

492
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,400
you test it.

493
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,160
Arm, can I get my towel now?

494
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
Yes.

495
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,840
Here.

496
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,440
Even though my bag is cluttered,

497
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,280
my heart is not.

498
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,280
Who said that?

499
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,200
See for yourself.

500
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,960
What’s he talking about?

501
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,200
Over here, Arc.

502
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,360
By the way,

503
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,840
can I ask you something?

504
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,800
What is it?

505
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,440
Who’s Tawan?

506
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,920
Why do you ask?

507
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,720
Pun made him sound so mysterious.

508
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,240
It’s actually nothing.

509
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,400
He’s just the first member of Perfect 10 Liners.

510
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,280
So, why do we get our bracelets made with him?

511
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,640
Does he move around a lot?

512
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,920
Tawan is actually independent.

513
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,160
After graduation, he’s been traveling

514
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,040
and opened a shop selling photos
and handmade items.

515
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,280
The bracelet thing was his idea
to help seniors and juniors bond quickly.

516
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,160
Ah.

517
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,960
So when Pun takes me to get my bracelet,

518
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,320
it’s like going on vacation, right?

519
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,120
That’s right.

520
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,240
You’re such a clever puppy.

521
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,520
What brand of dog food do you eat?

522
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,200
Hey!

523
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,320
I’m not a dog.

524
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,080
Arm!

525
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,120
I’m coming!

526
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,520
I’m leaving then.

527
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,320
Bye.

528
00:26:59,320 --> 00:26:59,880
Okay.

529
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,560
Just a moment!

530
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,840
Pun, can I have Tawan’s shop address?

531
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,760
This song is for those who’ve been hurt
over and over again.

532
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,760
Sing along if you can!

533
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,480
Ah.

534
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,920
Yes!

535
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,680
This song is my favorite!

536
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,320
Cheers!

537
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,440
Cheers!

538
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,480
Cheers!

539
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,280
Hey, guys.

540
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,240
Bottoms up?

541
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,080
Bottoms up?

542
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Wanna do it?

543
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,440
Sure!

544
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,720
Let’s go!

545
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,000
I said let go of me!

546
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,920
Let go of me!

547
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,640
Damn it, let go!

548
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,240
Sand! Arm!

549
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,440
Hey!

550
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,920
Guy is getting beaten.

551
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,440
Huh?

552
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,800
What’s going on?

553
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,120
It’s Guy!

554
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,280
Shit! Let’s go!

555
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,920
Stop it, assholes!

556
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,720
Your friend was asking for it.

557
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,600
Calm down, bro.

558
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,880
Let’s talk nicely.

559
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,680
I warned him to stay away from my girl.

560
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,960
This is the least of what he deserves.

561
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,280
If your girl didn’t play along,
there wouldn’t be a problem.

562
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,520
Shit!

563
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,880
Shit!

564
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,240
Shit!

565
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,480
Sand!

566
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Arm!

567
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,520
Arm!

568
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,960
Arm!

569
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,480
Arm!

570
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,040
Hey.

571
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,880
He’s awake.

572
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,920
Arm.

573
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,080
Hey.

574
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,760
Don’t touch it.

575
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,280
Arc.

576
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,960
You’re lucky you woke up.

577
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,320
I almost called the monks for your funeral.

578
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,160
Did you bring me to the hospital?

579
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,080
This is hell.

580
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,920
Look around.

581
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,440
Look.

582
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,120
I’ll let you win today.

583
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,040
I don’t have the energy to bicker with you.

584
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,240
Oh, where are my friends?

585
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,360
After getting their wounds dressed, they left.

586
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,760
What about the guys who hurt my friends?

587
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,080
They’re at the police station.

588
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,520
Slowly.

589
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Are you okay?

590
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,880
Yes.

591
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,200
Can I go back to my dorm now?

592
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,000
The doctor said you can once you wake up

593
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,240
but are you sure you’re okay?

594
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,560
Does it still hurt anywhere?

595
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,880
I’m fine.

596
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,800
If all’s fine, please excuse Pun and me.

597
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,760
Okay.

598
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,720
You’re going to take it from here, right?

599
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,400
By the way, Arm,

600
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,160
if you guys want to go to Bang On again soon,
you must have me or Arc accompany you.

601
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,160
Don’t go by yourselves, got it?

602
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,040
Yes, Jet.

603
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,080
Thank you.

604
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,240
We’re going then.

605
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,000
See you.

606
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,640
Get well soon.

607
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,560
Please take care of him.

608
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,560
See you.

609
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
I’m sorry.

610
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,360
So you realize what you did was wrong?

611
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,000
Yes,

612
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,000
but I wasn’t that wrong, was I?

613
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,200
I didn’t start the fight.

614
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,400
But you look the worst out of all of them.

615
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,800
Can you take me home?

616
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,440
Sure.

617
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,040
But you’re sleeping in my room tonight.

618
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,080
Why?

619
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,880
Look at yourself.

620
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,440
You look like a dog that got hit by a car.

621
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,960
If you go back to your dorm and the guards see you,
they'll report it to the uni. What will you do then?

622
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,600
You’re clever as a dog.

623
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,440
Do you want another red bruise
on the other side of your face?

624
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,840
Don’t scold me.

625
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,360
I’m injured.

626
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,440
Let’s go so you can rest.

627
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,440
Come on.

628
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,720
Look at you.

629
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,080
Ouch!

630
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,280
Can I sleep on your bed?

631
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,080
Yeah.

632
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,680
Thank you for coming to help me.

633
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,520
It’s okay.

634
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,760
My friends were the ones who helped talk it out.

635
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,200
Yeah

636
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,440
but I still want to thank you.

637
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,360
Don’t worry.

638
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,280
Anyone who hurts you,

639
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,240
I’ll make them pay.

640
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,760
That’s so cruel.

641
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,520
Now I feel lucky to be in the Perfect 10 Liners.

642
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
By the way, Arm.

643
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,320
Hmm?

644
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,240
You told me that if I won the football game,

645
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,120
you’d give me anything I ask for.

646
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,960
Wow, you’re bringing that up now?

647
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,800
Please don’t ask for anything expensive.

648
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,240
I barely have enough money left to eat this month.

649
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,320
It doesn’t need money.

650
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,760
Oh?

651
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,800
I’m just asking you to keep yourself safe.

652
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,280
I’m going to take a shower.

653
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,760
Ouch!

654
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,320
Hey.

655
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,760
Are you awake?

656
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,160
Yes.

657
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,480
What time is your class?

658
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,760
In the afternoon.

659
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,640
Then get up and take a shower

660
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,560
so you can eat.

661
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,840
Can I go back to my room and change?

662
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,960
I’m afraid I won’t look handsome in your uniform.

663
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,320
Yeah, your body is short.

664
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,640
Yes, I’m short.

665
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,480
Are you happy now?

666
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,920
Being sarcastic is not cute.

667
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,840
Take a shower here, then I’ll drive you
to your dorm so you can change.

668
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,920
Fine.

669
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,360
Wow, did you really make all of these?

670
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,480
Yeah, with my feet.

671
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,680
Your feet are amazing.

672
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,880
Do you want to kiss them?

673
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,360
Come on.

674
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,880
Am I not in a bad enough shape already?

675
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,480
Can I eat now?

676
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,160
Why don’t you try sitting still?

677
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,440
Maybe it will fly into your mouth.

678
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,480
What will fly?

679
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,400
My feet.

680
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,880
I’m going to eat then.

681
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,600
Go ahead.

682
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:02,880
Hey.

683
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,720
What happened to your hand?

684
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,280
I don’t know.

685
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,040
It must’ve been when you fell in the field.

686
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,960
Probably.

687
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,800
How’s your knee?

688
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,600
Is it healed now?

689
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,960
It’s not as bad as the wound on your head.

690
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,560
Hurry up and eat so we can go to your dorm.

691
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,120
I only slept over for one night

692
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,600
and you’re already annoyed with me.

693
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,920
Thank you for the ride.

694
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,040
I’m going now.

695
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,400
Wait.

696
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,720
Arc?

697
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,920
Oh, shit.

698
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,560
Here’s the second book.

699
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,160
But you said you wanted me
to finish the first one first.

700
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,800
Do you want it or not?

701
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,880
Yes, I do.

702
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,000
Ahem.

703
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Did you let your sweetheart borrow this book?

704
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,480
What are you talking about?

705
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,760
Here.

706
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,960
“Anol’s person.”

707
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,240
Who’s that?

708
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,080
Tell me.

709
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,080
I wrote that for you.

710
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,480
I’m leaving.

711
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,920
Arm!

712
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,400
- You’re still alive!
- You’re still alive!

713
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,880
You’re still as handsome as ever.

714
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,120
He’s still alive.

715
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
Survived, but disoriented.

716
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,160
Hey.

717
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,720
Hey.

718
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,840
Shit.

719
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,880
What’s he daydreaming about?

720
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,120
Does he have a concussion?

721
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,520
Your friend doesn’t even have a brain
to get affected.

722
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,920
Right, I forgot.

723
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,240
Shut up.

724
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,800
I’m this hurt, but when I opened my eyes,
I saw none of your faces.

725
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,480
Damn it.

726
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,120
But you saw Arc’s face, right?

727
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,960
What are you talking about?

728
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,040
How do you know I was with Arc?

729
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,920
Because once he paid the fine,
he rushed to the hospital.

730
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,400
He also sent us away
and told us he’d take care of you himself.

731
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,640
The fine?

732
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,240
What fine?

733
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,200
The fine for physical assault.

734
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,360
Physical assault?

735
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,680
Who assaulted who?

736
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,240
So he was with you all night
but didn’t tell you anything?

737
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,200
No.

738
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,640
Hey!

739
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,680
You’re the one who hurt Arm, right?

740
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,560
I’m sorry.

741
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
I didn’t know he was your guy.

742
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,360
You better remember next time.

743
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,200
Hey.

744
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,880
Is the charge settled?

745
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,200
Yeah,

746
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,480
I’ve paid the fine.

747
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,800
I thought you stopped being hot-headed.

748
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,200
I tried to calm down, but…

749
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,360
But Arm was hurt, right?

750
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,800
That’s why you couldn’t let it slide.

751
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,480
He’s my peer mentee’s mentee.

752
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,440
What was I supposed to do?

753
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,760
Your important peer mentee’s mentee.

754
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,320
Hey.

755
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,600
Why are you pressuring me, Warm?

756
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,760
I haven’t seen you like this in a long while.

757
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,920
What do you mean?

758
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,880
I’m normal.

759
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,320
Alright.

760
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,120
If you say so.

761
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,840
By the way, did anyone hear about last night?

762
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,760
You mean the way
you beat the crap out of that guy at the bar?

763
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,520
Warm!

764
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,160
Why did you have to say it so loud?

765
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:11,880
Are you afraid your junior will find out?

766
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,640
It’s too late for that.

767
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,560
Isn’t your class in the afternoon?

768
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,720
Why are you early?

769
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,960
You didn’t hurt your hand by falling in the field,
but by punching someone, right?

770
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,400
Why ask if you already know?

771
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,080
Why didn’t you tell me last night
that you dealt with those guys?

772
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,240
Are you okay?

773
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,920
It’s just a brawl.

774
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,640
I’ve paid the fine already.

775
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,280
But you got into trouble because of me.

776
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,920
Before I do anything,
I already expect the consequences.

777
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,720
Yes, I know,

778
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,600
but it was still dangerous.

779
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,960
What if you slip up and they gang up on you?

780
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,480
I’m fine, aren’t I?

781
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,200
Arc, you’re just…

782
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,320
Do you have bruises anywhere else?

783
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,800
Hey.

784
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,840
I’m fine.

785
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,000
Are you that worried about me?

786
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,080
I can take off my shirt and let you see.

787
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,640
Hey!

788
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,160
Don’t do it, I believe you now.

789
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,880
Next time, don’t get hot-headed again, okay?

790
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,040
Fine.

791
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,240
Next time I get hot-headed,

792
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,800
I’ll save it.

793
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,840
And if I really want to punch someone,
I’ll punch your face.

794
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,040
You’re the worst.

795
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,840
Alright, I’m leaving.

796
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,640
I only came here to talk about that.

797
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,800
Wait.

798
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,800
- What?
- Where are you going?

799
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,240
I’m going to find somewhere to sleep.

800
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,440
I have class in the afternoon.

801
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,280
So you came here early in the morning

802
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,440
just to talk to me about that?

803
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,680
Yeah.

804
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,320
You want somewhere to sleep, right?

805
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,640
Hi, guys.

806
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,520
Hi.

807
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,120
The teacher for this class is not strict.

808
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,040
You can just sleep here.

809
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,160
Fine.

810
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,960
At least it’s air-conditioned.

811
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,400
Hey.

812
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,680
Sleep on the other side.

813
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,400
This side will hurt.

814
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,520
Oh, I forgot.

815
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
Whoa, look.

816
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,320
Is he just his peer mentee’s mentee?

817
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,760
I don’t know.

818
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,920
You have to wait and see.

819
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,760
What building is your class in?

820
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
The central building.

821
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,360
The central building?

822
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,040
Arc is free.

823
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,960
Do you want him to walk you there?

824
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,760
It’s okay.

825
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,720
It’s just nearby. I can walk there myself.

826
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,360
I’m going.

827
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,160
Bye.

828
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:10,920
Bye.

829
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,080
What’s wrong with you?

830
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,280
I tried to help you just now.

831
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,680
Oh.

832
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:30,840
Hey.

833
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,800
Where’s Arc?

834
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,360
We split.

835
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,960
Whose jacket are you wearing?

836
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,760
Arc’s.

837
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,440
Shit.

838
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,760
Come on.

839
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,440
You’re keeping an open secret.

840
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,360
It’s not a secret.

841
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:53,880
Right.

842
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,360
Let’s go to class, guys.

843
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,160
We’re late.

844
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,320
I’m lazy.

845
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,280
Don’t be sleepy now.

846
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,080
Sand!

847
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,160
Carry my bag.

848
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:02,640
Come on!

849
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,280
I’m not going.

850
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,360
- We’re late!
- We’re late!

851
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,600
I don’t have any energy left.

852
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,160
Arm.

853
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,000
Arm!

854
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,200
The class is over.

855
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,160
Oh.

856
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,320
Shit.

857
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,080
Do you have to watch Arc play football today?

858
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,360
I have to go every time.

859
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,920
[DON’T GO TO THE FIELD THIS EVENING.]

860
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,840
[I HAVE LAB.]

861
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,840
Well, I don’t have to go anymore.

862
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,360
Oh?

863
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,240
I’m sorry.

864
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,040
The situation was desperate, so I…

865
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,920
So you got physical.

866
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,920
No, you have to listen to the whole story.

867
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,240
Arc already told me.

868
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,840
What if something worse had happened to you?

869
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,680
Don’t do that again,

870
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,720
or I’ll really be angry.

871
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,760
So this means you’re not angry this time.

872
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,720
What a relief.

873
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,880
Stop smiling.

874
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,000
I was worried, you know?

875
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,240
Yes, I know.

876
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,200
I won’t do that again.

877
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,080
I’m sorry.

878
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,280
Does it hurt?

879
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,800
No, it’s far from my heart.

880
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,360
Okay.

881
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
Ouch!

882
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,120
Pond!

883
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,320
You said it doesn’t hurt.

884
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,520
No, this one hurts a bit.

885
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,800
But this one doesn’t hurt at all.

886
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,200
One more time?

887
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,760
I’m leaving.

888
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,480
No one’s driving me home.

889
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,360
I’m so lonely.

890
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,200
Let’s go.

891
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,400
What are you doing?

892
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,960
What are you doing here?

893
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,040
I’m here to see you.

894
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,560
I came to return your jacket.

895
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,480
I accidentally took it
but you didn’t say anything.

896
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,760
It’s only a few hundred baht.

897
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,680
I can get a new one.

898
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,400
Yes, you’re rich.

899
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,520
Are you leaving soon?

900
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,920
In a while.

901
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,080
Why do you ask?

902
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,120
Can I leave with you?

903
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,120
It was so quiet on my way here.

904
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,400
It’ll be scary late at night.

905
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,520
I’m afraid of ghosts.

906
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,760
In that case,

907
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,720
you can sleep over there while you wait.

908
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,880
I’ll wake you up once I’m done.

909
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,360
Sleep again?

910
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,440
I just woke up earlier.

911
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,600
But I’ve never seen him close with anyone

912
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,680
like he’s with you, Arm.

913
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,200
It can’t be true.

914
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,960
Don’t you realize that
Arc is trying to get closer to you?

915
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,640
You know that we’re a close-knit group.

916
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,080
He’s probably just looking after me
like he always does for everyone in the group.

917
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,840
But when Arc found out you were badly hurt,

918
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,480
he was so angry.

919
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,840
He was so scary

920
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,440
that even Jet didn’t even dare stop him.

921
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:18,960
Yeah.

922
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,720
Really?

923
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,280
Yes.

924
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,480
Okay.

925
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,840
Whether Arc likes you or not doesn’t matter now.

926
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,560
How do you feel about him?

927
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:33,920
Arm.

928
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:35,840
Arm.

929
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,760
We can leave now.

930
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:53,920
Arc.

931
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,360
Um,

932
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,440
Can I ask you something?

933
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:13,840
Yeah.

934
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,200
Ask away.

935
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:22,720
What you wrote on the cover of the calculus book,

936
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,920
you said it was for me.

937
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,600
What does that mean?

938
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,040
I meant exactly what I wrote.

939
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,320
What does it mean?

940
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,040
You mean I’m your person?

941
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,440
Do you want to be?

942
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,640
If you don’t answer,

943
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,960
I’ll take that as a yes.

944
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,600
You’ll get it soon.

945
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,560
No need to rush.

946
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,200
Are you avoiding me?

947
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,400
You kissed me!

948
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,800
Do you want to kiss me back?

949
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,760
You don’t sound like the Arc I know.

950
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,240
Did Arc make you so angry you’re blushing?

951
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,000
Sand,

952
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,080
you’re getting a good one.

953
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,640
I’m hitting on you.

954
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,480
Don’t you realize it at all?

955
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,240
I’m going out of town tomorrow.

956
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,480
Are you going with Arc?

957
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,200
Pun sent me Tawan’s address.

958
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,480
It’s on a beach near Bangkok.

959
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,600
Let’s play in the water.

960
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,320
Come on!

961
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,000
Arm, do you trust me?

962
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,920
I’ll lead you forward.
