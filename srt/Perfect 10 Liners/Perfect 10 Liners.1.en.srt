1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,960
The next one
is from Computer Engineering.

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,240
Let’s give him a big hand.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,320
Please introduce yourself.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
Hi. My name is Witsawa.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,800
I used to go by Warat.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,400
You can call me Wine.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,480
(My university life)

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,520
(starts off kind of confusing.)

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,840
Wine, your student code is

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,920
0682.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,280
Hey, Pun!

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,000
WINE

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,000
I didn’t bring any gifts.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,120
Let me treat you to a meal instead.

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,920
See you, Witsarut.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,040
I’m Witsawa.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,680
(I get myself a weird peer mentor.)

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,560
BANG ON POCHANA

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,480
BANG ON POCHANA

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,000
Wine!

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,280
Come here.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,200
Hey.

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,680
(No, a group of them.)

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,960
Hi.

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,640
Sit here, Wine.

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,040
(People call them…)

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,920
Welcome to Perfect 10 Liners.

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,320
Hi, Wine.

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,480
I’m Arm.

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,120
I’m Yotha’s peer mentor

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,960
and Pun’s peer mentee.

32
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,920
This is Pun.

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
She’s Arc’s peer mentee.

34
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,960
Arc is Jet’s peer mentee.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,720
Pun and Jet are a couple.

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,960
Arc and I are…

37
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,800
I’m Arc.

38
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,440
I’m Arm’s boyfriend.

39
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,320
Of course.

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,960
Arm, you explained it too quickly.

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,960
You didn’t give him time to process it.

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,160
Look, Wine.

43
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,240
All of us here

44
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,960
are in Perfect 10 Liners.

45
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,600
Yeah.

46
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,320
Yeepun and I are together.

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,280
Arc and Arm

48
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
are also together.

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,560
Yeah.

50
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,320
As for Yotha,

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,680
Hey.

52
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,720
Stop what you’re thinking.

53
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,160
I’m already with someone.

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,880
What did I miss?

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,280
And who’s this?

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,360
It’s Wine.

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,200
He’s my peer mentee.

58
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh.

59
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,080
The Perfect 10 Liners is really something.

60
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,360
I’m Gun. Nice to meet you.

61
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,320
You too.

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,280
As a new joiner,

63
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,680
you get a chance to ask us

64
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,880
one question.

65
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,040
Whatever you ask will stay on this table.

66
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,760
Why don’t you ask them if I’m cute?

67
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,440
I’ll answer that I’m so cute.

68
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,400
Come on.

69
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
Hi, everyone.

70
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,120
Hi.

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,440
Fai, I told you
to stay away from my peer mentee.

72
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,640
What? We’re brothers.

73
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,040
Your peer mentee is like my own.

74
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,800
You said your friends
were at the bar next door.

75
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,440
Yes, but my heart led me here.

76
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,440
Fai!

77
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,320
What?

78
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,200
I’m going to splash this on you.

79
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,160
Go ahead.

80
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,160
Alright, I won’t tease you anymore.

81
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,520
Just ask them what you want to know.

82
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,760
Arc and Arm,
how did you two get together?

83
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,760
This stays between us, okay?

84
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,720
But first,

85
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,120
cheers!

86
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,400
Cheers!

87
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,040
WITSAWAKAM PRASART

88
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,160
Why did you choose to study Engineering?

89
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,400
I want to gain experience in what I love.

90
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,080
I want to achieve my childhood dream
because that’s the whole meaning of life.

91
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,720
Is that the script you memorized?

92
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,880
Try solving this question.

93
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,280
Okay.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Can I do this at home?

95
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,000
There’s no need.

96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,720
That’s a question for a post-grad student.

97
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,080
I just want you to have a look,
in case you might be able to solve it.

98
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,200
Oh.

99
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,000
I see your determination.

100
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,840
Now, pitch yourself to us.

101
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,080
Why should we accept you into this faculty?

102
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,920
Alright.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,680
At school, I did so many
extracurricular activities.

104
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,920
I even ran for school president.

105
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,800
SCHOOL PRESIDENT ELECTION
Number 2.

106
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,120
Come on now!

107
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,400
Number 2.

108
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,640
Number 1!

109
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,280
You were the school president?

110
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,760
Number 2.

111
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,080
Is there a mistake?

112
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,880
Number 2.

113
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,880
Number 2.

114
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,440
Number 2, again.

115
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,360
I was a candidate,

116
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,440
but I lost the election.

117
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Oh, and I led the Buddhist chanting
at the assembly.

118
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,080
Araham Samma
Sambuddho Bhagava.

119
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,800
I also showed the 7th graders
around the school garden.

120
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,280
Let me show you how to loosen the soil.

121
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,760
Teach us how it’s done.

122
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,440
Here.

123
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,760
You do this.

124
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,280
Oh, shit!

125
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,520
Po!

126
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,760
Watch out, Sand!

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,320
There’s nothing related to Engineering.

128
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,360
Well…

129
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,280
Oh!

130
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,040
I love changing light bulbs.

131
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,360
If I get into this faculty,

132
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,720
I’ll get better at it

133
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,040
and be able to help other houses with it.

134
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,360
What does your name Anon mean?

135
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,200
Anon means, uh,

136
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,960
a person who has no debt.

137
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,480
Do you think he can make it?

138
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,440
I’m worried about him, too.

139
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,320
He’s usually confused.

140
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,240
I know, right?

141
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,320
Gosh!

142
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,480
Sand. Po.

143
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,520
What did they ask you?

144
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,720
How was it?

145
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,680
Well…

146
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,280
What?

147
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,000
Just say it.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,640
Excuse me.

149
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,960
What’s your name?

150
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,360
Oh, my name is…

151
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,440
This is my friend, Arm.

152
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,040
Arm, I see.

153
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,040
Yes.

154
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
What faculty are you in, Arm?

155
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,840
Oh.

156
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,760
If he passed the interview,
it’d be Electrical Engineering.

157
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,800
Did you pass the interview?

158
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,800
Why don’t you guys ask me that
on my graduation day?

159
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,760
Did you hear what I did?

160
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,720
I passed, guys!

161
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,600
So you’re in Electrical Engineering, right?

162
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,000
Well, yes.

163
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,360
Can I take a photo of you
and post it on the Engineer Cute Boy page?

164
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,680
To make people swoon a bit.

165
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,560
Oh, well,

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,200
are you sure that’s a good idea?

167
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,600
Of course.

168
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,640
You look so cute.

169
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,360
You’ll definitely get a lot of likes.

170
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,360
Oh, okay then.

171
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,480
Your shirt is not wrinkled.

172
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,880
It’s perfectly neat.

173
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,360
What about my hair?

174
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,680
Your hair is perfect.

175
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,560
Ready?

176
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,360
Hold this for me.

177
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,360
I’m ready.

178
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,520
Can I take a photo of Arm alone?

179
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,320
Oh.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,840
Am I not handsome?

181
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,000
You’re the most handsome, dude.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You’re the most handsome.

183
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,160
Ready?

184
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,360
One, two, three.

185
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,840
ADORABLE ARM FROM ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
/ ADMIN P.

186
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
SO CUTE! THIS IS THE ONE!

187
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,720
IS THERE ANYONE CUTER THAN HIM?

188
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,120
I APPLY TO BE HIS MOMMY!

189
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,440
Hey!

190
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,840
Wow!

191
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,400
This is freedom, guys!

192
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,200
This is the first day I feel like a grown-up.

193
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,520
You guys are blocking my way.

194
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,800
Hey.

195
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,280
Your room is that way.

196
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,120
Go.

197
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,760
I’m not close with my roommate yet.

198
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,400
You will be soon.

199
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,720
Hey!

200
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,440
I’m going to sleep here.

201
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
I promise I won’t snore.

202
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,200
I don’t believe you.

203
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,760
Me neither.

204
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,440
Just go!

205
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,960
Come on!

206
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,840
Are you guys really my friends?

207
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,960
May I have the next freshy on stage?

208
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,080
Sand, get your hands off me.

209
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,880
Who do you want as your peer mentor?

210
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,960
I don’t know.

211
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,880
What about you?

212
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,080
Me?

213
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,800
That senior with a bun.

214
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,440
I think she’s my type.

215
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,480
Cute.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,360
Slap. Slap.

217
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,640
Why the hell did you slap me, Po?

218
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,080
You’re not supposed to find a partner,

219
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,600
but a peer mentor group to join.

220
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,840
Yeah, Sand, he’s right.

221
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,720
You’re just as bad.

222
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,920
You guys in this line, please stand up.

223
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,440
Hi.

224
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,120
I’m Anon Phuwakomol.

225
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,400
My nickname is Arm.

226
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,320
Please go ahead and draw lots.

227
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,360
Here.

228
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,400
Alright, Arm,
your peer mentor’s code is

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,040
0498.

230
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,440
Yes!

231
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,800
Is that the Perfect 10 Liners?

232
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,880
They just keep winning.

233
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,000
Arm!

234
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,200
Hey, Arm.

235
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,520
Welcome to Perfect 10 Liners.

236
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,920
You remember me, right?

237
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
I do.

238
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,080
What a small world.

239
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,640
Here’s a gift from me
and Jet, our 4th-year senior.

240
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,720
You get this too.

241
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,880
Open it.

242
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,840
A tile grout?

243
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,720
From your 3rd-year senior.

244
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,320
My first day was already chaotic.

245
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,200
Pun, why are we called Perfect 10 Liners?

246
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,880
Because we have perfect faces.

247
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,720
Do I have a perfect face?

248
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
Just kidding.

249
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,600
There are just many coincidences.

250
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,400
Soon, you’ll find out.

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,600
Ah.

252
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,800
Oh, by the way,

253
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
the photo I took of you and posted on the page

254
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,040
got over a thousand likes.

255
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,000
That many?

256
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,880
Yes.

257
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,720
I ran an ad on it.

258
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,680
Oh.

259
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,320
Look at that face.

260
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,280
You don’t know the Engineer Cute Boy page, do you?

261
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,680
Let me tell you about it.

262
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,200
HERE’S THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD FOR THE PAGE.

263
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,160
I promised myself that before I step down,

264
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,240
I’d teach my peer mentee
to take over the page admin role.

265
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,720
Luckily,
you joined us in the Perfect 10 Liners.

266
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,320
So, please help me.

267
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Well,

268
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,160
Please.

269
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,400
We only have hundreds of thousands of followers.

270
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,280
It’s not hard.

271
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,160
It shouldn’t be hard.

272
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,760
YOU HAVE A NEW NOTIFICATION.
YOU HAVE A NEW NOTIFICATION.

273
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,000
Damn!

274
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,760
What’s going on?

275
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,160
ADMIN, PLEASE POST A PHOTO OF ARC
FROM ENGINEERING.

276
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,000
I HAVEN’T SEEN YOU POST HIM.

277
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,280
HE’S THE HOTTEST!!!

278
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,320
Arc from Engineering?

279
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,120
Who’s that?

280
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,480
What do I have to do?

281
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,320
If anyone suggests a hot Engineering guy,

282
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,760
you just post his photo

283
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,560
and write a little caption.

284
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,160
Does this mean you agree to do it?

285
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,280
Well…

286
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,880
But one guy is an exception.

287
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,120
You cannot post him.

288
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,840
Oh?

289
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
I cannot…?

290
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,680
I cannot do what?

291
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,480
Whatever.

292
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
I’ll just post this photo.

293
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:07,000
LET’S HIT THE FIELD.
#HOTFOOTBALLPLAYERSPOTTED /ADMIN A.

294
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,920
Come on!

295
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Go!

296
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,760
Hey!

297
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,640
Arc!

298
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,800
Warm!

299
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,600
Strike a goal!

300
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,680
Yes!

301
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,720
Woo!

302
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,400
Woo!

303
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,600
Here.

304
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,680
Thank you.

305
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,080
Oh, shit. Look at this.

306
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,840
Shit.

307
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,160
Pond. Copp. What’s wrong?

308
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,120
Your faces look as if someone died.

309
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,520
If they’re not dead, they’re almost dead.

310
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,760
Look.

311
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Arc, have you seen this?

312
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Damn.

313
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
This guy is so popular.

314
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,120
PLEASE DELETE MY PHOTO FROM THE PAGE.

315
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,320
I DIDN’T GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO POST IT.

316
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,240
I’M SORRY I DIDN’T ASK FOR PERMISSION.

317
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,040
I WANT TO PROTECT MY PRIVACY.

318
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,160
I DON’T WANT ANYONE TO PUBLISH MY PHOTOS
OR CRITICIZE ME.

319
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,480
Damn.

320
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,160
Why is he so angry?

321
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,480
DELETE IT RIGHT NOW.

322
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,600
DELETE IT!!!!!!!

323
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,880
I SAID DELETE IT!!!!

324
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,840
They should know better than to mess with Arc.

325
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,320
DELETE IT!!!!!!!
Fine, I’ll delete it!

326
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,120
DELETE IT!!!!!!!
Damn it!

327
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,640
What a jerk.

328
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,000
We’re back.

329
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,200
Hey, Perfect 10 Liners member.

330
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,760
When you’re famous, don’t forget me.

331
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,120
Hey, Sand.

332
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,680
Hmm?

333
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,160
Is Perfect 10 Liners really that big?

334
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,680
Whoa.

335
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,520
You really don’t know anything.

336
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Their good looks carry on
from generation to generation.

337
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,000
But now that it’s reached you,

338
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,760
it may have dropped a bit.

339
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,840
Damn, Po.

340
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,360
What?

341
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,240
Are you picking on me?

342
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,040
I’m not.

343
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,280
Seriously.

344
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,000
Listen, guys.

345
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,520
Yeah?

346
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,840
Let me tell you something.

347
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,360
Okay.

348
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,720
What era are we in?

349
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Looking good and dressing well means nothing.

350
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,680
You know,
I stopped judging people based on that a long time ago.

351
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,400
You two should start doing the same.

352
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,560
How cool.

353
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,000
That’s deep.

354
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,080
That’s on point.

355
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,640
That’s so on point.

356
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,920
Listen.

357
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,520
Okay.

358
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,800
About my seemingly perfect peer mentoring group,
Pun said it’s all in people’s heads.

359
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,720
Damn it.

360
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,360
Who does he think he is?

361
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Does he think he can just talk shit to anyone?

362
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,960
He looks…

363
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,080
He looks good.

364
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,960
But so what?

365
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,920
Being good-looking but foul-mouthed
doesn’t make it okay.

366
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,640
Look, I’m sorry.

367
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,760
You didn’t have to scold me that harshly.

368
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,000
Anyway, don’t compliment me like that again

369
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,440
or I’ll get shy.

370
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,320
So handsome!

371
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,840
What?

372
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,280
That’s not me?

373
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,560
So what if he’s handsome?

374
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,840
He’s such a…

375
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,440
Bad boy.

376
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,040
As expected of his “beyond the star” title.

377
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,600
Look at these bulky muscles.

378
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,800
Bulky for sure.

379
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,000
Sand, what’s “beyond the star”?

380
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,520
It means more handsome than the star.

381
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,640
Arc is more handsome than the campus star.

382
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
So people call him “beyond the star”.

383
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,960
If he really were more handsome than the campus star,

384
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,560
he’d have won the title, right?

385
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,240
Arc prefers peace

386
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,200
so he didn’t join the contest.

387
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,680
Ugh.

388
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,360
Does he think acting mysterious makes him look cool?

389
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,840
Hey, enough about him.

390
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,720
What have you done?

391
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,280
I’ve been meaning to talk to you.

392
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,160
I don’t think I’m fit to manage the page.

393
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,920
Oh, about that.

394
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,840
I get it, Arm.

395
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,960
Well, then.

396
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,760
But you’ll get used to it.

397
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,440
Just don’t post any photos of Arc

398
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,200
and you’ll be fine.

399
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,080
Trust me.

400
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,320
But…

401
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,200
Stop it.

402
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,440
I didn’t ask you here to talk about this.

403
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,760
Oh?

404
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,040
I heard some seniors
tried to convince you to compete for campus star.

405
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,480
Why did you say no?

406
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,360
I don’t think I’m suitable for that.

407
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,840
Why not?

408
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,280
You’re so handsome, Arm.

409
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,360
The seniors say you’re the most suitable.

410
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,920
But I don’t think I am.

411
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,480
You’re just like Arc, you know?

412
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,440
Huh?

413
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,120
Jet told me that back then

414
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,760
the seniors tried to convince Arc
to compete for campus star too,

415
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,320
but he said no.

416
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,360
You’re acting exactly like him now.

417
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,280
Hey, guys.

418
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,880
Hey.

419
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,360
Have a seat.

420
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,080
This is Jet, the 4th-year senior in our group.

421
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,320
He’s my boyfriend.

422
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,280
Hi.

423
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,200
Hi.

424
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,960
Feel free to order anything you want.

425
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,800
Don’t hold back.

426
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,840
It’s my treat.

427
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,920
Isn’t he generous?

428
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,800
Hey, Pun, where’s…

429
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,680
Sorry. I just finished my football practice.

430
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,120
Shit!

431
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,880
Shit!

432
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,520
Shit!

433
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,440
What the hell?

434
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,520
I’m sorry.

435
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,880
Why didn’t you tell me Arc is in our group?

436
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,520
I thought you knew.

437
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,800
I’m sorry.

438
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,440
Just sit properly and stop being annoying.

439
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,480
Pun.

440
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,240
Yes?

441
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,120
Have you got any updates for me?

442
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,000
About the page admin?

443
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,400
Oh, shit!

444
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,680
When I find them,

445
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,800
I’m going to beat the crap out of them.

446
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,480
Take it easy, bro.

447
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,880
The junior probably didn’t mean it.

448
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,600
The junior?

449
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,840
Uh…

450
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,160
The uncle.

451
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,840
It could be an uncle or an auntie.

452
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,600
I don’t know.

453
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,280
It’s probably an uncle.

454
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,400
I don’t know.

455
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,960
Whatever. Just wait till I find them.

456
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,640
I’m going to smash their face.

457
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,080
Hey, calm down.

458
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
You’re scaring him. Look.

459
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Are you cold, Arm?

460
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,040
Uh, yes.

461
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,600
I mean, no.

462
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,000
I’ll be right back.

463
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,720
I’m going to the restroom.

464
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,160
Oh.

465
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,120
That’s just who Arc is.

466
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,480
He’s foul-mouthed

467
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,080
but he’s actually kind.

468
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,320
Really?

469
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,960
Right, babe?

470
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,440
Yeah.

471
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,760
That’s right.

472
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,360
I’m happy.

473
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,400
I think you’ll get along with us really well.

474
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,320
Yeah.

475
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,760
If you need any help, just let us know.

476
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,400
We're a tight-knit group.

477
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,560
I will, Jet.

478
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,720
I have to go.

479
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,040
Bye, Jet. Bye, Pun.

480
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,280
And what’s your name again?

481
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,200
His name is Arm.

482
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,640
Arc and Arm.

483
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,880
Arm and Arc.

484
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,280
Your names sound similar.

485
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Your first names are also similar.

486
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,400
Yours is Anon, isn’t it?

487
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,080
It’s Anon.

488
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,680
And yours is Anol, right?

489
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,160
Really?

490
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,560
Do they have similar meanings?

491
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,680
What does your name mean again?

492
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,480
Well, it means,

493
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,520
a person who has no debt.

494
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,200
Oh, a person who has no debt.

495
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,920
Why are you laughing?

496
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,000
Our names are similar,

497
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,640
so their meanings should be similar too, right?

498
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,920
My name means God of Fire.

499
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,200
God of Fire.

500
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,960
Thanks for this.

501
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,120
Keep it.

502
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,160
I don’t like wearing anything after anyone.

503
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,960
I can’t stand the perfume.

504
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,680
But…

505
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,440
And I don’t like anyone who talks back.

506
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,320
Sure.

507
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,240
Hey.

508
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,920
You’re going to your condo, right, Arc?

509
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,160
You’ll be passing the university.

510
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,640
Please give Arm a ride.

511
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,320
It’s okay, Pun.

512
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,640
I don’t want my perfume to stick to his car.

513
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,000
You’re getting on my nerves.

514
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,280
Have you heard of the saying,

515
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,560
“the most dangerous place is the safest one?”

516
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,960
Go with him.

517
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,040
But, Pun.

518
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,000
Please give him a ride.

519
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,680
No.

520
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,880
I just had my car washed.

521
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,000
I’m leaving.

522
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,560
We’re a tight-knit group, huh, Jet?

523
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,200
You guys will bond over time.

524
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,520
Don’t worry.

525
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,800
Damn it!

526
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,960
I’m so freaking pissed!

527
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,920
Hey, you’re back.

528
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,200
Do you want to play this game with me?

529
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,520
I’m so pissed!

530
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,160
He’s freaking foul-mouthed!

531
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,880
Asshole!

532
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,920
Foul-mouthed idiot!

533
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,520
As if his shirt smells good!

534
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,320
It freaking stinks!

535
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,960
Damn it!

536
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,480
I’m so pissed!

537
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,480
Po!

538
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,240
Po! Are you okay?

539
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,280
Breathe! Are you okay?

540
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,920
Breathe!

541
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,640
Breathe!

542
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,240
Po!

543
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,000
This one is good.

544
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,880
Go ahead.

545
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,440
Hey, Arm!

546
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,680
She’s calling me.

547
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,280
Hey!

548
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,240
No, she’s calling Arm.

549
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,920
Sorry.

550
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,440
I thought you were going to say no to this.

551
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,520
Well, I changed my mind.

552
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,080
Why?

553
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,080
I have my reasons.

554
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,800
What’s with the harsh tone?

555
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,480
I have to go.

556
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,320
Alright, do your best.

557
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,280
Cheer me on.

558
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,600
He wants us to cheer for him.

559
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,720
Let’s each carry a sign.

560
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,600
Thank you.

561
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
Next, please.

562
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,920
Hi. I’m A-ngun Arisara Metasiri.

563
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,880
Civil Engineering major.

564
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,320
Next, please.

565
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,280
Woo!

566
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,080
That’s my friend!

567
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,800
Go, buddy!

568
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,600
You’re so handsome!

569
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,120
Sorry.

570
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,160
Hi.

571
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,520
I’m Arm Anon Phuwakomol.

572
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,840
Representative from Electrical Engineering.

573
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,360
He’s my friend!

574
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,320
Arm!

575
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,360
What?

576
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,120
Turn around.

577
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,920
What are you saying?

578
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,120
Oh, okay.

579
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,280
Turn around.

580
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,080
Arm!

581
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,040
Po, my leg!

582
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,720
Does it hurt?

583
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Does it hurt?

584
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,880
Hey!

585
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,440
I just fell off a stage, not a building.

586
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,040
You’re right.

587
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,720
Yeah.

588
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,800
Are you okay?

589
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,320
I’m fine.

590
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,280
Just a bruise on my knee.

591
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,520
Is my friend’s knee okay?

592
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,800
Po! Sand!

593
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,520
Is it broken?

594
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,960
Ouch!

595
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,320
My bruise!

596
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,800
Is it broken?

597
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,520
Ouch!

598
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,800
How’s that?

599
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Damn it.

600
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,960
My knee isn’t broken.

601
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,840
But my face is in pieces.

602
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,680
Pun.

603
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,280
Yeah?

604
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,920
Do I still have to compete?

605
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,680
Oh, you don’t have to.

606
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,680
Why not?

607
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,600
They don’t think I have potential anymore?

608
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,120
It’s not that.

609
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,440
Are you done?

610
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,120
Pun,

611
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,520
I can actually get a ride with my friends.

612
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,160
You didn’t have to bother Arc.

613
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,960
Three people on one bike is dangerous.

614
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,240
Go with Arc.

615
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,880
But, Pun.

616
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,920
Don’t worry about being the page admin.

617
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
If you and I don’t say anything,

618
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,360
Arc isn’t going to find out.

619
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,400
Come on.

620
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,600
Don't act suspicious.

621
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,320
Just go.

622
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,800
Ride with Arc.

623
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,040
Please take care of him.

624
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,680
Safe trip.

625
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,040
See you.

626
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,640
Hey.

627
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,640
Do you think that by staring at my face,

628
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,200
you’ll magically fly into my car?

629
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,080
Seriously, Arc?

630
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,200
I was going to thank you,

631
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,520
but now I take it back.

632
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,680
If you don’t want to do this,

633
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,200
I can get a ride with my friends.

634
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,280
Let’s go, Po!

635
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,040
Hey!

636
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,000
- Damn it, Po!
- See you, Arm!

637
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:40,840
Sand!

638
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,440
Po!

639
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,760
See you?

640
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,240
Po! What about me?

641
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,200
Damn it!

642
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,760
Try staring at my face a little longer.

643
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,920
Maybe you’ll be able to fly into my car.

644
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,520
Aren’t you worried my perfume will stick to your car seat?

645
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,960
You’re not wearing your perfume today.

646
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,760
How much longer are you going to stand there?

647
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,320
Wait.

648
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,840
I gave you a ride just to keep the tradition.

649
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,400
Our group always takes care of each other like this.

650
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,200
Right.

651
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,320
I guess I’m not used to it yet.

652
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,480
If you don’t want to owe me anything,

653
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,680
just find a way to return the favor.

654
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,800
I didn’t ask you to give me a ride.

655
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,640
Look into the Engineer Cute Boy admin
and find out who they are.

656
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,480
Oh,

657
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
why do you want to know so much?

658
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,880
You should learn to let it go.

659
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,640
Stop asking questions.

660
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
Once we find that person,

661
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,280
you must help me deal with them.

662
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,720
Of course.

663
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,800
I have to go.

664
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,000
Bye.

665
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,840
What’s he so afraid of?

666
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,360
One here.

667
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,560
I’m going to put this here.

668
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,360
59.

669
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,720
Hey, Arc.

670
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,720
Where have you been?

671
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,240
It’s not fun playing this with just the three of us.

672
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,360
Come and join us.

673
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,160
What’s up?

674
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,560
Is everything alright?

675
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,080
Hey, guys.

676
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,640
I want my keycard back.

677
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,200
Next time you want to come over,
just give me a heads-up.

678
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,720
Are you serious?

679
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,200
Yeah.

680
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:07,800
What?

681
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,000
You said we could make ourselves at home here.

682
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,880
Yeah.

683
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
Come on, guys.

684
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,160
It’s not often that he finds what he likes.

685
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,680
Let our friend get his room ready.

686
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
What?

687
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,880
Damn it!

688
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,000
I’m so freaking pissed!

689
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,960
What makes Arc think he’s so handsome and cool?

690
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,080
Asshole.

691
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,800
I wish I could just punch his face once.

692
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,280
Careful.

693
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,840
You might just end up with what you hate.

694
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,320
Yeah.

695
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,680
I definitely will.

696
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,680
I definitely will end up punching his face one day.

697
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,520
Whoa, what a thug.

698
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,720
Let’s talk about you being the page admin.

699
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,880
How long do you think you can hide it from Arc?

700
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,400
I’ll hide until the day I die.

701
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,760
I’m just his peer mentee’s mentee,

702
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,400
but he’s bullying me this much.

703
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
If he finds out I posted his photo,

704
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,120
won’t he kill me?

705
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,440
Come on. Killing people is a sin.

706
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,840
Arc won’t do that.

707
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,080
Seriously, Po?

708
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,680
What?

709
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,680
You’re my friend,
but you never take my side.

710
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,200
Yeah. How could you side with someone else?

711
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,760
What?

712
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,040
Even though Arc is more handsome,

713
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,720
He’s more handsome, you know.

714
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,320
Cooler.

715
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
Cooler, too.

716
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,480
Taller.

717
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,320
Wow, he’s tall.

718
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,040
More importantly,

719
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,240
he’s smarter.

720
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,160
Damn it!

721
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,000
Arc, you think you’re so cool, huh?

722
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,160
Please! I hope I never see you again in this life.

723
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,520
Amen!

724
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,280
Get in the car.

725
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,480
No, thank you.

726
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,920
I can go on my own.

727
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,560
You guys have classes in the same building, right?

728
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,440
Get in.

729
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,400
I told you my friends and I can get our own ride.

730
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Let’s go, guys.

731
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,080
Hey!

732
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,480
You idiots!

733
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,800
Hurry up.

734
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,360
Damn it!

735
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,320
Thank you.

736
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,240
Thank you.

737
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,040
Uh…

738
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,280
Hey, go and stop them.

739
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,840
If they keep staring at each other like this,
things might escalate.

740
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,480
Hurry. They’re about to fight each other.

741
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,920
Go.

742
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,720
Okay.

743
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,120
Uh…

744
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,640
What are you guys doing?

745
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,560
What the hell?

746
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,080
Just do it.

747
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,680
Put your hands together.

748
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,480
Bow down.

749
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,760
Damn it, Po!

750
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
Thank you for the ride.

751
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:09,960
We should go.

752
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,800
Thank you.

753
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,240
Where the hell is Arc?

754
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,000
Hey.

755
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,000
Hey.

756
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,920
Where have you been?

757
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,800
Why are you so late?

758
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,840
I woke up late.

759
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,600
Huh?

760
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,320
You? Woke up late?

761
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah.

762
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,840
So, are you joining tonight?

763
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,440
Warm has booked us a VIP table.

764
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,520
No.

765
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,320
Arc!

766
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,960
Don’t tell me you’re going with the Perfect 10 Liners!

767
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,880
Yeah. You never cared about those things before.

768
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
I just started caring recently.

769
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,720
Damn.

770
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,880
This is not our friend.

771
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,080
He’s being possessed.

772
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,160
It’s hot, right?

773
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,720
It’s cold.

774
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,360
I should’ve said hot, right?

775
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,240
What’s wrong with you guys?

776
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,640
Hey!

777
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,120
You’re being weird.

778
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,120
Is there something we don’t know?

779
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,880
Arc usually gets really into things for a while.

780
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,440
Lately, he’s just been into welcoming his junior

781
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,760
in particular.

782
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,880
Hmm?

783
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,280
Am I right?

784
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,360
Whoa!

785
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,440
This is a lot.

786
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,000
I’ve never received anything like this in my life.

787
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,880
You’re exaggerating.

788
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,960
Are you going to share these snacks with us?

789
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,880
No.

790
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,120
How rude.

791
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,720
Arm.

792
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,760
Damn. That’s our faculty's hottest girl.

793
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,960
Yes?

794
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,640
My name is A-ngun.

795
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,520
We met at the campus star contest.

796
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,360
I’m not sure if you remember me.

797
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,600
Of course, I do.

798
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,240
We keep running into each other

799
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,360
but we’ve never had a chance to talk.

800
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,200
Yeah.

801
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,080
Do you want to talk about something?

802
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,480
Well,

803
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,480
I want to get to know…

804
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,280
Nice to meet you.

805
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,320
I want to get to know Arc,

806
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,960
the senior in your group.

807
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,560
I've asked to follow him on Instagram
and sent him a friend request on Facebook,

808
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,960
but he still hasn't accepted either.

809
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,880
Can you ask him to accept me, Arm?

810
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,440
Please, Arm.

811
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,480
Please help me.

812
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,200
Please.

813
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,120
Okay.

814
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,080
I’ll tell Arc.

815
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,640
You’re the best.

816
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,680
I have to go.

817
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,720
Damn.

818
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,880
I spent a long time keeping a straight face.

819
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,920
Po, do you have a broom?

820
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,760
Why do you need it?

821
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,840
To sweep up our friend’s face.

822
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,200
Shut up.

823
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,880
Hey.

824
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,400
I want this one for myself.

825
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,640
Here you go, buddy.

826
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,240
Wait, Arc.

827
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,560
Where are you going?

828
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:22,920
What about the second half?

829
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,120
I’m thirsty.

830
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,240
I’m going to get something to drink.

831
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,320
Here.

832
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,760
You can get something super sweet or less sweet.

833
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,280
There’s even a protein shake.

834
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,360
I’m hungry too.

835
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,760
I have to go.

836
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,720
I have meatballs here.

837
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,360
Hi.

838
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,760
What drink would you like?

839
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,560
Peach tea, please.

840
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,360
Peach tea, alright.

841
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,680
What about the handsome guy behind you?

842
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,320
Just water, please.

843
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,680
Oh, shit!

844
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,360
Here’s your water and peach tea.

845
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,640
This is for the water and peach tea.

846
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,520
Why did you pay for me?

847
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,480
I just wanted to donate to a dog.

848
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,760
Here’s your change.

849
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,400
Thank you.

850
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Can’t he talk nicely to me once?

851
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,920
Hey, Arc!

852
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,800
That’s my drink!

853
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,840
Damn it!

854
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,920
Hey, Arc.

855
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
My friend A-ngun wants you

856
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,640
to accept her friend request
on Facebook and Instagram.

857
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
Can you hear me?

858
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
If you walk away,

859
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,760
I won’t accept her friend request.

860
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,080
Why are you alone?

861
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,800
My friends are in the cheering activities.

862
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,880
Then why are you here?

863
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,720
I’m lazy.

864
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,920
If you don’t participate in all the activities,

865
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,520
I won’t get my pin and gear.

866
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,800
I know that. Don’t remind me.

867
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,200
Pun said that if I joined the campus star contest,
I wouldn’t have to join the cheering activities.

868
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,440
Who knew I’d end up falling off the stage?

869
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,360
Now it’s too late
to log my participation in everything.

870
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,520
So you’re just going to loiter around?

871
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,400
I’m a human,

872
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,000
not a ghost.

873
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,880
I’m just eating
while waiting to leave with my friends.

874
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,560
I’ll give you a ride.

875
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,840
There’s no need.

876
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,120
I can go home by myself.

877
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,880
Hey!

878
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,760
Arc!

879
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,080
That’s my last piece of crispy pork.

880
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,760
I haven’t even touched it.

881
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,440
Here.

882
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,720
I’ll take a shower in your room.

883
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,600
I have some errands nearby,

884
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,680
but I’m too lazy to go back to my condo.

885
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
Why didn’t you use the shower
at the field after football?

886
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,200
The water wasn’t running.

887
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,760
I told you I’m waiting to leave with my friends.

888
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,800
Hey!

889
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,400
Hello?

890
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,040
Tell your friends you’re leaving without them.

891
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,280
Why should I do that?

892
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:07,800
Arm?

893
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,400
Come on.

894
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,920
Hello? Arm?

895
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,040
Hey, I’m leaving now.

896
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:15,840
What?

897
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,080
What did Arm say?

898
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,800
He said he’s leaving without us.

899
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,480
What? I thought he was going to wait for us.

900
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,560
That’s it.

901
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,880
You want to take a shower, right?

902
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,680
Make it quick.

903
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,720
Use your own towel.

904
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,600
This one is mine.

905
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,200
Okay.

906
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:14,800
Ugh!

907
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,160
I’m so freaking pissed!

908
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,320
Damn it!

909
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,840
Why do you keep popping up in my life?

910
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,800
Do you know how much I hate you?

911
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,880
Can I use your shower gel?

912
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,600
Fine.

913
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,440
Just use it.

914
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,120
Speak nicely.

915
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,440
I’m your senior.

916
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,160
Yes, whatever.

917
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,120
Louder.

918
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,360
Yes, whatever.

919
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,120
Damn it!

920
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,560
Go to hell!

921
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,160
You love getting on my nerves, huh?

922
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,120
Damn it!

923
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,680
I’m done.

924
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,280
Hey!

925
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,080
Why haven't you put on a shirt?

926
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,080
Which one is your bed?

927
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,440
That one.

928
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:10,840
Why do you ask?

929
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,720
Seriously, Arc?

930
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,960
What are you doing?

931
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,960
Go take a shower.

932
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,760
You’re in my way.

933
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,680
Get up!

934
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,640
It’s my bed!

935
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,160
Why don’t you speak politely, Arm?

936
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,480
No!

937
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,120
It’s my bed! Get up, Arc!

938
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,000
You’re making it dirty!

939
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,680
Why do you love messing with me so much?

940
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,320
Huh?

941
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,120
I just want to welcome my junior.

942
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,520
Sorry.

943
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,600
I’m Pun’s peer mentee,

944
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,400
not yours.

945
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,080
Got it?

946
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,680
Apart from you, Arm,

947
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,440
I don’t want to mess with anyone else.

948
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,360
It’s

949
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,240
not

950
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,720
fun.

951
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:19,840
Fine!

952
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,080
Sleep here if you want.

953
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,880
Tomorrow,

954
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,480
I’ll just wash my bedsheet.

955
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,840
If I didn’t know you and Arc hate each other,

956
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,720
Hey!

957
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,040
I’d think

958
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,880
he’s hitting on you.

959
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,680
If this is how he’s hitting on me,
I’d rather die single.

960
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,880
Where have you been?

961
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,080
That’s my business.

962
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,640
Stay out of it.

963
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,960
Hey, Pond.

964
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,280
What are you doing here?

965
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,280
Other people would have
their partner waiting for them,

966
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,880
not dumping it on
their peer mentee’s mentee like this.

967
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,880
I’m single.

968
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,120
Then hurry up and find someone.

969
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,440
I am hurrying.
