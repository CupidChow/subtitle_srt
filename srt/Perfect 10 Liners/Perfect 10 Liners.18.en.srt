1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,822
Hi.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,680
My name is Witsawa.

3
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,588
Welcome to Perfect 10 Liners.

4
00:00:04,845 --> 00:00:05,914
Perfect 10 Liners?

5
00:00:05,931 --> 00:00:06,537
Wine!

6
00:00:06,554 --> 00:00:07,302
Come in!

7
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,217
There’s one more thing I want to ask you.

8
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:10,914
Is something wrong?

9
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,457
Why do you ask?

10
00:00:12,588 --> 00:00:15,085
Because you used to be more cheerful.

11
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:16,085
My heart is broken.

12
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:21,068
Your heart is not broken.

13
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,908
It’s just a little chipped.

14
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,514
I’ll fix it.

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,565
Did I sleep or just blink?

16
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,942
SLEPT FOR ONLY AN HOUR AND A HALF!
SHOULDN’T HAVE BOTHERED.

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,600
I’M UP NOW.
I’LL BE THERE IN HALF AN HOUR.

18
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,102
What took you guys so long?

19
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,125
Wine just got back at dawn.

20
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:13,594
He was sleeping in the bathroom.

21
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,657
I almost had to break the door down to help him.

22
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:16,920
I woke up to open the door, didn’t I?

23
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,245
Why are you complaining?

24
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:19,148
Let’s go to class.

25
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,645
Hey, wait.

26
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:21,377
From now on,

27
00:03:21,388 --> 00:03:24,000
I’m not letting you guys ride in my car for free anymore.

28
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:26,000
Especially you, Wine.

29
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,542
Fine.

30
00:03:28,022 --> 00:03:29,708
I was thinking of sharing the gas bill.

31
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:30,748
No.

32
00:03:31,102 --> 00:03:33,000
I don’t want gas money.

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,605
Then what do you want?

34
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:38,028
I want you to invite Perfect 10 Liners
to be on my channel.

35
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,657
The engagement would definitely skyrocket.

36
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:43,462
Can you please help me, Wine?

37
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,371
Please, please help.

38
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:48,171
Is his group really that big of a deal?

39
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,502
Yes.

40
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:50,891
Take last night, for example.

41
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:53,417
After Arm posted a group photo and tagged Wine,

42
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,410
his followers increased to over a thousand.

43
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,765
Over a thousand?

44
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:57,640
Yeah.

45
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,257
Damn.

46
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:04,434
You’re famous now, buddy.

47
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,988
You know I don’t like this.

48
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,462
Take it easy.

49
00:04:07,485 --> 00:04:09,680
I know you don’t like getting to know new people.

50
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,394
Why so serious?

51
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,177
Wine is an introvert.

52
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,120
He gets uncomfortable around strangers.

53
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,457
Don’t worry about that.

54
00:04:19,474 --> 00:04:21,388
I’ll protect you.

55
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:25,588
Whoever tries to mess with your private life
will have to deal with me.

56
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,137
Hey, where are you going?

57
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:31,908
I won’t do it

58
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:33,365
and I can go to uni by myself.

59
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,954
Hey.

60
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,260
Hold on.

61
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:39,165
You don’t have to do it.

62
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:41,640
No need to be sarcastic, darling.

63
00:04:42,017 --> 00:04:43,034
I’m not your darling.

64
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,508
That’s enough.

65
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:45,120
Stop fighting.

66
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:46,291
It’s time to go to class.

67
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:47,622
You two fight like children.

68
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:55,620
Hey, is that Faifa’s car?

69
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,348
Won’t you say hi to him?

70
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,611
Why should I?

71
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:03,491
He dropped you off last night, didn’t he?

72
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:04,800
Go say hi.

73
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:06,091
Have some manners.

74
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,102
See you.

75
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,045
Whoa, look.

76
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,965
Is that a car or a black hole?

77
00:05:16,988 --> 00:05:18,060
People keep coming out of it.

78
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,068
Maybe he had a childhood dream of driving a school bus.

79
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,485
Bye.

80
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,211
Oh.

81
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,291
Hey, Wine.

82
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,902
Why didn’t you tell me you had a morning class?

83
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:28,720
I would’ve picked you up.

84
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,634
I was just driving past the on-campus dorm.

85
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:33,840
My friend Ben has a car.

86
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,520
If we’re heading the same way, we could go together.

87
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:37,577
Let’s save on gas.

88
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,222
If we had come with him,
wouldn’t I have had to sit on the roof?

89
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,051
Can I ride in the trunk?

90
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:43,651
That’d make great content for my channel.

91
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:45,160
Keep it down.

92
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,857
Where are you guys going?

93
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:49,560
Can I give you a ride?

94
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:52,668
We’re going to eat at the Engineering canteen.

95
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:54,348
We can walk there.

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,034
Can I join you?

97
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:57,394
I’ve been lonely lately.

98
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,771
Let me move my car.

99
00:05:58,794 --> 00:05:59,908
See you at the canteen.

100
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:00,605
See you.

101
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,417
So as soon as everyone got out of his car,
he felt lonely.

102
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:05,050
Is that it?

103
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,828
Wine, you’re an introvert.

104
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,988
Are you sure you want to get to know Faifa?

105
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:12,525
You might want to think twice.

106
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,805
I don’t have a choice.

107
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,331
The situation’s forcing me to.

108
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,330
Hi, what drink can I get for you?

109
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:30,137
Where are you sitting?

110
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,285
Over there.

111
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,360
One Chrysanthemum tea, please.

112
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:39,942
One Chrysanthemum tea, okay.

113
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,760
Make it two.

114
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:44,217
I only have one left.

115
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:46,210
Would you like something else, Faifa?

116
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,880
Unbelievable.

117
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,068
Even the seller remembers his name.

118
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,565
Then anything else will do.

119
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:55,234
I’ll let you pretty lady choose something nice for me.

120
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:56,262
Try the Taiwanese milk tea, then.

121
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:57,285
It’s a new menu you can’t miss.

122
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,937
Sounds great.

123
00:06:57,948 --> 00:06:58,502
No.

124
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,377
Aren’t you allergic to milk?

125
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,565
I have my allergy pills.

126
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:08,588
Please give him a cup of ice and a bottle of water.

127
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,520
Let’s give in to him.

128
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:14,057
Kids these days sulk a lot.

129
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,834
If I don’t do what he says,
I’ll have to try to make up with him later.

130
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,845
I’m a grownup.

131
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,851
Stop calling me a kid.

132
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,857
Okay, little Wine.

133
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,548
With the way you two are,

134
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,960
I'll never stop being a shipper for the rest of my life.

135
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,348
You guys are so cute.

136
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,068
Here’s your Chrysanthemum tea.

137
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:36,577
Here’s your ice and water.

138
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:37,240
Here you go.

139
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:38,262
Thank you.

140
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,062
What’s your name, guys?

141
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:47,091
I’m Faifa from Electrical Engineering.

142
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:47,782
I’m Jay.

143
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:48,691
I’m Ben.

144
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,285
Are you all in Computer Engineering?

145
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,337
If you need any advice, just ask me.

146
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:53,531
Even though we’re from different majors,

147
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:54,851
you guys are still my juniors.

148
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:03,605
Ouch.

149
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,074
Why did you slap my hand?

150
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,217
You’re making it too bland.

151
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:17,474
Try it first.

152
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,765
This shop’s Chrysanthemum tea is sweet.

153
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,120
I always add water.

154
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,051
Genius.

155
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:32,154
Stop exaggerating.

156
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,411
I’ve been looking everywhere for you,

157
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:35,737
Wine from Perfect 10 Liners.

158
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,234
I got you some snacks.

159
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:38,102
Thank you.

160
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,040
Has anyone asked you yet?

161
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,857
Asked me?

162
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,445
About what?

163
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:48,440
The faculty star contest is coming up.

164
00:08:48,468 --> 00:08:50,440
The campus star contest too.

165
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,074
We want you to represent Computer Engineering.

166
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:56,891
Oh.

167
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,222
Well…

168
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,382
I don’t think he can do it.

169
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,308
Oh?

170
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:07,411
Tell them what you’re like when you’re nervous.

171
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,102
Come on.

172
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:12,280
Do it for the community.

173
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:12,560
Huh?

174
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,954
Listen.

175
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,365
When Wine gets nervous,

176
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,125
he always…

177
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:26,851
Farts.

178
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,782
Huh?

179
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,617
The smell is really bad.

180
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,205
The last person who smelled his fart
still can’t eat today.

181
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,234
Oh.

182
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:37,742
Is it that bad?

183
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:38,594
It is that bad.

184
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:39,668
Oh.

185
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,102
What’s wrong?

186
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,777
You seem nervous.

187
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:44,788
Don’t tell me…

188
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,348
You’re about to fart.

189
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,542
Take a deep breath.

190
00:09:48,565 --> 00:09:49,960
It’s okay.

191
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:51,320
We won’t trouble you then.

192
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,342
Fart? Seriously?

193
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:58,530
I couldn’t think of anything else in time.

194
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,691
I saw your sad face,

195
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,320
so I just made up a random excuse.

196
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,325
It’s for the best.

197
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,777
Wait, did you just fart?

198
00:10:10,182 --> 00:10:11,850
Just kidding.

199
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,262
Hey, dude.

200
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,108
Where are you going?

201
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,108
See you around.

202
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:45,257
Cherry.

203
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:46,268
Pay attention in class.

204
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,834
Hey.

205
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,514
My jacket is all wrinkled now.

206
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,051
What time did you drop my mentee off
at his dorm last night?

207
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,542
What’s that?

208
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,691
Arm, what brings you here?

209
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,188
Faifa!

210
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:18,708
Yes?

211
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,765
You must not know that Perfect 10 Liners
doesn’t just have good looks,

212
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:27,285
but we also love each other even more than siblings.

213
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,822
Why wasn’t Arm this protective of you back then?

214
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,371
He was.

215
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,194
I just didn’t care.

216
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,274
Why do I feel like
a prisoner being interrogated?

217
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:44,851
Someone told us that…

218
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:45,811
I need my lawyer.

219
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,217
Fai.

220
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,537
Come on.

221
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:50,502
I’m sorry.

222
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,628
But I didn’t take him to do anything bad, Arm.

223
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:56,674
Then why did he get back to his dorm in the morning?

224
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,697
Mm.

225
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:00,268
We split up when the bar closed, didn’t we?

226
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,005
He was so drunk.

227
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:02,668
How did he even remember?

228
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:03,217
Hey!

229
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:03,691
Yes?

230
00:12:03,714 --> 00:12:04,702
What do you have to say?

231
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,440
Here’s what happened.

232
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:08,314
While we were at Bang On last night,

233
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:09,560
I drank.

234
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:11,177
I was about to drive back

235
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,274
but Wine was worried about me.

236
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:13,497
He didn’t want me to drive.

237
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,348
So we went to eat porridge
and waited for me to sober up.

238
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,222
We were talking until the dorm closed,

239
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,068
so we had to wait in front of the dorm until it opened.

240
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:23,622
That’s all.

241
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:24,965
Nothing more.

242
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,862
Are you sure?

243
00:12:25,874 --> 00:12:26,845
I’m sure.

244
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:28,742
What did you talk about for three to four hours?

245
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:29,131
Exactly.

246
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,011
You just met each other, didn’t you?

247
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:30,457
Yeah.

248
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:36,900
Look, I’m sorry.

249
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:39,874
It won’t happen again.

250
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,434
I promise.

251
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,754
Fine.

252
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,491
Actually, I didn’t come to talk to you about that.

253
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:45,982
Oh?

254
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:47,080
I was just acting.

255
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,594
The other day, I posted Wine’s photo
and accidentally tagged him.

256
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,188
People must have been bothering him a lot
so he set his Instagram to private now.

257
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:00,457
Seriously?

258
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,645
Yeah.

259
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,765
The point is,

260
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,897
Pun talked to him a bit the other day.

261
00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:10,485
It seems like he has a problem
but he didn’t say anything.

262
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,662
We’ve been trying to figure out how to approach him.

263
00:13:13,685 --> 00:13:17,262
After discussing,
we’re thinking of…

264
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:21,462
Asking me to break his walls, right?

265
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,857
Yes. Help me.

266
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:24,565
I don’t think Fai…

267
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:26,771
You’ve made the right decision, Arm.

268
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:29,805
Let his real mentor take care of his puppy.

269
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,822
This foster mentor will take care of Wine.

270
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,154
I’ll leave it to you then.

271
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,811
Absolutely.

272
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,617
You’re the best.

273
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:39,577
Thank you.

274
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:48,320
I heard that last year,

275
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:51,365
the junior welcoming activities were more fun than this.

276
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:53,914
They had the buddy draw and the star contest.

277
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,571
Look at our year.

278
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,834
This is so damn boring.

279
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,874
Stop complaining and start working
so we can go back to the dorm.

280
00:14:01,914 --> 00:14:04,485
Guys, don’t be tired yet.

281
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,651
We’re not only asking you to clean.

282
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:09,005
We have an activity for you too.

283
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:11,780
Isn’t sweeping an activity?

284
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:13,217
Jay, keep your voice down.

285
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,674
Don’t let them hear you.

286
00:14:15,714 --> 00:14:19,102
To help you get to know each other better,

287
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,674
we’re asking you to take photos of 10 friends

288
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,365
and remember their names.

289
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:28,651
Whoever gets 10 done first will get to go home first.

290
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,125
What’s wrong?

291
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:46,120
Look at that frown.

292
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,508
How did you know I’m here?

293
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,771
I told you I have a magical power.

294
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,217
Let’s go.

295
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,485
Where are we going?

296
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,754
We’re not allowed to be here.

297
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,057
Are you sure this is a good idea?

298
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,891
You wanted to run away from chaos, didn’t you?

299
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,485
This is the most peaceful place.

300
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,600
When I don’t really want to talk to anyone,

301
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:18,188
I always come up here alone.

302
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:21,462
Is there a time you don’t want to talk to anyone?

303
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,262
Hold on.

304
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:26,674
Are you saying I talk too much?

305
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:27,657
No.

306
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,508
You just seem to enjoy being around a lot of people.

307
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,885
I didn’t think you’d want to be alone sometimes.

308
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,005
Of course, I do.

309
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:38,274
No one wants to talk to other people all the time.

310
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,348
By the way, what’s wrong?

311
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:42,748
Why won’t you join your friends?

312
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,222
The seniors asked us to take selfies with
and get to know 10 friends.

313
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:53,737
Otherwise, they won’t let us go home.

314
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,337
Ah.

315
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,542
So an introvert like you
chose to run away from the problem?

316
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,880
What now?

317
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,451
How much longer are you going to keep running?

318
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,017
I don’t know.

319
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,034
I have a habit of running away from my problems.

320
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:11,291
It’s something I can never break.

321
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,290
What are you doing?

322
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:30,188
Smile.

323
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:32,148
Come on, smile.

324
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,502
Make the peace sign.

325
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,628
Smile.

326
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:37,280
Smile too.

327
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:38,948
Give me a big smile like this.

328
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:42,502
Wait.

329
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,634
Don’t tell me you broke up with your ex
because you ran away from your problems.

330
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,560
“Let’s break up?”

331
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,222
How can you say that so easily?

332
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,497
What’s your reason?

333
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,342
I don’t have one.

334
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,417
Why didn’t you tell me sooner?

335
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:04,857
I wouldn’t have wasted my time!

336
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,308
Yes.

337
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:24,188
Why did you run away?

338
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:28,057
I guess it’s the easiest way

339
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,462
and I won’t have to know anything anymore.

340
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,885
You’re so little.

341
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,308
Why do you carry so much?

342
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,417
I’m as big as you.

343
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,011
We’re only a year apart.

344
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,554
But I feel much older than you.

345
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:45,777
Right, little Wine?

346
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:47,770
Faifa, stop playing with my head.

347
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,125
Stop playing with my head.

348
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:50,800
Fine, I won’t play with your head.

349
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:53,108
Can I play with your cheeks instead?

350
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,211
Little Wine!

351
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:55,102
Stop it!

352
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,388
Here.

353
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,657
Done.

354
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,508
You edited my face in?

355
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,788
Doesn’t it look real?

356
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,148
My selfies finally came in handy today.

357
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:08,662
Let’s go.

358
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,651
Get up.

359
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,794
Go give them these photos
so you can head back to the dorm.

360
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:12,371
Come on.

361
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,680
Come on.

362
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:18,182
Come on.

363
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,931
I thought you said you’re not a kid anymore.

364
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,571
You can’t even open the door.

365
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,377
Let me.

366
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,274
This one is…

367
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:55,280
Noon.

368
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:59,280
This one is…

369
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:03,142
(Duck.)

370
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,411
(Duck.)

371
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:06,440
Yuck.

372
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:07,000
Huh?

373
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:10,537
Oh, Duck.

374
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:11,388
Not Yuck.

375
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,577
Okay.

376
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:15,650
And this one…

377
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:17,650
(Pilly.)

378
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,565
Huh?

379
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:18,931
Huh?

380
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,148
Oh.

381
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,440
Uh…

382
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:23,114
Silly.

383
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:24,142
Say again?

384
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,468
Uh…

385
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,314
(Pilly.)

386
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,217
Oh, Pilly.

387
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,034
Pilly.

388
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:31,771
It’s Pilly.

389
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:33,754
Okay.

390
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:34,674
That’s all.

391
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,451
You passed.

392
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:36,931
Yes!

393
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,188
Can I leave now?

394
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,028
Yes.

395
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,805
This meal is on me.

396
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,982
I want to thank you for helping me today.

397
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,645
I’m a big eater.

398
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:58,685
I’ll pay 1,000 baht.

399
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,417
If it goes over, you pay the rest.

400
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,114
You weren’t always afraid of socializing, were you?

401
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,297
What made you become this way?

402
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:41,468
Wine has set his IG to public now, Arm.

403
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,674
I just saw it.

404
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:43,405
Really?

405
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,451
So that means getting Faifa’s help works.

406
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,450
How about we throw a party?

407
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:50,622
Maybe we could get Wine to open up more.

408
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:52,068
I totally agree.

409
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,862
Yotha’s here.

410
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:55,988
Hi.

411
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:56,668
Hey!

412
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,057
Yotha!

413
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,491
You’re still wearing the pajama set I gave you?

414
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:01,948
That’s cute.

415
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,451
But it looks a bit loose on you.

416
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,040
When I bought it, I didn’t know who my mentee would be,
so I got the one-size option.

417
00:21:09,062 --> 00:21:11,617
Let me get you a new one.

418
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:14,325
How about in pink color
with hippo print?

419
00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:15,080
It’s trending right now.

420
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:15,771
No.

421
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,297
Oh?

422
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,382
I mean, I don’t want to trouble you.

423
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:24,851
Wearing loose clothes is comfortable.

424
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,188
Oh.

425
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,691
Okay.

426
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,988
Alright then.

427
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:30,980
Wear it often. It’s cool.

428
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,565
Whoa.

429
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:35,982
Arc’s pajama set is cooler.

430
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,662
Really, Arc?

431
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:40,708
You’re not wearing a shirt again!

432
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:41,417
It’s hot.

433
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,954
I have to go.

434
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:44,662
Talk later.

435
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,194
I’ll invite Jet and Pun to join the party too.

436
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:47,211
Bye, Arm.

437
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:47,880
Bye, Arc.

438
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,417
Does your company make you do heavy lifting?

439
00:21:57,434 --> 00:22:00,262
The longer you work there,
the bigger you get.

440
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,594
I don’t think I can wrap my arms around you now.

441
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,251
You’re heavy, Arc.

442
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,520
Fine, I can wrap my arms around you fully.

443
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:24,194
Arc’s body looks so cool.

444
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,234
Hey.

445
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,068
What are you doing?

446
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,314
I want you to say I’m cool too.

447
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,822
Oh.

448
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,325
Am I cool now?

449
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,400
So-so.

450
00:22:48,188 --> 00:22:48,862
Oh?

451
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:49,851
Okay.

452
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,342
Don’t!

453
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,240
Don’t!

454
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,400
You’re cool now.

455
00:22:56,222 --> 00:22:57,514
You’re cool now.

456
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,680
You’re so cool.

457
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:01,022
You’re 10 times cooler than Arc.

458
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,160
10 times.

459
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:22,668
Thank you for dropping me off
and thank you for today.

460
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,217
Hey.

461
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,622
Every problem can be solved.

462
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,011
Just like today’s was.

463
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:36,640
It was solved because of your help.

464
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,817
If I can help make everything better for you,

465
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,582
I will.

466
00:23:50,017 --> 00:23:50,965
Okay?

467
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,851
Now go to sleep,

468
00:23:58,874 --> 00:24:00,017
or you won’t grow up.

469
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,468
I’m fully grown up.

470
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,514
Good night.

471
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:07,777
You too.

472
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:11,617
♪ No pressure, no worries, let’s fly ♪

473
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:14,942
♪ Before we turn this into something real ♪

474
00:24:19,714 --> 00:24:21,710
Wine broke up with his longtime girlfriend.

475
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,342
No one knows why.

476
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:24,440
We just know they broke up.

477
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:28,120
So he’s gloomy because of the breakup?

478
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,714
He used to be happy and cheerful

479
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,022
but ever since he broke up with Toey,

480
00:24:33,342 --> 00:24:34,930
he’s been unusually quiet.

481
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,891
I told you not to talk about this again, Jay.

482
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,131
Wine.

483
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,285
I didn’t know what to do to get the old you back,

484
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,468
so I asked Ben for advice.

485
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,697
Jay told me
because he’s really worried about you.

486
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,765
I’m not mad.

487
00:24:59,937 --> 00:25:01,930
I just don’t want anyone to talk about this again.

488
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,954
But I couldn’t stand

489
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,370
hearing you cry in the bathroom.

490
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,754
What the hell is wrong with him?

491
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,777
You heard me all this time?

492
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:26,434
When we filmed that ASMR food video,

493
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:28,430
when we ate that huge bowl of pork fried rice,

494
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,040
A huge bowl of fried rice!

495
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:34,422
Yay!

496
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:35,154
Dig in!

497
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,268
Wine, why are you crying?

498
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,497
I accidentally bit into chili.

499
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,371
Where’s the chili?

500
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,645
You didn’t cry because you bit into the chili,

501
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:55,880
but because pork fried rice
was Toey’s favorite dish, right?

502
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,937
Ben.

503
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,108
You guys worry so much about me.

504
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,057
You’re not alone in this world.

505
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,445
I may have only gotten close to you guys recently,

506
00:26:17,462 --> 00:26:18,594
but I…

507
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,800
I…

508
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,725
I don’t know what to say.

509
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,617
But I love you guys.

510
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,965
From now on,

511
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:38,540
you don’t have to deal with it alone, Wine.

512
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,017
We’ll help you move on.

513
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
Thank you so much, guys.

514
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,297
Wait.

515
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,960
What does “move on” mean?

516
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,537
You know I’m bad at English.

517
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
This will definitely work.

518
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,285
Everything about Toey,

519
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,502
you need to throw it away.

520
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,085
Let’s start.

521
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,051
Can I keep this?

522
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,680
Give it to me.

523
00:27:23,382 --> 00:27:25,380
Don’t throw away that teddy bear.

524
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,828
Anything else?

525
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,405
No.

526
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,720
I’ve blocked her on LINE and Facebook
to cut off all communication.

527
00:27:42,742 --> 00:27:43,645
What about TikTok?

528
00:27:43,668 --> 00:27:45,222
They always send each other funny clips.

529
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,731
Ouch.

530
00:27:45,754 --> 00:27:47,057
Done.

531
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,651
Delete the archived photos on Instagram too.

532
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,297
Isn’t this too much, guys?

533
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,462
Hang in there.

534
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,982
A little sharp pain now
will save you from long-term pain.

535
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,885
Other people who break up can still be friends.

536
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:03,662
Toey changed her number the day you broke up.

537
00:28:03,685 --> 00:28:05,660
It’s not like she wants to be friends with you.

538
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,291
I’ve cut off all communication.

539
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,290
It’s done.

540
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,680
Come on!

541
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,571
I hope someday
we can be friends again, Toey.

542
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,977
Love is like a double-edged sword.

543
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:33,440
The one that makes you the happiest
can also hurt you the most.

544
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,554
Peekaboo!

545
00:28:51,577 --> 00:28:52,748
Hi, Dad.

546
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,690
Why did you come home today?

547
00:28:55,897 --> 00:28:57,690
Because I missed you, Dad.

548
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:58,194
How much do you need?

549
00:28:58,217 --> 00:28:59,034
20,000 baht to my account.

550
00:28:59,057 --> 00:29:00,668
Come on, Dad!

551
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,382
My son.

552
00:29:03,405 --> 00:29:04,142
Yes?

553
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:05,411
You seem different today.

554
00:29:05,434 --> 00:29:06,628
No.

555
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,354
I just want to ask you something.

556
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,782
When you were heartbroken,

557
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,942
what did you do to feel better?

558
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,257
Why do you ask?

559
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:16,954
Well…

560
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:17,594
Hey!

561
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,280
Yotha. Gun.

562
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:20,765
Why are you here?

563
00:29:20,782 --> 00:29:21,760
It’s my home.

564
00:29:21,788 --> 00:29:23,760
I can come and go as I please.

565
00:29:23,788 --> 00:29:25,085
And why are you here?

566
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:26,542
You come and go like it’s your home.

567
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,737
Do you help my dad with the electricity bill?

568
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,034
He’s my boyfriend.

569
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:29,920
It’s none of your business.

570
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,365
Fine.

571
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:33,937
I’ll mind my own business.

572
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,297
Who’s heartbroken?

573
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,754
My friend.

574
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,600
From where?

575
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:44,560
Do I know this friend?

576
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:45,948
You’re so nosy.

577
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,645
Oh.

578
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,451
Are you keeping a secret from your friend?

579
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,525
What’s wrong with you?

580
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,925
Don’t tell me
you’re heartbroken.

581
00:29:52,948 --> 00:29:54,531
Heartbroken? You wish!

582
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,851
I need to learn to love someone first
before I can talk about being heartbroken.

583
00:29:57,874 --> 00:29:58,594
Okay.

584
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,177
So why are you asking me that?

585
00:30:03,097 --> 00:30:05,090
Nothing.

586
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:11,011
My friend is just heartbroken
so I want to find a way to help him.

587
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:15,251
Why are you finding faults with me?

588
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:17,691
You’re even asking Dad for advice on that?

589
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,440
What?

590
00:30:21,725 --> 00:30:22,668
Are you heartbroken?

591
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,800
No, I’m not!

592
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:27,880
Who else could I ask for advice if not Dad?

593
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,777
Why don’t you break up with Gun
so I can ask for your advice?

594
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:31,531
Fai, you jerk.

595
00:30:31,685 --> 00:30:35,457
I really don’t know what to do.

596
00:30:35,474 --> 00:30:37,725
I help everyone as usual.

597
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:39,720
Why are you making this weird?

598
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,188
Don’t you usually come up with simple ways
to solve problems yourself?

599
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:48,565
Why are you taking this so seriously?

600
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,280
I’m going to bed.

601
00:30:52,314 --> 00:30:53,050
I’m sleepy.

602
00:30:53,074 --> 00:30:53,840
Have a good dream.

603
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,782
Why the hell are you going to sleep?

604
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,085
It’s only half past noon.

605
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:57,440
I’m going to take a nap.

606
00:30:57,485 --> 00:31:00,114
Are you going to New’s bar later?

607
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:01,588
No, I’m lazy.

608
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,982
He’s heartbroken for sure, Dad.

609
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:07,068
For sure.

610
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,017
A million percent.

611
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,308
SEE YOU ALL AT 8 PM TONIGHT.

612
00:31:13,617 --> 00:31:15,610
Why does my group get together so often?

613
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:16,605
Come on.

614
00:31:16,628 --> 00:31:17,462
Just go.

615
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:18,497
Let loose for a change.

616
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:20,490
Can you guys come with me?

617
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:21,748
Are you crazy?

618
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:23,405
We’re not invited.

619
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,474
Besides, you’re not close to them yet.

620
00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:29,011
Bringing us would be bad manners.

621
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,782
But I don’t want to go alone.

622
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,062
It was solved because of your help.

623
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,280
If I can help make everything better for you,

624
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,371
I will.

625
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,314
If you don’t want to go, you can tell…

626
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:49,034
I’ll go.

627
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,240
Since I’m moving on today,

628
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:54,411
I’ll get wasted.

629
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:55,862
Who’s going to take care of you?

630
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,588
Pun and Jet said something urgent came up.

631
00:32:06,622 --> 00:32:07,851
They probably won’t be able to make it.

632
00:32:08,022 --> 00:32:09,440
Oh, okay.

633
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,091
How are you doing, Wine?

634
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,251
Is everything okay with your studies?

635
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,668
So-so.

636
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,668
Come on, Arc.

637
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,502
WHERE ARE YOU?

638
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,411
Cheers!

639
00:32:27,434 --> 00:32:27,948
Come on.

640
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,388
While we wait for the others.

641
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,725
♪ Say it loud one more time ♪

642
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:36,508
♪ Repeat it cuz I can’t get enough ♪

643
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,045
Come on!

644
00:32:38,068 --> 00:32:38,754
Walk faster!

645
00:32:38,777 --> 00:32:40,000
What’s wrong with you?

646
00:32:40,034 --> 00:32:41,194
You said you were too lazy to come.

647
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:42,577
Why are you rushing us now?

648
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,182
I’m fully rested after my sleep.

649
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:45,714
Now my throat is dry.

650
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,710
I want to drink some alcohol!

651
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,371
Come on!

652
00:32:48,405 --> 00:32:49,320
Let’s go drink some alcohol!

653
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,645
Hey.

654
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,508
Come on!

655
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:55,354
Why are you standing there confused?

656
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,388
Hey, Faifa!

657
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:01,994
- Hi, Arc. Hi, Arm.
- 	Hi.

658
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:03,085
What did I miss?

659
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,131
How are you, Yotha?

660
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:05,765
Hi, guys.

661
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:06,680
Hi.

662
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,034
Cheers to everyone being here.

663
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:11,337
Thank you for coming to keep me company.

664
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:13,411
My pleasure.

665
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:18,805
Come on.

666
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:21,085
Now that we’re all here, let’s drink to that.

667
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,268
Cheers!

668
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:25,142
We’ll take it easy tonight.

669
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:25,891
Okay.

670
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,365
You haven’t finished your drink.

671
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,862
Finish it, Wine.

672
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:37,860
Yotha.

673
00:33:37,988 --> 00:33:39,342
Bottoms up.

674
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,668
Come on.

675
00:33:44,697 --> 00:33:45,634
Keep it up.

676
00:33:45,662 --> 00:33:47,348
Cheers!

677
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,108
Take it easy.

678
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:50,651
Don’t get drunk, okay?

679
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,731
Let’s go.

680
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,714
I’m such a loser.

681
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,348
Hey.

682
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,325
Wine!

683
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,320
Why would you say that?

684
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,771
I’m your senior.

685
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,177
I can help you with everything.

686
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:19,822
Come on.

687
00:34:23,182 --> 00:34:24,554
There, there.

688
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,034
Here we go.

689
00:34:26,268 --> 00:34:27,531
Shall we leave now?

690
00:34:27,554 --> 00:34:28,994
Not yet.

691
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:30,990
This is getting fun.

692
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,880
Isn’t the heart supposed to pump blood?

693
00:34:35,925 --> 00:34:37,188
Damn it!

694
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:39,771
Why does love have to mess it up?

695
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,234
Calm down.

696
00:34:42,268 --> 00:34:43,994
I’m always by your side.

697
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,531
Got it?

698
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,514
My brother.

699
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,085
I’m heartbroken.

700
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,611
Damn it.

701
00:34:55,634 --> 00:34:58,634
Why are we always heartbroken when we’re at a bar?

702
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,085
It’s okay.

703
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,148
Nothing.

704
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,794
My friend is just heartbroken.

705
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,342
Hey.

706
00:35:09,868 --> 00:35:12,057
Listen to me, Wine.

707
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:16,508
You don’t need any damn love.

708
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:18,940
- It’s not that important to your life.
- 	Excuse me, Arm?

709
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,942
Well, if you can’t find someone as good as Arc,

710
00:35:24,977 --> 00:35:27,297
then just don’t date anyone.

711
00:35:27,314 --> 00:35:27,874
Right.

712
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,240
I’ll take care of you, okay?

713
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,217
Right, Arc?

714
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:38,697
You’re the best.

715
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,120
How did he turn this into bragging about his boyfriend?

716
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,845
Hey, Warichy.

717
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,320
Hi.

718
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,017
Sorry.

719
00:35:48,057 --> 00:35:49,325
New’s not here tonight.

720
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:50,428
We’re busy at the back.

721
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:53,005
Hi, Warichy.

722
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:54,251
Hi, Kl-ao.

723
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,120
We haven’t talked yet tonight,

724
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:57,154
but you’re already in this state.

725
00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:58,445
I’m fine.

726
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,171
I’m not drunk.

727
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,160
How about a challenge?

728
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,240
Hey, Wine.

729
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,920
These are Wa and Klao.

730
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,800
They’re boyfriends.

731
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,434
Wa, Klao, this is Wine.

732
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,577
The new member of our group.

733
00:36:13,594 --> 00:36:14,085
Hi.

734
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:14,857
Hi.

735
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:19,628
You guys are boyfriends?

736
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,125
You guys are boyfriends, too.

737
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,382
You guys, as well.

738
00:36:47,565 --> 00:36:49,380
What are you saying, Wine?

739
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,971
It’s normal for men to date, right?

740
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:03,057
I’m normal, right?

741
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,114
You’re drunk, Wine.

742
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:06,640
Go to the bathroom with me.

743
00:37:06,668 --> 00:37:07,068
Come on.

744
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:07,497
Get up!

745
00:37:07,514 --> 00:37:08,994
Oh, no.

746
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,057
Take good care of my brother, Faifa.

747
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,434
Okay.

748
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,491
We’ll be right back.

749
00:37:14,685 --> 00:37:19,177
Yotha’s mentee’s heartbreak seems bad.

750
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,880
Hey, sit down.

751
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,485
Arc, get them two drinks.

752
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:26,417
Hey, Arm.

753
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,211
Eat this.

754
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:29,308
No, let me drink first!

755
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:30,771
- You don’t want to get drunk.
- 	Come on!

756
00:37:30,788 --> 00:37:31,622
Yotha!

757
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,822
Why did you say that?

758
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:40,605
Because you guys make it seem normal.

759
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,120
Men liking men?

760
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:46,120
I’m into men.

761
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,222
Do you hear me? I’m into men.

762
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,137
What about it?

763
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,085
No one can accept me for who I am.

764
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,537
Listen to me.

765
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,605
Love is between the two of you.

766
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:09,017
The decision to get into a relationship
is made by the two of you.

767
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:10,788
You hold hands with just the two of you.

768
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,714
As long as you’re not stealing someone else’s partner,
why do you care?

769
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,508
Why does it matter if people can accept you or not?

770
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,034
Who has to?

771
00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:22,030
At the end of the day, it’s your feelings.

772
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,594

Are you dead?

789
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,537
You’re awake, vino baby.

790
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,674
My name is Wine.

791
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,982
But you got so drunk, vino baby.

792
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,628
Mm.

793
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,788
Hey.

794
00:42:15,811 --> 00:42:18,914
Do you realize what you did last night?

795
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,102
Do you remember?

796
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,925
Last night, I didn’t grab and kiss anyone, did I?

797
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,250
What if I told you that last night…

798
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,188
What’s up, Jay?

799
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:42,822
Wine, what did you do last night?

800
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,234
I blocked Toey on all channels on your phone.

801
00:42:54,262 --> 00:42:55,840
How were you still able to contact her?

802
00:42:55,862 --> 00:42:57,131
I said I can’t remember.

803
00:42:57,148 --> 00:42:58,165
I was drunk.

804
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,617
Toey told me you asked for your stuff back
in her YouTube search bar.

805
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,360
What?

806
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,262
GIVE EVERYTHING BACK.
WE BROKE UP, SO GIVE EVERYTHING BACK.
WHY ARE YOU STILL KEEPING MY STUFF?

807
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:07,890
You even remember Toey’s account?

808
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,120
Damn it.

809
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:16,125
She also said she only has your film camera left.

810
00:43:16,445 --> 00:43:17,828
You’re asking to get your film camera back?

811
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,274
I think I meant my heart.

812
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,434
I want my heart back.

813
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,422
The bar probably played sad songs last night.

814
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,000
That’s why I got emotional.

815
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,874
I was so drunk.

816
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,960
Toey is coming here to return your film camera today.

817
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,131
Do you want to get it yourself or…

818
00:43:36,148 --> 00:43:37,125
Can you get it for me?

819
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:40,348
Okay.

820
00:43:40,668 --> 00:43:41,668
Sure.

821
00:43:47,051 --> 00:43:49,050
We haven’t talked since graduating from high school.

822
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,845
How are you doing?

823
00:43:49,868 --> 00:43:51,045
I’m good.

824
00:43:51,325 --> 00:43:52,611
I’m dating someone new now.

825
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,034
Are you guys doing well?

826
00:43:56,045 --> 00:43:58,040
Wine still seems hurt.

827
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:04,845
Actually, I want you to tell Wine something.

828
00:44:04,874 --> 00:44:07,514
I was going to message him
but he blocked me on everything.

829
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,291
I was the one who blocked you.

830
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,908
I want him to move on.

831
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,308
Well, then.

832
00:44:14,382 --> 00:44:18,131
Please tell Wine that I’m not mad at him or hate him.

833
00:44:18,377 --> 00:44:21,137
And recently, Tor talked to Dad and Mom.

834
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:24,422
What do you mean?

835
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,142
Why are you telling me this?

836
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,720
Oh, did Wine not tell you about this?

837
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,617
Wine and I broke up
because he likes my older brother Tor.

838
00:44:53,445 --> 00:44:56,130
WINE

839
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,725
Hi, sleepyhead.

840
00:45:02,748 --> 00:45:03,988
How can I help you?

841
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,251
Hello?

842
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:10,080
Wine?

843
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,302
Wine, can you hear me?

844
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,737
Faifa.

845
00:45:17,897 --> 00:45:18,937
Are you free?

846
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:22,930
Don’t hang up until you see my face.

847
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:31,354
Wine.

848
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:57,750
You’re not hurt or in danger, are you?

849
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:01,737
Okay.

850
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:06,417
Well…

851
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,965
Well…

852
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,697
If no one died,

853
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:17,234
you don’t have to tell me now.

854
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,062
Don’t you want to know what’s wrong with me?

855
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:29,971
The question is, do you want to tell me?

856
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,337
I told you every problem can be solved.

857
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:37,137
If you can’t solve it yourself,

858
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,954
I’m here to help you.

859
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,468
I don’t know what you’re going through
or what you’re dealing with,

860
00:46:45,782 --> 00:46:47,780
but if the whole world turns its back on you,

861
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,828
I’ll always be here for you.

862
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:07,588
Got it?

863
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,125
I’m into men.

864
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,611
You already told me that.

865
00:47:27,628 --> 00:47:28,577
Don’t you remember?

866
00:47:33,622 --> 00:47:35,177
I’m into men.

867
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,965
Do you hear me? I’m into men.

868
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:47,537
I asked if you hate me for who I am.

869
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,857
