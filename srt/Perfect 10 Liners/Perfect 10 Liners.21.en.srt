1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,113
So, should I be the one to win your heart,

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,420
or should you be the one to win my heart?

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,993
Do you want this to end so soon?

4
00:00:05,013 --> 00:00:06,413
I don’t want it to end.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,460
You’ve fallen for Faifa, haven’t you?

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,820
I’m trying to change for someone.

7
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,766
Someone who made me realize what it’s like

8
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:16,513
when someone’s more special than anyone else.

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,120
You said I’m special to you.

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,153
Does that mean what I think it means?

11
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,513
Love

12
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,510
is feeling so damn happy

13
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:25,893
when I see him rejecting someone else

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,766
to be with me.

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,700
You didn’t call to let me know
you weren’t coming back to the room last night.

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,526
Where did you stay?

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,100
Wine?

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,180
What’s up?

19
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:52,813
Did you stay the night in Faifa’s room?

20
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:53,620
Mm.

21
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,026
You’re falling for his charms.

22
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:58,266
No.

23
00:00:58,286 --> 00:01:00,000
He’s just always taking care of me,

24
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:02,000
and something happened last night,

25
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:03,660
so I stayed with him.

26
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:04,933
Have you seen this?

27
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,200
Faifa took this photo.

28
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:12,313
No, I’m showing you that

29
00:01:12,346 --> 00:01:14,146
Tor commented on your photo.

30
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,706
YOU’VE GROWN SO MUCH. :)

31
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,526
Mm.

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,986
I think Tor is making a move.

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,786
If you don’t want to be in this game,

34
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:25,200
you should walk away.

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,300
Who’s Tor?

36
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,513
I didn’t mean to hide it from you.

37
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,900
I just didn’t have the chance to tell you.

38
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,340
Well, you’re telling me now.

39
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,206
Besides, it’s your choice whether to tell me or not.

40
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,880
It’s your personal matter.

41
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,953
Now that you know everything, Ben,

42
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,766
does anything still feel weird to you?

43
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:33,886
There’s one thing.

44
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,900
What is it?

45
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:38,020
The fact that you and Faifa have feelings for each other.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,146
Why don’t you two just date already?

47
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:41,860
Why do you have to be so loud?

48
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:43,146
What do you mean, date?

49
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,426
We’re brothers.

50
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,600
Just be careful.

51
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:50,326
Faifa is something else.

52
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,393
What do you mean?

53
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,390
He’s everyone’s man.

54
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:54,646
You should figure out

55
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,266
if you’re just one of his million or his one and only.

56
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,550
I understand what “special” means now.

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,460
I understand that it’s probably you.

58
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,760
Ouch!

59
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,190
Why did you slap my head?

60
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,093
Your imagination is running wild.

61
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:26,213
I just tried to keep it in check.

62
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,626
You definitely look like you’re keeping something from us.

63
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,680
Well,

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,280
I…

65
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,913
Faifa and I kissed already.

66
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,706
What?

67
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,706
My heart was racing
like it was going to jump out of my chest.

68
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,360
Were you drunk?

69
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:46,893
No.

70
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,493
Do you want to kiss him again?

71
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,993
Why do you ask?

72
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:53,300
Because if you feel like the kiss was a one-time thing,

73
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,980
then it doesn’t mean anything.

74
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,273
But if you liked the kiss…

75
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,706
Stop.

76
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,573
Your heart
is not yours anymore.

77
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,066
Do you have to see him again today?

78
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,826
He has to pick his mom up from the airport.

79
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,253
Wow.

80
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:10,206
You know what he’s up to like you’re….

81
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,226
We’re not dating.

82
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:11,953
Yet.

83
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,086
Damn!

84
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:22,293
- I understood the lesson again.
- This is getting tiring.

85
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,840
- I’m so smart.
- 	Whoa!

86
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:24,246
Arm!

87
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:24,920
Arm!

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,553
What?

89
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:28,320
What?

90
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,893
What’s the hurry, Gun?

91
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,873
There’s something.

92
00:05:32,153 --> 00:05:32,800
What?

93
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:34,606
Calm down.

94
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,340
There’s something.

95
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,400
There are feelings involved!

96
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
There are feelings involved!

97
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,620
Feelings!

98
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,360
Speak slowly.

99
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:45,373
Breathe.

100
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,293
Breathe in.

101
00:05:46,506 --> 00:05:47,340
Breathe in.

102
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,226
Breathe out.

103
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,060
Hold on.

104
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,726
I’m going to faint.

105
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:55,480
Okay.

106
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,806
I overheard Wine talking to his friends.

107
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:02,106
I think I’m sure.

108
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,166
Yeah?

109
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:05,933
Those two have feelings for each other.

110
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,600
Are you sure that’s not fake news?

111
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:09,913
I’m 100% sure.

112
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,180
Warich said Faifa likes Wine

113
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,613
and we know Wine likes Faifa.

114
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:16,180
Yeah.

115
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,900
Then why are they holding back?

116
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:20,786
I know, right?

117
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,813
What the hell are you two talking about?

118
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,120
I have no freaking idea.

119
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,193
Beagle.

120
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,640
- Hey, Yotha.
- Yotha.

121
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,120
Don’t you have to go home and eat with your mom?

122
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,146
I think there’s some issue, so she had to change her flight.

123
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:36,793
So Faifa’s been left hanging?

124
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:38,713
Newton has probably called him.

125
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:39,413
Okay.

126
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,440
What were you guys talking about?

127
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,406
Oh, about feelings.

128
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,566
Feelings?

129
00:06:44,586 --> 00:06:45,500
There are feelings.

130
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,653
It seems like Gun has feelings for Arm.

131
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,193
Yeah.

132
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:48,780
What?

133
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,173
- No!
- No!

134
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:52,520
You’re talking nonsense!

135
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,386
You too, idiot!

136
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,140
That hurt!

137
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:56,113
Hey, Po.

138
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,326
Do you have insurance?

139
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,980
Stop talking nonsense.

140
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,620
Why did they ask us to gather here?

141
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:08,120
I heard they’re going to talk about Engineers Unite.

142
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,546
Engineers Unite?

143
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,640
What’s that?

144
00:07:10,686 --> 00:07:14,400
It’s an event where engineering students
from four universities compete in football.

145
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,100
During Arm’s year, our uni was the host.

146
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,753
Another uni will probably host it this year.

147
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,893
We’ve now received official word from the people in charge

148
00:07:22,913 --> 00:07:24,066
that the event is canceled this year.

149
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,546
Bummer.

150
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,053
I was planning to film so much content.

151
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:31,686
Why did they have to cancel it this year?

152
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,320
What a bummer.

153
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,746
But we can see how eager everyone is,

154
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,026
so we’re going to host Engineers Market
for the first time this year.

155
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,133
I’m so bummed.

156
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,586
I heard that for the original event,

157
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,180
we were supposed to go to Chiang Mai.

158
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,886
I don’t want to go there.

159
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,340
Why not?

160
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:52,626
Everyone wants to go on vacation.

161
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,353
I’m lazy.

162
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,020
I don’t like packing.

163
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,720
And I don’t like sleeping in unfamiliar places.

164
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,286
So Faifa’s room is familiar, huh?

165
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,650
I bet you slept soundly.

166
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:04,650
How did you even turn the conversation into that?

167
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,073
There’s one more thing.

168
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:08,626
This is the first year one of our Computer Engineering majors

169
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:11,433
is a member of Perfect 10 Liners.

170
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:13,660
Who’s in the Perfect 10 Liners?

171
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:15,293
Put your hand up and show us your face.

172
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,133
Which one are you?

173
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,933
Wine!

174
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,750
Wine!

175
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:18,673
Put your hand up.

176
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:19,420
Which one are you?

177
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:20,593
Your seniors want to see your face.

178
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:22,433
My friend went to the restroom.

179
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,266
He went to the restroom?

180
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:24,880
That’s fine.

181
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,333
Can you tell your friend
to help promote the event?

182
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:54,660
This is a restricted area.

183
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:56,400
Do not enter without permission.

184
00:08:58,186 --> 00:08:59,353
Alright, I’ll leave.

185
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:06,293
Permission granted.

186
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,746
If you don’t want to smile,

187
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,886
you don’t have to force it.

188
00:09:23,826 --> 00:09:25,353
I’m fine.

189
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:26,773
You’re overthinking it.

190
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,046
You came up here because you don’t want to see people,

191
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:32,613
you don’t want to talk to anyone,

192
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:35,066
and you want to be yourself in a way no one has seen.

193
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,706
I don’t want this place to stop being your safe zone.

194
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,886
Wine.

195
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,846
Can you tell me what’s wrong?

196
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,680
BANG ON POCHANA

197
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:52,093
Wine from your mentoring group

198
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,493
and Faifa, the campus star?

199
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,433
Why the hell are you being so loud?

200
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:56,686
Keep your freaking voice down.

201
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,380
I wasn’t even that loud.

202
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:02,493
Honestly, I thought Gun was the only one

203
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,633
who could break the Perfect 10 Liners’ tradition.

204
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,986
Faifa is doing that too?

205
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,073
Yotha. Gun.

206
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:10,346
Don’t listen to this idiot.

207
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:11,326
He keeps talking nonsense.

208
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:12,806
When is your boyfriend picking you up?

209
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,720
You’re annoying me.

210
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,120
He’s coming with your boyfriend.

211
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,880
Don’t be annoyed with me.

212
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,700
I’m leaving soon.

213
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,226
I have dinner with my boyfriend.

214
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,493
Are you just telling us or are you bragging?

215
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:24,540
I’m bragging. What’s your problem?

216
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,886
Nothing.

217
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,893
Don’t make Pond jealous.

218
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:29,893
Damn.

219
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,340
Yo!

220
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:33,006
Hey.

221
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:34,406
- Hi.
- Hi.

222
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,066
Hi, guys.

223
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Hi.

224
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,240
Do you want some, Arc?

225
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:38,733
Yeah.

226
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,033
Jet and Pun can’t make it anymore.

227
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:42,026
They’re having dinner.

228
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Darling, do you want to go have dinner now?

229
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,473
Hurry and leave.

230
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:52,653
Be nice.

231
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:53,593
Or I’ll slap your eyes out.

232
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,353
Go.

233
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:55,646
Let’s go.

234
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,840
I’m annoyed with Arm.

235
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:57,886
Ugh.

236
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:58,566
Let’s go.

237
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:58,980
Let’s go.

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,100
See you next time, guys.

239
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:00,806
Bye.

240
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,833
Bye, Arc.

241
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:02,433
Bye.

242
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,913
I have an update about Faifa and Wine.

243
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,733
What is it?

244
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,160
I heard Wine himself say

245
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:18,420
that he has feelings for Fai.

246
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:19,360
What did you say?

247
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,920
It’s true, Yotha.

248
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,386
I heard it with my own ears.

249
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,826
So what do we do next?

250
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,800
Faifa won’t know how to approach him properly.

251
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,420
That’s true.

252
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,846
Unless we help him.

253
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,373
Actually, I’ve come up with a plan.

254
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:54,246
What’s the plan?

255
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,573
Tell me.

256
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,893
Oh, the plan he used with you two.

257
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,906
Arc, why did you tell him?

258
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,900
Don’t tell me that beach trip was your plan.

259
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,393
I knew it seemed weird.

260
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:16,733
Yotha.

261
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,400
Hmm?

262
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:19,020
Don’t tell me you were in on it with him.

263
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,313
Clear as day.

264
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,600
Come on.

265
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,600
It worked, didn’t it?

266
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,160
Without the group bracelets and my plan,

267
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:32,873
who knew when you two would’ve talked it out?

268
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,660
Am I right?

269
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,133
Chill.

270
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,893
Will it work this time?

271
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,140
The bracelets choose who to wear them together.

272
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,006
If it’s right, it’s right.

273
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:50,500
Trust me.

274
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,180
Did you also say that when it was my turn?

275
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,086
The same dialogue.

276
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,113
I spent 5 hours waiting at the airport for my mom.

277
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,673
At first, I thought her flight was delayed,

278
00:13:17,426 --> 00:13:19,420
so I called the airline to check.

279
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,460
They said the plane landed on time.

280
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,260
I was so worried

281
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,913
because I couldn’t get a hold of Mom.

282
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:32,480
So I called Dad right away

283
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,013
and he said Mom had some errands with her new family

284
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,906
and couldn’t fly here.

285
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,306
I was so upset

286
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,873
so I called Newton to tell him what happened.

287
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,826
But he already knew.

288
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,140
Yotha knew too.

289
00:13:58,453 --> 00:13:59,893
I was the only one who didn’t know.

290
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,126
That’s all.

291
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,653
I’m just feeling a bit slighted.

292
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:09,733
It’ll go away soon.

293
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,313
This is not the first time, is it?

294
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,413
How do you know?

295
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,646
I don’t.

296
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:31,730
But if this were the first time,

297
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:36,740
someone like you wouldn’t think it’s a big deal.

298
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,686
This is not the first time.

299
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,240
I don’t know how many times

300
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,073
Mom has chosen to ignore my feelings.

301
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:58,113
It’s like it’s written on my face that I’m okay.

302
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,780
Everyone believes that.

303
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,166
Who could I even tell that I’m not okay?

304
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:13,173
You can tell me.

305
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:36,973
My parents broke up.

306
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,660
Mom chose to take me with her,

307
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:44,660
but honestly, I didn’t want to be chosen.

308
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,920
I thought if I brought Faifa

309
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:51,713
who loves being with his Dad and brothers,

310
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,506
at least he would ask me

311
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,500
to bring him back to visit everyone often

312
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,553
and we’d all see each other sometimes.

313
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,880
Yotha lived with that trauma for like 10 years.

314
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:06,880
When Mom remarried,

315
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,513
she moved me back and left me here.

316
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,513
I couldn’t get along with anyone then.

317
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,346
I was so nervous.

318
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,330
I was afraid Yotha would hate me

319
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,373
because Mom chose to take me with her.

320
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,720
I was afraid I’d be abandoned somewhere else again.

321
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,700
I’m right here.

322
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,746
I’m by your side when you have no one.

323
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
Everyone else has already moved past it.

324
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,626
I’m moving to England

325
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,600
and I don’t know when I’ll be back.

326
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,613
You’re moving there?

327
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,400
Yes.

328
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,820
You know I love you, right?

329
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,386
Yes.

330
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:22,720
Newton is back to being a caring brother.

331
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,673
Yotha made up with Mom.

332
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,266
But the reason that cleared up his trauma

333
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,150
is what’s holding me back from moving forward.

334
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:54,630
Why do I have to be the one to sacrifice?

335
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,880
You have to get through this.

336
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,660
I have to make the people around me happy

337
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,900
so I can be happy.

338
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,720
Mom said

339
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:18,810
love won’t hurt me,

340
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,700
but why am I still hurting now?

But now,

00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,893
you do.

351
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,086
The world brought two people with problems together

352
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:18,080
to share them with each other.

353
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,780
We’ll get through it all together, okay?

354
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,780

The seniors invited me to hang out with the group.

363
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,300
When?

364
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,113
Now.

365
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,286
Are you going?

366
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:16,280
I’d rather keep you company.

367
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,413
But I want to go.

368
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
I’ve cried today.

369
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,893
I could use a drink.

370
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,666
What does that have to do with it?

371
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,513
Come with me.

372
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,510
Please.

373
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,400
Mm.

374
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,546
Yes!

375
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,800
Your mood changes so easily.

376
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:38,306
I told you I’m weird.

377
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:39,913
You can be weird all you want

378
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,220
as long as you’re being yourself when you’re with me.

379
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,906
Don’t force yourself to smile.

380
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,173
Don’t try to laugh.

381
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,170
And don’t make me worry.

382
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,880
Got it?

383
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,666
Got it.

384
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,306
Thank you.

385
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,340
No worries.

386
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,960
♪ You’ve made today perfect ♪

387
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,960
BANG ON POCHANA

388
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,133
Come on, Arm!

389
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,726
Don’t get drunk yet!

390
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,266
Let’s see if the plan works first.

391
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,693
Who said I’m drunk?

392
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:28,786
I’m not drunk, Gun.

393
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,140
Great.

394
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,540
Let’s bet

395
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:36,860
on whether Wine will bring Faifa.

396
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:39,120
Are you in?

397
00:21:39,446 --> 00:21:40,226
Do you want to play?

398
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:41,906
What happens if you lose the bet?

399
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,900
If you lose, you drink.

400
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,186
I’m putting two glasses on it.

401
00:21:46,206 --> 00:21:48,366
Wine is definitely bringing Faifa.

402
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:52,380
Hey, I want to bet that Faifa is coming too.

403
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,913
Yotha.

404
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:54,246
Hmm?

405
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,680
Can you bet that Faifa is not coming?

406
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,280
Please.

407
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:57,900
I want this bet to happen.

408
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,573
Please.

409
00:21:59,593 --> 00:22:00,460
Mm.

410
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,546
Mm what?

411
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,500
I bet Faifa is not coming.

412
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,580
You do as I say.

413
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,466
You’re the cutest.

414
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,140
I can’t believe you’re this down bad.

415
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,740
I don’t know either
why I’m this down bad.

416
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,973
Tan ta da dan tan tan
tan tan tan!

417
00:22:23,006 --> 00:22:25,420
Yay!

418
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:26,653
We guessed right, Arm!

419
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,520
Woohoo!

420
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,800
Bottoms up, Yotha!

421
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,360
- Down it!
- 	Bottoms up!

422
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,366
- Go!
- Come on!

423
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,546
Excuse me.

424
00:22:40,573 --> 00:22:42,706
What are you guys playing?

425
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,633
Nothing.

426
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,433
Just nonsense.

427
00:22:44,473 --> 00:22:45,913
I don’t know what you’re playing,

428
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,213
but cheers to that!

429
00:22:48,246 --> 00:22:50,280
I love that!

430
00:22:50,313 --> 00:22:52,300
Cheers!

431
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,486
Are you drinking tonight?

432
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:58,340
No.

433
00:22:58,526 --> 00:22:59,480
You go ahead.

434
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:00,873
I’ll take care of you tonight.

435
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,866
Let me drink my fill then, keeper.

436
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,393
Come on, cheers!

437
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:08,186
Cheers!

438
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,466
Cheers again!

439
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,180
What are we waiting for?

440
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:16,706
I love this song!

441
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,986
Come on!

442
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,746
Hey,

443
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,673
looks like we need to start the plan ourselves.

444
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,873
Agreed.

445
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:33,760
Cheers!

446
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,826
Wine.

447
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,733
Yes, Arc?

448
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,313
Why don’t you have the group bracelets yet?

449
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,620
The group bracelets?

450
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,393
What are they?

451
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:43,900
Oh, I haven’t told Wine yet.

452
00:23:43,926 --> 00:23:45,353
He probably doesn’t know.

453
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:45,806
Oh?

454
00:23:46,646 --> 00:23:48,393
You need to be punished.

455
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,453
That’s too harsh.

456
00:23:52,406 --> 00:23:54,400
Punished?

457
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,340
Alright, no punishment.

458
00:23:57,613 --> 00:24:00,220
But you need to get the group bracelets.

459
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,946
Make sure you get them within this month.

460
00:24:01,986 --> 00:24:04,153
If not, you’re out of the group.

461
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,433
Where can I buy them?

462
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:09,966
You can’t buy them.

463
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,100
Oh? Then where can I find them?

464
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:14,240
I heard that.

465
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:15,760
Here, Wine.

466
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,540
This is the group bracelet.

467
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,513
- I have one too.
- I have one too.

468
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:23,613
He has one too.

469
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,140
And he has one too.

470
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,800
We all have one

471
00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:28,073
but you don’t.

472
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,333
How did you get the group bracelet, Gun?

473
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:34,500
The Perfect 10 Liners bracelets come in pairs.

474
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,886
One is for you to wear.

475
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,446
The other is for someone you love.

476
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,433
Correct.

477
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,066
I don’t have one.

478
00:24:46,106 --> 00:24:50,473
I want to wear it too!

479
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:52,380
You don’t have it.

480
00:24:52,413 --> 00:24:53,893
There, there.

481
00:24:53,913 --> 00:24:55,890
I want to wear it!

482
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,093
Hey!

483
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:57,893
Faifa.

484
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,890
You’re even more drunk than me.

485
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,100
- That was so fast.
- 	I want Arc to help me up too.

486
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:03,706
Arm!

487
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,480
I want Yotha to help me up too.

488
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:06,706
Help me, Arc.

489
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:08,300
Help me, Yotha.

490
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,000
Gun!

491
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:09,680
Gun!

492
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,640
I can’t take this anymore.

493
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,946
I can’t.

494
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:27,900
Come on.

495
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,206
I’ll give you a ride to the on-campus dorm.

496
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,293
Can I stay and take care of Faifa?

497
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,793
He doesn’t like anyone meddling in his room.

498
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,500
But I’ve been here before.

499
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,453
Then just don’t get on his bed.

500
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,686
Fai doesn’t like that.

501
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,393
Uh…

502
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,513
Don’t tell me you’ve been on his bed before.

503
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:54,806
Yes.

504
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,420
Well, then you should have nothing to worry about.

505
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,560
I have to go.

506
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,840
Beagle is waiting in my car.

507
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:02,800
If anything happens,

508
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:03,766
don’t call me.

509
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:04,286
Sorry?

510
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:05,546
I’m going to sleep.

511
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:06,333
Oh, okay.

512
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:07,493
Wait, Yotha.

513
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,860
Can you tell me about the group bracelets?

514
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,693
Are you okay?

515
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,300
Go drop Wine off.

516
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,820
I already did.

517
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,893
Do you want to take a shower, Beagle?

518
00:26:34,586 --> 00:26:35,420
Yes.

519
00:26:48,766 --> 00:26:49,433
Come on.

520
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,140
Are you okay?

521
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,086
Let me kiss you.

522
00:27:07,246 --> 00:27:09,080
Beagle, you can’t do this.

523
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,113
Why not?

524
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,446
I have a boyfriend, so I have to kiss him.

525
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,460
Hold your neck straight.

526
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,073
Why don’t you stop?

527
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,146
It’s already dry.

528
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:45,306
You don’t want to get sick.

529
00:27:45,653 --> 00:27:47,650
If I do, you’ll just have to take care of me.

530
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,646
I’m almost done.

531
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,866
Finally, I can sleep.

532
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:56,986
You’re all set.

533
00:27:57,013 --> 00:27:58,260
Stop complaining.

534
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,260
Good night kiss.

535
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,720
Wine.

536
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,893
Can I turn off the lights?

537
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,360
Come sleep next to me.

538
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,606
Mm.

539
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,426
It’s so nice having you sleeping next to me.

540
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,370
I don’t like sleeping alone.

541
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,446
You don’t like sleeping alone?

542
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,686
Mm.

543
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,860
Before I moved out with Mom,

544
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:15,086
I used to share a bedroom with Yotha.

545
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,920
But when I moved back,

546
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,386
he wouldn’t let me do that anymore.

547
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,520
You know what?

548
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,993
In my freshman year,

549
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,760
when I moved into the on-campus dorm with Yotha,

550
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,166
I was so happy.

551
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,493
But once I found out he and Gun had feelings for each other,

552
00:29:35,513 --> 00:29:36,146
I…

553
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:38,140
You had to sacrifice again.

554
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,813
Yeah.

555
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,366
But I was willing to.

556
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,426
Seeing Yotha in a good relationship

557
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,726
made me happy I made that decision.

558
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,806
You’ve done so much for other people.

559
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,400
Don’t forget to do things for yourself too.

560
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,866
I’m doing that now.

561
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,506
I’m so happy.

562
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,060
This makes you happy already?

563
00:30:15,206 --> 00:30:15,793
No.

564
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:18,440
I’m so damn happy.

565
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,226
Me too.

566
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,146
Faifa.

567
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,860
Hmm?

568
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:38,860
About the Perfect 10 Liners bracelets…

569
00:30:38,893 --> 00:30:39,700
What about them?

570
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,580
Yotha said

571
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:44,560
I need to get them from the founding member.

572
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,546
You mean Tawan?

573
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,066
You know him?

574
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:49,880
I’ve heard about him.

575
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,873
They say he’s a free spirit
who gives off an uncle vibe.

576
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,813
He goes around selling handmade stuff,

577
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,810
living off his parents’ money.

578
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,386
If my family had money like his,

579
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:03,106
I’d splurge too.

580
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,220
So where do you have to go?

581
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,293
Tawan is opening a booth at
the Garden Music Festival in Nan.

582
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,126
Where?

583
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:11,753
In Nan.

584
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,646
Where?

585
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:13,553
It’s in Nan.

586
00:31:13,586 --> 00:31:14,746
I know it’s in Nan,

587
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:15,580
but where’s Nan?

588
00:31:15,606 --> 00:31:16,966
Nan is a city.

589
00:31:16,986 --> 00:31:17,880
Oh.

590
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:19,846
Why didn’t you say it properly?

591
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,226
When do you have to go?

592
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,093
Yotha is taking me next week.

593
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:28,486
Can you come with me?

594
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,200
Sure.

595
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,246
So easy.

596
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,440
When it comes to you, everything is easy.

597
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,420
There’s one more thing I want to ask you.

598
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:39,700
What is it?

599
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:46,546
Yotha said you don’t like anyone sleeping on your bed.

600
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,913
Is that true?

601
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,093
Yes, it’s true.

602
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,673
But I slept there twice already.

603
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,900
Why didn’t you tell me?

604
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,540
Because you’re not just anyone.

605
00:31:56,573 --> 00:31:58,133
You’re Wine.

606
00:31:58,173 --> 00:31:59,506
You’re not anyone else.

607
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,333
I have no more questions.

608
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,700
Let’s eat.

609
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,140
Jay.

610
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:23,060
Ben.

611
00:32:23,246 --> 00:32:24,780
Please let me go.

612
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,893
I’m sorry.

613
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,926
We have to do this.

614
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,660
When you ran away last time,

615
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:29,900
you almost got us in trouble.

616
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,480
If you run away again,

617
00:32:31,513 --> 00:32:32,946
you won’t collect all the activity points

618
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:34,760
and you won’t get your pin.

619
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,840
I’m fine with not getting a pin.

620
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:41,373
I don’t want to do PR.

621
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:43,370
I don’t like dressing up or having my photos taken.

622
00:32:43,413 --> 00:32:44,393
I’m sorry.

623
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,260
I really can’t let you get away, buddy.

624
00:32:46,286 --> 00:32:46,973
We mean well.

625
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,553
Okay.

626
00:32:48,573 --> 00:32:51,460
Our booth will sell T-shirts.

627
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,773
We have a hot model to promote our faculty T-shirts.

628
00:32:59,806 --> 00:33:02,226
That model is…

629
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,073
This can’t be true.

630
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:03,920
This can’t be true.

631
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,273
Our handsome Wine,

632
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:07,833
who just joined the Perfect 10 Liners this year.

633
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:09,426
Let’s give him a big hand.

634
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,680
I’m modeling too.

635
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,200
What’s he doing here?

636
00:33:19,126 --> 00:33:22,300
Did you come to the wrong major, Faifa?

637
00:33:22,353 --> 00:33:23,073
No.

638
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,066
Even if you did, I wouldn’t let you leave.

639
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:27,586
I’m not planning on leaving.

640
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,666
Don’t you have to join your major’s meeting?

641
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,313
Electrical Engineering is selling herbal drinks.

642
00:33:46,353 --> 00:33:47,600
I don’t want to hold the cups.

643
00:33:47,646 --> 00:33:48,793
I don’t think that’s very cool.

644
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,726
Tell me the truth.

645
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:55,786
A little bird told me someone’s looking sleepy

646
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:58,160
and about to cry because he has to do the photoshoot,

647
00:33:58,206 --> 00:34:00,453
so I’m going through all this trouble with you.

648
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
If it’s too much trouble, you don’t have to do it.

649
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,800
It’s only a little trouble

650
00:34:04,846 --> 00:34:06,866
but I’m very happy.

651
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,486
You both can wear L.

652
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,800
You’re the same size,

653
00:34:11,846 --> 00:34:13,800
but Wine’s body is a little smaller.

654
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,693
He really is small.

655
00:34:14,713 --> 00:34:15,853
I’ve hugged him before.

656
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:16,893
Faifa!

657
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,773
When’s the photoshoot, Mim?

658
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,980
You remember my name?

659
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:24,033
Of course.

660
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,760
We met during the orientation.

661
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,313
I’m so happy.

662
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,960
I didn’t expect you to remember.

663
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,933
Who could forget?

664
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,273
Anyway, you haven’t told me when the photoshoot is.

665
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,026
Probably next week.

666
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,240
We’re waiting for the mock-up T-shirts to arrive first.

667
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:38,686
Thank you so much, Faifa.

668
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:39,906
Thank you too, Wine.

669
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,786
You’re welcome.

670
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,640
Bye.

671
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,353
Let’s grab something to eat together.

672
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,680
I’m meeting my friends later.

673
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,053
They already left.

674
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:51,706
What?

675
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,193
How come?

676
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,040
I told them to leave.

677
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:58,060
I promised Jay and Ben I’d give you a ride to your dorm.

678
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,393
Then let’s….

679
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:02,280
Go back to your dorm after eating.

680
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,333
You’re forcing my hand.

681
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,330
While I’m forcing your hand, can I get your heart too?

682
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:08,953
Come on.

683
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,900
Let’s go grab something to eat.

684
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,626
Here’s your food.

685
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,706
Oh.

686
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,993
He’s here again.

687
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,940
♪ Again and again and again ♪

688
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,713
Hi, Phuri.

689
00:35:24,746 --> 00:35:25,580
Hi.

690
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,573
When it’s him,

691
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,500
there’s no need for extra chairs.

692
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,120
You’re special, you know?

693
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,800
What do you mean?

694
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,220
You talk too much.

695
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:38,726
Don’t slack off.

696
00:35:38,746 --> 00:35:39,733
Get back to work.

697
00:35:40,086 --> 00:35:42,333
Oh, okay.

698
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,166
- Sure.
- 	Go!

699
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,560
Enjoy your food.

700
00:35:48,633 --> 00:35:49,393
Eat that.

701
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,826
It’s delicious.

702
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,313
How many times have we eaten together?

703
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,893
Why do you ask?

704
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,280
Every time we’re here,

705
00:36:03,313 --> 00:36:05,280
I think of that notebook,

706
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,173
but I didn’t bring it.

707
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,726
If you forget to bring it,
you can’t check it off later.

708
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:10,786
Don’t forget the rules.

709
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,546
I remember the rules.

710
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,473
That’s why I didn’t bring it.

711
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,840
What do you mean?

712
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,426
I want to keep getting free food and drinks.

713
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,493
Not just 5 or 10 times

714
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,880
like you wrote in the notebook.

715
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,506
Wow, you want me to go broke, huh?

716
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,200
It’s alright, though.

717
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:31,200
I can treat you for the rest of your life.

718
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,846
Hello, Dad.

719
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,500
I’m busy tomorrow.

720
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:44,293
I don’t think I can make it to dinner.

721
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,253
Can you tell Mom I’ll go another day?

722
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:48,066
Okay.

723
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,893
Okay, bye.

724
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,260
Is your Mom coming?

725
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:56,180
Yeah.

726
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,620
She’s arriving tomorrow afternoon.

727
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,106
Aren’t you going to pick her up?

728
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,493
No.

729
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,286
She has a lot of kids.

730
00:37:02,326 --> 00:37:03,646
Let the others pick her up this time.

731
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,906
Are you still sulking?

732
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,373
I’ve cared too much about other people.

733
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,513
I want to protect my heart for a change.

734
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,973
Okay.

735
00:37:13,006 --> 00:37:14,133
That’s good.

736
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,913
I’m not being too unreasonable, am I?

737
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,910
No, you’re doing great.

738
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,300
Really?

739
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,860
Yes.

740
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,866
You’re doing really well.

741
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,666
I’m doing this well because I have you by my side.

742
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,920
Now, eat.

743
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,580
Okay.

744
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,260
Why are you smiling so much?

745
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,900
The clip is funny.

746
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,746
Your phone is upside down
and it’s still locked.

747
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:05,353
You’ve been glowing with a love aura lately.

748
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,706
You’re exaggerating.

749
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:07,966
I’m not a cartoon character

750
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,866
with an aura shining out of me.

751
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,713
I’m serious.

752
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,206
You might not realize it yet,

753
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:15,200
but let me tell you,

754
00:38:15,246 --> 00:38:18,193
you're back to being your cheerful self, little Wine.

755
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,886
Really?

756
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,240
Don’t forget to thank Faifa a lot.

757
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,366
Mm.

758
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,520
Are you in a hurry to go somewhere?

759
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,560
No.

760
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,286
Aren’t you going to see Faifa?

761
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,920
Why would I see him every day?

762
00:38:57,953 --> 00:38:59,533
Whatever.

763
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,706
Why?

764
00:39:01,746 --> 00:39:03,026
Are you two inviting me somewhere?

765
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,653
The seniors asked me to bring my car
to help carry stuff for setting up the booth.

766
00:39:05,686 --> 00:39:07,186
Can you come with me?

767
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:09,573
Are you guys on the art team?

768
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,506
Yeah.

769
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,326
Jay and I are helping with the booth.

770
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,660
We’re not having it easy like you, Mr. Model.

771
00:39:14,713 --> 00:39:18,000
If I could choose, I’d rather help you with the booth.

772
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:20,026
Then come with us.

773
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:21,046
Now?

774
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:21,713
Let’s go.

775
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,580
Is this the last round?

776
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,286
We’re done.

777
00:39:38,313 --> 00:39:38,733
Come on.

778
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,446
Let’s go.

779
00:39:39,466 --> 00:39:40,500
Let’s go, guys.

780
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,866
My body feels so sticky.

781
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,626
I want to take a shower.

782
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,053
Shit.

783
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,846
What?

784
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,233
CAN YOU CARRY THE STUFF ONE MORE TIME?

785
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:54,873
WE PUT IT UNDER THE FACULTY BUILDING.

786
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:55,960
Shit.

787
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,993
Can I use my model privileges to leave now?

788
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,906
No!

789
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,540
Let me go, friends.

790
00:40:04,573 --> 00:40:05,020
No.

791
00:40:05,046 --> 00:40:05,740
Stay and help.

792
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,153
Please let me go.

793
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,260
No!

794
00:40:26,706 --> 00:40:28,700
Guys, let’s go.

795
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,320
Let me take a little break.

796
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,153
I’m so sore I have no energy to press the accelerator.

797
00:40:33,173 --> 00:40:33,880
Yeah.

798
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,886
Well, I think we should leave.

799
00:40:42,926 --> 00:40:44,060
I have the energy now.

800
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,820
What’s wrong with you guys?

801
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,880
You act like you’ve seen a ghost.

802
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,313
Here I am.

803
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,900
The most handsome ghost in the world.

804
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:59,346
What are you doing, kids?

805
00:40:59,366 --> 00:41:01,126
It’s late. Why haven’t you gone home?

806
00:41:01,153 --> 00:41:02,206
Faifa!

807
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,873
We were carrying stuff for the booth,

808
00:41:03,906 --> 00:41:04,880
but we’re done and about to leave.

809
00:41:04,906 --> 00:41:06,640
Are you done with your task, Faifa?

810
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:07,866
Do you want to walk back with us?

811
00:41:07,906 --> 00:41:10,880
It’s kind of eerie walking alone.

812
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,026
I’m not done yet.

813
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,726
I have to get back to organizing the stuff.

814
00:41:13,753 --> 00:41:14,693
You guys can go ahead without me.

815
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,413
Safe trip home.

816
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,886
He’s a little weird, isn’t he?

817
00:41:20,913 --> 00:41:22,400
He'll probably be here for a while.

818
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:23,560
Do you want to stay and…?

819
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,386
Look at him.

820
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,633
Just now, he said he wanted to go back to the dorm.

821
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:29,873
Let’s go.

822
00:41:29,886 --> 00:41:31,870
Looks like your friend will be here for a long time.

823
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,660
My mom is back.

824
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,713
She keeps asking me to have a meal with her.

825
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:38,710
The other day, she even came to my condo.

826
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,986
So, you’re hiding here.

827
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:44,973
At least I can work and not think about anything crazy.

828
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,780
Why didn’t you call me?

829
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,986
Why did you come here alone?

830
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,300
Why didn’t you leave with your friends?

831
00:41:51,346 --> 00:41:53,300
I want to keep you company.

832
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,106
You’re the reason I can’t be alone.

833
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,193
You have me.

834
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,133
Why do you want to be alone?

835
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,480
You’re such a sweet talker these days.

836
00:42:05,513 --> 00:42:06,753
I mean it.

837
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,066
You’re cute.

838
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,686
Since you’re here,

839
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,680
can you watch my performance rehearsal?

840
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,700
What performance?

841
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,513
For the Engineers Market.

842
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,180
I promised the seniors I’d perform.

843
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,620
Shall we go now?

844
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,433
- Let’s go.
- Mm.

845
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:39,933
Hello. Test.

846
00:42:39,953 --> 00:42:41,666
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

847
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:42,833
Sounds good.

848
00:42:42,866 --> 00:42:44,186
Don’t forget to dance, Wine.

849
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:45,553
Start singing already.

850
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,993
Greetings to my dear family and friends!

851
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:55,186
Don’t say that!

852
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,126
It’s so old-school.

853
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,006
What should I say then?

854
00:42:59,053 --> 00:43:01,000
Just walk up, smile,

855
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,353
and people will already be falling hard for your charm.

856
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,313
Is that it?

857
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:05,606
Mm.

858
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,593
So…have you fallen for my charm yet?

859
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,900
Just sing already.

Wine.

882
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,733
Wine?

883
00:45:07,753 --> 00:45:08,586
Wine!

884
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,800
What are you lost in thought about?

885
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,513
You didn’t hear my question.

886
00:45:14,553 --> 00:45:17,460
What did you ask me again?

887
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,886
I asked if I sang well.

888
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,033
After you finish singing at the event,

889
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:27,860
many more people will definitely fall for you.

890
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,840
Why do you think so?

891
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,326
Because…

892
00:45:47,573 --> 00:45:48,860
Because you like me?

893
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,520
Well…

894
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,213
When you were singing and looking down,

895
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,486
you looked so charming.

896
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:05,053
Your voice.

897
00:46:05,073 --> 00:46:06,486
Your smile.

898
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,280
I couldn’t take my eyes off you.

899
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,600
You felt that way?

900
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,766
Did you just feel it now

901
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,146
or have you been feeling it for a long time?

902
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,626
Why do you ask like that?

903
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,166
Because I’ve been feeling it for a long time.

904
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,506
I really can’t take my eyes off you.

905
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,380
I like you, Wine.

906
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,093
If I wanted to ask someone to be in a relationship,

907
00:47:24,126 --> 00:47:25,900
what should I do to impress them?

908
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:28,260
You’re not presenting the T-shirts right now.

909
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:30,533
Give them a bouquet

910
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:33,740
and tell the whole world.

911
00:47:33,773 --> 00:47:35,166
Make it loud.

912
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,780
I’ll shout it from the stage.

913
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,593
Huh?

914
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,940
He’s asking him to be his boyfriend?

915
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,220
Do you really have to smile so much while rehearsing?

916
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:43,906
You’re crazy.

917
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,220
I want to be by your side, Faifa.

918
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,100
I get it now.
