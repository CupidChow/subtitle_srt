1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,800
Oh, shit!

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,520
Why did you go out in the rain and get soaked?

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,320
Do we know each other?

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,200
Just say you’re worried about him.

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,160
Why are you being so tight-lipped?

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,320
Take my car.

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,080
I have a class at 8:40 a.m. tomorrow.

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,160
Come pick me up.

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,240
Arc!

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,720
I’m sorry.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,520
From now on,

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,720
I’ll take the best care of you.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,640
When I got into that accident,

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,520
I was in shock.

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,280
Like this.

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,600
Honestly, you had some guts, Arc.

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,080
I can’t believe you crashed into another car like that.

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,240
I’d never do that.

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,960
I love my car too much.

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,800
Come on.

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,680
He has four cars at home.

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,400
He can use any of them while one’s being repaired.

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,400
Really?

24
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,080
Jet, you’re exaggerating.

25
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,080
Since that day,

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,480
Arc has never changed his car again.

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,960
And he’s become so calm.

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,400
No more speeding, let alone honking the horn.

29
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,480
You’re worried about me, right?

30
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,520
Right?

31
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,600
You’re drunk.

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,760
You should go home.

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,680
You always run away when you’re shy.

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,640
Just say you love me.

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,360
I always tell you I love you.

36
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,040
Love you, Arc.

37
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,560
This cute guy is mine.

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,440
Let me rub my face against yours.

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
He’s not okay.

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,840
I’m leaving, guys.

41
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,760
Enjoy.

42
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,680
Let’s go.

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,520
Safe trip home.

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,520
Bye.

45
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,280
Bye, Arc. Bye, Arm.

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,080
Are we leaving already?

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,880
Bye, guys.

48
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,960
- Bye.
- Bye.

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,760
- Bye. Safe trip home.
- We have to go.

50
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,320
- Safe trip home.
- See you.

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,280
Enjoy.

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,720
I’ll split the bill and let you know.

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,280
Okay.

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,680
Shall we leave too?

55
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,880
The bar is almost closing.

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,480
Anything works for me.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,120
Do you want to leave yet, Yeepun?

58
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,600
Let’s go, babe.

59
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,840
See you next time, guys.

60
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,760
Today was so much fun.

61
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,320
See you, everyone.

62
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,400
Bye, Jet. Bye, Pun.

63
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,120
Let’s go.

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,520
Bye.

65
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,480
Bye, guys.

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,240
Bye.

67
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,720
Shall we go?

68
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,240
Yes.

69
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
But I want to buy fried chicken with sticky rice
on our way back.

70
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,280
I’m hungry.

71
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,480
Of course.

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,880
By the way, freshmen live in the on-campus dorm, right?

73
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,600
I’ll give you a ride.

74
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,200
No need.

75
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,560
I’m passing the on-campus dorm.

76
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,480
I’ll give him a ride.

77
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,760
Excuse me.

78
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,760
Wine is my peer mentee.

79
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,000
You’re sticking your nose in.

80
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Come on.

81
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,120
You guys leave in pairs.

82
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,440
Do you want me to leave alone?

83
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,200
You know I don’t like leaving alone.

84
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,080
I’m lonely.

85
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Can I borrow your peer mentee for a day?

86
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,520
Please. Can I?

87
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,880
Well, I can go with Faifa.

88
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,560
You’re the cutest.

89
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,480
Let me kiss you on the forehead.

90
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,000
Ouch!

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,760
What?

92
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,400
Fai!

93
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,200
What?

94
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,280
I told you Wine is my peer mentee.

95
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,760
He’s not someone you can mess with.

96
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,960
Calm down.

97
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,400
I promise I won’t treat him
the way I did the others.

98
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,360
What do you mean?

99
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,480
He’s not like anyone else.

100
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,440
Right, Wine?

101
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,480
BANG ON POCHANA

102
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,360
I’m fine.

103
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,880
I haven’t even asked.

104
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
Our ride is almost here.

105
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,960
Are you sleepy?

106
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,320
A little bit.

107
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,360
Hey, you have class early tomorrow morning.

108
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,720
Will you be able to wake up?

109
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,760
It’s okay.

110
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,120
My boyfriend can wake me up.

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
Are you sober now?

112
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,360
Yes, I am.

113
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,080
How are we getting home?

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,680
Driving, of course.

115
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,280
But you were drinking.

116
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,160
How can you drive now?

117
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,400
Come on, it’s fine.
I only had a little.

118
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,360
It’s against the law.

119
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,880
Then I’ll need your help.

120
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,200
I can’t.

121
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,440
I drank too.

122
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,640
Besides, I can’t drive.

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,360
What I mean is, I’ll need you to sit with me
until my blood alcohol level drops.

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,960
Is that okay?

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,560
Yeah.

126
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,240
We’re here to wait for your blood alcohol level to drop,

127
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,440
not to eat.

128
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,960
No need to rush.

129
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,760
I forgot.

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The food is good.

131
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,280
Aren’t you going to eat?

132
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,320
Do you always drink and drive?

133
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,600
Sometimes.

134
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,120
It’s dangerous

135
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,040
both to yourself and others on the road.

136
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,440
You’re so strict.

137
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,160
I’m not scolding you,

138
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,120
just explaining.

139
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,840
I promise that from now on,
if I drink, I’ll never drive

140
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,880
because I don’t want Master Wine to worry about me.

141
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,680
Sir.

142
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,440
Is that okay?

143
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,840
You look like you want to talk to me about something.

144
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,120
Are you uncomfortable?

145
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,200
Huh?

146
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,640
Are you uncomfortable with me bothering you?

147
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,920
No.

148
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,880
Really?

149
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,360
That’s a relief.

150
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,880
Why would you think I’m uncomfortable?

151
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,320
Because Yotha is so possessive of you.

152
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,880
Look at what he said to me.

153
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,280
I’m starting to believe it.

154
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,080
Why are you worried I’ll be uncomfortable?

155
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,160
Because I always see you looking sleepy, lonely, and down.

156
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,400
I just want you to have fun when you’re with me.

157
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,680
Do I make you feel that way?

158
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,560
Yes.

159
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,200
There’s one more thing I want to ask you.

160
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,240
What is it?

161
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,360
Is something wrong?

162
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,480
Why do you ask?

163
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,160
Because you used to be more cheerful.

164
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,560
Lately, you’ve been looking sad,

165
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,160
like you have something on your mind.

166
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,680
Can you read people’s minds?

167
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,400
So I’m right, aren’t I?

168
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,960
I knew it.

169
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,560
I should’ve bought lottery tickets.

170
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,440
I would’ve won.

171
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,120
Hey. Lie down properly.

172
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,960
Do you want to sleep now or take a shower first?

173
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,600
Come on. Why do you ask?

174
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,760
You already know the answer.

175
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
You’re dirty.

176
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,960
Dirty?

177
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,760
Do you love me when I’m dirty?

178
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,440
Of course, I love you.

179
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,240
Hey. What’s with the lovey-dovey act?

180
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,920
Can you continue telling me the story?

181
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,680
What story?

182
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,880
Our story.

183
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,400
You haven’t finished telling it.

184
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,760
Can you continue?

185
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,680
You already know the whole story.

186
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,120
I want to hear it often.

187
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,440
I want to hear why you love me again.

188
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,240
Please.

189
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,400
Please.

190
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,040
Please.

191
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,920
Can you tell me again?

192
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,880
You’re not hurt anymore, right?

193
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,280
No, it’s only a little scratch.

194
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,000
At the time of the accident,

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,400
I was so shocked.

196
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,280
When Arc called,

197
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,960
I was so shocked, too.

198
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,400
Luckily, none of you got badly hurt.

199
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,800
But Arc,

200
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
you can’t keep doing things like that.

201
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,360
It’s dangerous for both you and Arm.

202
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,080
If something happened to him,

203
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,600
who would take responsibility?

204
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,960
Not to mention the other party.

205
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,400
We’re talking about someone’s life.

206
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,040
No matter how much money you have,

207
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,880
you can’t make up for that.

208
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,200
I’m sorry, Jet.

209
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,600
Alright.

210
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,160
Since no one got really hurt,

211
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,920
let’s stop talking about it.

212
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,560
Yeah.

213
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,120
Okay?

214
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,280
Let’s eat.

215
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,400
I’m going to the restroom.

216
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,480
Is something wrong with Arc?

217
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,040
I don’t know.

218
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,200
I’ve never seen him like this.

219
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,160
This time, it’s really serious for him.

220
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,760
He risked Arm’s life too.

221
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,320
Me?

222
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Hello.

223
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,480
What is it?

224
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,040
Pun is going to order desserts.

225
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,760
Do you want anything?

226
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,640
Can you leave me alone for a while?

227
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,680
No.

228
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,120
Arm.

229
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,680
Honestly, I’m mad at you for being hot-headed.

230
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,080
It was really dangerous, you know?

231
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,600
You usually get hot-headed
and do something like that, right?

232
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,120
But this time, you’re feeling bad because I was with you.

233
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,680
Am I right?

234
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,520
I’m glad you feel guilty,

235
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,040
but that’s not completely right.

236
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
What are you saying?

237
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,840
You shouldn’t feel guilty
just because you’re worried about someone else.

238
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,280
You should know there are people who worry about you, too.

239
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,800
You’re worried about me.

240
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,920
I’m worried about you, too.

241
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,320
Got it?

242
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,800
Do you understand?

243
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,320
Yeah.

244
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,240
Come on.

245
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
If you understand, you should nod.

246
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,720
Like this.

247
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,040
Don’t mess with my head.

248
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,120
I’m your senior.

249
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,640
Oh, I forgot my place.

250
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,680
Let’s go eat some desserts.

251
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,880
I want to eat ice cream already.

252
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,760
This meal is on you, okay?

253
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
Consider it your way of compensating me.

254
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,480
Let’s go.

255
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,560
Jet will give you a ride.

256
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,640
Both of you.

257
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,880
It’s okay.

258
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,640
My family already brought me another car.

259
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,120
Alright.

260
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,400
Safe drive, then.

261
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,520
Are you going with Arc?

262
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,480
Do you still dare to ride in his car?

263
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,120
We can split here.

264
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,520
Arm can go with Jet.

265
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,600
It’s fine.

266
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,880
I want to sit in every one of Arc’s cars.

267
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,040
This one looks beautiful.

268
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,520
The seats should be soft.

269
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,880
I’m leaving now.

270
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,560
Bye, Pun.

271
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,360
- Bye, Jet.
- Bye.

272
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,880
Okay.

273
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,960
Safe trip home.

274
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,840
Bye.

275
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,840
Come on.

276
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,520
Arm is cute,
don’t you think?

277
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,520
Wow.

278
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,360
This car is brand new.

279
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,520
Wow.

280
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,240
It’s so high-tech.

281
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,360
Can we turn on some music?

282
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,440
Sure.

283
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,000
Here we go.

284
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
Aren’t you scared anymore?

285
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,040
No.

286
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,680
You said you wouldn’t hurt me again, didn’t you?

287
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,000
Besides,

288
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,560
this car looks safe.

289
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,480
Sit still.

290
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,800
♪ I can only love you secretly ♪

291
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,080
Good boy.

292
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,880
Ahem.

293
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,840
I saw you secretly smiling.

294
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,800
Mind your own business.

295
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,400
Arm is really something.

296
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,200
He managed to throw Arc off balance.

297
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,800
Just like when I met you.

298
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
I hung up my fangs and claws

299
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,360
and became a kitten.

300
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,040
Arm is really cute.

301
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,760
This is just the beginning.

302
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,280
I think Arm can mess with Arc so much more.

303
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,160
Thanks for the ride.

304
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,320
Bye now.

305
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,120
Hey, wait.

306
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,520
I got you into an accident.

307
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,440
You can scold me as much as you want.

308
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,240
Wow.

309
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,040
As much as I want?

310
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,920
Hmm.

311
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,280
I can’t think of anything yet.

312
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,280
Can I keep my quota?

313
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,040
You’re getting on my nerves.

314
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,760
Come on, Arc.

315
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,560
You said I could scold you,

316
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,160
but you scolded me first.

317
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,680
Hmm.

318
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,640
I don’t know.

319
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,760
I can’t think of anything.

320
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,280
When I can, I’ll scold you then.

321
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,800
I have to go. Bye.

322
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,800
Why didn’t you go with Jet?

323
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
Why did you jump into my car?

324
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,760
Is that a problem?

325
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,400
I thought you’d have had enough
and not dare to get into my car again.

326
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,360
Well, I trust you now.

327
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,000
Huh?

328
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,960
You said you wouldn’t hurt me again, didn’t you?

329
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,520
Aw.

330
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,000
You’re touched, right?

331
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,760
Here.

332
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,760
What?

333
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,400
You can unblock yourself

334
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,280
on every app.

335
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,680
Every app?

336
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,560
That’s great.

337
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,320
Do you really mean every app?

338
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,640
Yeah.

339
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,960
Give it back.

340
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,240
No.

341
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,360
Ah.

342
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,880
It’s so cool in here.

343
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,440
Oh, you’re here, Po.

344
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,600
Where’s Sand?

345
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,240
He's been gone since the afternoon.

346
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
I don’t know what he’s doing.

347
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,920
I’m so tired.

348
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,280
Was the movie fun?

349
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,920
Fun, my ass.

350
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,040
I didn’t watch it.

351
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,120
Why not?

352
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,560
It’s a long story.

353
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,560
I’ll tell you later.

354
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,400
It’s a long story, huh?

355
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,840
I better take a shower.

356
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,560
Damn it!

357
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,920
What’s wrong?

358
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,440
What happened?

359
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,080
A cat scratched me.

360
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,880
Or a girl.

361
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,360
It’s my business.

362
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,560
Wow, you’re really something.

363
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,120
Whoa.

364
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,440
Shit.

365
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,880
I’m going to take a shower.

366
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,480
Hey.

367
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,400
What?

368
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,320
What are you doing?

369
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,400
It’s a long story.

370
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,320
You got me.

371
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,080
Yes, I did.

372
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,840
What’s wrong with you?

373
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,200
Electric shock?

374
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,760
Electric shock, then what?

375
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,240
Die.

376
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,840
Yes.

377
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,360
Correct.

378
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,080
Hey.

379
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,360
Hi, Arc.

380
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,040
What are you doing here?

381
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,360
I invited him,

382
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,480
since you stole his roommate this morning.

383
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,920
I didn’t want him to feel lonely, so I asked him to come along.

384
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,840
I was just asking,

385
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,640
not complaining.

386
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,240
Let’s talk about you.

387
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,440
Where did you get in trouble?

388
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,600
Who spread the news to you?

389
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,120
Huh?

390
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,280
Your mom called me.

391
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,560
No one spread it.

392
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,120
My mom?

393
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,760
Yeah, she called, asking me to take care of you

394
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,960
and warn you about your driving.

395
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,600
Old habits die hard, huh?

396
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,920
Be careful when you drive.

397
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,280
This time, you hurt a junior.

398
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,920
Oh.

399
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,680
Is it the scratch Arm posted on his story?

400
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,680
What story?

401
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,000
Here.

402
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,320
Arm!

403
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,160
Someone’s calling you!

404
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Just decline it!

405
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,680
I’m in the shower!

406
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,880
Oh, shit!

407
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,560
Arm!

408
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,360
What?

409
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,720
It’s Arc.

410
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,680
Shit!

411
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
Give me a second!

412
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,920
Where?

413
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,240
Here.

414
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,600
Oh, shit.

415
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,160
Why are you naked?

416
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,680
Come on. Don’t be shy.

417
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,320
You’ve seen me since kindergarten.

418
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,200
That was when you were a kid.

419
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,920
You’re a grownup now.

420
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,960
You might not be embarrassed

421
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
but I’m going to vomit.

422
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,160
I’m still as cute as ever.

423
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,680
It’s still as small as ever.

424
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,720
As if yours are so much bigger than mine.

425
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
Come on.

426
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,960
I almost got blind.

427
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,080
Hello?

428
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,280
You might as well post naked on your IG.

429
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,960
Why are you mad?

430
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,880
He’s just his peer mentor’s mentor

431
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,160
but he’s possessive of him.

432
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,760
He’s gone.

433
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,520
Hello?

434
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,720
Hello? Are you still there?

435
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,120
Why did you take a photo shirtless?

436
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,560
Only my shoulder can be seen.

437
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,160
I didn’t take off my shirt.

438
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,680
I can tell that you did.

439
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,400
So what if I did?

440
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,280
Are you possessive of me?

441
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,120
Don’t flatter yourself.

442
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,040
Delete it now.

443
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,600
Fine.

444
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,720
If I delete my story, you’ll be happy, right?

445
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,160
Yeah.

446
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,560
Only when you have half as many six-packs as I do,
can you think about showing them off.

447
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,600
You have a big belly. It’s embarrassing.

448
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,800
Fine.

449
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,880
You want to be like this?

450
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,920
Fine.

451
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,360
You want to be like this?

452
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,480
DON’T FORGET TO APPLY YOUR MEDICINE.

453
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,160
I feel so comfortable!

454
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,480
Have you seen Arc’s comment?

455
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,080
What did he say?

456
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,320
I bet he’s furious with me.

457
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,280
I’m so satisfied.

458
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,120
I got back at him.

459
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,440
Have a look.

460
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,640
What?

461
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,000
DON’T FORGET TO APPLY YOUR MEDICINE.

462
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,360
He’s definitely trying to get on my nerves.

463
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,800
He’s definitely trying to get on my nerves.

464
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,400
Shit!

465
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,080
Damn it!

466
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,400
He’s trying to get on my nerves.

467
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,640
Damn it!

468
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,560
Um, is this you looking satisfied?

469
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,240
Shut up, Po!

470
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,800
I’m going to sleep!

471
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,760
Come on, the sun hasn’t even set,

472
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,040
but you’re going to sleep already?

473
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,560
I knew it.

474
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,440
Hello?

475
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,960
Why did you call me?

476
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,440
You haven’t replied to me.

477
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,960
Have you applied your medicine?

478
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,640
Yes!

479
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,000
I already did!

480
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,960
Okay. Bye.

481
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,960
I lost!

482
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,720
Hey.

483
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,040
Who are you talking to?

484
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,280
None of your business.

485
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,520
Thank you for the ride

486
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,680
and the meal.

487
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,960
I’m so full.

488
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,720
Do you like the restaurant?

489
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,200
Very much.

490
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,080
The food is so good.

491
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,400
It’s definitely the hidden gem you said it would be.

492
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,040
Then I’ll take you there often.

493
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,280
I’m heading out now.

494
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,000
Drive safe.

495
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,880
Good night.

496
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,640
Good night.

497
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,480
See you.

498
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,520
Safe trip home.

499
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,520
Let me know when you get there.

500
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,080
Bye.

501
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,200
Hey, you’re quiet.

502
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,000
What’s this?

503
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,160
It’s only 8 p.m. and you guys are sleeping already?

504
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,720
I’m not, but your friend is having a sweet dream.

505
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,560
What? His wound is so small.

506
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,200
Why is he lying in bed like that?

507
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,240
What a loser.

508
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,640
The wound on his body might not be healed yet,

509
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,120
but the one in his heart is fully healed.

510
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,600
Does this mean you’re avoiding me by sleeping?

511
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,320
Hey, hey.

512
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,480
Wake up, loser!

513
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,760
He might actually be asleep.

514
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,600
Don’t bully him.

515
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,880
You know what, Po?

516
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,760
I have a way to prove if he’s really asleep.

517
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,520
If someone’s really asleep

518
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,480
and I make his hands form a heart shape like this,

519
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,800
his hands will stay in the air.

520
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,160
This means he’s not asleep.

521
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,080
Really, Arm?

522
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,200
I want to sleep!

523
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,120
You can’t sleep!

524
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,560
What’s going on between you and Arc?

525
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,720
Yeah, what’s going on?

526
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,560
Nothing!

527
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,720
Nothing, huh?

528
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,040
I want to sleep!

529
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,240
Damn it, Po!

530
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,880
Arc, Warm, I made you some snacks.

531
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,000
Thank you.

532
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,440
Wow, these look so good.

533
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,600
Enjoy.

534
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,000
Hey, I have to go.

535
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,200
Okay.

536
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,000
See you in class.

537
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,520
Why aren’t you in class?

538
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,080
Oh, shit!

539
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,080
You scared me.

540
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,120
What are you waiting for?

541
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,240
I’m waiting for Pun to bring me her calculus books.

542
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,080
Here.

543
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,880
Is it this one?

544
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Yes, it is.

545
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,120
You have it too?

546
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,400
It’s Pun’s.

547
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,640
She asked me to give it to you.

548
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Why didn’t you tell me that in the beginning?

549
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,320
Aren’t there supposed to be two books?

550
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,520
Yeah.

551
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,560
Where’s the other one?

552
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,520
Let me know when you finish this one

553
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
and I’ll bring you the other.

554
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,360
Why didn’t you bring me both at once?

555
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,560
Why should I?

556
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,520
To not waste time.

557
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,080
But I want to waste time.

558
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,800
Just let me know when you finish this one

559
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,200
and I’ll bring you the other.

560
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,560
I’m going now.

561
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,800
Where are you going?

562
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,160
Stay out of my business for once.

563
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,080
What’s wrong with him?

564
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,560
What’s wrong with you, Po?

565
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,880
You’re the one sighing non-stop.

566
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,960
Come on.

567
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,440
Hey,

568
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,760
I’m heading back.

569
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,720
If you’re lonely, just tell us,

570
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,160
so we can keep you company in your room.

571
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,200
There’s no need.

572
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,200
Oh, maybe you have someone waiting in the room.

573
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah.

574
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,960
No.

575
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,160
Hey, why did you raise your voice?

576
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,080
Hey, hey.

577
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,720
You said you’d wait for us

578
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,240
but your mentor’s mentor always drops you off at the dorm.

579
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,560
He’s right.

580
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,160
That’s why I’m a little confused.

581
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,080
Hey, Po.

582
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,320
Listen to me.

583
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:41,960
I’m listening.

584
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,000
I’m going back to our room.

585
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,440
I’ll be right back.

586
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
I’m thirsty.

587
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,400
Here you go.

588
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,960
I don’t drink anyone else's stuff.

589
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,000
It’s not anyone else’s.

590
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,680
They bought it for you.

591
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,360
I don’t drink anything that anyone else buys for me.

592
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,560
Fine.

593
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,440
Give me a moment.

594
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,280
Here you go.

595
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,480
Open it for me.

596
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,560
Here.

597
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,480
Thanks.

598
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,760
Save it.

599
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,560
Arm!

600
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,880
Can I go home now?

601
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,320
I’ll give you a ride.

602
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,240
Oh, you don’t have to.

603
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,720
Why not?

604
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,840
Why can’t I give you a ride?

605
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,160
No, I just don’t want to trouble you.

606
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,720
You don’t want to trouble me?

607
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,000
Give me the truth.

608
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,080
Uh,

609
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,040
I don’t want my friends to tease me.

610
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,720
Po and Sand are watching me.

611
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,120
Why are they watching you?

612
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,520
I don’t know.

613
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,440
What’s wrong with you?

614
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,840
Are you shy?

615
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
It feels like you…

616
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,320
I’m not shy.

617
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,480
Okay?

618
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,000
I’m almost done.

619
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,280
Wait and let’s leave together.

620
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,000
Don’t be stubborn.

621
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:18,960
Shy?

622
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,120
Am I shy?

623
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,280
Shit, I’m not shy!

624
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,480
That’s crazy!

625
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,640
The people who gave these to you would be so sad.

626
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,360
I didn’t ask them to.

627
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,280
You’re so mean.

628
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,600
I really didn’t ask them to.

629
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,880
Besides, I don’t like eating snacks.

630
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,600
You know that.

631
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,520
Why should I know that?

632
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,600
Don’t you want to get to know me at all?

633
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,360
Huh?

634
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,440
Get to know you?

635
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,760
You’re selfish.

636
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,520
Hey, Arc!

637
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,480
Shit!

638
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,120
How am I selfish?

639
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,760
I’m not selfish.

640
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,920
You’re selfish

641
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,960
because I’m the only one trying to get to know you.

642
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:20,920
What?

643
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,240
When will you get it, Arm?

644
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,800
Fine,

645
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,400
I’ll get to know you too.

646
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,880
Get this into your head.

647
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,520
I’m not selfish.

648
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,840
Get to know him for what?

649
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,160
What’s wrong with him?

650
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Why did you bring me here?

651
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,000
This is my favorite restaurant.

652
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,200
So?

653
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,400
Come on.

654
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,000
You said you’d get to know me, didn’t you?

655
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,040
Oh, right.

656
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,040
I forgot.

657
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,720
Here.

658
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,360
Order anything you want.

659
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,200
No.

660
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,600
What’s wrong with you now?

661
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,160
Well, you said I’m getting to know you today.

662
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,160
So just order anything you like

663
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,840
so I can remember it.

664
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,760
Mm.

665
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,480
Okay.

666
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:36,960
Hey.

667
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,440
Hmm?

668
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,960
Should we leave now?

669
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:38,920
Hold on.

670
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,320
What are you waiting for?

671
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,520
You didn’t bring your motorbike, did you?

672
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,440
Exactly.

673
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,000
So,

674
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,200
Get in the car.

675
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,440
Pond will give us a ride.

676
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,280
Hi, Pond.

677
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,000
Hi.

678
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,720
How should I feel about this?

679
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,080
When did you guys make this plan?

680
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,080
Wow.

681
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,880
The crispy pork is so big.

682
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,960
I just realized you like crispy pork too.

683
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,840
I don’t.

684
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,560
Oh?

685
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,360
Then why did you order it?

686
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,520
Because I know you like it.

687
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,760
It’s your favorite.

688
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
I remember that correctly, right?

689
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,520
Yes.

690
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,840
By the way, tomorrow is the pin-receiving ceremony.

691
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,400
Are you joining?

692
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,720
Why would I join?

693
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,880
You’re not getting one.

694
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,640
I thought maybe you’d want to laugh at me

695
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,560
for not joining the cheering activities

696
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,040
and not getting my gear and pin.

697
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,040
I’m so annoyed.

698
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,360
It’s just a pin.

699
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,280
You can buy one yourself.

700
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,480
Yeah, I guess so.

701
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,880
You haven’t answered me though.

702
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,720
About what?

703
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,000
Do you like this?

704
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,200
What’s your answer?

705
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,720
Yeah.

706
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,240
The food is tasty.

707
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,120
Try it.

708
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,360
Hey.

709
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,720
The way you’re staring at me like this…

710
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,480
Who’s staring at you?

711
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
I’m not staring at you.

712
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,480
If you’re lying, I hope you choke on your food.

713
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,400
So, should I give you CPR?

714
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,880
Oh, I’m fine now.

You might as well pack your clothes and move in here.

724
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,760
Damn.

725
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,880
His clothes are all in my closet.

726
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,120
My roommate snores.

727
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,560
Let me stay with you.

728
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,360
Yeah, you wouldn’t leave even if I tried to send you away.

729
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,040
That’s right.

730
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,160
Let’s talk about you.

731
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
Where have you been?

732
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,120
I had an errand to run.

733
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Mind your own business.

734
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,000
Is your errand tasty?

735
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,240
What?

736
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,360
Here’s what.

737
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,000
Here it is.

738
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,200
Was the food good?

739
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,200
Your nose is flaring.

740
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,240
Look at that face.

741
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,880
You’re shy.

742
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,640
You’re smiling.

743
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,560
I’m going to take a shower.

744
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,000
Hey, there’s no shower on the balcony.

745
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,160
I was going to watch the birds and fish.

746
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,680
Damn it.

747
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,960
Fish on the balcony?

748
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,320
You want to watch the birds, sure.

749
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,480
So was the food good?

750
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,520
None of your business.

751
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,120
It’s okay. We have our motorbike.

752
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,160
See you at uni tomorrow.

753
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,800
Okay. I have to go.

754
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,600
Next time you want to post my photo,

755
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,760
choose a good one.

756
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,960
I was chewing, Arc.

757
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,720
Thank you so much for this loneliness, guys.

758
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,160
Guys, if you’re getting your pins,

759
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,840
please gather in the auditorium.

760
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,000
Don’t be late.

761
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,600
Got it.

762
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,320
I’m too lazy to get this pin thing.

763
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,480
Can we skip the ceremony?

764
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,480
No, it’s an official welcome for our class year.

765
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,360
Hey, guys.

766
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,160
I’ll just leave without you as usual.

767
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,240
Are you leaving without us as usual

768
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,760
or is there someone picking you up as usual?

769
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,280
There’s really no one this time.

770
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,560
I’d make you swear

771
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,920
but I don’t want you to die for nothing.

772
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,840
I’m leaving.

773
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,360
Enjoy the sacred ceremony for me.

774
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,760
It’d be great if you could get me one, Po.

775
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:40,760
Bye.

776
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,440
Bye.

777
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,320
Have fun leaving alone.

778
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,800
Yeah.

779
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,960
Just go.

780
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,320
Hey.

781
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,040
Where are you going, sad puppy?

782
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,680
Have I ever barked at you?

783
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,880
You look like a sad puppy.

784
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,160
I’m going back to my room.

785
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,400
I’m not going with you.

786
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,280
Don’t invite me. I’m going to sleep.

787
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,960
It’s the pin-receiving ceremony today.

788
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,720
I know.

789
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,120
What are you doing?

790
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:03,920
Here you go.

791
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,360
You can stop being sad now.

793
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,240

797
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,320
I’ll transfer it to you.

798
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,560
It’s just a small change.

799
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,880
Right, you billionaire.

800
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,720
Can I leave now?

801
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,640
Not yet.

802
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,120
You have to watch me play football

803
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,680
in exchange for the pin.

804
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,760
I can remove it.

805
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,280
Arm!

806
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,560
Fine.

807
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,800

813
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,240
Hey, dude.

814
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,840
They’ll start selling pins next semester.

815
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,880
Anyone without one will be called out
the whole semester.

816
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,880
That means Arm is going to be called out.

817
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,720
Of course, he is.

818
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,720
- Hi, Arc.
- Hi, Arc.

819
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,920
Arm!

820
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,840
Where have you been, Arm?

821
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,880
I thought you were going back to the dorm.

822
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,040
Oh, I had nothing to do,

823
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,280
so I just went to watch Arc play football.

824
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,360
Oh.

825
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,240
Why do you have a pin?

826
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:38,720
Yeah, why?

827
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,000
Guys, I have to go.

828
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,200
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

829
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,760
So what happened?

830
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,600
How come you have a pin?

831
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,200
Oh,

832
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,760
I bought it.

833
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,520
Just now.

834
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,480
But Po told me they’d only start selling pins next semester.

835
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:56,960
Yeah.

836
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:57,840
Really?

837
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,480
Next semester?

838
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,040
Yes.

839
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,640
Next semester.

840
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,360
Shit, I’ll be right back.

841
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:02,920
I won’t be long.

842
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,440
Hey.

843
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,240
Where are you going?

844
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,720
Where are you going?

845
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,240
Arm!

846
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:05,960
Arm!

847
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,080
Arc!

848
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:09,960
Wait!

849
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,160
Hold on.

850
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,800
What’s wrong?

851
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,560
What’s the deal about this pin?

852
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,720
What do you mean?

853
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,840
My friends said the pins aren’t for sale yet.

854
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,320
I didn’t say I bought it.

855
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,640
Then where did you get it?

856
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,680
It’s my pin.

857
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,400
Huh?

858
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,720
Now that you know, don’t lose it.

859
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,000
Why did you give it to me?

860
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,320
Hey, you only got a pin.

861
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,560
Why is your heart racing?

862
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,840
It’s not.

863
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,560
You only got a pin and you’re this flustered.

864
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,440
If you get your gear, don’t have a heart attack.

865
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,960
I don’t want to be a criminal.

866
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,280
Your gear is meant for your partner,

867
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,640
not your peer mentee’s mentee.

868
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:37,960
Do you know that?

869
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,400
When did I say I’d give it to my peer mentee’s mentee?

870
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,960
Why do you always jump to conclusions?

871
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,280
You just said it yourself

872
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,640
that you’d give me your gear.

873
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,960
A gear is meant for one’s partner.

874
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,760
I’m not your partner.

What do you mean?

879
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,720
Let’s not rush it.

880
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,880
I’m still enjoying this.

881
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,040

Arc likes you, Arm.

889
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,720
That’s crazy, A-ngun.

890
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,040
Arc is so handsome and cool.

891
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,400
He might already be dating someone.

892
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,760
But when Arc found out you were badly hurt,

893
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,200
he was so angry.

894
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,920
Can you take me home?

895
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,600
Thanks for coming to help me.

896
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,560
I just don’t want anything to happen to you.

897
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,440
If something worse happened to you,
what would I do?

898
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,800
Whether Arc likes you or not
doesn’t matter now.

899
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,360
How do you feel about him?
