1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
I’d like my peer mentee
to take over the page admin role.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,560
It shouldn’t be hard.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,760
And what’s your name again?

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,000
His name is Arm.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,080
Arm and Arc.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,520
Your names sound similar.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,000
I heard some seniors tried to convince you
to compete for campus star.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,320
Go with Arc.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,760
Why do you love messing with me so much?

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,560
Apart from you, Arm,

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,280
I don’t want to mess with anyone else.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,320
WHOSE PHONE DID WE USE TO TAKE
GROUP PHOTOS YESTERDAY?

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,760
CAN YOU POST THEM TO WELCOME OUR JUNIOR?

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,880
Shit!

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,680
Why the heck did you stop?

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,200
Why the hell did you stop?

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,600
MY PEER MENTEE’S MENTEE IS POLITE.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,760
HE HAD TO BOW DOWN ON THE FLOOR
BEFORE HIS RUNWAY WALK.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,240
Damn it, Arc!

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,640
So clumsy.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,680
Hey.

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,520
Where are you going?

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,320
I’m going to kill…

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,400
You’re going to check attendance.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,120
You don’t want to be late.

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,720
Let go of me!

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,280
I’m going to take my revenge!

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,640
It’s not too late to get your revenge
10 years from now.

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,320
Let go of me!

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,720
But if you don’t go to the attendance check now,
you’ll be late.

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,440
I’m going to kill him!

32
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,840
MY PEER MENTEE’S MENTEE IS POLITE.
HE HAD TO BOW DOWN ON THE FLOOR
BEFORE HIS RUNWAY WALK. @Armm01

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,920
You’re such a gossip.

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,040
You always flirt with girls.

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,760
- As if you’re a good person.
- Hey.

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,480
I already liked your post.

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,880
Hey, are you guys free this evening?

38
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,000
Why?

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,800
Let’s play football.

40
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,840
Huh?

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,480
We play every day.

42
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,520
Lately, you’re the one
who’s always ditching us.

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,240
Yeah.

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,440
You’ve got it bad.

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,560
What have I got?

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,360
I know

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
our electrical major has to replace
our campus star representative

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,720
and who’s behind it.

49
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,960
Damn it!

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,000
Why are you freaking out?

51
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,040
Look on the bright side.

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,360
Arc’s Instagram is private.

53
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
Not that many people may have seen your photo.

54
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,840
His followers increased by 1,200
and you say not many people have seen it?

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,360
Damn it!

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,400
If you have thousands of followers,

57
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,160
you could become an influencer.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,640
Really?

59
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,440
Yeah.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Does being an influencer pay well?

61
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,320
Really well.

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,280
Really?

63
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,120
Yeah.

64
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,520
Why don’t we go back to our dorm
and learn how to become an influencer?

65
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,000
Great idea.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let’s get rich.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,320
Let’s not go see Arc anymore.

68
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,800
No.

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,680
Okay.

70
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,200
Let’s go.

71
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,680
Let’s go.

72
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,240
Hey, Arm.

73
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,280
Hi, Pun. Hi, Jet.

74
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,480
Yeepun and I have some errands to run.

76
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,000
Can you please bring these football boots
to Arc at the field?

77
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,240
He called us and sounded like
he needed them urgently.

78
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,600
Of course, Jet.

79
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,000
I was just thinking of going to see him.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,680
Don’t go.

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,320
Hey, Arm!

82
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,960
Follow him!

83
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,000
To where?

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,360
To stop that chihuahua with no filter.

85
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,400
I’ll have to leave this mission to you.

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,920
What?

87
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,520
I have to go eat with my grandma.

88
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,080
Your grandma?

89
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,800
Bye.

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640
Wait!

91
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,360
Your grandma?

92
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,520
Is something wrong?

93
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,320
I don’t have time to explain.

94
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,360
My friend’s life is more important.

95
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,000
I have to go.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,440
Bye. See you later.

97
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,840
Arc!

98
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,160
Arc, you jerk!

99
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,080
Arc, you jerk!

100
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,280
You jerk!

101
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,040
Hey!

102
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,960
Why did you shut my mouth, Sand?

103
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
Talking like that will get you in trouble.

104
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,760
You think I’m afraid?

105
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,560
Arc, you jerk!

106
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,120
Arm.

107
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,160
Be polite.

108
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,560
Why should I be polite with someone like him?

109
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,000
He’s so annoying.

110
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,520
I’d even call him Asshole Arc.

111
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Asshole Arc!

112
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,800
- Asshole Arc!
- What are you calling me?

113
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,200
It’s not true, is it?

114
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,720
It is.

115
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,400
What question is that the answer to?

116
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,920
What did you just call me, Arm?

117
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,720
Watch out!

118
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,400
Be careful when you're playing!

119
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,880
Are you alright?

120
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,960
I’m fine.

121
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,240
Are you alright?

122
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,800
Hey.

123
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,840
Looks like you’re hurt badly.

124
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Do you want to take him to the clinic?

125
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,520
Huh?

126
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,160
Let’s make way for Arc to deal with his junior.

127
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,200
Ouch!

128
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,200
It hurts so bad!

129
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,120
Are you hurt?

130
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,760
I can’t take this anymore.

131
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,880
Sand.

132
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,720
See you later.

133
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,400
Come on. Let’s go.

134
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,520
Okay. Let’s go.

135
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,400
Are you alright?

136
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,960
Excuse me.

137
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,280
Does it not hurt anymore?

138
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Why are you walking normally?

139
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,320
Oh.

140
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,320
It still hurts. Ouch!

141
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,840
It hurts so bad!

142
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,800
Ouch!

143
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,120
Is it so bad that you can’t walk?

144
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,800
Yeah, I think I need to sit down for a while.

145
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,960
Then please wait for me here.

146
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,160
- I’ll be right back.
- Hey.

147
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,800
Where are you going?

148
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,480
Hey!

149
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,240
What are you guys doing?

150
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,280
Come back to practice!

151
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,560
I’m about to!

152
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,160
Come on!

153
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,160
What’s up, smarty pants?

154
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,720
What are you doing here?

155
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,880
Jet asked me to return your shoes.

156
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,040
You only came for this?

157
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,880
Of course.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,560
Here.

159
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
I don’t need them now.

160
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Then put them away yourself.

161
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,280
Hey.

162
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,960
I don’t want to lose them.

163
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,760
Watch them.

164
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,520
Hey.

165
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,640
If I don’t see you sitting here from the field,

166
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,440
you’ll be in trouble.

167
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,840
Damn it!

168
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,560
Damn it!

169
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,680
Woo!

170
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,920
Watch your legs!

171
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,160
Here you go.

172
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,880
Why did you bring the cart?

173
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,080
You’re hurt so badly that you can’t walk,
so I borrowed it from the cleaning lady.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,920
I’ve already washed it

175
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
but be careful of the splinters.

176
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,920
It’s okay. I can walk.

177
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,680
Hey. Let me help.

178
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,560
You can’t walk.

179
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,480
I can walk.

180
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,320
Can we get through?

181
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,240
Excuse me!

182
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,560
We’ve arrived.

183
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,520
What am I doing?

184
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,080
Do you need me to carry you?

185
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,720
Come on.

186
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,320
Hey.

187
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,120
What brings you here, A-ngun?

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,080
I was passing by and saw you sitting here,

189
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,800
so I came to say hi.

190
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,920
Ah.

191
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh.

192
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,160
I got you some snacks.

193
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,880
This is for me?

194
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,200
Thanks.

195
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,080
And this is for Arc.

196
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,320
Hey, do you want me to keep it?

197
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,280
To make sure it doesn’t go missing.

198
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,760
It won’t.

199
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,160
Everything here is for Arc.

200
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,680
Huh?

201
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,120
How can he eat all that by himself?

202
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,960
By the way,

203
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,400
what did Arc say about my IG follow request?

204
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,480
He hasn’t accepted your request?

205
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,720
Not yet.

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,480
Let me talk to him again.

207
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,280
Thank you, Arm.

208
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,000
You’re the cutest.

209
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,840
Just score a goal!

210
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,320
I should go.

211
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,080
See you around.

212
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,200
Wait, A-ngun!

213
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,200
Oh, shit.

214
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,280
Don’t touch me.

215
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,200
You’re sweating all over.

216
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,920
Hey! You’re dirty!

217
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,640
Damn it!

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,600
What’s that?

219
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,960
Hey, Arc!

220
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,080
Damn it! What are you doing?

221
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,320
Are you mad that I posted your photo?

222
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,640
If you were me, wouldn’t you be mad

223
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,840
about being photographed like that?

224
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,200
Falling in the auditorium was embarrassing enough.

225
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,440
You didn’t have to post a photo of it too.

226
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
And don’t even say your account is private.

227
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,240
What private account has 3-4 thousand followers?

228
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,160
Not to say people screenshotted it

229
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,520
and made tons of memes.

230
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,040
I’m embarrassed, you know?

231
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
But I like it.

232
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,600
Are you a psycho?

233
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,440
Are you almost done?

234
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,400
I’m going to leave soon.

235
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,440
Why are you complaining so much?

236
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,160
Because I don’t want to freaking wait.

237
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,160
You’re being rude again, Arm.

238
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,440
I

239
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,200
don’t want to wait.

240
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,760
Okay?

241
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,800
Once you've been here a few times,
you’ll get used to it.

242
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,880
What do you mean I’ll get used to it?

243
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,080
Other people would have
their partner waiting for them,

244
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,000
not dumping it on
their peer mentee’s mentee like this.

245
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,280
I’m single.

246
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,480
Then hurry up and find someone.

247
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,360
I am hurrying.

248
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,040
Fine. I’m leaving.

249
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,880
Here.

250
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,000
Wait.

251
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,000
What now?

252
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,840
Bring your snacks home.

253
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,640
What snacks?

254
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,360
There.

255
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,200
P’ARC, YOU’RE SO HANDSOME.
ROOTING FOR YOU, P’ARC.

256
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,840
YOU’RE SO COOL, P’ARC.

257
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,960
YOU’RE SO COOL, P’ARM.

258
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,520
Here you go.

259
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
YOU’RE SO COOL, P’ARM.

260
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,880
What?

261
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,360
My car is parked in the same spot.

262
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,680
Hurry up and follow me.

263
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,920
Is this your condo?

264
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,480
Yeah.

265
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,080
Oh.

266
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,320
Freshmen need to stay
in the on-campus dorm, right?

267
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,400
Yes. The rooms are so tiny.

268
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,360
The water runs on and off.

269
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,680
Have you booked a ride?

270
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
Yes.

271
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,280
It got canceled.

272
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,120
Oh?

273
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,280
It’s okay.

274
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,960
I can get a motorbike taxi on the main road.

275
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,240
Thank you for today.

276
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,080
If it wasn’t for you,

277
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,160
my face would’ve been smashed.

278
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,280
I should go.

279
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,560
Wait.

280
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,920
Take my car.

281
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,200
Huh?

282
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,440
It’ll probably be hard to get a ride in this area.

283
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,760
Are you really going to lend your car
to a stranger this easily?

284
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,920
What’s your name?

285
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,200
I’m Sand.

286
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,520
I’m Pond.

287
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,920
We’re no longer strangers now.

288
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,040
I have a class at 8:40 a.m. tomorrow.

289
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,160
Come pick me up.

290
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:20,960
See you.

291
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,400
Don't forget to rub in some medicine.

292
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,240
Good night.

293
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,440
You can go.

294
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Hey, Arc.

295
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,160
The other day, I asked you
to accept my friend’s request

296
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,600
Why haven’t you?

297
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,080
I guess I forgot.

298
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,920
But you promised
that if I ate with you,

299
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,960
you’d do it.

300
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,200
Hurry up and accept her request.

301
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,320
I will later.

302
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,160
Do it now, or, I won’t get out of the car.

303
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,320
Come on. Do it.

304
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,000
That’s it.

305
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,240
Done.

306
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,360
Very good.

307
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,520
I’m going now.

308
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,200
Goodbye.

309
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,320
Hey, Arc.

310
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,440
Did you block me?

311
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,320
Hey!

312
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,680
Damn it!

313
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,520
I’m getting fed up!

314
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Come in!

315
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,280
I’m definitely coming in!

316
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,160
I’m strolling in my tower.

317
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,560
I’m running around in my tower. Whoa.

318
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,520
Come on, Sand.

319
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,800
Move, Po.

320
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,680
Scary.

321
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,320
Shit.

322
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,080
What the hell?

323
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,680
What are you doing down there?

324
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,040
Why did you have to squeeze in like that?

325
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,440
Hey, Arm.

326
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,240
Did Arc block you on Instagram?

327
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,800
Yes.

328
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,760
I’m so freaking pissed!

329
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,640
Arc is really independent, huh?

330
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,400
Look, Sand, you need to know the difference

331
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,880
between being independent and being a jerk.

332
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,760
He’s really getting on my nerves.

333
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,280
Damn it.

334
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,160
He’s cursing right in my face.

335
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,840
Why the hell did you ask him that?

336
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,120
What the hell is this?

337
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,720
What?

338
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,720
He blocked you on IG
but sent you a friend request on Facebook?

339
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,000
What’s he up to?

340
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,080
What should I do?

341
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,560
Accept it.
What are you waiting for?

342
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,400
I’ll freaking deal with you!

343
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,680
My friend will freaking deal with you!

344
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,200
Which one?

345
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,280
This one.

346
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,080
- It’s ugly.
- This one?

347
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,840
Go ahead.

348
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,480
Send it.

349
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,160
Yes.

350
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,400
What the hell is this thing?

351
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,760
He’s rude.

352
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,240
Look at that foul mouth.

353
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,400
YOU BLOCKED ME OVER THERE AND ADDED ME HERE.
DO YOU HAVE THAT MUCH FREE TIME?

354
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,320
Yes, does he have that much free time?

355
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,120
Yes. You better call him out.

356
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,160
Do you have that much free time?

357
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,840
Do you have that much free time?

358
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,520
None of your business.

359
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,800
Whoa. “None of your business”?

360
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,440
Oh, look at him.

361
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,040
Look at him.

362
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,920
I need to calm down.

363
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,720
I need to calm down.

364
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,720
Calm down.

365
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,760
Take a deep breath.

366
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,440
Unblock me on IG already.

367
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,520
I’m being nice.

368
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,920
You’re keeping your emotions in check.
You’re being mature.

369
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,760
I’ll see about my mood.

370
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,800
Whoa!

371
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,960
“I’ll see about my mood”?

372
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,600
How dare he say he’ll think about his mood?

373
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,520
Take a deep breath.

374
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,280
ACCEPT A-NGUN’S FRIEND REQUEST TOO.

375
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,720
Be mature.

376
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,960
If you talk about this again,

377
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,640
I’ll block you.

378
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,560
Do I still have to keep calm?

379
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,480
I can’t keep calm anymore.

380
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,240
Calm down.

381
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,280
He’s threatening you.

382
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,640
That’s a threat.

383
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
BUT YOU PROMISED ME!

384
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,760
Keep calling him out.

385
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,200
BESIDES, WHAT’S SO HARD ABOUT
ACCEPTING A FRIEND REQUEST?!

386
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,160
Press send.

387
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,680
I already did. Why isn’t it sending?

388
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,760
Maybe the internet isn’t working?

389
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,760
I know what this is.

390
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,280
He blocked you.

391
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,560
Shit.

392
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,760
Damn it!

393
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,720
You’re really getting on my nerves!

394
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,560
What’s the hospital number?

395
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,400
Call the hospital.

396
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,200
You guys are getting on my nerves!

397
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,880
Damn it!

398
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,880
Stop it, Sand!

399
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,480
Not yet!

400
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,000
Let me handle it.

401
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,080
You made me lose.
Seriously, Sand.

402
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,680
Y’all,

403
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,440
the teacher said today’s class is canceled.

404
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,600
Oh.

405
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,080
He might as well tell us tomorrow.

406
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,880
Damn it!

407
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,040
What was the point of coming early?

408
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,440
So you can go back to sleep at the dorm.

409
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,960
Get up.

410
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,560
Let’s head back to the dorm and sleep.

411
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,080
I’m so annoyed.

412
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,040
I don’t think our motorbike could get us back.

413
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,560
We’re so unlucky.

414
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,680
Sand.

415
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,360
Yeah?

416
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,000
Do you still have that anonymous luxury car?

417
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,160
Oh, I already returned it.

418
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,520
Will you tell us who it belongs to already?

419
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,640
Yeah, whose car is that?

420
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,160
Oh, it’s…

421
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,040
It’s a long story.

422
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,720
I knew it.

423
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,000
- You knew it well.
- A long story, huh?

424
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,640
You don’t need to know.

425
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,680
Let’s go to the cafe near the Faculty of Agriculture.

426
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,160
Come on.

427
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,960
We can talk about your long story there.

428
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,520
Let’s go.

429
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,240
Ouch!

430
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,760
Damn it!

431
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,400
Arm, watch your steps!

432
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Where should we go?

433
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,960
Yeah.

434
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,200
Oh, shit!

435
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,920
Run!

436
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,960
Shit!

437
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,280
It’s raining!

438
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,760
Run!

439
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,280
It’s a storm!

440
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,600
It’s raining!

441
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,880
It’s raining!

442
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,920
It’s raining!

443
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,480
It’s raining!

444
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,160
Damn it!

445
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,640
It hurts so much!

446
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,280
It hurts!

447
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,360
Because of my muscles.

448
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,120
Hey.

449
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,480
Is that your peer mentor’s mentor?

450
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,640
Not anymore.

451
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,760
I cut him off from my group.

452
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,200
That’s so cool.

453
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,800
Arm.

454
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,000
Why did you go out in the rain and get soaked?

455
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,880
Who are you talking to?

456
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,040
Do we know each other?

457
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,880
Come on, Arm.

458
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,760
What?

459
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,280
We blocked each other.

460
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,000
I don’t talk to strangers.

461
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,680
Fine.

462
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,720
You want to be like this?

463
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Hey.

464
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,640
Can anyone tell this sulky kid

465
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,360
to take care of himself when it’s raining

466
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,240
so he doesn’t get a cold?

467
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,080
If you get sick,

468
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,760
I’ll kick you.

469
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,240
Got it?

470
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,200
Please take it from here, guys.

471
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,680
Don’t get a cold from the rain

472
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,080
or he’ll kick you.

473
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,640
He didn’t ask you to say that!

474
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,400
Po!

475
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
Help me!

476
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,920
What are you daydreaming about?

477
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,440
Are you thinking about your peer mentor’s mentor?

478
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,360
Hmm?

479
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,120
Yes!

480
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,240
I was thinking that if I see him again,
what should I curse at him?

481
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,960
Damn it.

482
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,560
Hey, Arm.

483
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,280
He did all that because he’s worried about you.

484
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,200
Yeah.

485
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
More like he was trying to get on my nerves.

486
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,800
Didn’t you see that?

487
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,840
Oh.

488
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,480
If I didn’t know you and Arc hate each other,

489
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,720
I’d think

490
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,360
he’s hitting on you.

491
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
True.

492
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,360
Hitting on me, my ass!

493
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,760
If this is how he’s hitting on me,

494
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,320
I’d rather die single.

495
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,920
Damn it!

496
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,640
You’re acting all strong now.

497
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,280
Yeah.

498
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,280
This is hot!

499
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Why didn’t you tell me it's hot?

500
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,080
How would I know that?

501
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,320
We’re drinking cold drinks.

502
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,040
Cheers.

503
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,000
What are you looking at?

504
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,320
That looks good.

505
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,480
The food?

506
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,120
Hey, Arm!

507
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,640
Hey.

508
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,240
Hi, Pun. Hi, Jet.

509
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,200
Hi.

510
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,160
Come sit with us.

511
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,240
Where are your friends?

512
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,480
They’re in the cheering activities.

513
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,240
I’m waiting to leave with them,
so I came here to eat.

514
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,680
You’re not joining the cheering activities?

515
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,920
Then you won’t get your gear.

516
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,880
You can just buy it.

517
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,000
I bought mine too.

518
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,640
Hey!

519
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,320
Hey! Seriously, Arc?

520
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,560
Tell me honestly.

521
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,720
Why do you keep physically abusing me?

522
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
You call this physical abuse?

523
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,960
You hurt me.

524
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,440
It's called physical abuse.

525
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,920
Did that hurt already?

526
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,640
I’m more fragile than you think.

527
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,560
So,

528
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,960
don’t be rough with me again.

529
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,520
Got it?

530
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,760
Your whole body is fragile,

531
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,480
except your face.

532
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,200
Hey!

533
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,880
Guys, look at him!

534
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,840
Calm down.

535
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,080
Don’t fight.

536
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,320
Just say you’re worried about him.

537
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,400
Why are you being so tight-lipped?

538
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,200
Hey.

539
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,720
What do you do
when your senior gives you something?

540
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,000
I didn’t ask for it.

541
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,720
Arm.

542
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,720
Thank you.

543
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,480
Sir.

544
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,680
Hey, I just remember

545
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,040
I forgot to bring you my lecture notes again.

546
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,000
Sorry.

547
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,440
It’s totally fine.

548
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
You can bring it whenever it suits you.

549
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,480
I haven’t really been taking care of you.

550
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
I feel bad.

551
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,560
Don’t worry.

552
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,240
It’s chill.

553
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,240
I have an idea.

554
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,880
Since I took care of Yeepun for you
for a long time,

555
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,760
you should take care of Arm
to return the favor.

556
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,400
Uh…

557
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,040
Jet…

558
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,360
Great idea, babe.

559
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,400
That way, I won’t have to worry about you
or feel bad.

560
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,200
About the lecture notes,
you can borrow Arc’s.

561
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,520
His notes are so amazing, you know?

562
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,880
Well, Jet, I think…

563
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,640
Then come and get them today.

564
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,160
I was just planning to clear my room.

565
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,080
Let’s go.

566
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,800
Get up.

567
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,760
Hey.

568
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,240
I haven’t even eaten.

569
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,840
Get up!

570
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,880
Let me have one bite.

571
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,360
Arm!

572
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,000
Hurry up!

573
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,800
Let’s go!

574
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,240
My bag!

575
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,360
Hey.

576
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,120
What are you so excited about?

577
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,360
Nothing.

578
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,160
Where are your lecture notes?

579
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,280
Hurry up and give them to me.

580
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,920
I don’t know.

581
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,560
What?

582
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,080
My room is big.

583
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,760
It’ll take a while to find them.

584
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,280
Where are they?

585
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,120
I can help you look.

586
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,800
Have you taken any medicine?

587
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:35,960
No.

588
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,480
Here.

589
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,680
Hey!

590
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,760
What are you doing?

591
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,080
Feeding you medicine.

592
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,640
Hey!

593
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,200
What kind of method is this?

594
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,000
It’s how I give medicine to a dog.

595
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,520
I’ve never fed medicine to a human before.

596
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,080
Here.

597
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,840
Hey!

598
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,640
Hey!

599
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,680
Do I look like a dog?

600
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,360
Give it to me.

601
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,040
I can take it by myself.

602
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,400
Seriously.

603
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,240
Are you happy now?

604
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,160
Where are your notes?

605
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,400
Stop wasting time.

606
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,760
After I take a shower.

607
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,360
Why the hell are you stalling?

608
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,240
Where is he?

609
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,000
Should we report this to the police yet?

610
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,280
Don’t panic.

611
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,360
Is everything alright?

612
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,040
Hey, Pond.

613
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,080
Arm is missing.

614
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,320
Huh? Missing?

615
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,080
Yes. He didn’t join the cheering activities.

616
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,320
Normally, the three of us always leave together,

617
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,520
but he’s not picking up his phone.

618
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,920
We don’t know if he’s dead or alive.

619
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,160
He’s usually dumb.

620
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,960
Says the one who told me not to panic.

621
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,520
Stay out of it.

622
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,240
Fine.

623
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,000
Calm down.

624
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,680
I might have an idea where your friend is.

625
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,920
Let me find out for sure.

626
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,520
Okay. Please help us.

627
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,560
Should we actually call the police?

628
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,880
I think we should.

629
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,320
Yeah.

630
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
I’ll give him a ride when he wakes up.

631
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,000
I have to go.

632
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,800
That medicine could’ve put an elephant to sleep.

633
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,400
My head feels so heavy.

634
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,200
If you’re sleepy, just sleep.

635
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,680
Oh.

636
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,320
No.

637
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,560
Have you found the lecture notes?

638
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,160
Do you hate being around me that much?

639
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,480
Why do you ask that?

640
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,840
I don’t know.

641
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,600
It seems like you’re always
trying to get away from me.

642
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,280
Because you always get on my nerves.

643
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,720
Then tell me how you want me to approach you.

644
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,480
What?

645
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,600
Here.

646
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,120
I only found two subjects.

647
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,800
Once I find the rest, I’ll give them to you.

648
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,480
Thank you.

649
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,480
I should go.

650
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,600
I’ll give you a ride.

651
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,680
No need.

652
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,520
It’s just nearby.

653
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,200
Pun asked me to take care of you.

654
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,280
Are you confused?

655
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,840
Oh, just forget it.

656
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,080
Pun won’t find out.

657
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,120
It’s late. Just go to bed.

658
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,720
I’m leaving.

659
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,360
Hey.

660
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,480
Don’t be stubborn.

661
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:29,920
Fine.

662
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,880
Thank you, Pond.

663
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,480
No worries.

664
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,040
Thank you.

665
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,680
Shit!

666
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,560
I left the key with Arm!

667
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,240
What?

668
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,480
Shit.

669
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,640
You can hang out in my room for now.

670
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,400
I’d rather not.

671
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,360
Your roommate is as strict as a dog.

672
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,520
Come on.

673
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,560
He might be strict
but he’s not that scary.

674
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,360
Next time, don’t sleep in my room.

675
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:07,960
Fine.

676
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,280
I’ll wait for Arm with you.

677
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,800
It’s okay, Po.

678
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,000
I’ll stay with him.

679
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,000
I want to talk to Arc.

680
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,880
You can go.

681
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,920
I’ll wait for Arm.

682
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,960
You’re sending me away that easily?

683
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,920
Go upstairs.

684
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,760
Watch your steps.

685
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,760
Okay.

686
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,320
Yeah.

687
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,680
What? Why are you looking at me?

688
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,280
Just go.

689
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,600
It’s late so not many places are open.

690
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,920
Can you eat this?

691
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:42,920
Sure.

692
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,960
If you can,
then eat.

693
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,880
!@#$.

694
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:51,960
What?

695
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,520
!@#$

696
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,080
!@#$

697
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:56,880
!@#$

698
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,120
Huh?

699
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,040
!@#$

700
00:31:59,480 --> 00:31:59,960
Huh?

701
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,480
!@#$

702
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,280
Oh, it’s hot.

703
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,720
Drink some water.

704
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,480
Thanks, I guess.

705
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,640
I’m going now.

706
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,920
See you tomorrow at the cinema.

707
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,840
Okay.

708
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,640
Oh.

709
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,080
Ahem.

710
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,600
Ahem.

711
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,680
Where have you been?

712
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,160
Your friends were worried sick.

713
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,600
That’s my business.

714
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,320
Stay out of it.

715
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,400
Hey, Pond.

716
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,840
What are you doing here?

717
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,160
Don’t you want to talk to Arc?

718
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,680
Oh, not anymore.

719
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,720
I’ll just call him later.

720
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,720
See you around.

721
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,240
Yeah.

722
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,200
Then why did you…?

723
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,360
I have to go. I’m in a hurry.

724
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,480
- What are you up to?
- What are you up to?

725
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:02,960
Tell me what you’re up to.

726
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,480
What’s going on with you?

727
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:03,960
Something’s up with you.

728
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,640
Nothing’s going on with me.

729
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,280
Don’t try to put this on me.

730
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,320
Where have you been for so long?

731
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,960
And you didn’t think to tell us.

732
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,560
What was he doing here?

733
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,640
How come he dropped you off in front of the dorm?

734
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,760
No, he was waiting for him.

735
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,640
Nothing’s going on with me.

736
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,480
Tell me about you guys.

737
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,600
DON’T FORGET TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE AGAIN
BEFORE YOU SLEEP.

738
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,520
IF YOU DON’T LIKE MY REPLY,
WILL YOU BLOCK ME AGAIN?

739
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,720
I WON’T IF YOU DON’T GET ON MY NERVES.

740
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,320
THEN I’LL GET ON YOUR NERVES.
I WANT TO BE BLOCKED.

741
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,200
ARM, DON’T MAKE ME STUFF THE MEDICINE
IN YOUR MOUTH.

742
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,720
HOW SCARY.

743
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,360
WILL YOU DIE IF YOU STOP GETTING ON MY NERVES
FOR 1 SECOND?

744
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,400
ANSWER.

745
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,240
ARM! WHERE ARE YOU?

746
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,320
ANSWER ME.

747
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,080
I WAS JUST TRYING NOT TO GET ON YOUR NERVES.

748
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,200
DAMN, I ALMOST DIED.

749
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,200
YOU’RE SAYING RUDE THINGS AGAIN.

750
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,440
I’M TYPING.

751
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,160
SEND ME A PHOTO OF YOU TAKING YOUR MEDICINE.

752
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,560
OKAY.

753
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,680
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT ME?

754
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,680
I JUST DON’T WANT YOU TO SPREAD GERMS

761
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,840
Hi, Pun.

762
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,360
I’m waiting in front of my dorm.

763
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,560
Okay.

764
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,600
I’ll tell Arc.

765
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,960
Why are you telling him?

766
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,480
Arc is going to pick you up.

767
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
I’ll go with Jet.

768
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,880
See you at the mall.

769
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,160
Damn it.

770
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,560
Won’t you greet your senior?

771
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,640
Hi, Senior Arc.

772
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,080
This is weird.

773
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,360
What’s weird?

774
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
You’re being a good kid, which is unusual.

775
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,800
What are you talking about?

776
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,200
I’m a grown-up.

777
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,760
We’re only two years apart.

778
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,400
Let’s go.

779
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,720
Have we arrived?

780
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,400
Sit tight.

781
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,280
Hey, calm down, Arc.

782
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,760
Hey.

783
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,920
That car cut me off first.

784
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,160
Arc! It’s dangerous.

785
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,680
Calm down.

786
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,160
Arm,

787
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,680
grab my phone.

788
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,640
Why?

789
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,600
We’re going to call insurance soon.

790
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,320
Arc!

791
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,880
Arc!

792
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,360
Arc!

793
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,160
Arm.

794
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,920
Arm.

795
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,200
Arm.

796
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,720
Arm!

797
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,360
Arm!

798
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,520
Are you alright?

799
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,640
Answer me!

800
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,480
I’m fine.

801
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,240
Are you hurt?

802
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,080
Are either of you hurt?

803
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,320
Arm has a scratch.

804
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,160
He’s bleeding too.

805
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,720
Calm down, Arc.

806
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,360
Pun and I are coming right away.

807
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,680
What did he say?

808
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,000
Are they hurt?

809
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,080
From what I heard,

810
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,760
I don’t think they’re badly injured.

811
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,640
I hope this time, Arc learns to be more patient.

812
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,960
Yeah,

813
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,320
from how he sounds,

814
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,960
I think he’ll stop being hot-headed for good.

815
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,480
Are you alright?

816
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,760
I’m fine now.

817
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,840
Just a little shocked.

818
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,720
Okay.

819
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,640
That’s good.

820
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,160
What about you?

821
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,200
Are you hurt?

822
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,680
I’m sorry.

823
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:32,760
Hey.

824
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,320
Arc.

825
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,880
I’m really fine now.

826
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,480
Arc.

827
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:56,760
Hey.

828
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Look at me.

829
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,760
I’m really fine now.

830
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,720
Is something wrong?

831
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,560
I’m just worried about you.

832
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,640
I’m really fine now.

833
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,320
It’s just a small scratch.

834
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,560
It’s far from my heart.

835
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,920
I promised...

836
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,960
I’d take the best care of you.

837
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,720
Huh?

838
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,360
But I hurt you myself.

839
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,120
Who did you promise?

840
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,760
I promise you now.

841
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,200
From now on,

842
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,840

You’re selfish

00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,040
he hurt him.

00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,720
Oh.

855
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,520
Is it the scratch Arm posted on his story?

856
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,400
What story?

857
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,320
You might as well post naked on your IG.

You’re just his peer mentor’s mentor
but you’re possessive of him.

860
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,680
You haven’t answered me.

861
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,520
Do you like this?

862
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,080
