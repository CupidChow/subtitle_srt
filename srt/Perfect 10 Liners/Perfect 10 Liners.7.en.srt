1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,130
Being taken care of by you feels good.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,470
Do you like me at all yet?

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,780
I’m Brink.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,270
We’re buddies.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,840
I said I’m not jealous.

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,200
He’s not jealous, okay?

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,510
If you find him and he’s more handsome than me,

8
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,930
don’t fall for him, okay?

9
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,840
I can’t promise that.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,680
Arm!

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,090
Yotha, we can go separately from here.

12
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,680
But…

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,680
Pun ordered me to take care of you.

14
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,640
I won’t tell her.

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,320
Well…

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,820
Don’t you have to quickly go back to Gun?

17
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,820
True that, Wine.

18
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,460
Don’t you have to quickly see your boyfriend?

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,780
Right now,

20
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,080
he’s probably sitting there all sullen,

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,640
ears down, tail drooping,

22
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,160
waiting for you to come home.

23
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,000
Feeling lonely lately?

24
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,820
You’ve been
hanging around in my life a lot.

25
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,150
Me? Lonely?

26
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,290
I’m just doing my job as a good brother.

27
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,790
Taking care of my big bro.

28
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,340
And I’ll take care of
the peer mentee on his behalf, too.

29
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,960
Right, Wine?

30
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,650
Uh…

31
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,290
Fai,

32
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,090
Haven’t I told you…

33
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,310
Take it easy.

34
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,540
I told you,

35
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,120
this guy’s getting my special treatment.

36
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,480
Gun’s been read there while waiting for you.

37
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,350
Hurry up and go.

38
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,020
Huh?

39
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,400
But he said he’d eat with others.

40
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,090
Gong, Book and Franck?

41
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,710
They all bailed him.

42
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,120
And,

43
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,140
What about other friends?

44
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,890
Oh.

45
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,460
You say as if he has lots of friends.

46
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,440
He only has this many.

47
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,450
Damn, Fai.

48
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,140
Well, actually,

49
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,140
there is another person

50
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,610
who’d go eat with Gun.

51
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,500
Then?

52
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,540
Then, he bailed Gun
and is standing right before you.

53
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,300
You better go see Gun quickly.

54
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:38,840
I can go back…

55
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,320
You can go back with me.

56
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,420
Right, Wine?

57
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,820
Yeah.

58
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,590
Good job.

59
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,710
I’ll just go back with Faifa then.

60
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,420
Yeah.

61
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,590
Then,

62
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,900
I’ll owe you this meal for now.

63
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,660
Let’s catch up another time.

64
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,340
Yeah.

65
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
What should we eat, Wine?

66
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,960
Hm?

67
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,900
What about sushi? I’ll treat you.

68
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,700
I’m generous.

69
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,690
Just tell me what you want.

70
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,660
Wine won’t say it.

71
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,020
But I definitely will.

72
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,540
Heh.

73
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,180
Huh?

74
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,580
Have you done eating?

75
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,570
Why didn’t you tell me
that you didn’t go with your friends?

76
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,040
If I did,

77
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,040
you’d leave Wine behind and come to me.

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,510
Don’t tell me you really did that.

79
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,790
Yotha, it’s not good.

80
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,410
Begel lied, too. It’s also not good.

81
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,510
I didn’t lie.

82
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,890
Just…

83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,270
Didn’t tell you.

84
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,020
Hey, you’re good at
talking back these days.

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,880
You’ll be punished.

86
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,830
Why?

87
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,620
Um.

88
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,610
I want you to have time
for your peer mentee, too.

89
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,850
Almost like we’re together all the time.

90
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,470
Why do I have to give time to others?

91
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,730
Others?

92
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,010
He’s your peer mentee.

93
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,530
But you’re my boyfriend.

94
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,300
But Yotha…

95
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,110
Gun Yuwapol.

96
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,210
I left Wine behind for real.

97
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,610
See? You’re really a bad guy.

98
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,810
Listen first.

99
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,290
I left Wine behind for real,

100
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,000
but I left him with Fa.

101
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,430
Oh.

102
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,910
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

103
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,860
Hey, you didn’t listen at all right?

104
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,470
Why? What will you do?

105
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,130
You talked back?

106
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,880
Punished you.

107
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,150
Still talking back to me?

108
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,110
Good at it now right?

109
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,100
There are many people.

110
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:40,770
Don’t.

111
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,640
Why?

112
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,940
There are many people.

113
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,680
Then what?

114
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,200
Just love you.

115
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,250
Don’t… don’t.

116
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,170
Hey, there are others.

117
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,900
Then?

118
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,460
So what?

119
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,540
Talk back to me then.

120
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,180
Do it.

121
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:53,530
You talk back once,

122
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,530
I’ll kiss you once.

123
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,300
One time each.

124
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,230
I’ll tell Pun

125
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,420
that Yotha doesn’t take care of you.

126
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,290
Please don’t tell Pun.

127
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Yotha has Faifa take care of me instead.

128
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Right, Faifa?

129
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,630
Oh.

130
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,040
Yes, Arm.

131
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,380
I take care of Win better than Yotha does.

132
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,260
Um.

133
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,710
Yeah.

134
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,020
Um.

135
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:24,740
Yeah.

136
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,690
Okay, fine.

137
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,980
I’ll let him off this time.

138
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,080
I won’t tell Yeepun.

139
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,580
Yes.

140
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,110
But.

141
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,760
Yes?

142
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,780
There’s a condition.

143
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,920
What condition?

144
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,900
You two have to
sit here with me

145
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,300
till Arc picks me up.

146
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,100
Okay?

147
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,330
Huh?

148
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,800
Here?

149
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,260
Um.

150
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,250
He is stuck in traffic.

151
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,070
Look,

152
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,130
Been sitting and lying down,

153
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,250
and he is still not here.

154
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,250
I’m lonely.

155
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,680
Easy one.

156
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,230
Faifa and I can stay with you.

157
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,380
Why don’t you sit somewhere nice?

158
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,760
It’s so hot here.

159
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,460
There’s a coffee shop, too.

160
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,320
It’s peaceful here.

161
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,870
I like to be here
when I don’t want to be disturbed.

162
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,050
Also, back then,

163
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,400
when Arc hadn’t graduated,

164
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,870
we sat here together often.

165
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,410
And, it seemed we met Tongfah here.

166
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,490
Who’s Tongfah?

167
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,660
One of the Perfect 10 Liners?

168
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,220
Nah.

169
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,660
Tongfah is…

170
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,850
How should I explain?

171
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,890
What are you talking about?

172
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,310
Hi, Arc.

173
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,160
- Hi.
- 		Hey.

174
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,960
Are you here already?

175
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,560
Um.

176
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:38,930
What’s the matter?

177
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,900
What are you talking about?

178
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,390
Heh.

179
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,010
Telling them about Tongfah.

180
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,860
Oh, Tongfah.

181
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Your pretentious buddy, huh?

182
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,460
He’s my buddy.

183
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,170
But the pretentious one is you.

184
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,970
Not Tongfah.

185
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,390
I’ll tell you later.

186
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,500
Okay.

187
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,300
Then, have you met your buddy?

188
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,120
I don’t know who this person is.

189
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
The clue is also super tough.

190
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,920
How tough can it be?

191
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,960
What’s the clue?

192
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,890
Well…

193
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,320
The name is something about nature.

194
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,110
Vast and expansive.

195
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,560
And it’s the highest thing in the world.

196
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,890
Don’t know what it is.

197
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,810
What’s that?

198
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,850
Tongfah.

199
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,390
Hey.

200
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,400
The name is Tongfah.

201
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,550
We’re each other’s buddies.

202
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:13,920
Huh?

203
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,120
Oh, are you Tongfah?

204
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,850
You can just call me Fah.

205
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,870
What are you doing here?

206
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,510
Well, I wanted somewhere to lie down.

207
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,250
But now I’m awake.

208
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,440
Have you eaten, Buddy?

209
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,900
Should we eat together?

210
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,180
I’ll treat you.

211
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,140
No.

212
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,710
What?

213
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,880
Not hungry, either.

214
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,210
I asked him.

215
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,370
Not you.

216
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,640
Okay.

217
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,900
Let’s properly introduce ourselves.

218
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,270
Fah, he’s Arc.

219
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
My peer mentor.

220
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,540
Arc, he’s Fah.

221
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,440
My buddy.

222
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,510
Let’s be close.

223
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,070
Hi.

224
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:29,920
Yeah.

225
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:34,830
Fah.

226
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:35,580
Hum?

227
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,980
This shop is good.

228
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,180
Try it.

229
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,660
Really?

230
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,150
Um.

231
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,090
- Okay, I’ll try it.
- Here, here.

232
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,700
This is the best one.

233
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,580
Crispy pork.

234
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,810
My favorite.

235
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,440
Um.

236
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,090
It’s yummy.

237
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,520
See?

238
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,070
But let me treat you this time.

239
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,530
Just remembered that

240
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,870
I was to treat you, not the other way round.

241
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,020
Hey, not a problem.

242
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,670
It is.

243
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,590
Others have treated theirs for many days.

244
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,590
I only have one more day left

245
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,900
to take care of you before the activity ends.

246
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,120
Might not be fair to you.

247
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,440
Isn't having you as a buddy

248
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,450
already worth it?

249
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,500
Heh.

250
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,240
Well, then.

251
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,450
How are you getting home today?

252
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,300
Want me to give you a ride?

253
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,710
Oh, I’ll…

254
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,860
He’s coming with me.

255
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,730
Is that your way home?

256
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,100
Nah.

257
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,510
He’ll stay over at my place.

258
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,330
Huh?

259
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,760
Uh.

260
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,840
Uh.

261
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,140
Wait, Arc.

262
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,330
Stay over? Since when?

263
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,310
Let’s go.

264
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,950
Hey, I haven’t eaten the crispy pork.

265
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,410
Hurry up.

266
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,160
Let me eat it first.

267
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,840
Let’s go back.

268
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,050
Fah, bye bye.

269
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,130
See you.

270
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,280
Sigh.

271
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,390
I told you I didn’t bring my clothes.

272
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,000
I didn’t bring them.

273
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,860
Why didn’t you tell me first

274
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,250
that you want me to stay over?

275
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,600
I’d bring my stuff.

276
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,450
Ugh.

277
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,980
What’s wrong?

278
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,160
Huh.

279
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,690
Hey.

280
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,010
Let me go. Don’t.

281
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,040
Are you killing me?

282
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,340
What are you doing?

283
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,620
I’m locking you up.

284
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,630
Why?

285
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,270
You haven’t promised me.

286
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,440
About?

287
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,420
You must promise me first

288
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,010
if that buddy of yours
is more handsome than me,

289
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,720
you must not fall for him.

290
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,470
Sigh. Hey, Arc.

291
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,400
You think I change my mind easily?

292
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,080
I’ll like anyone who looks great?

293
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,120
I don’t care.

294
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,640
If I liked good-looking people,

295
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
I’d fall for you a long time ago.

296
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,000
Hey.

297
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,150
What do you mean?

298
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,170
Fine.

299
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,720
Just kidding.

300
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,790
You’re too serious.

301
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,800
I’m hurt by what you said.

302
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,880
​There, there.

303
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,860
You’re a big boy,

304
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,540
why are you so touchy?

305
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,320
Huh?

306
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,020
Hmm?

307
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,370
Because you keep messing with my feelings.

308
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,150
And do you like it?

309
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,120
Well…

310
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,360
Better go shower.

311
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,900
Arc,

312
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,730
Po told me about the ace of that team.

313
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,430
The one who didn’t join the warmup match.

314
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,100
Actually, he’s Tongfah.

315
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,430
Really?

316
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,130
Um.

317
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,560
Po said Tongfah would just join the final round.

318
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,010
Heh.

319
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,320
Full of himself.

320
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,220
Why makes him confident
that they’ll be in the final round?

321
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,580
What?

322
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,710
But their team gets to compete
in the final round with us for real though.

323
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,580
Tomorrow,

324
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,680
you’ll be in trouble for sure.

325
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,550
How do you know?

326
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,020
You haven’t seen him in a game.

327
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,370
No idea.

328
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,370
Just guessing.

329
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,020
But I think he seems mysterious.

330
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,090
Kinda strange, right?

331
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,350
Um.

332
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,200
Seems strangely dangerous.

333
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,390
Don’t be close to him then.

334
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,020
Is this personal?

335
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,660
Nah.

336
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,020
Will you play the game tomorrow?

337
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,230
If he joins the game, I’ll as well.

338
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,780
Of course, he will.

339
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:58,820
Yeah.

340
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,760
Who will you cheer for?

341
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,240
Um.

342
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,070
One is my peer mentor.

343
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,860
Another is my buddy.

344
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,600
I’ll just cheer for both of you.

345
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,470
So you're not going to
cheer for anyone in particular?

346
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,580
Nah.

347
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,500
Even until now,

348
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,470
I'm still not more special than anyone else?

349
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,230
Arc.

350
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,560
Let’s sleep.

351
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,530
I’m sleepy.

352
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,390
Good night.

353
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,330
Hum?

354
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,800
Sigh.

355
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,030
What’s the matter with you?

356
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,290
You took me here

357
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,560
but turned your back to me.

358
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,630
So rude.

359
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,690
So what?

360
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,750
Wanna go back home?

361
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,690
I’ll give you a ride.

362
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,780
Oho.

363
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,600
Are you chasing me away?

364
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,480
I’m not.

365
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,620
Just asking about your willingness.

366
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,980
I’m trying to make up with you.

367
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,270
Can you stop being upset?

368
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,020
Why do you do this? I’m not upset.

369
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,630
If you’re not upset, then what’s this?

370
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,880
I’m just an ordinary peer mentor.

371
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,080
You’re being sarcastic, too.

372
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,460
So, what now?

373
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,700
Wanna go back now?

374
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,640
I’ll send you back.

375
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,450
I’ll hold you.

376
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:35,900
Tomorrow,

377
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,030
if you’re still upset,

378
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,130
I’ll punch you for real.

379
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,870
Why won’t you go there with me?

380
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,610
Seniors ask us to gather first.

381
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,420
Bet they will delegate the work and all.

382
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,600
Isn’t it your job to take care of me?

383
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,230
All players, not just you.

384
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,180
Does it include that guy?

385
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,890
Which guy?

386
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,980
Tongfah.

387
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,560
Sigh.

388
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,050
I take care of everyone.

389
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,640
Not only you.

390
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,350
Also, Fah is my buddy.

391
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,580
Um, I forgot.

392
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,000
I’m just ordinary.

393
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,260
Hey, if you were really ordinary,

394
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,360
I wouldn’t hold you through last night.

395
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,280
I’m going. Bye.

396
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,180
Hey.

397
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,640
Fah.

398
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,840
What are you doing here?

399
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Don’t all players need to be at the field?

400
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,810
I get lost.

401
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,340
What?

402
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,110
Your campus is big.

403
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,010
There are many fields, too.

404
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,350
Then, why did you end up here?

405
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,080
Just came to the faculty of engineering.

406
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,040
I might get to see you.

407
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,880
See me?

408
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,700
Before I came here,

409
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,880
they said our buddy would take care of us.

410
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,010
So, I’ve waited here

411
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,210
for my buddy to take care of me.

412
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,970
Oh, you make me feel bad.

413
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,940
I feel I’m a very bad buddy.

414
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,520
I didn’t give you my number.

415
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,120
Didn’t take you around my campus.

416
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:46,880
Sorry.

417
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,670
Hey.

418
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,670
Don’t be glum.

419
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,350
Nah, I’m not.

420
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,660
Wanna go to the field now?

421
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,580
Yeah, I think so.

422
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:58,990
Let’s go.

423
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,520
Wait.

424
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,980
What’s the matter?

425
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,740
Do you have like 10 minutes?

426
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,520
Heh, nah.

427
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,870
Oh, man.

428
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,600
Kidding.

429
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,010
Sure.

430
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,400
Well.

431
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,380
I want to consult you a bit.

432
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,980
We’ve only met for a day,

433
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,090
do you trust me already?

434
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,710
Um.

435
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,480
I want to consult someone
who’s quite distant from me.

436
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,700
If he were close, I might be done.

437
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,180
But I like to tease people though.

438
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,020
Whatever.

439
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,080
You can only tease me for a short while.

440
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,380
You’ll be back soon, right?

441
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,970
Yeah. So, what’s the matter?

442
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,810
Tell me.

443
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,040
Have you ever

444
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,280
liked something,

445
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,860
very much?

446
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,510
Is it a person or thing?

447
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,800
Anything.

448
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,020
Of course, I have.

449
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,760
But,

450
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
you have never owned it.

451
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,240
Afraid that once you own it for real,

452
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,200
you cannot take good care of that thing.

453
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,420
To the point that one day, it’s gone.

454
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,500
Something like that.

455
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,210
So, you like Arc.

456
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,340
But you don’t dare dating him

457
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,320
cause you’re afraid that you might lose him.

458
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,240
Am I right?

459
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,840
Um.

460
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,330
Something like that.

461
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,480
Hey, wait.

462
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,520
I only said this much and you got it all?

463
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,610
Um.

464
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,630
Oh…

465
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,860
Um.

466
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,210
Well.

467
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,490
Do you think the sky is pretty today?

468
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,490
Um…

469
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,850
Quite pretty.

470
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,420
Try close your eyes

471
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,870
and count from 1 to 3.

472
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,000
1.

473
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,890
2.

474
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,020
3.

475
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,870
Here.

476
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,950
The sky last seconds ago

477
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,120
is different from the one right now.

478
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,750
See this?

479
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:45,960
True that.

480
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,650
Then, what about it?

481
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,960
So,

482
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,890
how can you be sure that

483
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,860
the thing you’re not holding onto

484
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,690
will always be there for you to see?

485
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,490
Let me borrow your phone a bit.

486
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,060
Oh.

487
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,980
Sometimes,

488
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,870
a chance might not come often.

489
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,880
But if you finally got one,

490
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,500
hold it tightly.

491
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,620
And attentively take good care of it.

492
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,330
I think it’s more interesting.

493
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,740
Don’t you think so?

494
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,920
Arm.

495
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,450
Oh, Pun.

496
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,900
Hello.

497
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,120
Hello.

498
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,770
Who is he?

499
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,510
He’s Tongfah.

500
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,880
My buddy.

501
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,550
Oh, Tongfah.

502
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,610
Arm,

503
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,660
can we take his photos for our page?

504
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,090
Well, I knew it.

505
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,130
Please.

506
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,890
- Ask him for me.
-	Again?

507
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,900
He’s cute.

508
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:30,890
Fine.

509
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,920
Can she take photos of you

510
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,260
to promote the event a little?

511
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,200
Sure.

512
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:38,820
Can we do it here?

513
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,510
Of course.

514
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,020
Okay.

515
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,150
Please stand here.

516
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,480
Hmm, you’re so collaborative.

517
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,560
Unlike Arc.

518
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,300
That guy is limited.

519
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,300
One of a kind, and unlike anyone else.

520
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,650
True. Only made for you.

521
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,030
Huh?

522
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,330
Come one. Ready?

523
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,770
1, 2, 3.

524
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,840
Uh…

525
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,260
Arm.

526
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,490
Take photos with him.

527
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,800
Isn’t he your buddy?

528
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,290
People might like it if I post it on our page.

529
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,640
What page will you post it on?

530
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,080
Uh, page…

531
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,630
Page…

532
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,890
Our uni's page.

533
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,480
Yes.

534
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,120
Yes, yes. The uni’s page.

535
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,670
To promote the event.

536
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,590
That’s right.

537
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,340
To promote the Engineers Unite.

538
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,680
Then, take photos with me.

539
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,970
Oh, okay.

540
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,890
Okay, ready? 1, 2, 3.

541
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,140
Move closer.

542
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,440
Everyone.

543
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,190
It’s you, man.

544
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,880
Those who have to
take care of the players are all here, right?

545
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,280
Yes.

546
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,160
Yes.

547
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,030
The game is about to begin.

548
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,860
So, follow your seniors in groups.

549
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,410
There’ll be many things for you to do.

550
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,220
Hey.

551
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
I think it’s getting weird now.

552
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,070
I think it’s all on me.

553
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,660
What are you doing here?

554
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,180
Is there something missing at the field?

555
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,780
There’s no staff to take care of the players.

556
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,330
What a timing. We’re about to let them go.

557
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,010
Yes, yes. I’ll go.

558
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,860
Okay.

559
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:36,960
Come back, come back.

560
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,220
Not you. Come back.

561
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,440
Damn, it’s not me.

562
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,440
Why did you make me go?

563
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,400
What’s with you?

564
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,490
Get up.

565
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,440
Do your job already.

566
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,790
I’ll go with everyone.

567
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,900
I told you.

568
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,570
You only have one job.

569
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,380
Only take care of those in your liner.

570
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,100
Get up.

571
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,890
Can you not be stubborn?

572
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,120
You’re just too cute.

573
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,610
Hey, calm down. Calm down.

574
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,370
Po.

575
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,160
Po.

576
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,160
Hurry up. Will you get up already?

577
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,160
Uh.

578
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,140
Hey, hey.

579
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,810
- Hurry up.
- 	Arm, just go. Go.

580
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,170
See you.

581
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,360
Arm, good luck.

582
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:32,860
Arc.

583
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,410
Do you think

584
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,250
they’re looking at us strangely?

585
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,650
Nah.

586
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,870
Isn’t it the zone for the players?

587
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,300
I think

588
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,890
I better sit on a bleacher.

589
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,700
Nah.

590
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,770
Sit.

591
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,890
Support for the player is also important.

592
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,050
Just sit here.

593
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,200
Arc.

594
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,250
Your motivation must be fully charged now.

595
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,370
Go get change.

596
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,680
Go, Arc.

597
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,720
Just go already.

598
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,160
Only cheer for me.

599
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,540
Well.งง

600
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,210
How can that be?

601
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Tongfah is my buddy.

602
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,760
I have to cheer for him, too.

603
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,890
Also, many people will cheer for you.

604
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,890
Many will cheer for your buddy, too.

605
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,330
You have more.

606
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,350
It’s different.

607
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,770
What’s the difference?

608
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,220
Others are not you.

609
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,120
Can’t it be you?

610
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,350
The one who cheers for me.

611
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,640
Can it be you, Arm?

612
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,180
Um.

613
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,930
Arc.

614
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,410
Yeah.

615
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,890
Go change your clothes already.

616
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,560
Fighting.

617
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,170
Um.

618
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,270
Go, go.

619
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,890
Yeah.

620
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,410
Whoa.

621
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,350
Damn, Arc.

622
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,230
Damn.

623
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,060
That’s it.

624
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:43,770
What’s that?

625
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,770
What did you do, man?

626
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,580
Oho.

627
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,760
Let’s go.

628
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,850
Sigh.

629
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,170
Hey.

630
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,090
I’ll take one then.

631
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,520
Here’s the water, Arc.

632
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,670
Are you hurt anywhere?

633
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,380
Nah.

634
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,720
Tongfah really is as cool as everyone says.

635
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,380
I'm the one going easy on him.

636
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,380
If I won the first half, it’d not be fun anymore.

637
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,870
Yeah, Mr. Capable.

638
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,620
You don’t want to hurt the pride of our uni.

639
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,730
I don’t play for the uni.

640
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,440
You’re the university soccer player,

641
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,660
but you say you don’t play for the uni?

642
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,530
Are you crazy?

643
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,140
I play the game for you.

644
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,720
Heh, talking nonsense

645
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,520
Arc.

646
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,510
We haven’t talked a lot.

647
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,290
I’m here to give you a gift.

648
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,470
Thank you.

649
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,230
Well…

650
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,050
Your campus is big.

651
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,600
I get lost every time I walk around.

652
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,870
Um, no problem.

653
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:28,950
Huh?

654
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,510
You’ll go back tomorrow.

655
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,930
It means nothing
though you remember the way.

656
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,280
Arc.

657
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,690
Yeah.

658
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,490
I’ll go back there first.

659
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,130
See you at the party this evening.

660
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,120
Uh, wait... Wait a moment, Brink.

661
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,840
A-ngun	.

662
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,390
Huh?

663
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,730
Uh, A-ngun, this’s Brink.

664
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,470
Brink, this’s A-ngun.

665
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,500
I saw you posted
that your buddy didn’t come. Is that right?

666
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,960
Oh, yes.

667
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,990
Great.

668
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,530
Brink is Arc’s buddy

669
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,240
but he has no time to take care of her.

670
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,470
Can you take care of her?

671
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,250
Of course.

672
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,250
Right?

673
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,920
Then, I’ll be in your care, A-ngun.

674
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,260
I’ll take care of you.

675
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,430
Bye bye.

676
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,540
Sigh.

677
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,060
Hey, Arc.

678
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,510
Can’t you be nice?

679
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,800
I feel sorry for Brink.

680
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,150
What?

681
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,040
I didn’t do anything.

682
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,080
Don’t act innocent.

683
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Why do you have to make it
so obvious that you don’t like her?

684
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,900
Not that I don’t like her.

685
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,210
It’s my usual self.

686
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,640
Usual?

687
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,280
But how I treat you

688
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,740
is to show that I like the person.

689
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,570
Damn.

690
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,570
You just talked nonsense.

691
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,220
I’ll go buy you a refreshing towel.

692
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,620
The heck are you looking at?

693
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,690
Nothing.

694
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,400
What’s wrong with you guys?

695
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,240
Here’s the water.

696
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,060
Want some water?

697
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,060
Sigh.

698
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,410
Sigh.

699
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,790
Oh, Fah.

700
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,500
Oh…

701
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,800
You were so great, bro.

702
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,350
Superb.

703
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,790
You even won.

704
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,460
It’s just the first half.

705
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,370
And what are you doing here?

706
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,760
oh, I’m here to buy stuff.

707
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,120
Yeah, I’m about to give them to you.

708
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,180
You just can take them now.

709
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,090
Oh.

710
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,410
There’s an analgesic balm, too.

711
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,250
Giving me this,

712
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,900
aren’t you afraid
that your peer mentor might be upset?

713
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,060
You mean Pun?

714
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:55,860
Nah.

715
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,010
I didn’t ask about Yeepun.

716
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,800
I’m asking about Arc.

717
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,600
Arc?

718
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,220
Um.

719
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,220
He cannot be upset either.

720
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,490
He’s a peer mentor.

721
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,880
You’re my buddy.

722
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,880
I have to take good care of you as well.

723
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,240
Is he really just your peer mentor?

724
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,570
What’s that, Fah?

725
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,090
Yeah, a peer mentor.

726
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,720
Thanks.

727
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,600
Buddy.

728
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,190
Yeah.

729
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,270
Then, want me to take you anywhere?

730
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,270
Will you get lost again?

731
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,540
It’s nice to get lost though.

732
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,730
I might find someone who feels a thing for me.

733
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,660
See you.

734
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,230
Yeah.

735
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,210
Here’s your food.

736
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,390
You didn’t come to cheer for me so I lost.

737
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,660
Hey, I have to take care of others.

738
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,550
Also, to prepare for the show tomorrow.

739
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,700
I got hurt, too.

740
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,500
Hey.

741
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,450
What happened?

742
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,160
I was cut when I carried the backdrop.

743
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,100
Not hurt anymore.

744
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,300
Why didn’t you tell me when you got hurt?

745
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,900
I’m telling you right now.

746
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,090
Don’t wait until the bandage is on;

747
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,460
you should’ve told me when it happened.

748
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,220
Well, you must be on the field at the time.

749
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,980
I didn’t want to bother you.

750
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,770
Just do it. You can bother me anytime.

751
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,700
Understood?

752
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,140
I just don’t want to bother you.

753
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,270
But I promise,
if I get hurt like Arm did,

754
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,580
you’ll be the first to know.

755
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,670
If I ever
let you get hurt that badly,

756
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,360
I’ll be so mad at myself.

757
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,460
Why will you feel mad?

758
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,780
Because I didn’t take good care of you.

759
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,180
Wait, it’s my head.
I have to take care of it myself.

760
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,350
What if I want to take care of you?

761
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,370
What do I have to do?

762
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,020
Do I have to be your boyfriend?

763
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,440
What did you say?

764
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,476
What did you say?

765
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,690
Damn.

766
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,720
Pond, you’re messing with me.

767
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,380
Thought you might unconsciously agree.

768
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,610
So wicked, bro.

769
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,290
Let’s go.

770
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,300
Let’s go.

771
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,050
Arm.

772
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,550
Bring the food to the player’s room for me.

773
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,540
Oh, okay.

774
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,540
Here.

775
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,020
Sigh.

776
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,440
Hm?

777
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:24,900
Oh.

778
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,700
Hey.

779
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
You need to pull, not push, you dummy.

780
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,880
I don’t know.

781
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,740
What do you know then?

782
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,200
Just acting sloppy every day.

783
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,880
You scold me again.

784
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:44,880
Tsk.

785
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,750
It’s hot outside. Come in.

786
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,100
Your cheeks are all red.

787
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,100
The food is here, guys.

788
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,610
Here.

789
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,700
Arc, here’s your survival pack.

790
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,370
There’s an analgesic balm, too.

791
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,190
Want it?

792
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,890
Um.

793
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,290
What’s up, Arm?

794
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,220
Oh.

795
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,340
Warm, tonight…

796
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,930
Will you perform anything?

797
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,260
Don’t people scream for me

798
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,630
even when I only show up on the stage?

799
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,660
Yeah.

800
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,510
Cause you’re the star.

801
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,480
Here.

802
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,530
It’s quite a regret.

803
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,890
You fell from the stage that day.

804
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
Or else, you’d be the star already.

805
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,600
Bet God doesn’t like me

806
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,280
so he kicked me out of the stage.

807
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,890
Anyway, it’s good that you’re not the star.

808
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,340
Isn’t it better to be
a person of the “beyond-the-star”?

809
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,030
Is that right, Arc?

810
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,220
Is it good?

811
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,730
What’s that?

812
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,820
Meet you again.

813
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,530
Have you eaten, Fah?

814
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,660
You can just take it.

815
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,290
Oh, fine.

816
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,460
I had it.

817
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,300
Yeah, Fah.

818
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,900
Tonight,

819
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,410
will you perform anything?

820
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,580
Of course.

821
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,980
Must represent my uni a little bit.

822
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:39,860
Really?

823
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:40,210
Um.

824
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,880
Well, what is the show?

825
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,780
Can you give me a spoiler?

826
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,170
What’s that?

827
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:49,890
Well,

828
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,500
just playing guitar and singing.

829
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,280
You can play guitar as well?

830
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,160
So cool.

831
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,890
I haven’t chosen the song.

832
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,810
Are you free?

833
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,290
Come help me choose a song.

834
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,800
Oh, I’m free.

835
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:03,870
Uh.

836
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,700
But can you play just any songs?

837
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,440
Um.

838
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,010
Let’s see,

839
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,290
I better go practice first.

840
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,880
Well, I’ll see you later.

841
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,760
See you.

842
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,890
So cool.

843
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,900
Yeah, Arc…

844
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,990
What did you feed me?

845
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:21,770
Give me another bite.

846
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,140
You have hands. Eat it yourself.

847
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,980
What?

848
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,180
My hands are full of the balm.

849
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,410
I’m massaging you.

850
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,800
Why don’t you massage him, too?

851
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,280
Huh?

852
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,350
Are you upset?

853
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,020
Huh.

854
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,120
Take them back.

855
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,880
I don’t use promotional stuff.

856
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,730
What promotion?

857
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,770
Didn’t you buy the 1-get-1 stuff?

858
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,530
Fah and I got quite the same ones.

859
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,710
How can they be the 1-get-1?

860
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,140
For Fah,

861
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,500
he doesn’t have me with him like this.

862
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,250
This one is super duper special.

863
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,250
Sigh.

864
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,140
You can feed me now, right?

865
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,140
You’re so good at it.

866
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,890
Good at what?

867
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,140
Messing with my feelings.

868
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,130
You’re really good at it.

869
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,360
When it’s my turn, don’t you dare crying.

870
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,550
Here.

871
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,560
Not going as well as planned.

872
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,480
What will you do?

873
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,320
You can’t be slow anymore, right?

874
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:40,560
Arc.

875
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:41,890
Oh my.

876
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,450
Wanna eat anything before the match?

877
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,490
Electrolyte drinks?

878
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,900
Nah. It’s okay.

879
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,350
You’ve been walking in the sun all day.

880
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,300
You’re gonna pass out.

881
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,860
Well, not gonna happen.

882
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,650
But it’s super hot.

883
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,270
Here.

884
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,160
I don’t dare to use it.

885
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,780
Your name is embroidered here.

886
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,660
The maker must pay so much attention to it.

887
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,360
Here.

888
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:22,980
Hey.

889
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,700
What are you doing?

890
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,710
Why are you surprised?

891
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,340
Here.

892
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,730
Dare to use it now?

893
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,790
Only this and it’s now mine?

894
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,200
Yours?

895
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:51,740
Here.

896
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,020
Hey.

897
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,740
Why did you take your shirt off?

898
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,280
Move.

899
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:06,590
Here.

900
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,300
This’s your man, too.

901
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,570
Hey, Arc.

902
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,500
Why don’t you wait for us?

903
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,290
You only care to eat.

904
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,250
Wait.

905
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,920
Let’s go.

906
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,140
Man…

907
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,120
Your man.

908
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,680
Am… I Arc’s?

909
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,330
Nonsense.

910
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,080
Of course not.

911
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,000
Me?

912
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,890
Hey, but I’d give them this time.

913
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,080
They were so great.

914
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,140
Indeed.

915
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:26,980
Move, move away.

916
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,290
I need a toilet. I need a toilet.

917
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,060
Damn.

918
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,280
Then, what about tonight?

919
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,400
Still going?

920
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,600
Of course.

921
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,500
We’ve booked the VIP room.

922
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,370
Win or lose, we’ll get wasted.

923
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,760
Do you not have to perform tonight?

924
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:43,930
Nah.

925
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,900
I’ve got contacts of everyone
from all majors and universities

926
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,980
that I have my eyes on already.

927
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,350
Why would I bother performing there?

928
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,870
Oh, man.

929
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,890
What about you? Still going?

930
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,540
No. I’ll go to the Engineering party.

931
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,610
You?

932
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,320
Um.

933
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,110
Arc.

934
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,900
Tongfah already beat you at soccer,

935
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,560
but you can’t let him win at anything else.

936
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,930
Come on. Let’s shower.

937
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,840
Forget it.

938
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,390
I’ll go with you.

939
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,490
I’ll use your soap.

940
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,180
I forgot mine.

941
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,180
Sure. We can use the same one.

942
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
Didn’t you say you go easy on him?

943
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,170
Even in the last game,
did you still go easy on him?

944
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:44,920
Yeah, I lost.

945
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,250
Happy now?

946
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,880
Hey.

947
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,570
I’m kidding.

948
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,570
No need to be so serious, Arc.

949
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,220
What do you want?

950
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,550
Talk nicely.

951
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,690
I’m here to console you.

952
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:58,750
Really?

953
00:43:58,910 --> 00:43:59,800
Thanks.

954
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
That’s it, right?

955
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:01,460
Hey.

956
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,580
Wait, wait, wait.

957
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:06,710
Here.

958
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,610
Your consolation prize.

959
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,380
Stop being upset already.

960
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,730
It’s not cool at all, Arc.

961
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,700
Arm.

962
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:22,990
Yeah.

963
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,990
I’ll help Pun out then.

964
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,020
Don’t forget to drink it.

965
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,020
Hello.

966
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:42,670
Test.

967
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:43,110
Test.

968
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:43,840
Test.

969
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,850
Love Yeepun, test.

970
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,000
Love Yeepun.

971
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:48,730
Love Yeepun, dear.

972
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,040
That’s enough.

973
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,360
The mic is loud, right?

974
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,280
Oh, not loud at all.

975
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,050
Volume up.

976
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,690
Love Yeepun.

977
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,700
Why did you tease him?

978
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,700
This couple is so lovey-dovey.

979
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,560
Enough.

980
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,660
- Come down.
- 	Enough?

981
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,590
Come down already.

982
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,590
Is my idol not coming?

983
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:11,900
Uh…

984
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:14,670
Arc

985
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,390
won’t participate in this kind of event.

986
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,300
We’re lucky that
he even agreed to play soccer for us.

987
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,590
Amen.

988
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,060
I thought Arc might drag you away already.

989
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:28,000
Drag me?

990
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,980
Why?

991
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:29,660
What?

992
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,100
Are you not in a relationship?

993
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,500
Uh…

994
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:38,100
Not yet.

995
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,860
Taking his shirt off to write your name down.

996
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,740
Are you sure you guys are nothing?

997
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,240
Even me,

998
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,570
I’ve been with Jet for so long,

999
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:48,910
and he’s never done anything like that.

1000
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:51,760
Do you want it, too, darling?

1001
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,410
I’ll write it down here on my jacket.

1002
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,370
No way he can wash it off.

1003
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:56,800
Never mind, darling.

1004
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,910
They all know how much we love each other.

1005
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:01,620
Um.

1006
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:02,230
Yeah.

1007
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,440
So,

1008
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,410
what between you and Arc?

1009
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,080
Dating

1010
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:10,390
Or not dating.

1011
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,090
Hmm?

1012
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,120
Uh…

1013
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,070
I don’t know either.

1014
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:21,920
Not date yet.

1015
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:22,960
Tsk.

1016
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,960
What’s he waiting for?

1017
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,530
Sigh.

1018
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
Jet asked what Arc was waiting for.

1019
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,740
It’s you, isn’t it?

1020
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,990
I don’t know.

1021
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,780
Did you tell him about Sai?

1022
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:44,740
Um.

1023
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,820
Arc told me

1024
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,260
he’s going to help me move forward.

1025
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:51,990
In what way?

1026
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,230
Like he will make you stand by yourself

1027
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,510
or will you guys move forward together?

1028
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,080
He didn’t tell me.

1029
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:00,830
So, what about you?

1030
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,030
How do you want it to be?

1031
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:08,960
I think

1032
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,430
Moving on with Arc wouldn’t be so lonely.

1033
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,880
Glad to hear that.

1034
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,780
And I’m sure

1035
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,150
Arc will be glad if he hears this, too.

1036
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,010
Has the party started?

1037
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,730
Hey.

1038
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,920
I have to recharge myself.

1039
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,540
So, I won’t feel drained when I get down.

1040
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:40,650
Hey, Sand.

1041
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,390
Huh?

1042
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,430
You can go inside first.

1043
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,040
I’ll be on the phone first.

1044
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,170
Okay. Quickly follow me then.

1045
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:08,280
Hey.

1046
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,010
Pun.

1047
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:09,980
Arm.

1048
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,320
What are you doing here?

1049
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,140
I forgot my phone in the player’s room.

1050
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:15,930
Oh.

1051
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,690
Want me to get it for you?

1052
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,140
It’s okay, I guess.

1053
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,880
You go to the party first.

1054
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:22,840
It’s okay.

1055
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,880
It’s already late at night.

1056
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,680
I’ll go get it for you.

1057
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,980
Uh, okay. Fine.

1058
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,620
I’ll leave it to you then.

1059
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:30,770
Thanks.

1060
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:31,120
Yeah.

1061
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,280
See you at the party.

1062
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,070
What?

1063
00:48:59,110 --> 00:48:59,900
Arc.

1064
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,890
I heard Sand say

1065
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,470
you guys have
another celebration planned, right?

1066
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,410
I didn’t go there.

1067
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:11,880
Well, why are you
playing guitar alone here?

1068
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,850
I’ll perform.

1069
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:17,180
Perform?

1070
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,710
What performance?

1071
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,610
The party over there.

1072
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,210
Are you crazy?

1073
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,700
You cannot play guitar.

1074
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,790
Do you really think practicing
for half an hour will make you a pro?

1075
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,300
No idea.

1076
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,200
Will try it out first.

1077
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,236
Hey, Arc.

1078
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:49,890
What are you doing?

1079
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:52,210
Can you tell me?

1080
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:02,560
Sigh.

1081
00:50:02,589 --> 00:50:04,560
I saw the way you looked at Tongfah.

1082
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,185
Your eyes are all dreamy.

1083
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,883
When he sang and played guitar.

1084
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,530
So, I thought you might like it.

1085
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,370
I just like to listen to music.

1086
00:50:16,407 --> 00:50:18,370
I just like the sound of a guitar.

1087
00:50:18,901 --> 00:50:20,254
Sigh.

1088
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,370
I want that kind of look from you, too.

1089
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:31,905
I don’t know how I used to look at you.

1090
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,352
But right now,

1091
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,698
from the way I look at you,

1092
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:44,312
don’t you feel anything at all?

1093
00:50:52,836 --> 00:50:54,501
I don’t know if you don’t tell me.

1094
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,672
Then,

1095
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,021
I’ll tell you.

1096
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,120
I…

1097
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,530
Hello, Pun.

1098
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,621
Oh, yes.

1099
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,832
Yes, I found it.

1100
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,167
Pun wanted us to go back.

1101
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,665
Should we go there now?

1102
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,476
They are all red.

1103
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,225
No need to try anymore.

1104
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,578
Being you like this

1105
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:23,410
is the cutest version already.

1106
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,261
Understood?

1107
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:25,280
Let’s go.

1108
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,032
Let’s go to the party.

1109
00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:28,210
Hurry up.

1110
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,523
And today, I’d like to congratulate

1111
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:38,290
SSU for winning this year’s championship.

1112
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:47,985
Hey.

1113
00:52:50,021 --> 00:52:50,916
Hello, Arc.

1114
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,596
Did you tell him?

1115
00:52:56,494 --> 00:52:57,229
Not yet.

1116
00:52:58,945 --> 00:52:59,272
What?

1117
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,094
Hurry up and say it.

1118
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:00,894
Fighting.

1119
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:04,581
And to not waste any more time,

1120
00:53:04,603 --> 00:53:07,025
Tongfah from SSU

1121
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,436
can kick off today’s performance.

1122
00:53:08,472 --> 00:53:10,050
So cool, Tongfah.

1123
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:21,752
Thanks so much

1124
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,470
for welcoming us so nicely.

1125
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:25,360
As for this song,

1126
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,261
I want to sing for everyone.

1127
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:31,796
Thank you.

1128
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:33,745
Hey.

1129
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,389
Hey, Arc.

1130
00:54:38,443 --> 00:54:40,440
Why are you dragging me here?

1131
00:54:40,472 --> 00:54:42,276
Tongfah hasn’t finished singing.

1132
00:54:42,298 --> 00:54:43,898
You like to listen to music

1133
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:45,418
or do you just like Tongfah?

1134
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:47,600
Huh?

1135
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:49,018
Sigh.

1136
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,883
Do you like Tongfah?

1137
00:54:54,385 --> 00:54:55,898
Are you crazy?

1138
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,869
I don’t like him.

1139
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:59,243
How can I like him?

1140
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:01,200
We’ve only met for a few days.

1141
00:55:01,236 --> 00:55:02,305
Are you crazy?

1142
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,800
If you knew him longer,

1143
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,163
would you like him?

1144
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,610
Are you drunk?

1145
00:55:08,632 --> 00:55:09,505
Hurry up.

1146
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,610
Answer me first.

1147
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:11,876
I’m not feeling okay.

1148
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,407
Yeah, I wouldn’t.

1149
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:16,705
How can I like him?

1150
00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:19,701
Tongfah doesn’t seem
like he’ll like me either.

1151
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,243
Um.

1152
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,123
My turn to ask you.

1153
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,592
What’s the matter?

1154
00:55:29,614 --> 00:55:31,200
Calling me all the way to talk about this.

1155
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:33,134
Well…

1156
00:55:34,676 --> 00:55:36,756
I don’t want you
to the special someone of anyone.

1157
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,105
What special someone?

1158
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,756
1.

1159
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,672
I don’t like anyone else looking at you.

1160
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:48,974
2.

1161
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,436
I don’t like you smiling at anyone else.

1162
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,545
3.

1163
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,090
I don’t like you going around acting cute.

1164
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:58,320
4.

1165
00:55:58,574 --> 00:55:59,549
I don’t like…

1166
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,254
The fact that I’m only just a peer mentor.

1167
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,607
Arc.

1168
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:19,650
Arm,

1169
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,440
do you like me a bit more now?

1170
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,658
What did you do?

1171
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:32,509
Just… checking my own feelings.

1172
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,810
You only checked that much,

1173
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,672
how would you know anything?

1174
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,603

1175
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:59,687

How’s that?

1180
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,200
What did you find out?

1181
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,287
You're really something,

1182
00:57:23,112 --> 00:57:25,110
making me brave enough to open up again.

1183
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,567

00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:54,501
Arc, why do you love me?

1187
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,141
He’s cute though.

1188
00:57:57,381 --> 00:57:58,276
Which part of him is cute?

1189
00:57:58,305 --> 00:58:00,270
You’ve targeted me
since the first day we met?

1190
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,072
Sand,

1191
00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:03,294
can you be my boyfriend already?

1192
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,181
I don’t love you the same.

1193
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,930
But I love you even more.

1194
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,781
I want to live with you for a long time, Arm.

1195
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,105
Sorry

1196
00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:14,780
for keeping you waiting for so long.

1197
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,094
I love you, Arm.

1198
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,672
I love you, too.
