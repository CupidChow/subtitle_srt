1
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

2
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,596
-Miss.
-Ask her what is wrong.

3
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,723
-I have no idea.
-Miss!

4
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,309
-What made you so angry?
-I'll kill you all!

5
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,146
What is this noise?

6
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,899
The palace was quiet for a while.

7
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,485
His Majesty must have
called the performers again.

8
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,489
The palace is full of unrest as it is.
I doubt it is the performers.

9
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,990
We have been here long enough.

10
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,159
It is obviously the performers.

11
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,703
Let us hurry and prepare
His Majesty's chojoban

12
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,914
before he reprimands us
for serving him late.

13
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,083
CHOJOBAN: EARLY MORNING MEAL
THAT USUALLY INCLUDES SOOTHING FOOD

14
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,542
Sure.

15
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,472
What are you doing?

16
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,807
You are scaring me.

17
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,773
Good morning.

18
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:54,739
I have no idea
why she stayed up all night doing that.

19
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,952
I must go to Saongwon,
Office of Royal Meals.

20
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,538
Then take me with you.

21
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,917
Man-su, it seems we are out of firewood.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,044
Oh no. That is not good news.

23
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,507
What is the matter, miss?

24
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,633
Look at your face.

25
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,805
What happened
that made you look so haggard?

26
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,310
There is no one but us now, so tell me.

27
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,730
-You're so dead!
-My goodness!

28
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,448
Do I have to cook hangover soup
for that punk?

29
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,077
It's such a shame
I don't have gochugaru, chili powder.

30
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,205
Poor dried pollack.

31
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,499
It died twice.

32
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,086
Miss, what are you making
that requires such work?

33
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:51,880
What?

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,800
I was going to cook
dried pollack hangover soup,

35
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,303
but this is an insult to the fish.

36
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,596
-Right?
-Yes.

37
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,515
I am embarrassed to face it. Oh dear.

38
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,767
Take this, Gil-geum.

39
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,603
What for?

40
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,355
I'm going to

41
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,526
turn all this into powder.

42
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,488
I'm going to destroy you!

43
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,034
Miss!

44
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:31,127
COURSE N° 5 SNOWFLAKE SCHNITZEL

45
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,841
Your Majesty, your chojoban is ready.

46
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,343
Bring it in.

47
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,236
YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

48
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,905
Your Majesty, are you all right?

49
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,822
You are here.

50
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,171
You had too much to drink last night,

51
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,383
so I prepared a dried pollack consommé
to soothe your hangover.

52
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,759
CONSOMMÉ: A FRENCH-STYLE CLEAR SOUP

53
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,852
A dried pollack consumed in hay?

54
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,312
Yes.

55
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,315
It's a French-style soup
made with dried pollack.

56
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,654
A soup made with dried pollack?

57
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,448
-Taste it.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

58
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,545
CHOI MAL-IM
KING'S SENIOR COURT LADY

59
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,989
Did you not say

60
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,700
this was a dried pollack soup?

61
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,411
Where is the dried pollack?

62
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:32,123
I crushed the fish into small pieces
to make it easier to eat.

63
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,875
Have some more.

64
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,877
See if you feel anything bothering you.

65
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,712
Though I'm sure you won't feel anything.

66
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:43,426
Everyone but the chief royal cook
may leave.

67
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,136
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

68
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,521
Tell me.

69
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,565
Did something happen last night?

70
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,819
I was going to ask you.

71
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,406
Do you not remember

72
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,741
what happened last night?

73
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,995
Well, I was drinking.

74
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,623
And then?

75
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,250
One drinks to forget.

76
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,211
So why would I remember anything?

77
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:24,592
So you're saying
you don't remember anything at all, right?

78
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,470
How dare you?
You are speaking out of line.

79
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,679
Why do you keep asking?

80
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,517
"Stay as you are."

81
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,895
"Just for a while."

82
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,397
You don't remember that?

83
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,274
What was that?

84
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,154
I'd rather not explain any further.

85
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,405
Are you done?

86
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,408
Why are you acting like this?

87
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,077
Tell it to me straight.

88
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,457
Your Majesty.

89
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,627
Let me make one thing very clear.

90
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,964
You're not my style at all, okay?

91
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,882
What? Not your sty?

92
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,468
No. I'm talking about ideal types.

93
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,761
The type that I like.

94
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:13,057
You're not at all
the kind of man that I like.

95
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,519
Have you forgotten?

96
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,730
You are my chief royal cook.

97
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,566
That means

98
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,695
I do not see you as a woman.

99
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,281
That's perfect.

100
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,450
So what is there to make clear?

101
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,078
I'm so sick and tired of this.

102
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,330
I won't beat around the bush.

103
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,415
Your Majesty.

104
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,418
From now on, watch where you… No.

105
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,171
Watch out
when you drink at night, all right?

106
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,964
Very well.

107
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,383
I will be careful when I drink at night.

108
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,556
-Take the food away.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

109
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,575
My goodness.

110
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,083
Chang-seon.

111
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,962
CHANG-SEON
CHIEF EUNUCH OF ROYAL FOOD

112
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,547
Did you ask for me, Your Majesty?

113
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,674
Did something happen

114
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,260
to the chief royal cook
at Unyeongjeong last night?

115
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,394
Yesterday, she…

116
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,854
What happened to her?

117
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,481
Well…

118
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,319
You laid your lips upon hers,
Your Majesty.

119
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,201
I laid my lips
upon the chief royal cook's own?

120
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,080
I brought your juansang--

121
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,373
Stay still.

122
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,334
Your Majesty…

123
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,336
Stay as you are.

124
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,420
Just for a while.

125
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,514
Do you not remember
what happened last night?

126
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,848
Your Majesty, from now on,

127
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,142
watch out
when you drink at night, all right?

128
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,354
What on earth do I do about this?

129
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,484
It would be better for us both
to ignore what happened.

130
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,487
No. Considering what I did to her,

131
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,906
it would be best to soothe her anger.

132
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,907
Wait.

133
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,742
Why should I

134
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,287
even worry about this?

135
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,414
I am the king of this nation,

136
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,791
and Cook Yeon is just my cook.

137
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,838
The more I think about it,
the less sense it makes.

138
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,728
He doesn't remember, huh?

139
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:07,481
Man, how ridiculous. That punk.

140
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,027
I understand he blacked out,

141
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,446
but how can he be so shameless?

142
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,823
I didn't even expect an apology.

143
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,159
This is just absurd.

144
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,660
Is something bothering you?

145
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,665
Why are you mumbling to yourself?

146
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,461
Who are you? Do you know me?

147
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,629
GONG-GIL
YEONHUIGUN'S JESTER WITH MANY SECRETS

148
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,922
Do you not recognize me?

149
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,799
I asked because I don't.

150
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,094
Surely you're not a new cook.

151
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,395
What the heck?

152
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,194
You're that jester from the other night.

153
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,071
Gong-gil?

154
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:55,988
That is right.

155
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,617
I apologize for startling you that night.

156
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,618
Did you

157
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,205
come here to deceive me
and call it another performance?

158
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,792
Let me tell you something.

159
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,170
I got promoted to chief royal cook.

160
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,713
It's a sixth-rank junior position.

161
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,216
The head of the royal kitchen.

162
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,093
That sure is intimidating.

163
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,220
A sixth-rank junior official.

164
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,848
Are you laughing?

165
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,558
I'm warning you right now.

166
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,102
Very well.

167
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,355
I will not mock you again.

168
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,359
By the way, is that maid all right?

169
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,486
Gil-geum, was it?

170
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,738
Someone suddenly hit me and made me fall.

171
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,240
That's when I smacked my head
on the ground.

172
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,493
A man suddenly appeared
and shouted at the culprit.

173
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:46,747
It was the handsome jester, Gong-gil.

174
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,706
Oh.

175
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,001
Yes. Gil-geum is fine and well.

176
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,755
Did you see who did that to her?

177
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,674
I did not see.

178
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,384
However,

179
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,178
the color of her attire
was that of a court lady.

180
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,472
I saw the hem of her skirt, you see.

181
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,974
A court lady?

182
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,434
Who on earth would do that?

183
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,937
Tell Gil-geum to watch out for a while.

184
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,856
I will.

185
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,276
Gil-geum is grateful for your help.

186
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,444
It was nothing at all.

187
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,655
I only ran into her
while looking for someone.

188
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,115
Who were you looking for?

189
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,201
Sometimes ignorance is bliss.

190
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,287
Okay.

191
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,038
Goodbye then.

192
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,833
I hope to see you again, Chief Royal Cook.

193
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,628
What's wrong with him?

194
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,423
This place is filled with weirdos.

195
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,508
I just can't get used to this.

196
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,683
Who is that?

197
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,792
She was taken to Jahongwon
and returned home dead.

198
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,712
This is all because of that damned king!

199
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,425
You said you would live a comfortable life
in the palace.

200
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,552
Why did you come back dead?

201
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,389
Ok-dan…

202
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,823
If I watch you closely,

203
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,326
I will soon find out.

204
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,371
After all, I have found the owner

205
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,500
of the binyeo that my older sister
held tight even in death.

206
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,087
Are you certain

207
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,632
that Gong-gil did not see you
during the competition?

208
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,510
Yes, Your Grace. Do not concern yourself.

209
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:09,431
Could it be that the lowly jester
has grown fond of the gwinyeo?

210
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,228
How interesting.

211
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:18,691
If the jester has secretly developed
feelings for the gwinyeo,

212
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,026
he will get in the way at every turn.

213
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,989
Get someone who can be trusted
to find out all they can about Gong-gil.

214
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,617
I must find out why he suddenly
took a part in the gwinyeo's affairs.

215
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,702
Yes, Your Grace.

216
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,245
Also,

217
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,415
tell the chief eunuch
that I wish to speak with His Majesty

218
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,334
after the morning assembly today.

219
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,296
Yes, Your Grace. I will tell him so.

220
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,508
Your Majesty,

221
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,969
I believe the letters from the ministers
require your immediate attention.

222
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,054
What are these letters of appeal about?

223
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,931
It is a request that you reduce

224
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,601
the amount of ginseng
the Hwanghae Governor renders tribute.

225
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,395
They want the amount to be reduced?

226
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,481
Yes, Your Majesty. Ginseng smuggling
has recently become rampant in Kaesong,

227
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,859
and they are short on supply
to send to the palace.

228
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,529
Moreover, the Ming envoy
who will reach Hanyang in four days

229
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,907
is thought to mention this matter as well.

230
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,824
What?

231
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,410
As if buying Joseon ginseng
in secret is not enough,

232
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,996
they will make it a diplomatic issue?

233
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,416
Does the Ming want all the ginseng
Joseon can grow?

234
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,960
Nothing is for sure yet.

235
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,420
Please calm yourself, Your Majesty.

236
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,381
Tell me.

237
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,926
Who is the chief envoy this time?

238
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,054
The leader of the Imperial Eight,
also known as the eight directors

239
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,639
who seized power
with the Emperor's support…

240
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,140
THE IMPERIAL EIGHT: EIGHT EUNUCHS
(DIRECTORS) FAVORED BY THE MING EMPEROR

241
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,600
…Yu Kun.

242
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,395
Yu Kun?

243
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,688
Is he not the eunuch

244
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,608
who punished the Ming envoy
who returned after agreeing

245
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,402
to no longer take Joseon women as tribute
two years ago?

246
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,487
It is he, Your Majesty.

247
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,530
What is he scheming?

248
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:53,369
Why would that man
come in person as a chief envoy?

249
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,913
Find out exactly
what his true intent could be.

250
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,039
Yes, Your Majesty.

251
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,209
I will send word
to the reception official and find out.

252
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,802
Your Majesty.

253
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,679
Last night,

254
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,723
while partaking in your juansang,

255
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,142
you and the chief royal…

256
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,397
-Please forget it, Your Majesty.
-Do not stop midway.

257
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,648
Continue.

258
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,698
Is it true that while partaking
in your juansang last night,

259
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,825
you and the chief royal cook…

260
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,917
Is it true that you did that?

261
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,462
What?

262
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,090
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
Let us head to the morning assembly.

263
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,425
No, wait!

264
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,553
Come here.

265
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,478
I had a lot to drink,

266
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,482
and I think I bestowed
the brazen woman with my favor.

267
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,651
However, instead of being grateful,

268
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,029
her already unattractive face
is brimming with spite.

269
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,990
I cannot stand the sight.

270
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,201
How dare you laugh at me?

271
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,038
Your Majesty.

272
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,708
Women, by nature,
are easily swayed by gifts.

273
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,709
Gifts?

274
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,586
Is it not enough that I bestowed my favor?

275
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,129
Must I also give her a gift?

276
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,256
If her unattractive face
were to become even more unattractive,

277
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,926
it would torment you to have to
look at it every day, would it not?

278
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,220
It would indeed.

279
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,514
Then tell me.

280
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,517
What should I give someone like her
to make her feel better?

281
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,853
Silk?

282
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,480
A binyeo, hairpin?

283
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,939
Or a ring?

284
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,191
No, not those things.

285
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:51,445
You cannot gift a woman just anything,
Your Majesty.

286
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,404
Then what?

287
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,822
What is most important

288
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,617
is that you find out what she likes
and give her that.

289
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,787
How am I to know what she likes?

290
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,038
That is why

291
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,208
women are hard to grasp.

292
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,127
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager
prefers books to jewels,

293
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,005
and Her Grace Consort Kang
prefers jewels to books.

294
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,425
They are both women,
and yet they like different things.

295
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,179
I respectfully advise you
to ponder this carefully, Your Majesty.

296
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,352
Your Majesty.

297
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,355
A group of envoys will arrive in Hanyang
four days from today

298
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,273
with an edict from the Ming Emperor.

299
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,191
So I heard.

300
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,401
How are the preparations going?

301
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,987
A temporary reception office
has been set up,

302
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,365
and Second Minister of Rites
Yoo Hyeong-min left for Yangju

303
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,617
with a retinue to do his duty
as the reception official.

304
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,537
The envoy's route from the entrance
to the capital, Namdaemun,

305
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,789
to Taepyeonggwan, Official Reception Hall,
has been cleaned.

306
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,125
Furthermore, to entertain the envoys,

307
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,753
we summoned a great many jesters
for a grand welcome celebration.

308
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,673
Once the official business is done,
we will float boats on the Han River

309
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:56,802
where the envoys can write
and exchange poems with our scholars.

310
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,847
What about the preparations
for the farewell ceremony?

311
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,558
We prepared gifts
for them to take on their return,

312
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:07,062
including 200 pieces of silver bullion.

313
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,063
What?

314
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,565
Two hundred pieces of silver?

315
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,983
Yes, Your Majesty.

316
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,359
That is not all.

317
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,319
The silver must be taken to the border,

318
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,364
and that requires eight men per cart,
a total of around sixty men.

319
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,409
It will reduce
what is in our coffers by half.

320
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,493
Your Majesty.

321
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,454
This is something that must be done

322
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,165
to sustain our amicable relationship
with the Ming.

323
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,334
However, it is true
that 200 pieces of silver are too much.

324
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:33,046
That is right. The previous envoy
did not return with that much silver.

325
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,466
The previous envoy was a civil official
well-known in the Ming,

326
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,927
and he did not care much
for monetary goods.

327
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,888
However, the envoy
we are expecting this time

328
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,850
is known for being haughty and greedy,
even in his homeland.

329
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,019
An excess can be remedied later on,

330
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,438
but we will not have time
to make up for a deficiency.

331
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,566
It is only right to be well-prepared.

332
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,235
I agree with the Chief State Councilor.

333
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,696
We do not yet know
what the envoy will demand,

334
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,574
and we cannot ignore
their authority and influence.

335
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,618
Would it not be best to host the envoys

336
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,953
-without incident?
-Enough!

337
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,375
That is enough.

338
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,543
Our state coffers

339
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,213
are filled with the blood, sweat,

340
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,381
and hard work of my people.

341
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:17,841
And yet

342
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,719
you have no plans to secure our resources

343
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,264
and only aim to pander to them
and cower before their whims.

344
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,141
You do not know what he will demand,

345
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,435
so you prepared gifts
and 200 pieces of silver?

346
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,275
And you still claim that you are acting
in the people's interest?

347
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,194
Can you, without shame,

348
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,821
say that you are acting in the interest
of the country and its people?

349
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,323
However, Your Majesty,

350
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,825
we cannot simply demand our wishes

351
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,411
-when it comes to diplomatic issues.
-The taxes paid by the Joseon people

352
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,373
belong to the Joseon royal family.

353
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,252
Prepare only the minimum of gifts
and silver bullion,

354
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,545
and keep the reception of the envoys

355
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,756
in the most modest manner.

356
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,385
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

357
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:05,180
-We will do as you command.
-We will do as you command.

358
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:11,895
Your Majesty.

359
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,524
Step back.

360
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,900
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

361
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,153
What is it?

362
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:24,574
Yi Jang-gyun was found collapsed
at Banchon Village this morning.

363
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,327
-Is he alive?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

364
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,663
He is unconscious
due to the severe injury.

365
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,789
Where is he now?

366
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,126
What about the draft?

367
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,169
I did not find it.

368
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,381
I took him somewhere safe
and had a physician treat him.

369
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,299
And?

370
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,551
He disappeared without a trace.

371
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,970
-He disappeared?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

372
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,347
There were no signs of an intrusion,

373
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,558
so it seems he got away on his own.

374
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,186
Where would an injured man go?

375
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,524
Someone must still be after his life.

376
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:58,859
I am certain of it.

377
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,111
Who?

378
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,988
Who would do this?

379
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,951
Select a few nimble,
tight-lipped soldiers and find him.

380
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,745
Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,289
You must hurry.

382
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,213
Your Majesty.

383
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,675
Her Grace Consort Kang
wishes to have an audience with you.

384
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,886
I shall escort you to Jahongwon.

385
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,387
I do not

386
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,557
wish to see anyone today.

387
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,476
But Your Majesty…

388
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,810
Your Majesty.

389
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,940
These are butterfly hairpins.

390
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,901
Yes, I like these.

391
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,739
Leave us.

392
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,039
What is it?

393
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,166
His Majesty left the hall of governance,

394
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,086
but he is headed to his chambers.

395
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,170
What?

396
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:04,382
Did the chief eunuch inform him
that I wished to see him?

397
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,425
Yes, Your Grace.

398
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,639
So this is how he chooses to act.

399
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,689
Drag the queen out!

400
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,024
Let go of me!

401
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,318
How dare you do this to me?

402
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,696
Your Majesty, how could you--

403
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,366
Enough! Drag her away!

404
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,535
-Let go of me.
-Please stand up, Your Majesty.

405
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,995
Your Majesty!

406
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,748
A king is one who fathoms.

407
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,627
He must fathom his family, the heavens,

408
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,672
and the hearts of others.

409
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,881
What does fathom mean?

410
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:49,177
You will understand
what that means when you grow up.

411
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,224
Your Majesty.

412
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,893
This is the way to the royal kitchen.

413
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,743
Why did I come here?

414
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,246
Are you going to eat or not? Open up.

415
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,748
I'm glad to see you enjoying it.

416
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,377
I'm sure you had
a lot to think about today.

417
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,838
It's just like how being a king
comes with perks,

418
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,341
but also challenges and hardships.

419
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,345
Why am I thinking of you

420
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,724
when my heart feels heavy?

421
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:58,413
Someone must still be after his life.
I am certain of it.

422
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,416
Not even I have seen
the draft of the historical record.

423
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:06,546
So who is chasing Principal Drafter Yi
so viciously and why?

424
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,467
Your Majesty, it is I, Court Lady Choi.

425
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,509
You may enter.

426
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,017
Your Majesty.

427
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,853
-Your seoksura, evening meal--
-Leave it.

428
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,146
Pardon?

429
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,106
-Then--
-Enough.

430
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:27,984
I do not

431
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,780
wish to eat anything tonight.

432
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

433
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:52,425
His Majesty remains in his chambers
without eating his meal?

434
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,637
Something does not feel right.

435
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,766
Did you hear that last night,

436
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,478
he touched lips with the chief royal cook
who brought his juansang to Unyeongjeong?

437
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,771
Yes, Your Grace.

438
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,148
However, His Majesty was drunk--

439
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,526
It was not purely because he was drunk.

440
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,444
All incidents are preceded by a sign.

441
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:12,862
Then…

442
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,283
The chief royal cook's presence itself
is a thorn in my side.

443
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,118
What would you like to be done?

444
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,869
If he will not see me,

445
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,123
I have no choice but to go see him myself.

446
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,418
His Majesty's physical examination
is coming up, is it not?

447
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,295
Yes. It is in two days' time.

448
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,422
Grand Prince Jesan
will visit the palace that day.

449
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,548
What if

450
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:36,011
I served His Majesty a meal that day?

451
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,723
It would be the perfect way
to win back His Majesty's favor.

452
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,727
What should I serve him?

453
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,398
His Majesty will skip his seoksura.

454
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,316
Okay.

455
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,277
Wait, what?
He's skipping his evening meal? Why?

456
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,029
I do not know why,

457
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,198
but His Majesty said not to bring in
any food today.

458
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,784
He won't eat? That's odd.

459
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,077
It sure is.

460
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,830
He rarely misses a meal.

461
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,290
It truly is worrisome.

462
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,459
I'll prepare his meal anyway.

463
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,252
If he refuses to eat, so be it.

464
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,420
Do you have a good idea?

465
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,422
I have to at least try.

466
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,590
Yes, do that.

467
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,716
I shall get going.

468
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,469
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Eunuch Yoon.

469
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,847
-Oh dear. What do we do?
-Let's go.

470
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,475
-What was that?
-Le…

471
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,976
-What?
-Lego!

472
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,651
This competition was the chance
to replace the chief royal cook.

473
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,236
I have no excuse for my failure,
Your Grace.

474
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,406
This is your last chance
to become the chief royal cook.

475
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,825
Your Grace. This is…

476
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,285
It is arsenic.

477
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,371
Watch for the right time

478
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,790
and add that to the meal
the gwinyeo makes for His Majesty.

479
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,341
SEOKSURA

480
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,887
CHICKEN FRICASSEE
A FRENCH CREAM STEW WITH CHICKEN

481
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,056
What?

482
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,394
CHOJOBAN

483
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:10,980
Your Majesty. Your chojoban is ready.

484
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,153
He really should try this though.

485
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,659
NATGEOTSANG

486
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,079
Your Majesty, your natgeotsang,
daytime meal, is ready.

487
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,921
SEOKSURA

488
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,682
What a long day it was.

489
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,603
-You did well today.
-You too, Gil-geum.

490
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,360
Oh, are you not going inside?

491
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,362
No. You go ahead.

492
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,615
-Okay. Do not stay out too long.
-Okay.

493
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,334
How did I end up like this?

494
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,005
It feels like yesterday
that I won La Poêle d'Or.

495
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,549
This feels so unreal.

496
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,391
I wonder how Dad is doing.

497
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,394
I miss him.

498
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,151
I hope he's not skipping meals
like His Majesty is.

499
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,377
Oh my. I must be losing my mind.

500
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,803
What did I just see?

501
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,306
Isn't he hungry at all?

502
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,099
Food is what keeps us going.

503
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,811
What on earth is making him skip meals?

504
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,604
Goodness.

505
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,698
Oh, our dear princess,

506
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,742
is this little bite good enough for you?
Here you go.

507
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,119
This is what we call "tableside service."

508
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,330
Watching and enjoying
the food being prepared before your eyes

509
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,790
stimulates the appetite.

510
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,874
I'll show you.

511
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,293
Open your mouth.

512
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,345
Am I thinking of you because I am hungry,

513
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,807
or am I hungry
because I am thinking of you?

514
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,438
I cannot tell.

515
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:02,735
Chang-seon.

516
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,198
Yes, Your Majesty.

517
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,951
When will they serve my evening meal?

518
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:10,869
Pardon?

519
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:15,248
Did you just ask about your evening meal,
Your Majesty?

520
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,249
Yes.

521
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,878
I am hungry.

522
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,928
Your Majesty, your seoksura is ready.

523
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,263
Bring it in.

524
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,706
It has been a while, Chief Royal Cook.

525
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,835
Yes. It has been a while, Your Majesty.

526
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,756
So, what did you bring me this evening?

527
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,051
You didn't eat at all today,

528
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,720
so I made chicken soup
to soothe your stomach.

529
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:17,560
CHICKEN SOUP: A CLEAR CHICKEN BROTH
WITH MEAT AND VEGETABLES

530
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,145
"Swoop"?

531
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,732
It's like a rice gruel
flavored with chicken broth.

532
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,734
They call it "soup" in foreign countries.

533
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,445
In case you get an upset stomach,

534
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,988
I only prepared dongchimi,
radish water kimchi,

535
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,324
as an easily-digestible side dish
to spark your appetite.

536
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,203
Taste it.

537
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,704
Yes, Your Majesty.

538
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,157
It is delicious.

539
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,033
What is this feeling?
Why do I feel so proud?

540
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,806
Why does my heart

541
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,226
race so fast

542
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,812
when I see you?

543
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,819
GRAND PRINCE JESAN'S RESIDENCE

544
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,029
Was it not

545
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:37,075
the anniversary of your younger brother
Kim I-son's death recently?

546
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,242
It was, Your Highness.

547
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,370
He died so suddenly.

548
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,498
Your brother passed so suddenly

549
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,875
during the Muin Literati Purge,

550
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,502
as well as my friends

551
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,338
and the brothers of many officials.

552
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,298
That is why

553
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,551
we got together, did we not?

554
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,470
Yes, Your Highness.

555
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,931
Then why

556
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,560
did you send an assassin
to Salgoji Forest without my permission?

557
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:09,440
With your family
almost wiped out because of the purge,

558
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:14,028
I am sure you were ashamed
to have survived by yourself

559
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,571
just because you were
His Majesty's lecturer.

560
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,033
Even so, you should not have
acted out alone

561
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,661
like that.

562
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,041
I thought and believed

563
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,961
that there would be no better opportunity.

564
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,674
I apologize, Your Highness.

565
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:38,010
You provoked His Majesty,
who had been calm since the purge.

566
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,263
The day you are discovered, all of us…

567
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,850
will have to pay the price.

568
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,731
This is a deed to some land in Yeoju.

569
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,776
You should be able to support your family
for the rest of your life.

570
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,323
Grand Prince Jesan
found out that I was behind

571
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,242
the attack in Salgoji Forest.

572
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:06,956
You have to live like the dead
from now on.

573
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:45,953
Get him!

574
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,974
So Grand Prince Jesan
was the one behind Kim Yang-son?

575
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,977
How interesting.

576
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,815
The foul stench spreads wide.

577
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,907
You lost him yet again?

578
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,869
I apologize, Your Highness.

579
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,704
He must be no ordinary guy.

580
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,165
That little rat.

581
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,877
I will kill him at all costs
and eliminate all future threats.

582
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,066
You have lost him already…

583
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,612
and you will never be able to
find him again.

584
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,697
However,

585
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,532
he tried to assassinate His Majesty.

586
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,742
He will surely show himself again.

587
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,252
If you make a mistake again,

588
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,879
it will be your head
that will get cut off.

589
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,216
I will remember that, Your Highness.

590
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,347
His Majesty has started to eat

591
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,392
the meals prepared by the chief royal cook
since last night?

592
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,518
Yes, Your Grace.

593
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,021
I heard it from one of the maids
at His Majesty's quarters.

594
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,024
Send word
to the royal kitchen immediately.

595
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,775
For His Majesty, a gourmet,

596
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,946
I will prepare the natgeotsang
after the physical examination today.

597
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,489
Yes, Your Grace.

598
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,492
Deliver this to Cook Maeng.

599
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,703
Yes, Your Grace.

600
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,541
I will not sit back
and let the chief royal cook be this time.

601
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,961
I will show her myself

602
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,507
that one can burn
if they approach the sun recklessly.

603
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,179
Here it comes.

604
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,347
-Here it is.
-Eunuch Yoon.

605
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,598
Greetings.

606
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,183
-My gosh.
-Here.

607
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,518
-It is beef.
-Beef?

608
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,146
I got the best from Banchon Village.

609
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,107
My word. Look at this precious thing!

610
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,234
It must've been freshly butchered.

611
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,695
It has a nice sheen and lovely marbling.

612
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,739
It's really fresh.

613
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:29,992
It sure is.

614
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,454
I can smell the distinct,
rich aroma of fresh meat.

615
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,374
We have meat in Saongwon too.

616
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,167
Why did you go all the way
to Banchon Village?

617
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,961
Today is the day
of His Majesty's physical examination,

618
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,047
so Grand Prince Jesan
will visit the palace.

619
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,592
Use this to prepare
a special royal meal for them.

620
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,388
What exactly is a physical examination?

621
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,181
It is a day when Grand Prince Jesan,

622
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,183
the Superintendent of Saongwon,
visits the palace

623
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:59,021
to examine His Majesty's health in detail
with the royal physician.

624
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,773
Oh, it's like a checkup.

625
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,608
A checkup?

626
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,444
Well, I guess you could call it that.

627
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,738
Then will His Majesty

628
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,032
and Grand Prince Jesan
dine together today?

629
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:10,950
Yes.

630
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:14,245
Prepare the natgeotsang
so they can dine together.

631
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,496
Okay, understood.

632
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,290
-Goodbye.
-All right.

633
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,458
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

634
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:24,338
So who is this Grand Prince Jesan?

635
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,758
I believe he is the cousin
of His Majesty's father,

636
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,427
the late king.

637
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,679
Oh, he's a member of the royal family.

638
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,014
Wait.

639
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,724
Grand Prince Jesan?

640
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:39,603
Doesn't Grand Prince Jinmyeong
take the throne after a revolt?

641
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,939
I'm all confused now.

642
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,734
Since we're expecting a special guest,

643
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:46,777
the menu…

644
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,489
How about we have a meeting
to discuss the food?

645
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,740
-A meeting?
-Yes.

646
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:55,744
-I mean--
-Let us hurry up and gather round.

647
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,705
A meeting?

648
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,417
My goodness.

649
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,710
Cook Maeng.

650
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,966
Yes, my lady. What brings you here?

651
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,138
Her Grace will serve
the natgeotsang herself today.

652
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,682
You are to prepare what is written here.

653
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,893
Her Grace will serve it herself?

654
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,395
-But we have a chief royal--
-Do not talk back.

655
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,022
Very well. I understand.

656
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,450
BAEKMAJATANG, HWANGJAGYE HONDONTANG

657
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,245
They are both made with hens.

658
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,500
Can you make this side a little rounder?

659
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,834
Like this?

660
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,212
I think that's good.

661
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:48,964
All right.

662
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:53,302
We're expecting a special guest today,
so I'd like to prepare something special.

663
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,804
Where's Cook Maeng?

664
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,139
Oh, well…

665
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,141
Here I am.

666
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:05,981
Her Grace Consort Kang
will serve today's natgeotsang.

667
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,192
What are you talking about?

668
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,735
I received an order to prepare the meal

669
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:13,697
for His Majesty and Grand Prince Jesan
to have after the physical examination.

670
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,950
Did you?

671
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,327
Well, this is uncalled for.

672
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,206
Does that mean
you will be in charge of cooking?

673
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,124
Yes. I apologize.

674
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,712
Why would you apologize?
We have no say in these matters.

675
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,801
You can do as she said then.

676
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,887
However, I didn't receive
His Majesty's order saying otherwise,

677
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,473
so I'll prepare my natgeotsang as planned.

678
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,642
Yes, she is right.

679
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,061
If we do not prepare anything

680
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,189
and His Majesty says,
"I did not command such a thing,"

681
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,276
we will be the ones to lose our lives.

682
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,278
I understand.

683
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,155
Cook Min, I need you to assist me.

684
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,074
Yes, I will.

685
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,122
All right then.

686
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,957
Shall I explain the food?

687
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,625
-Gil-geum?
-Yes.

688
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,213
Today's dish is…

689
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,716
schnitzel.

690
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,843
What? What did you say?

691
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,261
Schni…

692
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,221
In other words,

693
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:22,182
it's a favorite of Koreans,
regardless of their age or gender.

694
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,768
-Pork cutlet.
-"Cutlet"?

695
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,562
I have never heard of it before.

696
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,983
Pound it to spread it thin.

697
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,401
-And cut through the connective tissue.
-Okay.

698
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,529
That's it. Good.

699
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,532
Cut it this long
and then cut it into quarters.

700
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:40,868
Good.

701
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,246
This is harder than I thought.

702
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,056
Take the meat that you flattened,

703
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,558
season it with salt and pepper,

704
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,435
cover both sides with flour,

705
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,479
and coat it with beaten eggs.

706
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,314
Since we don't have breadcrumbs,

707
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,525
we'll use snowflakes
made with fried loose batter.

708
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,235
Press it down hard so it sticks.

709
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,572
Fry that in oil, and it's game over.

710
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,286
This is what we call

711
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,704
schnitzel.

712
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:26,914
-Shay…
-Schnitzel.

713
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,166
-Shay…
-No, "sch."

714
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,712
We'll deep-fry burdock to serve as a side

715
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,006
and make a sauce with raspberry jam.

716
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,110
-Do you know this famous saying?
-What is it?

717
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,821
"Even a shoe tastes good when it's fried."

718
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,573
"Even a shoe tastes good when it's fried."

719
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,575
This is amazing, miss.

720
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,993
Good.

721
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,912
It's not ready yet.

722
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,124
-You have to cut it up before eating.
-Oh dear.

723
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,459
You are going to put a knife on the table?

724
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,671
However small it may be,
a knife on His Majesty's table

725
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,965
means every one of us loses our heads.

726
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,175
I do not think we should, miss.

727
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,802
The knife is threatening, huh?

728
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,471
Then we'll do the cutting beforehand.

729
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,057
You use such strange words.

730
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,642
What was it? "Cut tea"?

731
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,436
"Cotty"?

732
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,937
She said "cotton."

733
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:44,825
That looks good.

734
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,660
Her Grace Consort Kang has arrived.

735
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,663
Oh goodness.

736
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,753
Is it done?

737
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,339
Yes, Your Grace. The tables are set.

738
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,732
That will do. Well done.

739
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:26,033
How dare you look at Her Grace like that?

740
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,243
Pardon?

741
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,039
-I didn't look at her.
-You dare talk back to me?

742
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,540
Talk back?

743
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,292
No. What I meant was--

744
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,293
Enough.

745
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,923
It is only natural that one cannot
take their eyes off something beautiful.

746
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,685
This place is so crowded and messy.

747
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,522
I will prepare a change of clothes,
Your Grace.

748
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,440
Let us stop by Jahongwon on the way.

749
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,442
-Hurry.
-Yes, Your Grace.

750
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,324
Oh my god.

751
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,619
Damn her.

752
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,329
It was plated so perfectly.

753
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,456
-Let's hurry and plate it again.
-Yes, miss.

754
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:25,217
So, how is His Majesty's condition?

755
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,513
I examined if his stomach
had weakened from fasting,

756
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,474
but he is in good health.

757
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,643
However, to prevent upsetting his stomach,

758
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:38,480
he should refrain from having cold food
for a while.

759
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,026
What if he were to take
bellflower root extract

760
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,112
or braised black beans after a meal?

761
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,322
That would be an excellent choice.

762
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,285
What do you think, Your Majesty?

763
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:55,372
You never visit the royal kitchen, Uncle,

764
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:59,376
yet you only show concern for my health
at my monthly examination.

765
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,381
As the Superintendent of Saongwon,

766
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,634
it is my duty to monitor your health,
Your Majesty.

767
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,970
You only flaunt your title
at times like this.

768
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,348
I will make sure
to inform those in the royal kitchen.

769
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,118
What are you waiting for?
Announce Her Grace's arrival.

770
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,371
Your Majesty.

771
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,749
-Your natgeotsang is ready.
-Bring it in.

772
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:15,202
Your Majesty,
I hope you have been in good health.

773
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,829
Your Highness,
it has been a while since we last met.

774
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,753
Consort Kang, what is all this?

775
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,130
I heard about your physical examination
taking place this afternoon

776
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:30,300
and hurriedly prepared your natgeotsang.

777
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,928
Did you make all this?

778
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:37,349
I prepared something special
for both you and His Highness

779
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,017
with the assistance of Cook Maeng.

780
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,645
The other natgeotsang

781
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:45,440
was prepared by the chief royal cook
and the other cooks at the royal kitchen.

782
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,025
Should you not have informed

783
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,444
the royal kitchen
so you could serve just one dish?

784
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,280
I knew you'd get told off.

785
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,740
In your face.

786
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,076
That is what I clearly
instructed them to do,

787
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,286
but when I arrived at the royal kitchen,

788
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,372
the chief royal cook's dish
was already prepared.

789
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:01,915
She must have thought

790
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,836
my food would not be good enough.

791
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,381
What's this childish move?

792
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:18,598
She probably prepared a meal
because I did not give a direct order.

793
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,563
Then you should enjoy
your usual natgeotsang

794
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:28,692
and consider my humble dish
a modest token of my sincerity.

795
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,235
I shall.

796
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:36,533
Your Majesty, it is truly admirable
how much Her Grace cares for you.

797
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,287
Are you the chief royal cook?

798
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:44,374
Yes. She is the newly appointed
chief royal cook at the royal kitchen.

799
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:48,295
You must be the Cook Yeon
I heard many rumors about.

800
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,504
It is a pleasure to meet you.

801
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:53,967
I heard of your visit,
so I prepared something special.

802
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,719
I hope it's to your taste.

803
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:57,763
I look forward to it.

804
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,767
She is a great beauty

805
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,769
and speaks without fear.

806
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,106
Taste the food.

807
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,399
Yes, Your Majesty.

808
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,581
Is this chogyetang, cold chicken soup?

809
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:25,707
It is baekmajatang.

810
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,668
It is a cold chicken soup
made with a broth prepared by simmering

811
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,588
a young hen for an extended time,
then finished with shredded chicken

812
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,048
and ground sesame seeds.

813
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:36,593
It invigorates the organs
and helps fight the summer heat,

814
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,886
so it is almost medicinal.

815
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,555
I prepared it especially for you,
Your Majesty.

816
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,809
I was told to avoid cold foods.

817
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,568
What is this dish, Your Grace?

818
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:58,490
That is called hwangjagye hondontang.

819
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,867
The bones of a yellow-feathered hen
called hwangjagye

820
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,327
were boiled for a long time.

821
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,496
A characteristic of the dish

822
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:07,582
is the seasoned chicken filling
wrapped like dumplings and boiled.

823
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,835
I prepared a soothing meal for you,
Your Highness,

824
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,045
as you are quite the drinker.

825
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,340
It smells delicious.

826
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,235
Both dishes are made with only hen meat.

827
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,194
That is correct.

828
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,280
All things female may look different
on the outside,

829
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,781
but they are the same on the inside.

830
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:44,119
I prepared the dishes,
hoping you would consider them a lesson

831
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:48,665
that teaches you to stay away from women
and focus on your duties as a king.

832
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,253
Wait. Is she saying I'm a hen?

833
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,630
How ridiculous.

834
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,341
That is truly commendable.

835
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,427
I will keep that in mind.

836
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,180
What is the dish

837
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,558
that you specially prepared for us,
Chief Royal Cook?

838
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,643
What did you make today?

839
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,855
The dish I prepared today

840
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,357
is a German dish called schnitzel.

841
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,360
"Shiny shell"?

842
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,657
My goodness.

843
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,911
That is not it, Your Majesty.

844
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,329
It is sunchae.

845
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,165
You might not know what it is,

846
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:33,835
but sunchae is an edible vegetable
very similar to lotus leaf.

847
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,295
Sunchae.

848
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,047
-Oh, sunchae?
-Yes.

849
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:39,966
What…

850
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:50,477
What did you say this was called again?

851
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,062
Beef schnitzel.

852
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,855
"Buffed shell"?

853
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,065
BEEF SCHNITZEL
GERMAN HOMESTYLE BEEF CUTLET

854
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:59,945
Uncle, you said it was sunchae.

855
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:05,116
To make schnitzel,
you thinly pound a slice of meat,

856
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,495
then coat it in breadcrumbs
and fry it in oil.

857
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,915
Dipping it in the sweet and sour fruit jam
is what makes this dish a banger--

858
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,668
I mean,
that's a characteristic of the dish.

859
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:19,714
It's full of protein, which aids
the recovery of your body and mind.

860
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,384
As Your Majesty skipped meals for a while,

861
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:27,555
I prepared something especially tasty
and nutritious with fresh beef.

862
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,686
Yet another strange dish.

863
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,146
But it will not go your way today.

864
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,857
-Taste it.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

865
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:59,879
It looks as if our native blackberry
has bloomed on top of a buchimgae.

866
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,673
It is truly a work of art.

867
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,970
The white thing on top. Is that milk?

868
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,888
That's tartar sauce.

869
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,975
It's creamy, but also sweet and sour.

870
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,394
If you want to eat it sweeter,

871
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,063
you can dip the meat
in the raspberry jam on the side.

872
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,859
Gleamy taro and dip in jam?

873
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,445
Oh, raspberry…

874
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,196
Blackberry jammy.

875
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,199
Blackberry jammy.

876
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,035
You can dip it like this.

877
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,328
Dip and eat.

878
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,414
Dip and eat?

879
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,708
Stick it in deep. Dip and eat.

880
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,169
Do you mean like this?

881
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,336
Yes, like that.

882
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,409
How can this be?

883
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,620
What is this taste?

884
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:25,048
It is crunchy on the outside,
but moist and chewy on the inside.

885
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,717
Your Majesty, that's what we call

886
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,512
"crunchy out, chewy in."

887
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,764
"Crunchy out, chewy in"?

888
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,392
I know what that means.

889
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:40,855
Does it not mean crunchy on the outside
and chewy on the inside?

890
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,440
Yes.

891
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,025
It's a short way of saying

892
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:47,737
it's crunchy on the outside
and chewy on the inside.

893
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,280
Crunchy out, chewy in.

894
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,241
You shorten all sorts of things.
How unnecessary.

895
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,577
Yes, it's called SAS, Shorten All Sorts.

896
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,539
Why is she picking on me for no reason?

897
00:56:57,622 --> 00:57:00,083
Hey, Mok-ju. I can bite back if I want to.

898
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,009
Your Majesty.

899
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,302
Your Highness.

900
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,264
Why don't you try the vegetables
on the side?

901
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,224
Do you mean this?

902
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,560
Yes. That's burdock.

903
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,187
It'll cut through
the greasiness of the meat.

904
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,316
It is bitter.

905
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,444
Uncle is right. It is bitter.

906
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:32,407
People tend to eat
the leaves and stems of vegetables

907
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,160
and throw out the roots
because they're bitter.

908
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,119
But the truth is,

909
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,413
the roots contain more nutrients.

910
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:42,208
It worries me that you might
misjudge someone

911
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,544
based on their appearance

912
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:46,838
without considering their roots.

913
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,968
How dare you, you wench?

914
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,560
It is bitter,

915
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,145
but as you said,

916
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:05,064
it did cleanse my palate.

917
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,319
I will always remember
the roots of the vegetable.

918
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,404
Thank you, Your Majesty.

919
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,283
Shall we enjoy the food then?

920
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,284
Yes, Uncle.

921
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,620
-Please enjoy.
-I will.

922
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,474
All right.

923
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:48,566
Gosh, it's bitter.

924
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,083
I will never,

925
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:08,253
ever let you get away with this.

926
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,587
You're ticked off, aren't you?

927
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,339
So don't cross the line.

928
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,050
You might be the most villainous woman
of your time,

929
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,843
but I'm from the future.

930
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,804
I know more than you do.

931
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,394
That was delicious.

932
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:34,362
Watching you enjoy your meal
also put me in a good mood, Your Majesty.

933
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:39,826
Your Majesty,
I believe Her Grace and Cook Yeon

934
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,744
should be rewarded greatly.

935
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:46,124
Your Grace,
is there anything you wish for?

936
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:49,961
All I wish for
is His Majesty's health and safety.

937
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:55,300
You are truly virtuous and wise.

938
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,094
Thank you, Consort Kang.

939
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:01,973
Cook Yeon, is there anything you wish for?

940
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,182
What I wish for?

941
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,059
My…

942
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,813
I can't mention my handbag
in front of her.

943
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,774
Well…

944
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,443
Your Majesty.

945
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,862
Women, by nature,
are easily swayed by gifts.

946
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,155
What is most important

947
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:19,324
is that you find out what she likes
and give her that.

948
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,703
Tell me. What is it that you want?

949
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:26,956
Well, actually…

950
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,339
I get excited and happy
when I see fresh, new ingredients.

951
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,675
All that is at Saongwon, so I'm fine.

952
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,052
I appreciate the thought though.

953
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,972
All you want are some vegetables?

954
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,557
As expected of a chief royal cook.

955
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,686
She seems to want something very big.

956
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,441
You're the one who wants something big.

957
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,778
Is that so?

958
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,154
No, Your Majesty.

959
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:01,449
-Really, I don't want anything.
-As the Superintendent of Saongwon,

960
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:05,078
I will send you all the vegetables,
whether big or small.

961
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,950
BEEF

962
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,494
People tend to eat

963
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:48,329
the leaves and stems of vegetables

964
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:51,290
and throw out the roots
because they're bitter.

965
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,419
But the truth is,
the roots contain more nutrients.

966
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:58,464
No matter the situation,
she is cheerful and wise.

967
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:02,093
Your Majesty! The theme
of the competition was filial piety.

968
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,886
Wouldn't it be unfilial

969
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,930
to cut off the arms of such cooks?

970
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,809
She was benevolent enough
to save the lives

971
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:10,935
of her competitors.

972
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,900
She is a wise

973
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,485
and thoughtful woman.

974
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,740
TARTAR SAUCE, FRIED BURDOCK, RASPBERRY JAM

975
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:27,326
CRUNCHY OUT, CHEWY IN

976
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,455
The envoys will arrive soon,

977
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:33,332
so why are there so many complaints?

978
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,709
You should rest for a short while.

979
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,794
I will read the rest.

980
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,088
You are the most filial son.

981
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:43,301
-Oh gosh, that hurt.
-Goodness me.

982
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,428
So tell me, son.

983
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:48,681
Is His Majesty making progress
with the chief royal cook?

984
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:52,643
I am asking if the new playground
you set up for him is working.

985
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:53,644
Father.

986
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,896
His Majesty has reached the point

987
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,982
where he is contemplating
what gift to give her.

988
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:01,152
If he is contemplating
what gift to give a woman,

989
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,237
it means he is besotted with her.

990
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,823
Since that is your specialty,

991
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:09,660
be sure to tell His Majesty
the ideal gift to give her.

992
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,996
You want me to prepare Cook Yeon's gift…

993
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:18,419
Did something come to mind?

994
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,380
There is one thing the gwinyeo
is desperately looking for.

995
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,340
What is that?

996
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,926
When we brought her here
from the Gyeonggi Governor's Office,

997
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,845
she lost her bundle in Salgoji Forest.

998
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:30,640
-I found it and kept it.
-A bundle?

999
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:34,143
Was there something important inside?

1000
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,270
She was so desperate to find it,

1001
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,606
so I thought maybe
there was some gold inside.

1002
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,484
My goodness.

1003
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:46,364
"Republic of Korea, passport."

1004
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:48,699
"Republic of Korea."

1005
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:51,786
Republic of Korea.

1006
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,167
The gwinyeo!

1007
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:01,045
It was full of strange items.

1008
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:06,342
Then it should be fine
returning it to her.

1009
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:10,555
At any rate, if it is something
the gwinyeo is desperately looking for,

1010
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:13,307
you should give it to His Majesty.

1011
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,519
I shall. Having you point things out

1012
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,021
is certainly helping my mind
become sharp and clear again.

1013
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:26,153
If His Majesty returns
the handybag to Cook Yeon…

1014
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,991
That will bring them closer.

1015
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,576
"Handybag"?

1016
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:37,456
BONGDEOKGUNG

1017
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,374
"Handybag"?

1018
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:39,792
Yes, Your Majesty.

1019
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:42,587
It is what Cook Yeon
is desperately looking for.

1020
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,178
It is what she was looking for
when she claimed to be from the future.

1021
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,388
It is, Your Majesty.

1022
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,727
How did this come into your possession?

1023
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,813
The day after you threw it over the cliff,

1024
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,232
I sent someone to retrieve it.

1025
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:08,195
I am certain Cook Yeon will appreciate it
if you give this to her.

1026
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:10,281
You are quite silly.

1027
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:18,664
But how did you know I had been
contemplating a gift for Cook Yeon?

1028
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:25,421
One glance and I know.

1029
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,383
Thank you.

1030
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,094
By the way, Your Majesty,

1031
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,013
about the Ming envoys we are expecting.

1032
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,056
What about them?

1033
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,641
Chief Envoy Yu Kun

1034
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,851
is said to have brought
as many as three first-class cooks.

1035
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,144
That many?

1036
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:44,315
Has word of my picky taste
reached that far?

1037
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:47,360
It seems they are planning on
captivating you

1038
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,403
to get something out of you.

1039
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:50,863
They want something?

1040
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,115
I do not know for sure what that is yet,

1041
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,868
but he represents the imperial Ming,
so the demand must be quite substantial.

1042
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,080
Something that could be hard for us

1043
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:00,998
to either accept or refuse.

1044
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:05,378
Three first-class cooks
and a considerable demand?

1045
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,967
BYEOKJEGWAN

1046
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,102
Ask if the food is not to his liking.

1047
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:34,573
He does not wish to eat it.

1048
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,908
What?

1049
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:40,037
YU KUN
THE MING'S CHIEF ENVOY

1050
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,212
TANG BAILONG
MASTER OF SICHUAN CUISINE

1051
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,273
Please try it.

1052
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,529
What is this?

1053
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,539
He says not to be surprised.

1054
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:08,709
The tofu was sliced as thin as a thread
and made to look like a blossoming flower.

1055
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,559
This is what we eat in our great country.

1056
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:28,687
Go and tell your king

1057
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:33,025
that I cannot eat Joseon food.

1058
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,659
I didn't know there was a place like this.

1059
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:43,869
This is Jangwonseo,
Office of Royal Horticulture.

1060
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:47,998
JANGWONSEO: OFFICE IN CHARGE OF GROWING
PLANTS AND FRUITS IN THE ROYAL GARDENS

1061
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:52,044
This is where we grow the flowers, fruits,
and vegetables we serve the royals.

1062
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,631
Take a look.

1063
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:02,930
Oh, Jangwonseo.

1064
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,807
I read about it in history books.

1065
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,725
The world's first greenhouse.

1066
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:09,937
I don't believe this.

1067
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,195
An apple tree.

1068
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:22,741
A mandarin tree too.

1069
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:24,869
This is amazing.

1070
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:29,999
They smell amazing too.

1071
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:32,877
Right?

1072
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,044
Come here.

1073
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:49,059
Why are you making a fuss over nothing?

1074
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,604
It's because
I've never seen anything like it.

1075
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,648
You may feel free to use this place.

1076
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:56,066
Pardon?

1077
01:09:57,776 --> 01:09:59,445
You need fresh ingredients

1078
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,822
to cook more delicious food.

1079
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:05,034
Is this like a free pass?

1080
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:08,621
Well, I guess you could say so.

1081
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:12,958
It is a gift.

1082
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,669
A gift?

1083
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,463
Yes.

1084
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:19,590
Take a look around.

1085
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,517
This is a pyeondo tree.

1086
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:32,853
It yields wonky peaches.

1087
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:35,105
It was a tribute
offered by a Persian merchant,

1088
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,315
but the fruit is inedible.

1089
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:38,150
It is ornamental.

1090
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:42,154
Your Majesty, this is edible.

1091
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:46,325
It is unbearably astringent.

1092
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,035
The fruit, yes.

1093
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:49,870
The seeds are the good part.

1094
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:53,749
Where I'm from, we call the seeds

1095
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,334
almonds.

1096
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,211
"All mend"?

1097
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:02,341
Come this way.

1098
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,890
This is where poisonous plants
are studied.

1099
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:12,184
Do not go too close.

1100
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:19,191
POISON

1101
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,444
I told you they were poisonous!

1102
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,946
Do not touch them.

1103
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,197
Your Majesty.

1104
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:28,617
These are gochu, chili peppers!

1105
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:29,910
Gocho?

1106
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,079
I can make gochugaru now.

1107
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,082
Do not…

1108
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,295
Where did you get these?

1109
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:43,048
A few years ago,
we saved a shipwrecked westerner,

1110
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:45,301
and they gave this to us
as a token of gratitude.

1111
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:47,678
However, they were too spicy and potent

1112
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:49,430
that some even died eating them.

1113
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,558
They are grown here to use as poison.

1114
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,393
I heard they used this as a weapon
a long time ago.

1115
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:55,894
So it was really true.

1116
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,438
This is amazing.

1117
01:11:57,521 --> 01:12:01,859
Your Majesty, this is a huge windfall!

1118
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:02,985
A windfall?

1119
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,571
Are you that pleased?

1120
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:06,989
Totally!

1121
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:08,490
My goodness.

1122
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,533
Then,

1123
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:11,660
what about this?

1124
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,163
What's this?

1125
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,250
I found it on the way here.

1126
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,543
What?

1127
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:21,754
What is it?

1128
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:24,757
It is what you have been
desperately looking for.

1129
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,092
The handybag.

1130
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:31,013
What? No way.

1131
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,307
Is it really?

1132
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,146
Thank you!

1133
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:41,565
Thank you so much!

1134
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,610
How did you find it?

1135
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,029
I told you

1136
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:48,989
I found it on the way here.

1137
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,076
I'm…

1138
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:55,704
I'm so happy that I can't believe it.

1139
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:00,209
It is nothing at all.

1140
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:01,543
What do you mean it's nothing?

1141
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,712
This means so much to me.

1142
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:09,176
Are you no longer angry then?

1143
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,679
About what happened at Unyeongjeong…

1144
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,642
I am sorry.

1145
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:22,106
Are you apologizing to me?

1146
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,193
Then was this gift

1147
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,862
to make me feel better?

1148
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:30,322
Yes.

1149
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:31,740
That is right.

1150
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:34,201
Why?

1151
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:36,703
Why, you ask?

1152
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:58,308
It is because…

1153
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:00,978
Is he…

1154
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,815
I have begun to see you as a woman.

1155
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,449
It is because I am pleased with the food
you prepare for me.

1156
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,159
What?

1157
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:20,372
Why did you turn away from me to say that?

1158
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,127
Because I…

1159
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,379
Why are you walking away from me?

1160
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,797
-Because I…
-Why…

1161
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:18,138
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

1162
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,432
I'm going to go back now.

1163
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:24,394
Just where does she keep saying
she will go?

1164
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,983
The taste of true Joseon food.

1165
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:31,235
No!

1166
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:34,947
You can't suddenly tell me to bear
the weight of the country's future.

1167
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,406
If you want to return,

1168
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,658
win.

1169
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,993
Joseon must lose this competition.

1170
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:41,828
They are no ordinary cooks.

1171
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:43,789
-Tell him
-Let's win, royal kitchen!

1172
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,791
that I also have
a special chief royal cook.

1173
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,418
I'll give you a blazing hot taste.

1174
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:55,425
