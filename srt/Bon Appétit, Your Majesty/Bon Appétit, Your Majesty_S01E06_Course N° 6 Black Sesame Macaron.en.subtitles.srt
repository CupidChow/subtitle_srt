1
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

2
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,180
It is because…

3
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,766
Is he…

4
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:01,019
I have begun to see you as a woman.

5
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,983
It is because I am pleased with the food
you prepare for me.

6
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,651
What?

7
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,489
Why did you turn away from me to say that?

8
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,450
Because I…

9
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,367
Why…

10
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,911
-Well…
-What?

11
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,287
Why are you walking away from me?

12
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,580
-Because I…
-Why…

13
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,942
That was your fault.

14
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,027
If you had stopped coming toward me,

15
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,279
I would not have fallen down.

16
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:57,283
Why are you so angry about it?
It's no big deal.

17
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,036
I'm fine.

18
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,831
I scraped my palm.

19
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,249
Let me see.

20
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,295
This is not just a scrape.

21
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,223
I must summon the royal physician.

22
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,600
Your Majesty.

23
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,353
You get cuts and scrapes like this
all the time in the royal kitchen.

24
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,896
I'm really okay.

25
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,693
Is that so? I did not know.

26
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:37,282
I shall inform those in the royal kitchen
to dull all the knives.

27
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,159
No, it's fine.

28
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,244
I got my handbag back,

29
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,621
so I'm going to go back now.

30
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,168
What do you mean you will go back
now that you have found your handybag?

31
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,838
Inside this handbag…

32
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,632
What is inside the handybag?

33
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,302
Mangunrok's inside.

34
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,437
Where did it go?

35
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,188
Wait.

36
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,611
What? My phone's gone too.

37
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,862
My Mangunrok.

38
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,197
My Mangunrok!

39
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,532
Calm down, Cook Yeon.

40
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,201
There was no book inside the handybag.

41
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,996
Where did you find this?

42
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,998
Song-jae gave it to me.

43
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,041
Song-jae?

44
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,460
The Chief Royal Secretary?

45
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,341
There was no book
inside the handybag when I received it.

46
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,634
Are you sure about that?

47
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,720
Your Majesty,
I would not dare to lie to you.

48
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,722
That can't be.

49
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,016
I swear it was in here.

50
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,062
If you're keeping it,
please just give it to me already.

51
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,230
I said I do not know of it.

52
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,315
I would return it immediately if I knew.

53
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,192
Oh no.

54
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,236
Cook Yeon.

55
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,489
I think the book fell out and landed

56
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,742
somewhere in Salgoji Forest
when the handybag flew over the cliff.

57
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,660
Look.

58
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,454
My lipstick, pouch,
passport, and wallet are all here,

59
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,580
so why would only the book disappear?

60
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,291
If not that, then why else would that be
the only thing missing?

61
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,710
Think about it.

62
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,421
What would the Chief Royal Secretary gain
from keeping it?

63
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,842
You never know.

64
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,386
I told you clearly I did not take it.

65
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,181
Then how about this?

66
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,892
Once the envoys leave,

67
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,312
I will send my troops
to search the forest for the book.

68
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,189
If they still cannot find it,

69
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,942
I will issue an order all over the country
and offer a reward for the book.

70
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,027
What do you think?

71
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,822
Do you promise?

72
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,284
Your Majesty.

73
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,495
I'm serious. I need to go back home.

74
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,539
I have to go back to the future.

75
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,500
Very well.

76
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,003
I understand
how desperately you seek this book,

77
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,671
so I will find it for you by any means.

78
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,923
Okay.

79
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,719
I guess I'll have to wait a bit more then.

80
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,028
ROYAL KITCHEN

81
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,822
Ever heard of seoktanhyang,
the scent of seoktanju?

82
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,118
It is said that after tasting this liquor,
His Majesty said,

83
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,371
"It is so sweet and fragrant

84
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:34,417
that I wish to keep it in my mouth
and never swallow."

85
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,210
MAENG MAN-SU
EIGHTH-RANK SENIOR COOK

86
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,128
SIM MAK-JIN
ASSISTANT COOK

87
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,296
Enough talking.

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,965
Let us raise our bowls
for the royal kitchen.

89
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,551
-To the royal kitchen!
-To the royal kitchen!

90
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,189
You are here.

91
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,273
You are here, miss.

92
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,068
Look who is here.

93
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,278
It is our chief royal cook.

94
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,614
Yes. I'm a bit late, aren't I?

95
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,659
What's this smell?

96
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,455
Were you drinking?

97
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,458
-I do not smell anything.
-Well… Wait.

98
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,920
This is liquor.

99
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,882
Cook Eom happened to brew
some good liquor,

100
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,510
-so we were tasting it.
-That is right.

101
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,678
This is called seoktanju.

102
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,931
I let it ferment for seven days,

103
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:33,351
and I opened the pot today
to just have a taste.

104
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,439
Since we got caught anyway,

105
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:44,070
would you like to have a taste yourself?

106
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,323
Right, miss. Just have a taste.

107
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,784
Are you not able to hold your liquor?

108
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,662
I mean, I can drink, but…

109
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:03,339
What on earth

110
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,718
Am I trying so hard to find?

111
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:12,473
Where on earth

112
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,476
Am I flowing without rest?

113
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,061
No, wait!

114
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:21,190
There's no rhythm.

115
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,651
While I sing…

116
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,073
You should tap the beat for me!

117
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,411
I once saw the end of my life

118
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,872
My heart grew tight

119
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,874
What stopped me from living

120
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,042
Was the fear I had about my tomorrow

121
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,753
Gosh, she reeks of liquor.

122
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,256
In those long and repeated days

123
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,050
I saw my abandoned self

124
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,761
-Oh, the smell.
-I wasn't there

125
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,098
And neither was my Mangunrok

126
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,893
You must come back home

127
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,269
Everybody!

128
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,527
Come, come, come, come back home

129
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,615
Where is the missing Mangunrok?

130
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,204
I will go back

131
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:20,208
COURSE N° 6 BLACK SESAME MACARON

132
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,308
-Miss, you are awake.
-Oh, my head…

133
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,105
Gil-geum. Why am I here?

134
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:44,941
The seoksura!

135
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,983
Do not worry.

136
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,862
His Majesty commanded Cook Eom
to prepare tonight's evening meal.

137
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,072
Oh, okay.

138
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:56,077
Did something bad happen to you?

139
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,954
"Mangunrok."

140
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,997
"Mangunrok."

141
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,958
"Oh no, my Mangunrok!"

142
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,210
You kept saying that
and cried your eyes out.

143
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,879
-Do you even remember?
-Well…

144
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,511
Gil-geum, so I got my handbag back--

145
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,679
But Mangunrok was missing?

146
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,972
How do you know that?

147
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,474
You got drunk and kept saying that

148
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,893
until it made our ears bleed.

149
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,520
Oh, I see.

150
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,944
I thought I'd be able to go home.

151
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,697
What should I do now?

152
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,116
Why are you worried?

153
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,369
You said His Majesty
promised to find it for you.

154
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,287
My gosh!

155
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,163
I even told you about that?

156
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,417
This makes it the 35th time.

157
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,087
Anyway, if His Majesty is helping you out,

158
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,464
I am sure you will find it somehow.

159
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,011
Oh, I don't know. I'm going to sleep.

160
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,139
So give it some time and be patient.

161
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,475
Where on earth is it?

162
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,322
She will go back to where she came from?

163
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,281
Your Majesty.

164
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,908
I'm serious. I need to go back home.

165
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,244
I have to go back to the future.

166
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,248
Just where

167
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,210
does she keep saying she will go?

168
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,214
What future?

169
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,845
CHANG-SEON
CHIEF EUNUCH OF ROYAL FOOD

170
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,644
So you are telling me

171
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,606
the Ming envoy refuses to eat Joseon food?

172
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

173
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,817
That is the message
I received from Minister Yoo,

174
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,695
who is in Yangju
as the reception official.

175
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,489
Seeing that they are finding fault
with the food

176
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,741
that has been prepared with care,
saying it is not to their liking,

177
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,577
is it not obvious
that they are trying to make extra demands

178
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,122
under the pretext of our neglecting to
welcome the envoy in an appropriate way?

179
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,042
What did we send to the Ming
with the previous envoy?

180
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:13,714
Fine silk, ramie fabric, white paper,
woven sedge mats, sable fur, otter fur,

181
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:18,177
horses from Jeju,
and peregrine falcons, Your Majesty.

182
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,179
We did not send any ginseng, I see.

183
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,599
Is that what this is about?

184
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,394
Your Majesty, we seek your advice.

185
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:30,731
How about we serve Ming food
that the envoys are accustomed to?

186
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,234
There are some Han people
who are skilled in cooking

187
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,069
in the Chinese clan village.

188
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,822
No.

189
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,451
Let them starve.

190
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,537
Pardon?

191
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,790
Let them starve?

192
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,585
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

193
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,088
I fear that would provide them
with just the excuse they are looking for.

194
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,339
He is right.

195
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,591
If we do starve them,
they might once again force us

196
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,718
to purchase worthless objects from them.

197
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,388
How can you conduct diplomacy
with such timidity?

198
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,890
His Majesty is right.

199
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,308
Fellow ministers.

200
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,727
Rather than wasting time worrying,

201
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,605
-we ought to come up with a plan.
-He is right.

202
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,567
As His Majesty said,
we could lose what is in our best interest

203
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,193
if we only focus on appeasing the envoys.

204
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,445
Silence!

205
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,617
I was told he brought
as many as three cooks,

206
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,494
so I doubt he will actually starve.

207
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,997
Regardless of their plan,

208
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,458
we must not act
according to their intentions.

209
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,001
Do you understand?

210
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,546
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

211
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,506
Let us conclude the morning assembly.

212
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,884
Be sure to strictly follow protocol.

213
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,428
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

214
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,736
What on earth is His Majesty thinking?

215
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:02,823
It would be inappropriate not to serve
any food at all, would it not?

216
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,034
-Exactly.
-"Let them starve."

217
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,288
I would never have imagined
hearing such an answer.

218
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,875
But surely you do not believe
His Majesty intends for us to starve them?

219
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,211
We are told to follow protocol,

220
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,254
so let us prepare the hamayeon with care.

221
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,464
HAMAYEON: BANQUET HELD BY THE KING
UPON THE ENVOY'S ARRIVAL

222
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,090
Very well!

223
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,260
Shall we go, Father?

224
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,472
My goodness. What do you expect us to do?

225
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,392
The Ming envoys and their entourage
have finally reached the palace.

226
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,019
Quickly prepare some refreshments.

227
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,980
They barely ate because Joseon food
is not to their taste.

228
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,691
I need you to do your best, Cook Yeon.

229
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,902
Our food was not to their taste?

230
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,072
Did they really starve
throughout the entire journey?

231
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,198
That is what I heard.

232
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,741
I heard that the chief envoy

233
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,536
is a eunuch renowned in the Ming
for his refined palate.

234
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,205
So we should take particular care
in preparing and serving his food.

235
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,374
-He's a eunuch?
-Yes.

236
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,043
The chief envoy visiting us
is of great influence,

237
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,920
who has practically raised
the current emperor

238
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,380
since he was a crown prince.

239
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,882
Surely he would have tasted
delicacies from around the world.

240
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,300
In that case,

241
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:07,221
I'd better serve something
he has never tasted before.

242
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,515
-Is there such a thing?
-Yes.

243
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,560
I'm not sure if he'll like it,

244
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,270
but something just came to mind.

245
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,313
That is truly a relief.

246
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,732
Even so, I am still concerned.

247
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,736
I hear that this chief envoy
is ill-tempered.

248
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,405
I heard that as well.

249
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,073
For entertainment's sake,

250
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,908
he has incredibly skilled cooks
of the Ming

251
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:33,455
partake in a cooking competition
against Joseon cooks.

252
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,958
I see you heard that rumor as well.

253
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,710
Uiju, Pyeongyang, Yangju.

254
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,379
They competed against Joseon cooks
in every region they passed through

255
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,798
and humiliated them.

256
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,691
TAEPYEONGGWAN

257
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,238
The long journey must have been tedious.

258
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:10,242
I heard that the food of Joseon
was not to your liking,

259
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,702
which gave you quite a hard time.

260
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,965
He has brought cooks from the Ming,
and fortunately, has not gone hungry.

261
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,844
They must be some impressive cooks.

262
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,936
They not only serve as cooks
but also as bodyguards.

263
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,270
First…

264
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,857
Firstly, of the three Ming cooks,

265
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,817
this person is the equivalent
of a chief royal cook.

266
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,488
He is the last descendant of the
Sichuan Tang clan, famed for martial arts,

267
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,782
which was annihilated a century
ago for treason.

268
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,369
He is a legendary cook
who challenged and beat

269
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,330
all the famous inns in China
and took their signboards.

270
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,381
He is the master of Sichuan fare,

271
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,174
Tang Bailong.

272
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,387
Isn't that what you'd expect
to read in a novel?

273
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,308
It's like a story
straight out of a martial arts novel.

274
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,352
Anyway, continue.

275
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,353
The next person

276
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,231
is Tang Bailong's niece and pupil.

277
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,526
I heard she combines Sichuan food
with foods from other regions

278
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,987
to create a new tradition.

279
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,030
Simply put…

280
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,161
She is the fairy of Sichuan fare,
Ya Feixiu.

281
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,499
That would practically make her
a food researcher.

282
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,423
Next up is the most mysterious cook,
who is said to be Confucius' descendant.

283
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,425
Of the four great branches
of Chinese fare,

284
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,844
he is the master of Shandong fare.

285
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,763
They say his cooking skills
are as precise as his knife

286
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,807
and just as delectable.

287
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,936
KUNG FU FARE: CUISINE OF CONFUCIUS FAMILY
SERVED TO THE EMPEROR

288
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,648
He is the Shandong kung fu fare expert,
Kong Wenli.

289
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,359
That's enough material
for a whole cooking movie.

290
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,405
Well, I have to admit, I'm intrigued.

291
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:15,242
They must all be really impressive cooks.

292
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,661
Cooks like me
who have only studied briefly abroad

293
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,789
are nothing compared to cooks
who live and breathe the fare.

294
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,626
Will you be able to manage?

295
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,422
I'm suddenly reminded of an old saying.

296
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,967
"There's nothing much to eat at feasts
that are the talk of the town."

297
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,511
There's no time. Let's go.

298
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,888
-Come on, hurry.
-Okay.

299
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,149
He says his cooks

300
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,110
will show you, a gourmet,
truly delectable delicacies.

301
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,614
Thank you. I look forward to it.

302
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:57,618
Tell him that I also have
a special chief royal cook.

303
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,705
And that the taste of true Joseon food

304
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,416
will be available for them to enjoy.

305
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,012
He has already heard
about the gwinyeo cook.

306
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,516
He is curious.

307
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,936
You will soon get a taste.

308
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,691
Shall we go inside?

309
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,834
This is the secret weapon
for the refreshment we'll be making.

310
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,252
It's butter.

311
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:51,964
Batter?

312
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,757
Botto?

313
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,175
Balta?

314
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,301
Butta?

315
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:02,474
Will this be enough
to captivate the envoys?

316
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,103
Nothing beats something sweet
when you want to lighten the mood.

317
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,980
I'm sure the envoys are tired

318
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,983
after the long trip to get here.

319
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,569
Let's see if something sweet
will work its magic on them.

320
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,362
How do you make this?

321
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,239
You make it by boiling cow's milk

322
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,367
and collecting the curds
that form on the surface.

323
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,662
I was wondering what you had been making
over the past few days.

324
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,664
This was it?

325
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,169
Last time, it smelled of filbert.

326
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:35,007
But this time,
it smells slightly sour and rich.

327
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,884
Impressive indeed.

328
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:50,939
In short,

329
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,734
on top of what we sent
to the Ming last time,

330
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,946
you want 50 tribute women
and twice the amount of ginseng.

331
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,823
It is our understanding that you agreed

332
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,658
not to request any more women
as tribute last time.

333
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,704
Is this truly the Emperor's command?

334
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,049
He claims he is only upholding
the Emperor's command.

335
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,592
Then did the Emperor

336
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,012
change his mind without reason?

337
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,933
As stated last time,
we cannot send any more women.

338
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,769
As for the ginseng…

339
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:35,400
I will think about what to do with it
depending on your reciprocal gifts.

340
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,154
High-quality Nanjing Yunjin brocade,

341
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,450
books, the ten most famous Ming teas,

342
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,869
including black tea,
white tea, yellow tea,

343
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,665
and 100 pieces
of blue and white porcelain.

344
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,541
Those are what they offered us last time.

345
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,378
They are offering
the same reciprocal gifts,

346
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,839
so why is it that they are demanding
we increase our tribute?

347
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,008
His Majesty wishes to know

348
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:04,638
why we are the only ones
who have to increase our tribute.

349
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,555
What?

350
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:11,144
Does the King of Joseon dare question
the orders of the Great Ming Emperor?

351
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,660
Is this that thing?

352
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,162
The suyu we add to suyu tea?

353
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,163
Suyu tea?

354
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,331
SUYU: OLD NAME FOR BUTTER

355
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,042
Oh, there was a royal tea called suyu tea

356
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,587
that was made by adding butter
to goji berry tea, right?

357
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,550
You're right.
Suyu and butter are the same thing.

358
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:46,763
So what are you making with suyu?

359
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,891
What is this sujebi dough for?

360
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,812
She is not thinking of serving hand-pulled
dough soup with suyu tea, is she?

361
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,189
The refreshment I'm making is…

362
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,945
Your Majesty, the refreshments are ready.

363
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,523
He asked what these are.

364
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,945
These are macarons.

365
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,740
MACARON: FRENCH DESSERT MADE PRIMARILY
WITH ALMOND FLOUR, SUGAR, AND EGG WHITES

366
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,575
"Macrong"?

367
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,911
"Macrong"?

368
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,580
They are commonly eaten as a snack
in Western countries.

369
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,041
The sweetness puts you in a good mood.

370
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,712
What are they made with?

371
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,381
The macaron shells are made
with black sesame and almonds…

372
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,843
butter,

373
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,971
egg whites, and sugar beaten together.

374
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,686
These are Joseon-style macarons
flavored with black sesame, mugwort,

375
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,355
dates, gardenia, and rice.

376
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,529
What is the rice-cake-looking thing
in the middle?

377
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,031
That's the filling between the shells.

378
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,243
I made that by mixing butter, sugar,
and black sesame.

379
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,079
It's a savory and sweet cream filling.

380
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,414
"Creamy"?

381
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,499
Yes.

382
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,752
The crunchy texture,
accompanied by the sweetness,

383
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,879
will relieve your fatigue.

384
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,636
I think she explained enough.

385
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,388
How about you try one?

386
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,020
You three taste it first.

387
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,631
How do you like it?

388
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:54,803
This taste…

389
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,141
He asked about Cook Yeon.

390
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,354
This woman

391
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,107
is the chief royal cook
I mentioned earlier.

392
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,442
I am Chief Royal Cook Yeon Ji-young.

393
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:19,953
Your Excellency,
Cook Yeon's macrongs were exquisite.

394
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,381
He wants to take the opportunity
to show you the taste of the Ming as well.

395
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,757
As you wish.

396
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,727
He suggested

397
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,647
that Cook Yeon and the Ming cooks compete
to decide the terms of the tribute.

398
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,983
As I heard,

399
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,484
it seems his purpose

400
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,321
is to use the competition as an excuse
to take more from us.

401
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,656
Chinese cuisine is so diverse.

402
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,366
How can I compete against them?

403
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,332
Say no.

404
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,253
That is a great idea.

405
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,213
What are you doing?

406
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,673
Tyrant, have you lost your mind?

407
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,593
We're not prepared at all,
and they came fully prepared.

408
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,844
Can't you tell?

409
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,058
Say no. No!

410
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,394
However,

411
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,814
you brought three cooks with you.

412
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,943
So how about they compete
with three of my cooks?

413
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,614
That would be interesting.

414
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,075
This is so frustrating.

415
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,285
What are you thinking?

416
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,578
What? A team match?

417
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:46,247
They can compete in three rounds.

418
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,710
The King of Joseon and I
will be the judges,

419
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,047
and in the event that the score is tied,

420
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,009
we shall have a reputable judge

421
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:02,555
taste the food
and come to a final decision.

422
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,184
That is a good idea.

423
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,107
Let us decide on the themes

424
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,651
at the next banquet.

425
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,486
Very well.

426
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,162
You've actually got to be kidding me.

427
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,582
Your Majesty.

428
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,836
You can't do this
without consulting me first.

429
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,672
You signaled to me with your hand.

430
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,006
What signal?

431
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,008
This.

432
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,261
I was telling you to say no.

433
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,179
This is driving me crazy.

434
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,014
How could you misunderstand that?

435
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,978
You should handle
political matters politically.

436
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,021
Cooking is politics.

437
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,773
Politics is not only conducted

438
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,317
with swords, spears,
diplomatic events, and documents.

439
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:00,280
Resolving political issues
by exchanging food and culture

440
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,614
is such a peaceful solution.

441
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,617
You want us to participate in a team match
without any information or preparations?

442
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,287
There's no way. I can't do it.

443
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,247
Steam match?

444
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,499
Your Majesty.

445
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,211
Can't you just call off this whole thing?

446
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,298
Do not tell me
you are not confident you will win.

447
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,801
It's not about
whether I'm confident or not.

448
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,972
You can't suddenly tell me to bear
the weight of the country's future.

449
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,516
I acknowledged you
as the greatest cook in Joseon.

450
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,768
Who can do it if not you?

451
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,897
Do it for me and the people of Joseon.

452
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,733
I just can't get through to you.

453
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:41,112
Why should I do this for the people?

454
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,989
You are the chief royal cook of Joseon.

455
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,909
You cannot possibly say
you have nothing to do with the people.

456
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,328
What if we lose?

457
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,122
You will, of course,
be charged with treason.

458
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,541
So you want me to risk my life

459
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,711
on yet another competition
that I'm not at all prepared for?

460
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,214
Refusing to compete against the Ming cooks

461
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,924
would also be considered treason.

462
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,762
I will receive numerous letters of appeal,
demanding that you be punished.

463
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,515
And eventually…

464
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:14,312
You're saying I die if I don't compete,
and I die if I lose.

465
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,231
You understand at last.

466
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:24,697
I have no choice but to win
when I don't even have time to prepare.

467
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,950
Cook Shanzu of the Tang Dynasty

468
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,744
did not become the first female cook
just because she was skilled.

469
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,120
A true cook

470
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,957
does not blame the lack of time,
but selects good ingredients

471
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,125
to create an exquisite dish.

472
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:40,004
But you can't expect me
to risk my life at every turn.

473
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,258
I really can't do it this time.

474
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,720
If you win,

475
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,391
I promise to find Mangunrok for you.

476
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,603
But you promised that already.

477
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,272
You said you'd find it and let me return.

478
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,773
I said I would find the book.

479
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,942
I never promised I would let you leave.

480
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:05,446
Why are you changing your words?
You're scaring me.

481
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,161
Win.

482
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,373
By all means.

483
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,004
Did you say the Ming cooks

484
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,172
and the Joseon cooks will compete?

485
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:27,343
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
What should we do about this matter?

486
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,680
I thought we had some peace and quiet.

487
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,891
It would seem that His Majesty

488
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,685
made a big mistake this time.

489
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,812
Must we stake our nation's fate

490
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,064
on the cooking skills
of a chief royal cook?

491
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,318
However great Cook Yeon's skills may be,

492
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,363
there is no guarantee that she will beat
the greatest cooks of the Ming.

493
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,117
Something must be done

494
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,077
before we find ourselves in grave trouble.

495
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,954
What exactly do you mean?

496
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,789
The chief envoy who came this time

497
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,542
is a eunuch named Yu Kun, is he not?

498
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,252
Yes, that is what I heard.

499
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,506
His heedless behavior tells me

500
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,886
he does not know of my relationship
with the Ming imperial family.

501
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,513
I will write you a letter.

502
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,016
Deliver it to the Ming Emperor.

503
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,269
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

504
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:27,028
This is the refreshment
Cook Yeon served the envoys earlier.

505
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,684
She truly has amazing skills.

506
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,104
Her sunchae was incredible as well.

507
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,024
It is too sweet for my liking.

508
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,318
What if she serves something like this

509
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,529
and loses the competition
against the Ming cooks?

510
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,199
We must have someone else participate.

511
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,451
Who? Cook Maeng?

512
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,996
Why are you making such a fuss
just because you cannot

513
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,455
get rid of a mere cook?

514
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,499
Refrain from causing any ruckus,

515
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,959
at least until we achieve what we want.

516
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,794
However--

517
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,878
Do as I say.

518
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,590
Be patient, and in time,

519
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,010
I will present her to you as a gift.

520
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,803
Yes, Your Highness.

521
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:37,265
The loss in the competition
will humiliate His Majesty,

522
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,435
and Yu Kun will win the right
to harvest Joseon ginseng.

523
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,980
In return, he will provide us
with a reason to replace our king.

524
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,775
His Majesty will have
brought it upon himself

525
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,570
by being foolish enough
to agree to the competition.

526
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,450
Things are working out in our favor.

527
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,326
The wench's few shallow skills

528
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,371
will not be enough to beat
the best cooks of the Ming.

529
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,126
However, she is a lucky wench,
and if His Majesty were to help,

530
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,336
I cannot be sure of the result.

531
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,299
No matter how much His Majesty tries,

532
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:15,428
Cook Yeon will not be able to win.

533
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,056
Hearing you say that

534
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,267
makes me look forward
to the competition even more.

535
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,191
This is from Grand Prince Jesan.

536
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:35,239
Is there something
you wish to say to me in private?

537
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,116
His Majesty

538
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,786
is not of sound mind.

539
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,662
He often has fits

540
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,123
and even sees things that are not there.

541
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,333
Oh dear.

542
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,668
Is this really true?

543
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,420
Whenever he has a fit,

544
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,798
he causes strange incidents
that negatively impact the court,

545
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,008
so Joseon must resolve this issue
as soon as possible.

546
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:58,096
Please relay this

547
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,599
to the Emperor.

548
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,060
Are you saying you wish

549
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,521
to change your ruler?

550
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:12,819
Then what do I stand to gain from this?

551
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:17,073
I will ensure
that you win the cooking competition,

552
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,118
so set the stakes high.

553
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,621
Instead of 50, demand 100 tribute women.

554
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,874
Instead of demanding
double the amount of ginseng,

555
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:31,712
demand the right
to harvest all the ginseng in Joseon.

556
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,925
The thought alone pleases me greatly.

557
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,555
However,

558
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:44,225
it is a given that the greatest cooks
of the Ming will win the competition.

559
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,436
How do you plan to help with that?

560
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,858
My lord, the chief royal cook of Joseon
is incredibly skilled.

561
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:57,321
You tasted her food yourself,
so you must know.

562
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,991
What if I refuse?

563
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,747
This is a record we kept

564
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:12,545
of all the gifts you received
and the dates they were received.

565
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:17,216
Lord Sung! Are you threatening me,
the Emperor's envoy?

566
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,343
I would not dare to.

567
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,347
I will leave this here.

568
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:32,523
Considering our long-standing ties,

569
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,651
I trust that you will help us.

570
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,449
Our long-standing ties, you say?

571
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,056
He is one sneaky old man.

572
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,934
Seeing how the officials who serve
one king are divided in their loyalties,

573
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,520
it seems that this nation
is nearing its end as well.

574
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,232
What do you mean by that?

575
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,067
It is none of your concern.

576
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:21,322
It seems that Joseon's chief royal cook
is greatly skilled.

577
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,449
Are you referring
to the refreshment, my lord?

578
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,118
That was just a petty trick.

579
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,912
That does not mean she can truly--

580
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,455
Every competition must be taken seriously.

581
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,708
The pride of our great nation is at stake.

582
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,714
Petty trick or not,

583
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,008
I have to say I am quite curious

584
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:45,805
as to how skilled the cooks of Joseon are.

585
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,140
How about I test them?

586
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,643
-Ya Feixiu!
-No, Bailong.

587
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,603
Yes, my lord.

588
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,855
We must take this competition
as an opportunity

589
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,109
to humiliate and discourage
the Joseon king.

590
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,070
Will you have a go?

591
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,197
Leave it to me, my lord.

592
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,713
Damn, that was close.

593
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,717
-After him!
-Yes!

594
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,516
GONG-GIL
YEONHUIGUN'S JESTER WITH MANY SECRETS

595
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,436
Goodness me. They sensed my presence?

596
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,646
How chilling.

597
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,318
Are they that well-trained?

598
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,571
Yes, Your Majesty.
They are no ordinary cooks.

599
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,866
So…

600
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,786
the Right State Councilor was there?

601
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:59,003
Did the talk with the envoy go well?

602
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,464
Yes, Your Highness. Do not worry.

603
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,758
All you did was exchange a few words.

604
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,468
Can he be trusted?

605
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:09,638
Yu Kun is cunning beyond belief.

606
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,891
This is the second volume of the ledger.

607
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,810
I gave him the first volume.

608
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,812
Well done.

609
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,399
Are you sure it is a good idea
to hand over the rights

610
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,193
to harvest all of Joseon's ginseng?

611
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,319
Right now,

612
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,946
we must protect our nation,

613
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,157
even if it means making a sacrifice.

614
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,658
The royal family must stand strong

615
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,620
for the nation to stand strong.

616
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,704
That is right.

617
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,582
This is a small sacrifice we must make

618
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,876
to protect our nation.

619
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,753
Let us proceed without hesitation.

620
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,380
Since we have made the call,

621
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,715
we must move ahead without looking back.

622
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,925
We must find a way

623
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:50,221
to guarantee the Ming cooks' victory
in the competition.

624
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,308
I hope you will help
to the best of your ability.

625
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,352
This competition

626
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,772
must be the starting point
for a new Joseon Dynasty.

627
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,775
At all costs.

628
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:06,320
Soon, this draft of the historical record
will serve its purpose.

629
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,530
Indeed.

630
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,492
Our time is coming.

631
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,998
What did you do
with the arsenic I gave you?

632
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,709
Ever since
His Majesty's physical examination,

633
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,380
the royal kitchen has been too busy,
so I did not have the chance to use it.

634
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,756
Of course.

635
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,135
There is always an excuse.

636
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,222
Soon, you will compete
against the Ming cooks.

637
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,809
A cooking competition, Your Grace?

638
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,479
Yes, and you will participate.

639
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,273
I will see to it that you do.

640
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,943
Yes, Your Grace. I will give my all
to uphold the honor of the royal kitchen.

641
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,195
No, that is not it.

642
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,198
Joseon must lose this competition.

643
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,492
Pardon?

644
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,254
Don't rub your eyes after touching these.

645
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:08,007
I am plucking off the tops
and taking out the seeds

646
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,634
because you say
you need this for the competition, but…

647
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,722
You should have told me sooner!

648
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,224
What do you need these for anyway?

649
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,059
We'll dry them,

650
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,354
crush them into powder, and make a paste.

651
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,357
They say these are so spicy
that some even died eating them.

652
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,443
What paste can you make with them?

653
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,946
-Do they become edible when dried?
-Goodness.

654
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,619
They're not poisonous.
You can eat them as they are.

655
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,079
Did you see that?

656
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,541
She said this is a secret weapon
for the competition.

657
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,336
-Put your fingers to work now.
-That's right. Well said.

658
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,214
-Man-su.
-How is it?

659
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,676
It must be spicy.

660
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,849
Greetings.

661
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,143
-Eunuch Yoon.
-Greetings, Eunuch Yoon.

662
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,648
Cook Yeon, His Majesty wishes to see you.

663
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,107
What about the travel plaque I asked for?

664
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,319
You will hear about that
when you go see him.

665
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,446
Okay.

666
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:17,618
Your Majesty.

667
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,833
So I heard

668
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,294
you need a travel plaque.

669
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,462
Yes.

670
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,589
I have to go to the mill myself
and explain what I need

671
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,175
for the new seasoning
we'll be using in the competition.

672
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,093
The mill?

673
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,595
Then are you going to Unjongga?

674
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,472
Yes.

675
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,726
If that is the case, I must go with you.

676
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,187
What? You're going to join me?

677
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:50,067
Is it okay for you
to just leave the palace on a whim?

678
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,485
On a whim, you say?

679
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,654
You said you need the seasoning
for the competition.

680
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,364
What could be more important than that?

681
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,700
That's true, but still…

682
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,537
Hurry up and prepare yourself.

683
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,622
I don't need to prepare anything.

684
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,040
I'll just wait outside.

685
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,960
Are you thinking
of going around the market

686
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,920
in your chief royal cook's attire?

687
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,088
Well…

688
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,507
You must change into your disguise attire.

689
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,758
My disguise attire?

690
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,636
The only other clothes I have

691
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,264
are Gil-geum's clothes
that she let me wear.

692
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,308
How pathetic.

693
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,644
Follow me.

694
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,563
Chang-seon.

695
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,258
Is all this really necessary
when I'm just dropping by the mill?

696
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,469
Meet me in front of Gyemumun.

697
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,054
GYEMUMUN: SMALL GATE
NEXT TO BONGDEOKGUNG'S NORTH GATE

698
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,056
What? Where?

699
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,268
But…

700
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,241
Let us go.

701
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,040
We sell hair ribbons too.

702
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,167
We have straw hats.

703
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,309
Oh my, the colors are so pretty.

704
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,606
Goodness, come this way and have a look.

705
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,610
Pretty, are they not?

706
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,115
This looks similar

707
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,617
to the one hanging from Mangunrok.

708
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,578
It costs ten nip.

709
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,414
Oh, that's fine. I don't need it.

710
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,041
-Come along.
-Take a look.

711
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,300
Oh, this is it.

712
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,217
I found the place.

713
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,052
I'll take that.

714
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,345
Thank you.

715
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,724
I need to go somewhere for a bit.

716
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,852
Okay, then we can meet back here later.

717
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,062
Wait.

718
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,108
Oh, come on.

719
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,195
I have money too.

720
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:25,991
Take it.

721
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:27,868
I really don't need it.

722
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,454
See you later.

723
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,876
I have never ground
anything like this before.

724
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,172
What is this?

725
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,882
They're gochu, chili peppers.

726
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,384
They're spicy, so you might
have a hard time with them.

727
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,220
Regardless, I'll be counting on you.

728
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,096
Sure. That will be five nip.

729
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,098
Five nip?

730
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:53,060
I heard it would cost just two.

731
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,980
I would've been in big trouble
if he hadn't given me this.

732
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,234
Please cut down on the cost
when I become a regular.

733
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,610
Thank you.

734
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,202
Give me that.

735
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,206
We will take them all.

736
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,103
He said he'd be gone for a bit.
Why isn't he back yet?

737
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,314
Where did he go?

738
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,735
I want to look around some more.

739
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,073
I'll be quick.

740
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:59,585
Is the chief royal cook still at the mill?

741
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,295
I will go inside and check, Your Majesty.

742
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,505
You do that.

743
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,652
Goodness, it is a sun-shower.
What do we do with all these?

744
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,738
What is with the sudden shower?

745
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,240
What a lovely day. My goodness.

746
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,120
Why are you taking
our precious ingredient?

747
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,336
That sure is potent.

748
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,297
What is this scent?

749
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,640
Who are you?

750
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,267
Strangers are not allowed to come in here.

751
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,728
This is Ya Feixiu, one of the Ming cooks.

752
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,605
What? The Ming?

753
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,526
Cook Maeng! Cook Eom!

754
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,405
It is raining hard.

755
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,949
-Hwang, hold onto this for me.
-Okay.

756
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,035
-Cook Min.
-Yes?

757
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,371
You have really improved
at chopping green onions.

758
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,039
Thank you, Bong-sik.

759
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,420
The Ming cook. She bit into a gochu--

760
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,964
Take a breath first and speak slowly.

761
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,174
Listen.

762
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:32,636
The Ming cook
is here at the royal kitchen.

763
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:54,074
I am Cook Eom of the royal kitchen.

764
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,416
What did she say?

765
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,960
She said your knife skills are decent.

766
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,671
She said his knife skills are dreadful.

767
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,131
Did you think I would not understand?

768
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,632
What?

769
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:18,974
How dare you act so insolently
in Joseon's royal kitchen?

770
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,892
What a mess.

771
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,144
Hey, you!

772
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:25,480
Cook Eom, I have been chopping
in the royal kitchen for over ten years!

773
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,523
I cannot take this.

774
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,442
Move. Neither can I.

775
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,528
Do you want to have a green onion
chopping competition or something?

776
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,740
Settle down, everyone.

777
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,576
She is with the envoy's entourage.

778
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,202
How about a green onion
chopping competition?

779
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,496
A chopping contest?

780
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,833
With such pitiful knife skills?

781
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,753
"Pitiful knife skills"?
Watch what you say!

782
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:52,174
Even a dog gets some respect in its home.
Who do you think you--

783
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,550
This is not your fight.

784
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,801
You are so noisy.

785
00:50:56,136 --> 00:51:00,015
They say an empty cart
rattles the loudest.

786
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,394
Where is the chief royal cook?

787
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,604
The chief royal cook?

788
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,856
I will take you on!

789
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,775
Stop insulting my seniors,

790
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,777
and let us settle this
with a chopping competition!

791
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,613
How ridiculous.

792
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,740
Are you all…

793
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,081
sure about this?

794
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,879
Cook Min.

795
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,173
Are you sure about this?

796
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,176
Cook Maeng can chop just as well,

797
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,262
so if it is too much pressure,
leave it to him.

798
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,973
No. She looks like
the youngest of the three.

799
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:45,185
It would look better for us
if Cook Min were to settle things.

800
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,273
Cook Min, speed is important,

801
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,442
but it is even more important
to cut uniform pieces.

802
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,277
I will remember that.

803
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,696
Cook Min, I believe in you.

804
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,917
Where in the world
did the chief royal cook go

805
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,418
when she does not even know
her way around?

806
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,837
I apologize, Your Majesty.

807
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,381
I have checked the back alleys,
so I will go check the bigger streets.

808
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,340
You do that.

809
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,052
I will wait here in case she returns.

810
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,804
Yes, Your Majesty.

811
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:57,966
You're back.

812
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,969
Where did you go?

813
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,179
I was waiting for you,
then went to get some flowers.

814
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,807
I see you are getting around just fine
despite the rain.

815
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,018
What is that?

816
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,061
They're irises.

817
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,731
It's a flower that helps soothe the mind.

818
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,399
Eyeless?

819
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,908
These are butkkot.

820
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:24,993
"Butkkot"?

821
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:43,970
My flowers.

822
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,140
Oh no, what a shame.

823
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,393
I will get you prettier flowers.

824
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,271
We shall head back now.

825
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,607
But…

826
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,530
Why are you not coming?

827
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,449
Just a second.

828
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,581
Do not pick up what fell on the ground.

829
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,501
I picked these to give to you.

830
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,461
They have medicinal properties

831
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,047
and soothe the mind,
so they're good to keep in the room.

832
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,842
It is surprising
that I even crossed your mind

833
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,844
when the competition is nearing.

834
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,472
We could've planted it in Jangwonseo,
Office of Royal Horticulture.

835
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,380
Your…

836
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,394
Your Majesty.

837
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,646
-Your face.
-What?

838
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,943
Right here.

839
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,365
What did you just do?

840
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,536
There was something on your face.

841
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,583
There is something on yours as well.

842
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,797
Darn it. Stop it.

843
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,924
-What? Come here.
-Stay away.

844
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,718
-Stop it.
-Come here.

845
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,679
Come back here.

846
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,892
Your face is a mess.

847
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,519
It has become even more unattractive.

848
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,689
Oh, I sincerely apologize, Your Majesty.

849
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,983
Your face is just as dirty.

850
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:03,777
What?

851
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,656
You gave me a gift today,

852
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,202
so I shall make a special exception
and disregard your insolence.

853
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,746
I'm so grateful that you like the gift.

854
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:20,126
Is it okay for you to leave the palace
for this long?

855
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,798
What could be more important
than preparing the ingredients

856
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,257
for the cooking competition?

857
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,635
That's true.

858
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:30,887
Tell me.

859
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,350
Can you actually win the competition
with the gocho?

860
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:38,019
I can't say for sure,

861
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,438
but I think we'll need something striking.

862
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,690
The gochugaru and gochujang

863
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,652
are secret seasonings that will be
very important in the competition.

864
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:49,405
You know what they taste like.

865
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,241
You had the bibimbap
at the thatched house.

866
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,792
Oh, the taste
that brought tears to my eyes.

867
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:02,961
Yes.

868
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:06,297
I'll get back to the royal kitchen.

869
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,175
Give me your hand.

870
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,594
What? My hand?

871
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,979
This is the ornament from earlier.

872
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,148
Well, you seemed to want it.

873
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,277
Did he notice me fiddling with it earlier?

874
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:31,739
I shall take my leave.

875
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,632
Oh, right.

876
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:56,389
I mean, would it be so hard for you
to bring these inside?

877
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,575
Butkkot.

878
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,663
Butkkot…

879
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:47,482
How will I face him
if I lose after all this?

880
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,957
Are you all right?

881
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,378
The Ming chef?

882
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:11,130
Joseon's chief royal cook.

883
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,883
What were you doing here?

884
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:17,011
You got lucky today.

885
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,351
Your fellow cooks
seem to be waiting eagerly for you.

886
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,650
What the…

887
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,070
What on earth happened here?

888
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,780
Miss!

889
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,407
Miss.

890
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,828
So what happened was…

891
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,123
It's okay, Gil-geum.
Slow down and tell me what happened.

892
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,500
Okay. That nasty Ya Feixiu or whatever

893
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,378
is incredibly skillful.

894
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:54,382
She had a green onion
chopping competition with Cook Min, and…

895
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,014
She was like a Shaolin warrior.

896
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,933
She showed unwavering focus
and extraordinary knife skills.

897
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,478
That was not all.

898
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:11,149
I am actually afraid of knives, you see.

899
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,660
I felt so rushed

900
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,913
and ended up chopping parts
we do not even eat.

901
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:30,835
But I did not expect Cook Maeng to lose.

902
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:56,819
This is the first time
I have been outpaced in knife work.

903
01:00:56,903 --> 01:01:00,114
So all of you lost?

904
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,909
We have absolutely no excuses.

905
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,119
What do we do, miss?

906
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,711
This is a declaration of war, isn't it?

907
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,798
How dare she come into our kitchen
without the slightest bit of courtesy?

908
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:18,675
Damn it.

909
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,471
Who cares how much
and how fast you can chop

910
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:25,473
when you don't even have
basic human decency?

911
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:28,142
I can tell what she's like just by looking
at the way she's chopped this.

912
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,477
It's not cool at all.

913
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,312
She's just a show-off.

914
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:33,731
Darn her.

915
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:37,193
Are you all just going to give up?

916
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:39,404
They made a mess of the royal kitchen.

917
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:42,907
We must make them pay
for looking down on Joseon cooks!

918
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,826
Right?

919
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,954
Right?

920
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,205
Yes.

921
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,708
We can take them on!

922
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,460
I will not lose to them!

923
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,379
If we compete again,

924
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:59,132
I will show her
what the true balance of chopping is.

925
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,468
I will give it another try.

926
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,595
Just tell me what you need.

927
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,806
I will do whatever I can to help.

928
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,975
We will also help out.

929
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,977
-Us too.
-We will help too.

930
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,855
-We will too.
-I will do what I can!

931
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,274
All right, good. This is great!

932
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,609
We can do this. We'll go nail it!

933
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,445
-Nail what?
-What nail?

934
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,447
-What?
-What was that?

935
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,994
Rise, royal kitchen!

936
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,329
-Rise, royal kitchen!
-Rise, royal kitchen!

937
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,664
Let's fight, royal kitchen!

938
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,458
-Let's fight, royal kitchen!
-Let's fight, royal kitchen!

939
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,209
Let's win, royal kitchen!

940
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:38,463
-Let's win, royal kitchen!
-Let's win, royal kitchen!

941
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:46,053
So how were the Joseon cooks?

942
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:48,639
I competed with them
in a green onion chopping competition,

943
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,058
and their basic knife skills
were pathetic.

944
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:53,394
What about the chief royal cook?

945
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:56,272
She was not there.

946
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,275
You wasted time playing with the minions.

947
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,069
Not entirely.

948
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:09,702
I found out they have
a special seasoning ingredient.

949
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,830
What is this?

950
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:19,086
It smells like mala, but it is different.

951
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:29,305
I guess we will find out
when the competition begins.

952
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,770
I am very curious to see

953
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:40,650
what is making the Joseon king
so confident.

954
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,618
However great her skills may be,

955
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:53,120
how can he put the nation's fate
on the line over a competition?

956
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:56,249
The Ming envoy
brought three cooks of his own,

957
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,084
so it seems he had planned it all along.

958
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:02,380
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager
is devising a plan,

959
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:04,215
so do not worry too much.

960
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,553
Son, if our cooks lose this competition,

961
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,847
it will greatly damage
His Majesty's reputation.

962
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,475
Have you any clever device?

963
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,143
Father.

964
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,187
Do not worry too much.

965
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,358
They can do what they want,
but they are in the land of Joseon.

966
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:27,196
I will not allow them to get their way.

967
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,115
I cannot accept that.

968
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:44,964
SWEET

969
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,181
MEAT

970
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:55,766
FISH

971
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,155
He says you can pick first, Your Majesty.

972
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:10,489
No.

973
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,409
You should pick first.

974
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,917
He is suggesting picking at the same time.

975
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:22,835
Shall we do that?

976
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,854
Mu, meaning "nonexistent,"
and yuk, meaning "meat."

977
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,815
Mu, meaning "nonexistent,"
and yuk, meaning "meat"!

978
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:48,569
For the first round,

979
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,156
they will have to make a meat dish
that has never been seen before.

980
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:56,827
Correct. A meat dish
the world has never seen.

981
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,923
You pick the next one, Chief Royal Cook.

982
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:11,384
Pardon?

983
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,969
Me?

984
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:14,595
Yes.

985
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:19,934
Bailong.

986
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,229
Yes, my lord.

987
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,214
Ji, meaning "know,"
and yeok, meaning "change."

988
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,717
Ji, meaning "know,"
and yeok, meaning "change"!

989
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,179
"Know" and "change"…

990
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:04,186
He suggests picking again,
as the combination makes no sense.

991
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,522
"Know" and "change"…

992
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:15,448
Diplomacy is about learning
and understanding each other's cultures.

993
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:17,283
With that being said,

994
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,494
how about we cook each other's fare?

995
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,331
Are you suggesting
that for the second round,

996
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:27,543
the Ming cooks are to make a Joseon dish,

997
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:30,046
and the Joseon cooks
are to make a Ming dish?

998
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,298
That is exactly it.

999
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,302
What an interesting idea.

1000
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,638
Why is he so relaxed?

1001
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,683
Is he that confident
they can cook Joseon dishes?

1002
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,728
It is time to pick the third theme.

1003
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,738
Will you do the honors, Uncle?

1004
01:07:58,157 --> 01:07:59,200
Your Highness.

1005
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,202
-Your Highness.
-What?

1006
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,329
-What?
-You are to pick one.

1007
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,246
Pick one?

1008
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,540
Oh, of course.

1009
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:08,751
Me?

1010
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:11,712
Yes. You are the Superintendent
of Saongwon, Office of Royal Meals,

1011
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:13,756
so you shall pick one.

1012
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,176
Very well then.

1013
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:20,096
I like the feeling of suspense.

1014
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:22,515
Kong Wenli.

1015
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,642
Yes, my lord.

1016
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,647
Let me see.

1017
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,411
Tang, meaning "soup,"
and sam, meaning "ginseng."

1018
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:47,456
Tang, meaning "soup,"
and sam, meaning "ginseng"!

1019
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:54,130
Is not their fare known for soups?

1020
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,799
It will be a tough round.

1021
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,050
It seems so.

1022
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,012
"Ginseng" and "soup"…

1023
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,432
I see we have soup.

1024
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:09,103
Then in the final round,

1025
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,772
they will make a soup dish
containing ginseng.

1026
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:26,495
He is suggesting raising the stakes
now that the themes have been decided.

1027
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,458
He wishes to raise the stakes now?

1028
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,005
How so?

1029
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,974
He would like 100 tribute women
on top of what was agreed,

1030
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:50,060
as well as the right
to harvest Joseon ginseng.

1031
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:53,147
-What did he say?
-What nonsense is that?

1032
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,149
-What utter nonsense.
-Goodness.

1033
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,200
In that case,

1034
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,161
we shall also add to our conditions.

1035
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:11,749
If Joseon wins,

1036
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:15,044
the Ming is to receive
only half the tribute

1037
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:17,254
and allow Joseon to purchase

1038
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:20,257
as much sugarcane and flour as we wish
before they are harvested.

1039
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:28,641
As much flour as they wish?

1040
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,979
How is this any different
from asking our great nation

1041
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,439
to pay tribute to Joseon instead?

1042
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,486
What is the matter?
Are you not confident you will win?

1043
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:45,824
He says this is a matter that requires
the opinion of the Emperor and the court,

1044
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,578
and that he cannot make the decision
on his own.

1045
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,333
Then we shall adhere to
what we previously agreed on.

1046
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,720
He says if the Ming loses,
he will strongly petition the Emperor

1047
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,138
to accept the conditions.

1048
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:11,767
Very well.

1049
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:15,562
Chief Royal Secretary,
record all that was discussed today.

1050
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:18,399
The cooks representing each nation
will compete in a total of three rounds,

1051
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:20,192
and the competition will last one sijin.

1052
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,110
ONE SIJIN: APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS

1053
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,862
The time to select the dishes
and prepare the ingredients

1054
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:24,947
will be three days.

1055
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:31,662
Which might not be enough time,

1056
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:33,122
so it will be five days.

1057
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,126
Very well.

1058
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:40,129
Five days shall it be.

1059
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:41,297
In conclusion, the competition

1060
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,841
will be held in five days at misi,
thirteenth to fifteenth hour,

1061
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:45,301
at Huijeongdang.

1062
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:47,553
The cooks from both nations

1063
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,221
shall step forward
to pay their respects to each other.

1064
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:08,449
You left your knife
in the royal kitchen yesterday.

1065
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,873
I brought it back to Taepyeonggwan,
Official Reception Hall, safe and sound.

1066
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,468
How rude.

1067
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:29,595
Is this

1068
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,680
the Joseon way?

1069
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:38,645
How dare they challenge me outright?

1070
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,651
They completely ruined the blade.

1071
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,462
Brace yourselves, envoys.

1072
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:06,465
I'll give you a blazing hot taste.

1073
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,810
PRESSURE COOKER, PACKING,
COMPRESS, CAST-IRON POT

1074
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:41,792
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

1075
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:42,793
This pressure cooker.

1076
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:46,422
There is one man in Joseon
who can make this.

1077
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,632
He is the descendant of the
grand military protector Jang Yeong-sil.

1078
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:50,634
I should accompany you.

1079
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,220
-My legs are killing me.
-What a pain.

1080
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:54,638
Your Majesty, please!

1081
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,056
It's a cannon.

1082
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,267
-Get out of here!
-Is he out of his mind?

1083
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,894
His Majesty has left the palace again?

1084
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:05,149
A lot of dangerous things
happen outside the palace.

1085
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:06,108
The target

1086
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,610
is the chief royal cook.

1087
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,529
Cook Yeon!

1088
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:17,828
