1
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:04,514
Your back is against the wall now.

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:06,114
Why?

3
00:00:06,154 --> 00:00:07,354
What are you trying to do, Sea?

4
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:10,254
I didn't expect to see you
at a time like this.

5
00:00:12,754 --> 00:00:13,594
Why?

6
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:16,314
Are you possessive of me,
or have you been missing me?

7
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:18,714
Don't be so possessive.
We're not a couple, you know?

8
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:25,475
How are you doing, though?

9
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:28,955
Well, it has always been the same,
I guess.

10
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:30,955
Not so great then?

11
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:32,461
Mm.

12
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:35,435
I wouldn't have met you
if I hadn't accepted this gig.

13
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:38,275
How's your brother doing, though?

14
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:40,035
Alright, I guess.

15
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:41,955
I still have to take him to the doctor.

16
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:45,755
I'm sorry that at that time,

17
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:53,395
when we were dating,

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,410
I couldn't help you with anything at all.

19
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:57,355
Hey, it's fine.

20
00:00:57,635 --> 00:00:59,435
I couldn't help you either.

21
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:05,515
I miss you, Bam.

22
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:07,755
Should we get back together?

23
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:09,715
Huh? No.

24
00:01:09,755 --> 00:01:10,675
Are you out of your mind?

25
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:12,235
Here?

26
00:01:12,595 --> 00:01:14,035
With the same client?

27
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,275
We'll be jealous of each other to death.

28
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:19,275
How about this? Give me a month.

29
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:22,515
Other people's money will be ours.

30
00:01:22,755 --> 00:01:25,475
When it's time, we'll come back together.

31
00:01:25,675 --> 00:01:26,435
Sounds good?

32
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:29,835
You're gonna stab Queen in the back?

33
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:31,515
Don't put it that way.

34
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:33,395
It's just that
I haven't told her the whole truth.

35
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:36,715
We need money,

36
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:40,515
and as for her,
she's able to afford the service.

37
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:41,955
It's a fair game, isn't it?

38
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:15,875
Can you explain it clearly?

39
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:23,315
We'll use our charm to win her sympathy.

40
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:25,355
She's really empathetic, you know?

41
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:29,075
You're as cheeky as usual, you know?

42
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:31,795
It's called being resourceful.

43
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:35,235
Agreed.

44
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:38,555
I also need the money to aid my mom.

45
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:44,835
If that's the case...

46
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:46,835
we have a deal, okay?

47
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:48,915
My soon-to-be lover?

48
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:51,835
Um...

49
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,875
It's a deal.

50
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:42,875
♫Caught your eyes,
now I'm feeling weak inside♫

51
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:49,195
♫Your glance broke my guard,
no place to hide♫

52
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:58,099
♫Though I tried, keep it cool,
but it shakes my soul♫

53
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:04,595
♫Lost myself in the dark,
but found the truth♫

54
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:13,785
♫I'm losing my control,
I've got to let it go♫

55
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:17,635
♫You're keeping me alive,
I just cannot hide♫

56
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:21,795
You just got out of the shower?

57
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:23,525
Yes.

58
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:25,675
I still haven't dried my hair, though.

59
00:04:26,535 --> 00:04:27,715
That's perfect, actually.

60
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,490
Alright. Let me help you.

61
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:30,715
Come and sit right here.

62
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:31,875
Okay.

63
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:36,395
- Let me blow your hair dry for you.
- Sure.

64
00:04:59,210 --> 00:04:59,977
All done.

65
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,275
From here on out,
I'll be a little busy, Babe.

66
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,795
My brother is sick.

67
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,195
I had to take him to the hospital.

68
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:15,875
Understood.

69
00:05:16,995 --> 00:05:18,795
What's wrong with him, though?

70
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:22,675
He has colorectal cancer.

71
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:27,795
The doctor says that
his symptoms have been worse.

72
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:34,915
Sea.

73
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:41,155
Please tell me if you need my help.

74
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:42,795
Do not hesitate.

75
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:49,635
Thank you.

76
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:55,795
If it's too much for me,

77
00:05:58,115 --> 00:05:59,955
you'll be the first to know, Babe.

78
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:05,915
Though, right now,
I can still deal with it myself.

79
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,795
It's fine.

80
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:25,315
I'm always by your side.

81
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:31,795
Thank you.

82
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:39,835
If I really need your help,

83
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:41,675
I'll tell you, okay?

84
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:43,795
Right now, I'm still going strong.

85
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:46,595
Okay.

86
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,475
Thank you for that.

87
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:53,715
Are you sure you'll do alright?

88
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:55,755
I am.

89
00:06:58,475 --> 00:06:59,355
Are you hungry?

90
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,275
Would you like me to cook you a dish?

91
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:03,795
You know how to cook?

92
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:05,355
Well...

93
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:07,715
I do.

94
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:09,315
Give it a shot.

95
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:11,795
Sure. I'll be your assistant, okay?

96
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,675
What should we have?

97
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:15,875
Anything.

98
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:18,715
Mm...

99
00:07:19,195 --> 00:07:20,755
Let's make a special dish.

100
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:22,395
Let's go.

101
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:23,995
Alright.

102
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:32,875
Why are you soaking wet?

103
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,875
It's suddenly raining.

104
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:37,155
Here. Let's go get changed first.

105
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:39,235
- I'm soaked.
- Go and get changed

106
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:40,275
before you get sick.

107
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:51,785
♫I should run,
but I'm tied to the sound of you♫

108
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:57,915
♫Words dissolve in the air,
I'm losing hold♫

109
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:07,275
♫Pull me close,
now I'm stranded in your waves,♫

110
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:12,075
♫Losing more of myself, yet I'm okay♫

111
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:12,995
Oh, Babe.

112
00:08:13,715 --> 00:08:15,035
Let me dry your hair for you.

113
00:08:17,115 --> 00:08:17,775
Here.

114
00:08:24,195 --> 00:08:25,435
You're so sweet, Babe.

115
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:26,995
Hm?

116
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,370
Just by drying your hair?

117
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:30,875
Well,

118
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:33,115
nobody has ever done this to me.

119
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:41,595
How's it?

120
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:50,845
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

121
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:53,865
I'm not looking at anyone.

122
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:10,035
Your hair smells so good.

123
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:14,331
Alright. It's done.

124
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:15,715
Here.

125
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:17,395
I've got something for you.

126
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,370
What is it?

127
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:20,675
Come closer.

128
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:22,955
Why?

129
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:25,355
What is it?

130
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:29,395
It's your reward.

131
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:35,675
Your lips are a bit pale, though.

132
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:36,915
Really?

133
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:44,445
Here, let me apply it for you.

134
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:54,075
Don't mess around!

135
00:09:58,035 --> 00:09:59,355
Stay still.

136
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:04,955
Why are you smiling?

137
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:06,195
Nothing.

138
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,315
All done.

139
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:13,915
You look so pretty.

140
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:16,875
And...

141
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:19,475
What would you like to do today?

142
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:21,955
Mm...

143
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:23,435
Shall we watch some movies?

144
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:25,075
Mm...

145
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,355
I just wanna be close to you, Babe.

146
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:31,725
I love the scent
of the perfume I gave you.

147
00:10:36,195 --> 00:10:37,475
You smelled the perfume
without telling me?

148
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:38,755
Yeah.

149
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:42,695
So now I can do it a bit closer?

150
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:44,755
Hey!

151
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:47,235
- Let me smell it, too.
- No.

152
00:10:49,035 --> 00:10:50,515
Fine, then I won't let you do it, too.

153
00:10:50,555 --> 00:10:51,675
I'm the only one who can do it.

154
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:52,835
Let me smell your perfume.

155
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,755
You smell so nice.

156
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:03,555
It's refreshing.

157
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:04,675
You're exaggerating.

158
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:05,595
Let me smell you, too.

159
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:17,675
It's ready,

160
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:20,915
the one-and-only special dish
from yours truly.

161
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:25,035
Wow! It looks amazing.

162
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,275
I'm digging in, okay?

163
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:34,715
Is it good?

164
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:40,355
It's as tasty as ever!

165
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:44,235
How's your brother doing?

166
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:46,515
What did the doctor say?
Is he feeling better?

167
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:48,875
The doctor says
he's ready for the surgery.

168
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,555
The only thing that's holding us back

169
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:54,795
is the bills.

170
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:58,275
Don't worry, though.

171
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:01,555
I've already explained everything to Queen.

172
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:02,715
- Don't worry.
- Mm.

173
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,315
And how's your situation going?

174
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:07,035
Well...

175
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:08,715
I'm not doing too well.

176
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:12,435
I don't know
who Mom borrowed more money from.

177
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:17,155
Have you done any of the plans yet?

178
00:12:17,555 --> 00:12:18,915
Mm...

179
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,795
Not yet.

180
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,395
I couldn't find the opportunity.

181
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:23,635
Oh...

182
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:28,075
You should finish the dish.

183
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,115
The noodles are all soggy.

184
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:31,875
It's also getting late,
so you should get going.

185
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:33,835
Come on!

186
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:35,475
You're kicking me out?

187
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:37,715
Can't I just spend a night here?

188
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:41,195
That's a no.

189
00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:43,235
We'll talk about it a month
after we're back together.

190
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:45,675
Okay? Seasea.

191
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:48,675
Sure.

192
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:50,315
A month it is.

193
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:52,835
I guess I'll have to obey you for now.

194
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,955
Don't be so nonsensical and eat up.

195
00:12:55,395 --> 00:12:56,755
Best dish I've ever had!

196
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:20,755
I've already warned you.
The payment is 3 days overdue.

197
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:23,395
Don't make me come to your house
and make you pay.

198
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,675
What do I do?

199
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:47,035
Why isn't she accepting the call?

200
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:51,195
Come on, Sea.

201
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:01,435
"My brother is at the hospital."

202
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,275
[I'll get back to you]

203
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:19,435
Babe, why did you come here
without telling me?

204
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:22,395
What's wrong?

205
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,635
I can't hold it anymore.

206
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:25,995
What's the matter?

207
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:27,475
What happened?

208
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:29,955
It's okay.

209
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:31,955
You're with me now.
Don't worry.

210
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:34,275
It's okay.

211
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,475
Don't worry.

212
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:41,645
Have a rest first.

213
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:43,635
Let's go.

214
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:47,355
Let's get you rest up.

215
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,555
Don't cry.

216
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,035
Have a seat.

217
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:14,675
Don't cry, Babe.

218
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:19,475
I'll deal with every problem for you.

219
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,995
I'm scared, Babe.

220
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:27,491
Don't be.

221
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:29,715
I'm by your side.

222
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:33,315
I'm right here with you, okay?

223
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:37,995
Stay with me, Babe.

224
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,595
So that's how to make you feel better.

225
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,515
Do you want me to keep going?

226
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:15,995
Do you still want...

227
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:17,495
I do.

228
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:05,675
I'll be right back, okay?

229
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:30,979
- Oh, Sea?
- Queen.

230
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,160
- What's wrong?
- Queen.

231
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,440
What's the matter?

232
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,840
Queen, my sibling is not gonna make it.

233
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,040
- What do I do?
- Why?

234
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Have a seat.

235
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,160
Calm down, okay?

236
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,880
Tell me what happened.

237
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,727
The doctor says
my sibling needs urgent surgery.

238
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,400
How much is the bill?

239
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,480
Huh?

240
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,440
How much do you need?

241
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,370
Why don't you...

242
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,240
No need to ask questions.

243
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:20,503
Sea. That’s who you care about.

244
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
For me...

245
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,240
I don't wanna see you cry.

246
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,640
This amount of money is nothing
compared to your smile.

247
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't care what I've gotta lose,

248
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,680
but if it's your smile,
I can't afford to lose it.

249
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,360
[Transfer Completed: 100,000 baht]

250
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
I've transferred the money.

251
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,240
[Deposit: 100,000 baht
Transaction Date: May 7, 2025 on 3:43 P.M.]

252
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,040
Thank you, Queen.

253
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,680
I'll pay you back as quickly as possible.

254
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
It's okay.

255
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,800
Tell me if it's not enough.

256
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Thank you.

257
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,440
I promise that I'll repay you.

258
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,200
Sea.

259
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,560
Hm?

260
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,080
How about...

261
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,160
How about working with me?

262
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,920
Mm.

263
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,640
It's a special gig, though.

264
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Will you accept it?

265
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,800
♫Though I tried, keep it cool,
but it shakes my soul♫

266
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:20,400
♫Lost myself in the dark,
but found the truth♫

267
00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:29,575
♫I'm losing my control,
I've got to let it go♫

268
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,600
♫You're keeping me alive,
I just cannot hide♫

269
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,480
♫Even if it's wrong, alright♫

270
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Sea.

271
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,360
Bam.

272
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,800
Oh, two relationships have collided.

273
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,100
Aww, I messed up the arrangements.

274
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,640
How did I let two of my soon-to-be lovers
meet each other?

275
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,560
What do you mean?

276
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,920
Why are you here, Sea?

277
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,120
You said you were at the hospital.

278
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
What about you?

279
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,360
Why are you here?

280
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,240
You said that your mom was sick.

281
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Or...

282
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,560
Before asking me,
just take a look at yourself.

283
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:29,454
It's not like that.

284
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:30,573
Then, what is it?

285
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,400
Yeah, yeah.

286
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,280
You let me kiss you,

287
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,280
so what does it mean?

288
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,320
Right.

289
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,440
You claimed that your sibling was sick,
so you had to cover the cost.

290
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
Disgusting.

291
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,400
Babe, you said that
you were gonna see your mom.

292
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,880
Why are you here?

293
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,920
So what?

294
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:03,205
My mom's in trouble.

295
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,560
Exactly! So what are you doing here?

296
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,720
Oh...

297
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,440
You called each other "Babe."

298
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,920
Then tell me, what's going on
between the two of you?

299
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,880
- Ms. Queen.
- Huh?

300
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,600
What is it?

301
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,000
Apparently, I hired both of you,
who were exes,

302
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,683
and now your love is rekindling?

303
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,135
So you teamed up, trying to fool me?

304
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,080
- It's not like that.
- Then, what is it?

305
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,560
So, what went down that night

306
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,600
at my birthday party?

307
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,200
I miss you, Bam.

308
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,560
Should we get back together?

309
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,889
Give me a month.

310
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,738
Other people's money will be ours.

311
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,640
When it's time,
we'll come back together.

312
00:23:54,746 --> 00:23:57,400
You're gonna stab Queen in the back?

313
00:23:58,448 --> 00:24:00,088
We need money,

314
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,720
and as for her,
she's able to afford the service.

315
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,600
We'll use our charm to win her sympathy.

316
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:10,343
She's really empathetic, you know?

317
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,950
It's not like what you saw, Ms. Queen.

318
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:33,175
Babe, what are you doing?

319
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,000
Let go.

320
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,280
- Just admit it.
- No!

321
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,560
I did it because I was drunk.

322
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,880
After getting to spend time with Queen,

323
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,640
I realize that

324
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I love her.

325
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,040
Bambam.

326
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,400
What is it, Sea?

327
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:52,135
You also love her, right?

328
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:53,775
Nonsense! What are you saying?

329
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,080
You thought I didn't know?

330
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
Since I worked after your session,

331
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,760
I saw everything you'd done.

332
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,640
You cooked for her,

333
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
watched movies with her,

334
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,020
and arranged flowers.

335
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,440
You've never done any of that with me.

336
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,657
It's part of my job, isn't it?

337
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,360
I'm sorry.

338
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:20,403
It's fine

339
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,280
because I'm no longer in love with you.

340
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:27,712
I also don't wanna be with you anymore.

341
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,735
This is what you do to your loved ones,

342
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,280
a deceiving love?

343
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:02,933
I totally understand
if you're not okay,

344
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,760
but I'm not here to deceive you.

345
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,880
I just wanna be with you.

346
00:26:09,415 --> 00:26:11,415
You don't have to help me
with anything at all.

347
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,360
I just wanna spend time with you.

348
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,700
Sickening.

349
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,960
It's obvious that
you're here for the money,

350
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,640
and that's called "Being selfish."

351
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,760
Really?

352
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:23,735
Then, we're both the same.

353
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,280
- You're also here to beg her for the money.
- Sea!

354
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,240
When love blooms,
you're a perfect team.

355
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,120
When it dies,
you start blaming each other.

356
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,720
This is your definition of love,

357
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
right?

358
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,160
- Ms. Queen.
- Stop.

359
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,080
Don't come any closer.

360
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,920
I don't want to hurt
those I love anymore.

361
00:27:04,863 --> 00:27:06,223
No need to name names.

362
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,680
It all results in pain.

363
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,880
Just let me take all of it in.

364
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,520
Please leave now.

365
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,280
- Ms. Queen.
- I'm sorry,

366
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,440
but everything we did was real.

367
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,160
I may have intentionally deceived you

368
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,000
and done everything for you,

369
00:27:32,695 --> 00:27:34,615
but there was one thing
that happened unintentionally.

370
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,120
It might have happened because

371
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,920
I love you.

372
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:52,520
I'd like to apologize.

373
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,480
♫Caught your eyes,
now I'm feeling weak inside♫

374
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,200
♫Your glance broke my guard,
no place to hide♫

375
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,000
♫Whenever you're around♫

376
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:20,760
♫Though I tried, keep it cool,
but it shakes my soul♫

377
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,600
♫Lost myself in the dark,
but found the truth♫

378
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,470
♫I'm falling every day♫

379
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:36,120
♫I'm losing my control,
I've got to let it go♫

380
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,240
♫You're keeping me alive,
I just cannot hide♫

381
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,840
♫Even if it's wrong, alright♫

382
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,600
What are you doing?

383
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,600
I'm cutting the cake for the lovely host.

384
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,640
Would you like to try some?

385
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,640
Mm, I'd love to.

386
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,280
You're so sweet, Babe.

387
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,560
♫But I found myself in you♫

388
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,440
♫Pull me close,
now I'm stranded in your waves,♫

389
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,320
♫Losing more of myself, yet I'm okay♫

390
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,480
♫You're the chaos I embrace♫

391
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:36,920
♫I'm losing my control,
I've got to let it go♫

392
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,220
♫You're keeping me alive,
I just cannot hide♫

393
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,880
Happy birthday, Babe.

394
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,040
I don't have a special gift for you.

395
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,430
I want nothing but...

396
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,440
♫You're keeping me alive,
I just cannot hide♫

397
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,480
♫Even if it's wrong, alright♫

398
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:22,830
♫I'm losing my control,
I've got to let it go♫

399
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:26,935
♫You're keeping me alive,
I just cannot hide♫

400
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,960
♫Even if it's wrong, alright♫

401
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,472
Are you alright?

402
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,230
Yes.

403
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,800
It's just that I'm back to
living like the old days,

404
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,560
being with nobody but ourselves.

405
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,720
What those two said was real, though.

406
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,640
Sea's sibling is in a coma in the ICU.

407
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,120
As for Bam's mother,
she owes money to some loan sharks.

408
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:36,695
I already knew that.

409
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:40,983
I may have gone along with the lies,

410
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,680
but I can't stop thinking that

411
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,680
some of the feelings I had
might've been real.

412
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,520
Love built on deception

413
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,280
is inherently wrong

414
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,840
and doomed from the start.

415
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,440
The way you’re speaking
is starting to feel like Mom's.

416
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,360
Thank you.

417
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,720
I've gotta get back to my work now.

418
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,200
If you need anything, just let me know.

419
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,880
I'm always available.

420
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,800
Hey!

421
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,880
You've gotta be kidding me.

422
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
I was just teasing you.

423
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,880
Ms. Queen, you were losing control,

424
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,440
so you should let them go.

425
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,320
Okay.

426
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,040
"Losing control."

427
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,520
"Let them go."

428
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,080
Alright.
