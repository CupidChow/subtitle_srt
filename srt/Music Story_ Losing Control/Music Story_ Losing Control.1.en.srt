[1 month earlier]

3
00:00:35,247 --> 00:00:39,967
I'm Queen, Pitinan Teerakietsakul.

4
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:42,887
My name means
"a lady who enjoys her possessions."

5
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,527
Mom, I miss you.

6
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:54,567
But I don't think you miss me
or even hear me.

7
00:00:58,487 --> 00:01:02,127
I'm sorry for always letting you down.

8
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:11,087
Nonetheless, thank you
for the house and the money.

9
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:15,047
I promise you that I'll spend it wisely.

10
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:29,927
I guess this is what it feels like
to be wealthy but lonely.

11
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:54,807
♫Caught your eyes,
now I'm feeling weak inside♫

12
00:01:55,527 --> 00:02:01,087
♫Your glance broke my guard,
no place to hide♫

13
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:09,967
♫Though I tried, keep it cool,
but it shakes my soul♫

14
00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:16,567
♫Lost myself in the dark,
but found the truth♫

15
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:25,704
♫I'm losing my control,
I've got to let it go♫

16
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:29,927
♫You're keeping me alive,
I just cannot hide♫

17
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:34,447
♫Even if it's wrong, alright♫

18
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:42,567
"If you're lonely and want someone
by your side, as a partner or a friend,

19
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:46,167
to read books or stargaze with,

20
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,367
feel free to reach out to me.

21
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:51,727
Payment by the hour
or by the day works for me."

22
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:53,447
The ID is...

23
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:55,837
Huh?!

24
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:00,447
This kind of gig?

25
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:07,727
How uninteresting.

26
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:32,767
Whoa.

27
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:35,487
The client's house
sure looks nice to live in.

28
00:03:54,743 --> 00:03:55,833
Good morning.

29
00:03:57,847 --> 00:03:59,447
- Uh...
- Good morning.

30
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:03,167
You're Ms. Queen, right?

31
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,167
Yes, I am.

32
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:08,167
No need for such formality.
You can just call me "Queen,"

33
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:10,391
as we're probably around the same age.

34
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:12,727
Understood, Ms.

35
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:13,527
Sorry...

36
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,807
Understood, Queen.

37
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:19,792
You're such a tease,

38
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:21,832
making jokes
the moment we know each other.

39
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:26,647
Actually, I'm an introvert,

40
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:32,047
but I got blown away by your smile.

41
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:34,207
That's great. I like that.

42
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:40,847
I mean, I like quiet people
who love making jokes.

43
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:43,327
- Alright, let's head inside.
- Understood.

44
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:45,847
This way.

45
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:10,807
- Hey, Ms.
- Oh!

46
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:13,127
Are you okay?

47
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,487
Sorry, I got a bit distracted
by my own thoughts.

48
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:18,047
Uh...

49
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:19,967
Is there anything wrong?

50
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:22,887
You're living alone, Queen?

51
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:24,287
Mm.

52
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:26,167
Yes, I am usually,

53
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:31,287
but sometimes, Maew,
the housemaid, would be here.

54
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:34,687
You're living by yourself...

55
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,186
Mm.

56
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:38,767
You used the app
because you felt lonely, right?

57
00:05:40,627 --> 00:05:41,917
Well, it goes without saying.

58
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:46,247
My loneliness brought you here.

59
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:54,447
By the way, you haven't specified
whether to pay me by the day or hour.

60
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,327
I'll pay you by the day if you don't mind.

61
00:05:56,687 --> 00:06:00,967
Let me know if there are any extra charges
not mentioned in the app.

62
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:03,027
Absolutely.

63
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:04,887
I'm pleased to be of service.

64
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:07,527
It's a pleasure.

65
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:12,478
By the way, how do you like the service?

66
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:16,967
Do you want me to be your personal chef,
cooking up your lunch?

67
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:17,987
How does that sound?

68
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:20,767
Mm...

69
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:22,327
That does sound great.

70
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,257
However,

71
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,647
I prefer a partner who cooks for me.

72
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:32,767
At your service.

73
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:16,407
Your spaghetti is ready.

74
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:20,967
You can cook Western food?

75
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:22,638
Of course, I do.

76
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:24,287
I love cooking for myself.

77
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,847
What if it tastes bad?

78
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:33,287
I guess you might
have to order a takeout.

79
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:36,967
You can also have me instead.

80
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:43,247
Well?

81
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:56,487
Hm?

82
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:57,767
You look tough.

83
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,047
It'd be too hard to chew.

84
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,287
Ms. Queen!

85
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:05,327
We've talked about this!

86
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:09,127
We're a couple, so don't say "Ms."

87
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,247
What would you like me to call you, then?

88
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:17,127
Um...

89
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:23,487
How about "Babe?"

90
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,967
Yes, Babe.

91
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:34,767
The spaghetti's getting cold.

92
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,647
Let's give it a go

93
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,247
and see if it's delicious.

94
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:51,207
How is it?

95
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:53,087
It's tasty!

96
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:02,767
It's on my lips?

97
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:03,807
Mm.

98
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,287
No, let me do it for you.

99
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:09,007
No, I'll do it myself.

100
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,007
I know that you can do it yourself,

101
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,007
but, just for today, can I do it for you?

102
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:17,687
Excuse me, Ms. Queen...

103
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:21,207
Excuse me, Babe.

104
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:24,087
You're such a messy eater.

105
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:28,887
There you go.

106
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:30,087
Now, enjoy your spaghetti.

107
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:38,167
Dig in!

108
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:40,327
Why? It's not tasty?

109
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,527
It is tasty!

110
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:44,647
But it's kinda awkward
having someone stare at me while eating.

111
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:48,177
You look cute while you're eating.

112
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,367
Can't I just have this moment?

113
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:57,327
Wanna join me?

114
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,287
I've had it so many times already,

115
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:02,127
so please, enjoy.

116
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:05,647
Are my lips still a mess?

117
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:28,007
Nom!

118
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:29,567
Am I a little girl to you?

119
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:31,767
I'm not a kid, you know?

120
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:37,727
Thank you.

121
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:40,447
Mm.

122
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:50,647
What's the matter?
Are you sleepy?

123
00:10:52,327 --> 00:10:53,217
Here.

124
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:00,847
Please, rest your head on me.

125
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:41,767
Queen.

126
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,527
- Queen.
- Hm?

127
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:44,567
Wake up.

128
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:45,927
I've gotta go.

129
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,247
Can't you stay just a bit longer?

130
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:52,007
I can't. I have other clients to tend to.

131
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:54,327
How much is the payment?

132
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:56,367
I'll double it.

133
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,837
No, I actually can't.

134
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:02,007
This client has already
paid me in advance.

135
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:05,287
Fine.

136
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:09,607
Why?

137
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:11,207
You can't live without me?

138
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:16,007
It's just that I'm bored.

139
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:18,047
By the way,

140
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:20,087
when will you be available again?

141
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:23,407
This Wednesday.
I'll sort it out just for you.

142
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:26,687
What? Wednesday?

143
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,447
You're not available tomorrow?

144
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:34,407
At least let me stay with you
for a couple of hours.

145
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:37,647
You want to see me?

146
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:39,357
Nope!

147
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:42,447
I was just asking.

148
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:44,127
Aww...

149
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:47,792
I'm free from noon to 2 P.M. tomorrow.

150
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:49,432
I was about to put your name
in that time slot...

151
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:50,807
Yes, please!

152
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,087
Well...

153
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:59,127
I'm too lazy to cook for myself.

154
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:00,927
Mm...

155
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:02,807
Can you please cook for me like today?

156
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,007
Absolutely!

157
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:10,407
You're mine for tomorrow, okay?

158
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:11,927
See you at noon.

159
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,927
Understood, my dear client.

160
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:18,567
Take care of yourself, okay?

161
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:20,607
Text me when you're home.

162
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,287
Is this against
the terms of service, though?

163
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:25,953
It's not,

164
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:30,047
but that's outside my working hours.

165
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:33,047
Aww, it's nothing much, though.

166
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,297
Please?

167
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:39,847
Mm... What should I say?

168
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:45,447
Sure, I guess.

169
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:48,447
I'll keep you posted
the moment I'm home.

170
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:51,687
Hopefully, I've alleviated your loneliness.

171
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,247
A lot of tips
would be greatly appreciated, too.

172
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,847
I'm kidding.

173
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:03,647
I've gotta go now.

174
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:05,887
Bye-bye.

175
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:15,767
I've just realized that
having someone to do simple things with

176
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,727
can make the world feel so much livelier.

177
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:54,087
What's wrong with me?

178
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:56,147
Why is my heart racing?

179
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:06,927
"A friend for rent."

180
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,967
"I can be your conversation partner,
travel buddy, or confidant.

181
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:17,247
I'm available 24/7."

182
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:20,767
Here we go.

183
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:22,567
I'm going with her, then.

184
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:33,647
"Are you available tonight?"

185
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:46,367
"I am. I actually just got ghosted."

186
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:47,887
"Let's meet up at this location."

187
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:51,327
"Sure."

188
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:19,207
Hi.

189
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:22,807
You're Bam, right?

190
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:25,847
Yes, I am.

191
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:28,447
I'm Queen.

192
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:31,847
Got it.

193
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:34,287
Uh...

194
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:42,887
You look more beautiful in person.

195
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:46,557
Okay.

196
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,607
By the way, what kind of vibes
are you looking for, Ms. Queen?

197
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:56,647
Do you want me to be your friend

198
00:16:58,327 --> 00:16:59,327
or your partner?

199
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:02,927
Be my partner, please.

200
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:04,647
Alright...

201
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:10,007
I don't do overnight stays, though.

202
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:13,647
That's fine.

203
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:15,327
Right.

204
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:45,287
Do you have other places
to go to after this?

205
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:48,647
No, actually.

206
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:51,327
Do you want to hang out
with me after this?

207
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,247
I actually don't mind if you want me to.

208
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,527
Do you mind, though?

209
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:03,167
But you said no overnight stays.

210
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,127
I'm not saying that I'm going to.

211
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:08,007
Right.

212
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:13,767
We can just go to other places, right?

213
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,327
Watch your step.

214
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,167
That's one.

215
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,087
One more.

216
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:39,447
Okay, nicely done.

217
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:43,407
Be careful, okay?

218
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:46,047
Whoa! Whoa!!

219
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:47,127
Be careful.

220
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,607
Keep going.

221
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:50,687
Okay.

222
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,167
There you go.

223
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,167
Bam.

224
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:04,207
Okay.

225
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:12,287
Who's treating who, really?

226
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:17,527
Not only do I have to pay you,

227
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:20,087
but also take care of you?

228
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,167
Bam?

229
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:30,527
Hey...

230
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:32,727
Bam! Don't throw up just yet!

231
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:34,607
You can't throw up here.

232
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:36,327
Please go to the bathroom.

233
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:38,207
Let's head to the bathroom.

234
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:39,367
Please stand up.

235
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,527
Don't throw up, okay?

236
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,367
Hang in there.

237
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:48,287
Oh, hang in there, Bam.

238
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,927
Okay! We're here!

239
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:52,767
There you go.

240
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:01,527
Don't mess up my bathroom, okay?

241
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:04,247
Okay!

242
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:12,487
Good heavens.

243
00:20:13,518 --> 00:20:14,461
Bam!

244
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:18,127
Be careful.

245
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,007
Gently, okay?

246
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:29,007
Onto the couch, you go.

247
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,447
You're kinda funny, actually.

248
00:21:58,007 --> 00:21:59,647
Tonight, I guess I'm no longer lonely.

249
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:03,967
You sure gave me a headache.

250
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:34,927
What?! Where am I?

251
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:37,407
Good morning.

252
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,367
- Uh...
- You're finally awake.

253
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:41,207
Did you have a good sleep?

254
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,687
You're Ms. Queen.

255
00:22:44,607 --> 00:22:46,074
I'm supposed to be happy

256
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,607
that you still remember
my name, aren't I?

257
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:49,847
Of course, I still got your name.

258
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:52,567
How did I end up here?

259
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:55,981
My memories were kinda blurry.

260
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:59,287
You didn't remember anything?

261
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:02,607
Did I accidentally do
something horrible to you?

262
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,447
I usually don't drink,

263
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:07,047
so I lost control of myself.

264
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:10,367
I don't mind, actually.

265
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:13,687
Taking care of a drunk person
is better than being alone.

266
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:14,727
Right.

267
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:18,247
By the way, I've already made my payment.

268
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:19,847
- Oh, thank you.
- No problem.

269
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:23,287
Wait! It's 11 A.M. already?

270
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:26,327
Ms. Queen, I've gotta take my leave.

271
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:28,927
Wait! Don't you wanna
have breakfast with me?

272
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,607
I can't. I need to go to work.

273
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:34,047
I have a lot on my shoulders,
so I have to work hard.

274
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:34,927
Okay, then.

275
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:37,887
I'll call you for
our next session later, okay?

276
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:42,887
You still enjoy my service?

277
00:23:42,927 --> 00:23:45,607
Well, I like it.

278
00:23:46,747 --> 00:23:48,007
- It's an odd experience.
- Okay.

279
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:50,247
- You're into this kind of stuff?
- I guess.

280
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:52,167
Thank you for using my service,

281
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:54,647
but I've gotta get going now.

282
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:55,807
Thank you!

283
00:23:57,527 --> 00:23:58,527
Bye-bye.

284
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:22,567
Is she alright?

285
00:24:26,727 --> 00:24:28,087
Did you forget your phone?

286
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:28,967
It's here.

287
00:24:31,547 --> 00:24:32,367
Oh...

288
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:34,927
Sea. You're here already?

289
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,150
It's before noon, though.

290
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:40,367
I got here early because I was worried
that my partner might go hungry.

291
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:42,967
So I wanna make you some tasty dishes.

292
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:47,127
But no, the truth is that I miss you.

293
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:50,388
With you being this sweet,

294
00:24:50,428 --> 00:24:52,278
how many clients have
you drained their pockets?

295
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:54,327
I've never treated anyone like this.

296
00:24:55,047 --> 00:24:58,567
What kind of dish are you making today?

297
00:24:59,627 --> 00:25:01,527
What do you have in mind?

298
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:04,967
Thai food? Western food? Indian food?

299
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:07,207
Thai food, Western food,
or Indian food...

300
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:10,847
Let's go with any
that you think I'll enjoy.

301
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:12,887
I guess it's gonna be me, right?

302
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:15,527
I don't know. I've gotta go shower now.

303
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:19,087
I want the dish ready when I'm back.

304
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:25,047
Do you want me to help you
with the shower?

305
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:26,087
No need!

306
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:38,403
Ms. Queen,

307
00:25:38,443 --> 00:25:40,598
I must've forgotten my phone
at your place.
