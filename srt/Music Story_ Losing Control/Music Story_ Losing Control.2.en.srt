1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,480
♫Caught your eyes,
now I'm feeling weak inside♫

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,800
♫Your glance broke my guard,
no place to hide♫

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,720
♫Though I tried, keep it cool,
but it shakes my soul♫

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,200
♫Lost myself in the dark,
but found the truth♫

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,400
♫I'm losing my control, I've got to let it go♫

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,885
Ms. Queen,

7
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:51,080
I must have forgotten my phone
at your place.

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
Sea.

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,800
Bam.

10
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:07,735
What are you doing here?

11
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,960
Don't tell me that...

12
00:01:10,114 --> 00:01:14,360
Queen is also your client.

13
00:01:19,783 --> 00:01:20,783
Also?

14
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:24,775
So that means she is your client as well?

15
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,679
Yes.

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
At any rate,

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,720
you said you were gonna quit
doing this job, didn't you?

18
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,080
Why are you still doing it?

19
00:01:41,464 --> 00:01:43,312
It's none of your business, is it?

20
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:45,260
Just look at you.

21
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:47,791
You said you hated this job.

22
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,920
You know how it is.

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,560
It's an easy job with a good pay rate,

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,440
no wonder why everybody's doing it.

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,520
Uh...

26
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,080
Ms. Queen, I must have forgotten my phone.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
Oh.

28
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,320
Here.

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,880
I thought you were
gonna leave it for good.

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,480
Thank you.

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,880
I'll be on my way now.

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,440
- Right, bye-bye.
- Thank you.

33
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:35,575
Do you two know each other?

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,040
Well...

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,200
It's not strange to know
those working in the same field, is it?

36
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,640
I guess.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm hungry.

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,920
- What do you have for me?
- This way.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,080
Check this out.

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,040
Look at this.

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,440
I present to you

42
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
black pepper pork chop.

43
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,560
This looks amazing.

44
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,920
Did you cook it yourself?

45
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,040
Mm.

46
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:10,871
Please enjoy, Miss.

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,200
Thank you.

48
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,040
Let me slice it up for you.

49
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,680
At this rate,

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,800
you might as well feed me, Babe.

51
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:31,503
As you wish.

52
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,000
Open your mouth.

53
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,600
Nom, nom!

54
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
It's so good!

55
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,280
If you enjoy it, please eat up.

56
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,480
- It's wonderful.
- I've sliced it up for you.

57
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,865
Okay.

58
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:56,105
What would you like to do today, Babe?

59
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,840
Would you like to build a Lego set,
watch movies,

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,320
listen to the music, read books,

61
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,879
or...

62
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,600
Anything goes,

63
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,800
as long as I have you by my side.

64
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,760
Wanna enjoy this together?

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,144
No? Nom!

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
What's on your shirt?

67
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,924
Huh?

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,480
It must have been because of the cooking.

69
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,240
Let me.

70
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
You smell so nice.

71
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,599
What was that?

72
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,120
All done.

73
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,080
How about we build a Lego set today?

74
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,120
I saw that you have
so many unfinished Lego builds.

75
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,720
You've got great eyes, you know?

76
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,040
Mm.

77
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,960
Sure.

78
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,480
Would you like to enjoy this together?

79
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,520
I'm good.

80
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,480
Have a piece.

81
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,629
I prefer watching you enjoy it, Babe.

82
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,960
- At least have one.
- Okay, sure.

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,360
It's tasty because
you're the one feeding me.

84
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,880
That's ridiculous.

85
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,800
♫Though I tried, keep it cool,
but it shakes my soul♫

86
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,320
♫Lost myself in the dark,
but found the truth♫

87
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:44,400
♫I'm losing my control,
I've got to let it go♫

88
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,480
♫You're keeping me alive,
I just cannot hide♫

89
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,120
♫Even if it's wrong, alright♫

90
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,120
Let's get started.

91
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,360
Do you enjoy building Lego sets?

92
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,520
Mm.

93
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Yeah.

94
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,520
It's a hobby for a lonely person.

95
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,440
Do you know that building Lego
improve concentration really well?

96
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,640
It does,

97
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,760
but having you on my side,

98
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,380
I can't really concentrate.

99
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,440
Don't be ridiculous.

100
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,880
Here. You can work on this.

101
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,280
I'll cheer you on the side.

102
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,360
Sure.

103
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,320
- Maybe it's this?
- Perhaps.

104
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,760
Oh, it's the orange one?

105
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,240
It's the gray one.

106
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,560
Would you like some snacks?

107
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,680
I'll feed you.

108
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,760
Mm.

109
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,760
- Here.
- Thank you, Babe.

110
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,080
♫Caught your eyes,
now I'm feeling weak inside♫

111
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,240
♫Your glance broke my guard,
no place to hide♫

112
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,680
♫Whenever you're around♫

113
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:45,640
♫Though I tried, keep it cool,
but it shakes my soul♫

114
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,640
♫Lost myself in the dark,
but found the truth♫

115
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,520
♫I'm falling every day♫

116
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:00,480
♫I'm losing my control, I've got to let it go♫

117
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,800
It's already 2 P.M.

118
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
The session's already over.

119
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,072
Next time, I'll be sure
to finish the whole build.

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,120
Mm, fine.

121
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,800
Happy times go by really quickly.

122
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,280
Don't be sad, okay?

123
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,120
This Sunday is my birthday.

124
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Can I have you on that day?

125
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,160
Would you mind staying a bit late?

126
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,644
Of course.

127
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,600
I usually don't accept evening sessions,

128
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,560
but for you, Ms. Queen,

129
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,280
it's an exception.

130
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,680
Thank you.

131
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:55,160
Thank you for using my service, my babe!

132
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,160
You're so cheeky!

133
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,160
Have a safe trip home, okay?

134
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,800
I've gotta go now.

135
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,092
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye...

136
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:34,200
♫I'm losing my control,
I've got to let it go♫

137
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,280
♫You're keeping me alive,
I just cannot hide♫

138
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,960
♫Even if it's wrong, alright♫

139
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,920
- Hello, Bam.
- Hi.

140
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,280
Welcome. Please come in.

141
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,082
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

142
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,840
Do I have to change to slippers?

143
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,800
Oh, yes, if you don't mind.

144
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,840
This way.

145
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,600
Do you have places
you'd like to visit today?

146
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,416
No, actually.

147
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,160
I just wanna stay home with you.

148
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,520
Okay, staying home with me it is.

149
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,240
- So...
- Oh!

150
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
You smell so good.

151
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,520
How long are you gonna stay like this?

152
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,680
I'm so sorry.

153
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,560
I just love the smell.

154
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,124
They say the more pleasant
a woman's fragrance is,

155
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:41,320
the more charming she becomes.

156
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,600
And you...

157
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,591
You both smell nice and are charming.

158
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:49,640
That's why I was charmed.

159
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,640
I'm supposed to get charmed by you, no?

160
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,360
You're charmed by your own client,
aren't you?

161
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,360
Well, there are no rules against that.

162
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,120
How adorable.

163
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
- What was that, Ms. Queen?
- Huh?

164
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,520
Oh, nothing.

165
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,640
I didn't say anything.

166
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,640
- Oh, okay. Sure.
- Yeah.

167
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
What kind of vibe are you looking for?

168
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,520
A friend or a lover?

169
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
A lover.

170
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,440
- A lover?
- Mm.

171
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,960
Then, you're about to have a cuddly lover,
Ms. Queen.

172
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,160
Are you hungry, Babe?

173
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,840
Let me cook for you.

174
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,800
Sure.

175
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,360
Shall we get cooking?

176
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,240
Let's go.

177
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,880
Okay.

178
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,437
- Let's go.
- Okay.

179
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
Why are you so quiet?

180
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,985
Ms. Queen.

181
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,880
Can you give me a second chance?

182
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
It's...

183
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,640
Something must have gone wrong.

184
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,040
No, it's fine.

185
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
I'm okay with this.

186
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,800
I can have it.

187
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,240
Then, should I cook you a new dish?

188
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,440
Oh, it's okay. I'm totally fine with this.

189
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,090
Please don't; it's burnt.

190
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,520
- There are eggs in the fridge, right?
- Yes.

191
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,160
Let me make you another dish.

192
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,520
The new one is gonna be tasty.

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,440
Here. Let me do it.

194
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,160
You can go and wait at the table, Babe.

195
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Okay.

196
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,560
- See you there.
- Mm.

197
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,480
The dishes are done!

198
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,426
- Whoa! They look wonderful!
- Here you go.

199
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:19,760
You're amazing, Ms. Queen.

200
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,880
I mean, Babe.

201
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Can I try it?

202
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,920
Sure.

203
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,240
Is it this piece?

204
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,240
Maybe it's this one.

205
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
That's not it either.

206
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,800
So that means...

207
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,987
Maybe this?

208
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,600
I think this is correct.

209
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,960
Here. Let me do it.

210
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,800
Are you sure you can do it?

211
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,800
I can. This is nothing.

212
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,560
Babe, look at the instructions.

213
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,400
Babe, you're the best.

214
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,360
How come you're this amazing?

215
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,880
It took me so long to find the piece.

216
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,560
You're already giving me praise
just by doing this?

217
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,960
Mm.

218
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,393
Why?

219
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Are compliments only reserved
for accomplishing big things?

220
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,720
Babe.

221
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
- Babe!
- Huh?

222
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,520
What's wrong?

223
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,845
- Nothing.
- Babe?

224
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,560
Huh?

225
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,240
What is it?

226
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,042
Would you like to finish
the final part together?

227
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,960
Let's go.

228
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,520
How did it go again?

229
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
There.

230
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,005
Yay! All done.

231
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,200
Without you,
I wouldn't have completed the build.

232
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,000
You're so sweet, you know?

233
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,200
Wanna know how sweet I am?

234
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,840
The session's over, though.

235
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,360
I have to call it here.

236
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,360
You immediately kill the vibe
when the time is over?

237
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
I can't keep going,

238
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,960
or else I'll be working overtime.

239
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,491
Okay.

240
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,520
Hold on.

241
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,720
Please wait for a moment.

242
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,360
Where are you going?

243
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,040
- It's a secret.
- What?

244
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,360
It's for me?

245
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,600
I can't take it.
This must've cost a fortune.

246
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,200
If it's deducted from my payment,
I'd rather not take it.

247
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:46,593
It's fine. It's a gift from me.

248
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,560
Next time, you can visit me
with this fragrance.

249
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,880
I just wanna know
how fragrant it'll be

250
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,120
if you're the one using it.

251
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,880
So you still want more of my service?

252
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,960
Mm.

253
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,520
This Sunday is my birthday.

254
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Are you free?

255
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,880
You're mine on that day, okay?

256
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,440
You can stay with me until late, right?

257
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
I can, actually,

258
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,680
my dear client.

259
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,120
I'll see you around.

260
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,440
Stay safe, okay?

261
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay.

262
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,482
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

263
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,385
I just realized that I, too,

264
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:21,520
can get compliments for
doing insignificant things.

265
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,668
Queen...

266
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Queen.

267
00:24:52,760 --> 00:25:00,120
♫I'm losing my control,
I've got to let it go♫

268
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,160
♫You're keeping me alive,
I just cannot hide♫

269
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,080
♫Even if it's wrong, alright♫

270
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,000
You got here early today.

271
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,520
What are you doing here, Sea?

272
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,120
We're both here for the same event.

273
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
Do you have to be that upset?

274
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,440
You're worried you'd lose this client?

275
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
I'm not.

276
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,960
We'll see which one of us Queen is into.

277
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,280
Great. Now, we'll know who the winner is.

278
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,840
Just focus on your job.

279
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,680
Wow!

280
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,080
♫Happy birthday to you♫

281
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,720
♫Happy birthday to you♫

282
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,400
♫Happy birthday, happy birthday♫

283
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,520
♫Happy birthday to you♫

284
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,280
Please make a wish.

285
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,960
I'm sorry, Mom,

286
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,080
for being a player.

287
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,880
I've been thirsty for way too long.

288
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,600
This year, please let me have this.

289
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,520
- Yay!
- Yay!!

290
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,640
Thank you.

291
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,960
Wishing you much happiness.

292
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,640
Thank you.

293
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,240
Please stay with me till the end of time.

294
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,640
Right.

295
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,200
Okay, shall we enjoy the cake?

296
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,840
- Please enjoy.
- Enjoy the cake.

297
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,800
Let me slice the cake for you.

298
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Thank you.

299
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,000
I did my best to pick
the best one for you.

300
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
The strawberries?

301
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,440
No, I'm done.

302
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,400
Do you want salt with that?

303
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,040
No, I'm good.

304
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
No, no...

305
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,040
I just realized that good friendships

306
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,840
can heal someone loveless like me.

307
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,520
Your back is against the wall now.

308
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,120
Why?

309
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,680
What are you trying to do, Sea?

310
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,627
I didn't expect to see you
at a time like this.

311
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,960
Why?

312
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,680
Are you possessive of me,
or have you been missing me?

313
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,080
Don't be so possessive.
We're not a couple, you know?
