1
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,279
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,759
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,040
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,320
Everything is related to karma and destiny.

5
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,880
Follow me

6
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,240
if you two wish to know the truth.

7
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:30,000
It has been almost 80 years.

8
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,200
Where are we?

9
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,440
Back then,

10
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,160
we invented the Eight Supremes here.

11
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,119
I tried all kinds of methods

12
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:40,640
to return to this place

13
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,759
after escaping from the Lyu family.

14
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:45,039
However, I couldn't achieve my goal.

15
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,399
Is this the legendary Valley of 24 Terms?

16
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,640
Thank you for helping me

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,399
to return to this place.

18
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,320
You invented Double Quan Palm here,

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,919
yet you couldn't enter this place by yourself.

20
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,640
The Valley of 24 Terms

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,280
isn't as simple as you think.

22
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,799
This is another dimension.

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,720
This place

24
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,040
is the true Outsiders' world.

25
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
It's the origin of all superpowers.

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,440
A power is flowing subtly in this world.

27
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,480
It guides the blood circulation

28
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,880
of all living beings here,

29
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,560
allowing humans to harness superpowers.

30
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
The Valley of 24 Terms

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,880
transcends time.

32
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:32,079
It influences your present,

33
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:33,840
past,

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,560
and future.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,720
What a shame.

36
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:40,880
I've tried all kinds of methods all these years,

37
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,679
yet I could only wander around the edge of the Outsiders' world.

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,760
It seems like the energy flow has become stagnant.

39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,760
That's why this body could not grow.

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,320
I cannot enter the Valley of 24 Terms

41
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,359
with my powers alone.

42
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,239
I never expected you guys

43
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,160
to bring me back here one day.

44
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,720
Why did you have to come back?

45
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,160
Back then,

46
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,160
me,

47
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:02,359
Gensheng,

48
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,200
Dummy, and the rest,

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
the nine of us

50
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,359
stayed in the Valley of 24 Terms together.

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,880
We were isolated from the world

52
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,440
as we sought enlightenment together.

53
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,880
We were focused on finding our own paths.

54
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,880
The kind of camaraderie,

55
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,920
happiness,

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,160
and wholeness we experienced here,

57
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,079
it's something you would never understand

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,440
if you didn't experience it yourself.

59
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,120
Double Quan Palm wouldn't have existed

60
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:27,480
if it weren't for this place.

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,399
Do you know what it feels like

62
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,079
when you achieve enlightenment?

63
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,560
It feels like

64
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,840
you can decide your own fate.

65
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,880
It felt as if you were one with the world.

66
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,000
You could feel the rhythm of the world.

67
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,359
It felt as if the world was dancing for you.

68
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,440
So, my grandfather invented

69
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,200
Qi Apotheosis here.

70
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,519
Fate has brought us together.

71
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,160
It has been so long since I was this happy.

72
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,280
But what is Qi Apotheosis?

73
00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,560
I don't know.

74
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:03,399
Everyone has a different way of achieving enlightenment.

75
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:05,480
The Eight Supremes

76
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,720
are more than just powerful superpowers.

77
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,320
More importantly,

78
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:13,560
it's a sign of mastery of the world.

79
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,159
It's a sign of mastery toward your fate.

80
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,640
Maybe you'll understand this one day

81
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:19,880
and will be enlightened.

82
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,599
Maybe you won't be able to achieve enlightenment.

83
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,960
Dummy didn't impart his supreme to you?

84
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,840
What a shame.

85
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
What about you?

86
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,640
What do you plan to do next?

87
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,840
I ended up becoming the person Lyu Huan hated the most.

88
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
I wish to return to the time

89
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,120
when Lyu Huan and I were still together.

90
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,080
I want to be my true self.

91
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:02,719
I want to be the good brother in Lyu Huan's heart.

92
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,560
I've hurt so many people

93
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,840
and committed so many evil deeds.

94
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,320
I've decided to turn myself in to NDT.

95
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,080
Zhang Chulan,

96
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,039
you mustn't follow in my footsteps.

97
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,560
You must protect the person who means the most to you.

98
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,280
Protect Feng Baobao.

99
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Go now.

100
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,800
LYU LIANG WAS SEVERELY PUNISHED BY NDT FOR VIOLATING THE OUTSIDER REGULATIONS
BUT DUE TO HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND HIS ATTEMPT TO ATONE

101
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,719
HE WAS GRANTED A SENTENCE REDUCTION.
IN CONSIDERATION OF THE NATURE OF THE CRIME AND HIS BEHAVIOR,

102
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:37,560
INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LYU FAMILY
HAVE BEEN CHARGED UNLAWFUL DETENTION

103
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,440
AND INTENTIONAL HARM AGAINST DUANMU YING,
WARRANTING SEVERE PUNISHMENT.

104
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
NDT IMPOSED STRICT PENALTIES ON THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED.

105
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,359
Is this me?

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,560
It's you.

107
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,479
I…

108
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:11,000
I look very happy.

109
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,120
Gensheng carved this.

110
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,159
Your father was known for his peerless elegance back then.

111
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,159
He loved you very much.

112
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,080
However, you were caught in an accident.

113
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:36,680
Back then, he gathered the eight of us and returned to the Valley of 24 Terms

114
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,479
to save you.

115
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,640
Each of the Eight Supremes has its own strengths.

116
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,479
We could only rescue you

117
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,840
with the power of all eight individuals.

118
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,640
That was the only way

119
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,359
we could revive the original you.

120
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,080
However, you didn't show up.

121
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,840
I did want to show up.

122
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,799
Yet the Lyu family detained me.

123
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,359
I was responsible

124
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,359
for awakening Feng Baobao's memories with my Double Quan Palm.

125
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,679
It's a shame that…

126
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,760
I will return

127
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,120
what I owed you last time.

128
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,520
Where are Ms. Bao's memories?

129
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,479
Back then,

130
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,760
they only managed to awaken your body.

131
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,560
Your memories

132
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,320
were kept in this cave all these years.

133
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,079
Baobao, extend your hand.

134
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
Father.

135
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,760
Baobao, come.

136
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,760
I brought you something nice.

137
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,439
You'll definitely like it.

138
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,400
Father, you're the best.

139
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,640
The scattering qi

140
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
isn't coming into contact with the qi formation.

141
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,199
I can only maintain it for a while.

142
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,199
Baobao,

143
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,600
I will return everything to you.

144
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,240
Your family,

145
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:39,199
your past,

146
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,839
everything you desire,

147
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,959
they're all here.

148
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,360
Follow me.

149
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,920
Ms. Bao, don't trust her yet.

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,240
She was the one who killed Xu Huan.

151
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,760
Zhang Chulan,

152
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
we've been through so much together

153
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,839
and we got to know so many people.

154
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,680
Everyone has their own past

155
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,680
and their families.

156
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,199
You have your grandfather too.

157
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,280
Although he has passed away,

158
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,600
at least he's still in your memories.

159
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,000
I saw that man

160
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,720
on the train just now.

161
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,520
I saw him

162
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,360
shedding tears for me.

163
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:19,800
However, I don't know who he is.

164
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,040
I want to know him.

165
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,360
I want to know

166
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,079
how my father used to dote on me.

167
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,560
I will cast the qi formation now.

168
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,880
Step back.

169
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,880
Don't disturb me when I'm restoring her memories.

170
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,880
Back then,

171
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,000
the eight of them

172
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,680
stood here

173
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,040
and revived you

174
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,319
while I was imprisoned in the Lyu family's cellar.

175
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,920
They tortured me through and through.

176
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,319
I was like a living corpse.

177
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,120
Even so, I believed

178
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:59,719
that my best buddies would come and save me.

179
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,880
However,

180
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,360
they didn't.

181
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:04,280
I was so naive.

182
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,000
I was too naive!

183
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,920
Feng Baobao, when I saw you,

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,319
I understood that they didn't care about me at all!

185
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,360
This world is filled with malicious intent!

186
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:22,760
This body of yours

187
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:24,599
houses the power of the Eight Supremes.

188
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,120
Only I deserve to possess it!

189
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,280
You have no idea

190
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,280
about the true power of the Eight Supremes.

191
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,800
Once I get my hands on it,

192
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,800
I will be invincible!

193
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,160
Duanmu Ying, what are you doing?

194
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,680
Duanmu Ying,

195
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,880
what are you doing?

196
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,920
How can I implant my memories into her mind

197
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
without extracting hers in the first place?

198
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,040
Dummy's grandson,

199
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,959
I'll show you!

200
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,479
Ms. Bao.

201
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,920
Duanmu Ying,

202
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,040
stop!

203
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,439
The qi barrier reflects my attack.

204
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,120
You better stop right now!

205
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,520
This qi formation is formed with the power of the Eight Supremes.

206
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:31,439
Even Zhang Zhiwei couldn't dispel it!

207
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
Zhang Chulan,

208
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,079
from now on,

209
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,479
you're my slave.

210
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,599
Zhang Chulan,

211
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,079
you should follow me back.

212
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,640
Follow me. I'll make you happy.

213
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:47,719
Doesn't it hurt when you hit yourself like that?

214
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,199
Tell me then.

215
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,439
What should I do?

216
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,479
You shouldn't hit yourself.

217
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,479
You should find those who hurt you

218
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,640
and hit them instead.

219
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:58,280
Zhang Chulan, you don't need to fear him.

220
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:02,880
You no longer need to hide or escape once you become my slave.

221
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,079
If you don't want to live like a loser, you should stand up.

222
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,040
From now on, live like a decent human being.

223
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,879
Crush all those who trouble you.

224
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:14,119
I've got your back.

225
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,240
Zhang Chulan, from now on,

226
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,040
you're my slave.

227
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,319
Yes, Ms. Bao.

228
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:28,760
I am now your slave. Feel free to use me.

229
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,960
Boss me around.

230
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,000
Come on. Light up the path ahead for your master.

231
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,200
Roger that,

232
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,720
Master.

233
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,399
Ms. Bao! I'm sorry!
Ms. Bao! No, Ms. Bao!

234
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:42,840
Ms. Bao! Please don't kill me!

235
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:44,440
Ms. Bao!

236
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,520
Come back.

237
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,760
I know that I might die here

238
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,399
if I keep this up.

239
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
However, if I don't keep this up,

240
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:58,960
I'll lose all of my dignity here.

241
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:01,440
Feng Baobao,

242
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,120
this master-servant game is over.

243
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,960
I said, come back!

244
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,840
I messed up.

245
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,159
I'm sorry. I apologize, Zhang Chulan.

246
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,960
Ms. Bao.

247
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,480
Why didn't you dodge it?

248
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,720
You told me to stand here.

249
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,200
Ms. Bao, wake up!

250
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,200
I won't run away again.

251
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,159
I'll be your obedient servant from now on.

252
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,600
Baobao!

253
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:49,679
Baobao, what's wrong with you?

254
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,399
I don't know either.

255
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,600
Zhang Chulan,

256
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,480
I wish to go home too.

257
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,879
You have it.

258
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,800
All of you have it.

259
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:01,399
It's in here.

260
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,240
Ms. Bao.

261
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:09,879
I will help you find the truth.

262
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,080
I will find your home.

263
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:34,520
Feng Baobao,

264
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,159
I would like

265
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,080
to ask you for a favor.

266
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,440
When I'm gone,

267
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,040
please protect Chulan on my behalf.

268
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,480
Is that all right?

269
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,760
I can do you this favor.

270
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,679
He's only ten.

271
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,919
Don't tell me

272
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,879
you're going to look after him

273
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,560
and wait until the end of time?

274
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,960
His grandfather is right.

275
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,879
I have plenty of time.

276
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,840
I can afford to wait.

277
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:10,120
Feng Baobao,

278
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,200
If possible,

279
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,240
don't let him know about your presence.

280
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,840
Don't move or I'll hit you.

281
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:34,520
ZHANG CHULAN, 10 YEARS OLD

282
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:55,480
ZHANG CHULAN, 12 YEARS OLD

283
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:01,639
ZHANG CHULAN, 20 YEARS OLD

284
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:10,280
ZHANG CHULAN, 21 YEARS OLD

285
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,080
ZHANG CHULAN, 22 YEARS OLD

286
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,240
So…

287
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,440
So you were by my side all along.

288
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,560
You were always there with me.

289
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:58,600
No!

290
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,879
Ms. Bao…

291
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:33,240
I'm sorry.

292
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,439
What do you think about Zhang Chulan?

293
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,679
All humans are the same.

294
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,639
Zhang Chulan.

295
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,000
The innocent carries the guilt of the guilty.

296
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,639
Zhang Chulan, you shouldn't stand up again.

297
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,480
Zhang Chulan is a rising star.

298
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,000
How do you plan to pursue luck and avoid danger?

299
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,159
The Tao follows nature.

300
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,600
Which course should you follow?

301
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Chulan.

302
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,040
No matter what difficulties you face, you must hang in there.

303
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,399
Don't despair.

304
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,639
For those of us who practice Taoism, we emphasize thinking.

305
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,159
But above all, we emphasize on doing.

306
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,000
The purpose of life

307
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,560
is not necessarily to please others.

308
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:57,360
Only those with pure hearts

309
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:59,080
who wish to protect all Outsiders

310
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,040
will be truly acknowledged by everyone.

311
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:04,960
Zhang Chulan, you're shameless!

312
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,800
When you absorb the power of the world

313
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:08,199
into your own body

314
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,760
and return it to the world generously

315
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,120
using your own way,

316
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:14,439
that's the definition of superpower.

317
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,960
People can do all sorts of things under the banner of self-interest.

318
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,320
Then I will stop them.

319
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:21,120
There are so many of them. How can you stop them all?

320
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,480
I will give my life for it.

321
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,600
Am I truly going to die

322
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,960
and become a part of this starry universe?

323
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,840
But I think I can still hear everyone's voices.

324
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,520
Zhang Chulan.

325
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,040
Just like the universe and the stars,

326
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,280
I was already one with everyone long ago.

327
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,639
I had no way of letting you guys go long ago.

328
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:32,879
Qi Apotheosis?

329
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,320
I'm just a nobody.

330
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,720
I can't protect the entire world.

331
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,919
I just wish to protect

332
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,280
the person I wish to protect.

333
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,280
Karma,

334
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,560
fate,

335
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:49,600
all of you think

336
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,600
that you can enjoy all the best things in life.

337
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,040
I don't believe it!

338
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,679
I've already lost Lyu Huan.

339
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,520
You can't afford to lose Feng Baobao now.

340
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:24,760
I just want the person in front of me.

341
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,520
That's my only desire!

342
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,120
In the beginning, too profound;

343
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,840
without form or shape.

344
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,879
No one knows what's heavy or light;

345
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,760
who can distinguish clear from dim?

346
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:05,879
I, in the chaos,

347
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,159
distinguish between darkness and light.

348
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,320
Heaven thrives,

349
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,199
and Earth finds peace.

350
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,280
The people are nurtured,

351
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,280
and creatures begin to flourish.

352
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,879
Within the Three Forces,

353
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,879
all kinds thrive.

354
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,520
Throughout the Four Seas,

355
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,480
the Way is known to all.

356
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,840
Man follows the Earth,

357
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,760
the Earth follows the Heavens,

358
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,600
the Heavens follow the Tao,

359
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,199
and the Tao follows nature.

360
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,240
The endpoint of all qi techniques

361
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,520
is Qi Apotheosis.

362
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:55,840
Ms. Bao!

363
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,639
That's all there is to life.

364
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,879
Stop pretending that you've suffered and are trying to be enlightened!

365
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:58,040
The only enlightenment is the path ahead of you!

366
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,399
You look left and right

367
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,199
on the path ahead

368
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,959
all because you're afraid of death.

369
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,159
Can you see the people waiting for you on the path ahead?

370
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,480
Ms. Bao, you've protected me for so many years.

371
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,240
Now, it's my turn to protect you!

372
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,639
The endpoint of all qi techniques

373
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,240
is the companions you make along the way.

374
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,040
Thank you guys so much.

375
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:19,640
LONG LIVE TAOISM

376
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,799
Xu San, let me tell you.

377
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,799
Eat up. If not, you'll starve at night.

378
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
This is so spicy.

379
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,319
I already told them to make it less spicy.

380
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,799
Xu San, Xu Si,

381
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,279
why did you guys have a hotpot without me?

382
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:25,160
Xu San, let's have a toast.

383
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,360
Xu Si,

384
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,400
how long have I been asleep?

385
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,880
Three days?

386
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,920
Three months? Or three years?

387
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,560
Xu San, I'm not dead, am I?

388
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,000
It's so spicy.

389
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,680
Xu San,

390
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:38,960
once we're done eating,

391
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,720
let's go and pay respect

392
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:41,960
to Zhang Chulan.

393
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,279
-Should we prepare some offerings then? -I don't think it's a big deal.

394
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,560
Xu Si, that's unnecessary!

395
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,160
I'm here! Look at me!

396
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,480
Xu San, Xu Si.

397
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,720
All of them have arrived.

398
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:51,640
We'll depart now to accomplish our mission.

399
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,319
You're awake.

400
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:02,400
THREE MONTHS LATER

401
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,120
Ms. Bao, are you happy to see me awake?

402
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,120
Yes. I can finally do some useful stuff instead of taking care of you.

403
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,720
What do you mean?

404
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:18,560
Baobao took care of you for the past three months.

405
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,040
If so, why is she being so cold to me?

406
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,319
Didn't you see it for yourself

407
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,759
when Duanmu Ying extracted her memories and destroyed them?

408
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,880
Ms. Bao, I'm Zhang Chulan.

409
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,080
I'm Lian! I'm your slave!

410
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,120
Ms. Bao, that's fine.

411
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,040
It's fine, even if you've forgotten about me.

412
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,080
We have plenty of time to know each other again.

413
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,160
I'm Zhang Chulan.

414
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,720
I'm a final-year student at Xinpukai University.

415
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:06,279
I was once your little brother.

416
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:13,560
I was once your slave too.

417
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,040
Be my follower, then.

418
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,799
I need a slave anyway.

419
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,839
Let's go. Time to work.

420
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:51,160
Why are you still standing here? Let's go.

421
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,600
You can do it while walking.

422
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,640
What are you guys doing here?

423
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,600
Lian,

424
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,600
you did sleep for a long time, huh?

425
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,040
I've finally met someone lazier than me.

426
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,359
What are you doing?

427
00:39:57,759 --> 00:39:59,120
Do you guys know each other?

428
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,160
We know each other too well.

429
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,799
If so, I'll skip the introduction.

430
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,200
This is the slave I just took in.

431
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:06,960
You guys better treat him nicely in the future.

432
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,640
It's getting late.

433
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,960
Let's go!

434
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,600
Let's go?

435
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,080
In the end, Ms. Bao was the luckiest one

436
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,480
because she forgot everything.

437
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,080
That was the best ending.

438
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,319
Everyone came to this world

439
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,000
as a seed.

440
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,440
They will grow up

441
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,680
and take their own paths eventually.

442
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:39,720
However, if you're in trouble,

443
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,680
I'll help you out.

444
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,560
The paths that everyone is taking might be difficult

445
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,319
or tough.

446
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,040
Lyu Huan.

447
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,440
It might be a happy one

448
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,600
or a sad one.

449
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,359
Grandpa Zizhong,

450
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,720
I'm so sorry.

451
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:01,000
The winner is

452
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,920
Feng Shayan.

453
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,000
I decide what I'm worth.

454
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,799
We've experienced all kinds of things.

455
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,480
However, we didn't give up.

456
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,319
We still move forward with determination.

457
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,359
Everyone is unique in their own way.

458
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,319
Everyone may be different,

459
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,759
but we possess the same courage and strength.

460
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,440
We grow and love.

461
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,720
Cultivation isn't about the past.

462
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,920
It's about the present.

463
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,240
That's why it doesn't matter

464
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,319
if Ms. Bao remembers the past or not.

465
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,040
It's enough as long as

466
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,560
we can watch over each other.

467
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
NDT EXPRESS

468
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,600
Get in.

469
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,400
Ms. Bao, what kind of urgent mission is this?

470
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,839
We don't even have time to eat.

471
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,160
We have no time. They're in trouble.

472
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,920
They? Ms. Bao, who are they?

473
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,880
Make yourself clear.

474
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,440
Everyone.

475
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,440
Who do you mean?

476
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,920
You, me,

477
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,040
Xu San, Xu Si,

478
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,920
Wang Ye, Zhuge Qing, Zhang Lingyu.

479
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,080
Everyone.

480
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,160
What happened?

481
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,960
Your Qi Apotheosis

482
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,160
has disrupted the entire Outsiders' world.

483
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,400
We are

484
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,359
running out of time.

485
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,400
That's all for our story at the moment.

486
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,120
One part of the secret

487
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,359
behind the Jiashen Calamity has been revealed.

488
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,759
However, it's far from over.

489
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,160
Our young Outsiders

490
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,839
will embark on a new journey soon.

491
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,839
I'm coming.

492
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,240
Here's your parcel. Please sign here.

493
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:14,759
Wait.

494
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:16,120
You look so similar.

495
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,960
The resemblance is uncanny.

496
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,480
You look exactly the same as the female lead I drew.

497
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:40,879
SALUTE TO ALL THE STAFF

498
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,839
WHO HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY FOR THIS PRODUCTION
