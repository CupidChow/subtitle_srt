1
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,160
Chief Celestial Taoist.

2
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,080
Yes.

3
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,360
Careful.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,919
Chief Celestial Taoist.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,279
These are the damages done by Sinister Pleasure.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,119
We will contact All-In-One Insurance and file a claim.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,839
Okay.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,519
Zhang Chulan.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,480
What secret lies in Tianshidu?

10
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:42,960
Is there something about my past?

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,839
Tianshidu…

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,160
Chulan, come here.

13
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:52,160
Ms. Bao, wait for me here.

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,880
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,320
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

16
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:31,640
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

17
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:37,360
Chief Celestial Taoist.

18
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,479
I'm Feng from Sinister Pleasure.

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,479
I'm Kun from Sinister Pleasure.

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,160
Greetings, Chief Celestial Taoist.

21
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,479
Good.

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,160
Can we go now?

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,119
Rest well.

24
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,080
-Yes. -We can leave now.

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,559
You did such a great job.

26
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,080
Why don't you stay here

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,440
and take care of me?

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,919
Why not express your gratitude to Chief Celestial Taoist right away?

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800
It's such an honorable position.

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,680
I would die to stay here.

31
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,880
I'm so jealous of you.

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
We shall pack our things.

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,760
Stop shoving. You should get your braces changed.

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,000
Congratulations, Grandmaster.

35
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,680
You have two more assistants now.

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,959
You said you were jealous of them.

37
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,840
Why don't you stay here then?

38
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:33,239
Grandmaster.
Well,

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,640
the presence of Sinister Pleasure here has been eradicated.

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,359
Xu San lamented the lack of foresight

41
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,560
and promised that this would not happen again.

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,400
Don't change the topic.

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,679
I'll ask you again.

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
Will you accept Tianshidu or not?

45
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,160
Grandmaster,

46
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,799
you haven't answered

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,320
my question from back then.

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,640
If you give me Tianshidu,

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,640
what will happen to you?

50
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:08,400
You

51
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
must have guessed the answer already.

52
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:15,840
Grandmaster,

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,160
will I see you again?

54
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,399
Talking to you is like talking to a wall.

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,959
As long as you do not stray from your path,

56
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,720
I will always be your grandmaster.

57
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,880
Mount Longhu will always be your home.

58
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,359
Sorry, Grandmaster.

59
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,560
Forget it.

60
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,280
You know my answer.

61
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,239
You should know why I did all that.

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,560
Descend the mountain tomorrow.

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,359
Find someone for me.

64
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,480
Test him and see if he's qualified

65
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,720
to inherit Tianshidu.

66
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,720
You have to win the contest.

67
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,359
You'll know once you're the champion.

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,160
Most importantly,

69
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,480
once you become Chief Celestial Taoist,

70
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,959
Sinister Pleasure won't be able to lay their hands on you.

71
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,920
Grandmaster,

72
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,200
I don't want

73
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:12,839
Tianshidu.

74
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,679
You're too smart to not have figured it out.

75
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,519
I set up the contest for you!

76
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,920
Take good care of yourself.

77
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,440
You,

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,960
Lingyu,

79
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:29,760
and that Wang Ye,

80
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,200
the world

81
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,760
will be yours in the future.

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,400
The burden

83
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,760
will be a heavy one.

84
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,240
But you're here, Grandmaster.

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,560
No harm will come to me, right?

86
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,800
Cheeky rascal.

87
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,280
I bet that lady is waiting for you out there.

88
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,760
Go back now.

89
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,440
Ms. Bao?

90
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,200
You hold her dearly, don't you?

91
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,719
-Help! Somebody! -Don't run!

92
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,159
Chief Celestial Taoist, you lied to me.

93
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,520
Save us.

94
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,120
-Who did this? -He did.

95
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,400
Master,

96
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,479
are you all right?

97
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,120
Why are you here?

98
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,640
Aren't you supposed to protect Jinzhong?

99
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:32,200
It's very quiet over there.

100
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
There was no invader whatsoever.

101
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,240
On my way here,

102
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,400
I ran into these two scoundrels.

103
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:36,680
Why are you here? Answer me!

104
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,800
Where is Jinzhong?

105
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,640
He's in his room.

106
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,320
Master?

107
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,440
Master Tian.

108
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,760
Master is here.

109
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,520
Master.

110
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,200
Master Tian?

111
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,640
Master Tian?

112
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,799
Master Tian!

113
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,840
Chulan,

114
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,799
who did this?

115
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,479
Everything about him has been wiped clean.

116
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,280
Lyu Liang…

117
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,560
Check if there are any clues.

118
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,159
Chief Celestial Taoist,

119
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,359
please stand aside.

120
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,039
This is a specialist from my company.

121
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,200
He can reenact past scenes from the ambient qi.

122
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,479
But of course,

123
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,760
if the incident took place a long time ago,

124
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,000
the amount of ambient qi will be too faint

125
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,520
for a proper restoration.

126
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:46,080
Is it plausible?

127
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,520
It took place less than 40 minutes ago.

128
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,120
I can do it.

129
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,320
I was there.

130
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Master Tian.

131
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,080
Rong Shan.

132
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,679
What's the matter, Qing?

133
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,400
You're shaking.

134
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,320
Celestial Taoist Mansion…

135
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:22,479
Sinister Pleasure is attacking Celestial Taoist Mansion.

136
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Those scums!

137
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,479
I heard Chief Celestial Taoist is fighting too,

138
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,960
Sinister Pleasure is numerous.

139
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,479
Chief Celestial Taoist is old.

140
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,000
I fear that he might be outnumbered.

141
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,039
Rong Shan, go now.

142
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,439
Help your master.

143
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,760
No, Master Tian.

144
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,919
Master told me to protect you.

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,360
This place is far from the battlefield. No one will come here.

146
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:46,319
Go.

147
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,720
This is an order.

148
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,240
Yu, Qing.

149
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,040
Protect Master Tian.

150
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,959
Yes.

151
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,680
Worry not, Rong Shan.

152
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,400
You fool.

153
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:03,920
See how easy they lured you away?

154
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
What do we do?

155
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,600
Is Sinister Pleasure

156
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
going to destroy Celestial Taoist Mansion?

157
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
Don't worry.

158
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,600
They are not strong enough.

159
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,240
And they don't want to destroy Celestial Taoist Mansion anyway.

160
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:16,640
Qing.

161
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,120
You have never met Sinister Pleasure.

162
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,680
They will use every means

163
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:24,160
to advance their goal.

164
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,199
Qing.

165
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,560
What are you doing?

166
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,760
You say Sinister Pleasure uses every means to advance their goal.

167
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,400
I am aware of that.

168
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,199
Because I told them

169
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,400
to destroy the unimportant parts of Celestial Taoist Mansion.

170
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,800
You see, I've been here for three years now.

171
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,040
This place has sentimental value to me.

172
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,079
I am the Interim Leader of Sinister Pleasure, Gong Qing.

173
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,319
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

174
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,240
INTERIM LEADER OF SINISTER PLEASURE, GONG QING

175
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,720
THIRTY MINUTES AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF TIAN JINZHONG

176
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
He's here.

177
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,560
Finally, you show up.

178
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Interim Leader Gong.

179
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,400
They are on high alert now.

180
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,920
Tianqian has been sealed by NDT.

181
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,280
This warehouse looks abandoned.

182
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,760
I don't think they will come here.

183
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,360
Let's spend a night here for now.

184
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,000
We can merge with the crowd and leave this place

185
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,400
during the funeral tomorrow.

186
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,680
Funeral?

187
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,040
Whose funeral?

188
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,319
Mr. Yuan.

189
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,600
How's everything on your side?

190
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,040
You see,

191
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,040
I managed to keep Chief Celestial Taoist occupied.

192
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,959
But so many people died

193
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,839
for you.

194
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,439
Even though they were just fodders,

195
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,480
they're still members of Sinister Pleasure.

196
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,880
Do you know what awaits you

197
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,920
if you return empty-handed?

198
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,640
Stop squeezing it.

199
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,120
Enough!

200
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,800
Mr. Yuan.

201
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,040
You asked me whose funeral it'd be.

202
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,600
It'd be Tian Jinzhong's.

203
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,760
It's Master Tian's funeral.

204
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,920
Tian Jinzhong is dead?

205
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:24,520
I killed him.

206
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:35,319
"Don't you pride yourself on knowing Sinister Pleasure the best?"

207
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
So why does my double identity

208
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,719
as your disciple and the interim leader of Sinister Pleasure

209
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,199
surprise you that much?

210
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:43,439
I'll be frank with you.

211
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,560
I am interested in Jiashen Calamity.

212
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,280
Especially Zhang Huaiyi.

213
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,920
I found out that he stayed in Mount Longhu

214
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,480
so I infiltrated this place.

215
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,079
However, your security is airtight.

216
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,000
During my sojourn here,

217
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,280
I found nothing.

218
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,000
But I got lucky.

219
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,439
When I was about to give up,

220
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,439
I stumbled upon a lead.

221
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,880
And so I was waiting for an opportunity.

222
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,920
An opportunity like today.

223
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,120
To ask you the question.

224
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,319
What question?

225
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,599
You once left Mount Longhu with Zhang Zhiwei

226
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,920
and went your separate ways.

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,839
No one knows why.

228
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
But I do.

229
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,400
You two were looking

230
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,040
for the traitor of Mount Longhu,

231
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,079
Zhang Huaiyi.

232
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,480
What I want to know is,

233
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,880
was your search

234
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,319
a fruitful one?

235
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,240
How did you obtain that information?

236
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,280
That incident

237
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,760
was only privy to my master, Zhiwei, and me.

238
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:50,000
You are right.

239
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,000
The secret is only privy to the three of you.

240
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,120
But it isn't too hard to deduct it.

241
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:56,640
I have seen your scars.

242
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,599
They were inflicted by torture.

243
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,839
Why were you interrogated?

244
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,280
Because someone wanted to know

245
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,199
why you made the trip.

246
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,640
It was for Zhang Huaiyi.

247
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:10,599
Is my theory

248
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,760
sound and logical?

249
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,880
Did you theorize all that?

250
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:16,959
I did.

251
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,079
At this point,

252
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:22,000
I don't mind telling you that I launched this invasion

253
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,520
to test my theory.

254
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,880
If my hypothesis is wrong,

255
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,920
my peers will kill me.

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,959
What a shame.

257
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,800
Because you're right.

258
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,120
We did leave Mount Longhu

259
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,199
to look for Huaiyi.

260
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,199
My kidnapper

261
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,599
wanted to get Huaiyi's whereabouts from me too.

262
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,599
Failing to find Huaiyi

263
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,800
is my deepest regret.

264
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,599
If Huaiyi were with me,

265
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,640
they wouldn't be able to lay their hands on me!

266
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,599
So they got nothing

267
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,199
from you?

268
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,520
You see.

269
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,839
They reduced me to a cripple but I still refused to give in.

270
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,319
What makes you,

271
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,760
Gong Qing,

272
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,839
think you can fish information

273
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,439
out of me?

274
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,719
Master Tian,

275
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:17,120
you are as stubborn as a mule.

276
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,479
Indeed, I can't extract information from you.

277
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,760
Come in.

278
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,120
Will you remain stubborn

279
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,240
or should I continue guessing?

280
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,079
After all,

281
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,360
I have been taking care of you

282
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,959
for the past few years.

283
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:46,479
And during these few years,

284
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,800
I found out many times,

285
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,839
that you, who claimed that you needed no sleep,

286
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,920
almost dozed off.

287
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,400
Grandmaster.

288
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,719
Is Master Tian that powerful?

289
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,199
Does he need no sleep at all?

290
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,599
Yes.

291
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,240
It's called mindfulness.

292
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,479
That's incredible.

293
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,959
Since when?

294
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,400
A long time ago.

295
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,800
After he was injured,

296
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,040
his body was too weak

297
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:40,560
to practice anything

298
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,240
other than static qigong.

299
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,800
You have no idea

300
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,319
how excited I was at this discovery.

301
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:54,880
Because it gave me

302
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,800
another explanation.

303
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,400
You are not unwilling to sleep,

304
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,920
but unable to do so.

305
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,520
Or perhaps, you don't dare to.

306
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,079
I theorized

307
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,159
that your kidnappers

308
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,720
couldn't get anything out of you.

309
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,119
And you never mentioned it

310
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,319
to anyone in Mount Longhu.

311
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,240
It was around that time

312
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,480
that you began to be afraid of sleeping.

313
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,960
Why?

314
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,240
Because when we're asleep,

315
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,280
our inhibition is lowered.

316
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,720
You are afraid of sleep-talking.

317
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,399
After your rescue,

318
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,360
there is a secret

319
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,800
inside you.

320
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,240
And that secret is

321
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,120
you

322
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,560
met Zhang Huaiyi.

323
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,440
Not only that,

324
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,960
you talked to Zhang Huaiyi

325
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,480
and obtained information

326
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,280
that cannot be revealed to your master.

327
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
You would bring it to your grave.

328
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,000
Young lad.

329
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,399
You're so creative.

330
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,280
But you got it wrong

331
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,480
this time.

332
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,600
I did not find Huaiyi.

333
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,720
Even if my limbs were chopped off,

334
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,960
and my meridian system was destroyed,

335
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,040
a fact is a fact.

336
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,320
Whatever situation I'm in, whoever asks me that question,

337
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,560
my answer will not change.

338
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:23,360
Master Tian,

339
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,000
I know how stubborn you can be.

340
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,159
I wasn't planning to make you confess anyway.

341
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,960
Lyu Liang.

342
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,440
Stay back

343
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,040
foul beasts!

344
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,080
Hurry.

345
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,960
Extract his memory from back then.

346
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,159
Then delete all memories from that incident

347
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,360
as well as memories containing you and me.

348
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,399
He had held onto them for far too long.

349
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,840
Let's release him from his agony.

350
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,280
I can't.

351
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,240
He has the most resilient

352
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,600
primordial spirit I have ever seen.

353
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,480
Count yourself lucky

354
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,879
that I can check his memory.

355
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,200
To extract specific memories,

356
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,960
it'll take months.

357
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,800
We won't be able to get anything

358
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,840
from him now.

359
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:14,840
Go.

360
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:16,040
Guard the door.

361
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,200
I will do my best

362
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,120
to make a copy of all his memory.

363
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm done.

364
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:44,000
Let's go.

365
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,879
It's dangerous to stay here.

366
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,840
Qing.

367
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,600
I need you.

368
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:52,720
Come. We're done here.

369
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
What are you waiting for?

370
00:19:58,639 --> 00:19:59,560
What are you doing?

371
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:00,840
Are you crazy?

372
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:02,200
I'm leaving you.

373
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,320
Qing.

374
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,800
Not bad.

375
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,879
You weaved your intricate plan patiently for three years

376
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,560
and it paid off.

377
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,879
I won't be able to convince you to give up,

378
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,840
will I?

379
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,960
Are you going to leave now?

380
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,960
Yes.

381
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,080
To think that Sinister Pleasure was once a virtuous organization.

382
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,679
Look how far you have fallen.

383
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,440
You're nothing but a motley band of criminals,

384
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,399
scumbags!

385
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,560
You think the world is your oyster

386
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,560
but you're destroying it.

387
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,560
Irresponsible morons!

388
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:20,320
Master Tian, this is unbecoming

389
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,960
of you.

390
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,120
Don't call me that!

391
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,760
You're dirtying my name.

392
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,720
You're the ringleader.

393
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,000
Minister in Black?

394
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,159
Wu Gensheng?

395
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,080
All of you are the same.

396
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,399
You are cowards who turn away from their responsibilities!

397
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,560
I see.

398
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,760
You're so right.

399
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,879
NEFARIOUS NEEDLE

400
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,960
Let me take charge

401
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:07,840
of your life.

402
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,159
You finally grew a pair.

403
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,679
Do you want to kill me?

404
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,800
I might be a cripple

405
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:23,879
but here in Celestial Taoist Mansion,

406
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,720
my power is second only to Zhiwei's.

407
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,159
Quit threatening me.

408
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,120
What if I chicken out?

409
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,679
Are you sure about it?

410
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
YEAR OF JIASHEN

411
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,040
Are you sure about it?

412
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,600
Even so,

413
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,320
are you still trying to force me to say it?

414
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:19,360
Is that right, Jinzhong?

415
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,879
Yes, unless you explain why

416
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,399
I won't stop pestering you.

417
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,120
And that is our duty.

418
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,840
What epiphany did you receive?

419
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,280
The finality of all things

420
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,639
is Qi Apotheosis.

421
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,560
Dummy.

422
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:40,159
Let's go. We're running out of time.

423
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:47,320
Jinzhong.

424
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:49,320
Don't return.

425
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:50,399
Come with me.

426
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,879
I can't. Master is waiting for me.

427
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,280
I have to go back to him.

428
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:56,760
Fine.

429
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:59,280
I know you far too well.

430
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,760
Be proud of yourself now

431
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,080
because you're the sole keeper

432
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,720
of this secret.

433
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:06,360
Jinzhong.

434
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,080
Take care.

435
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,120
All the best.

436
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
May we never meet again.

437
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,560
May we never meet again.

438
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,120
You're awake.

439
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Master.

440
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,840
Zhiwei.

441
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:32,480
I did not find Huaiyi.

442
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,720
But they wouldn't believe me.

443
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,960
They wouldn't…

444
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,919
Jinzhong.

445
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,960
I will track your kidnappers down

446
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,159
and avenge you.

447
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,919
Jinzhong.

448
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,120
What are you doing?

449
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,879
Master.

450
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,879
Just let me die.

451
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:02,480
Please,

452
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,360
Master!

453
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,679
You fool!

454
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,040
Have you learned nothing

455
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,159
from years

456
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,080
of cultivation?

457
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:11,639
Remember.

458
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,280
You are no ordinary man.

459
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
Like me, we seek enlightenment.

460
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,120
We celebrate life.

461
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:19,720
No cultivators

462
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,199
kill themselves

463
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,040
upon encountering a setback.

464
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,199
The path is arduous

465
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,960
but you will endure it.

466
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,800
Remember this.

467
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:30,240
Hardship

468
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,080
means you're making progress.

469
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,800
Master…

470
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:38,360
Sorry, Master.

471
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:40,280
Come.

472
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,480
-Do you like it? -You made it?

473
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,600
Did I improve?

474
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,080
Not bad.

475
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,720
Zhiwei.

476
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,639
I don't care what assignment Master gives you.

477
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,280
Even when you become a Celestial Taoist,

478
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,600
you have to cook for me.

479
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,919
I had a deal with Huaiyi.

480
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,960
He'd travel for a year.

481
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,159
Then it'd be my turn.

482
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,960
In the end, he never came back.

483
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,480
Here.

484
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,480
Take another bite.

485
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,159
Zhiwei.

486
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,439
Thank you so much.

487
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Jinzhong.

488
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,600
Don't feel bad at all.

489
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,679
You got injured on a mission.

490
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,679
You did not fail our sect

491
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,040
nor did you fail your peers.

492
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:30,879
And to be honest,

493
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,399
when everyone takes turns

494
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,720
to take care of you,

495
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,199
we actually get to skip

496
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,560
some of our training.

497
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,320
I don't feel that guilty, you know?

498
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,360
Maybe I do when others are here. But you?

499
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:44,000
You ought to take care of me.

500
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,199
Anyway, you were talking in your sleep last night.

501
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,159
"Sorry, Master."

502
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,399
"Sorry, Zhiwei."

503
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,639
What else did I say?

504
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,399
You also said,

505
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:57,679
"finality",

506
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,679
and,
"qi".

507
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,439
Hardship means I'm making progress.

508
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,800
Hardship means I'm making progress.

509
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,800
Huaiyi.

510
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,040
I regret it so much.

511
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,040
I shouldn't have asked you to explain.

512
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,439
And now, I have to carry

513
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
this burden.

514
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,760
When you told me what you were doing,

515
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,520
I should have done it.

516
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,760
Even though I would betray my doctrine

517
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,439
in the process,

518
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,080
I should have died a long time ago.

519
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,240
I'm sorry.

520
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,040
I should have died a long time ago.

521
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,679
Master Tian.

522
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Goodnight.

523
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,560
Lyu Liang did his best

524
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:36,399
and extracted Master Tian's memory.

525
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,199
Brilliant!

526
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,280
So your theory

527
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,240
is right.

528
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,560
Three years ago,

529
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,120
you wagered your life

530
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:47,439
to convince us.

531
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,959
You said you'd find the whereabouts of our former leader, Wu Gensheng.

532
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,199
Your wager paid off handsomely.

533
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,199
Don't tell anyone the fact

534
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,879
that we have Master Tian's memory now.

535
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,120
I trust you to circulate

536
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,879
what I'm about to say to everyone.

537
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,480
Another operation right after

538
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,399
we invaded Celestial Taoist Mansion?

539
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,600
Do you know

540
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:11,879
how heavy the casualties are?

541
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,199
Tell all our members

542
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,600
to be in mourning for seven days.

543
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,240
We will all mourn for Master Tian.

544
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,360
Those who refuse to comply

545
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,480
will be killed.

546
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:45,800
I did everything I could to reenact the past.

547
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:47,320
But Master Tian's memory

548
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:48,800
is in Lyu Liang's possession.

549
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:50,679
I have no way to retrieve his memory either.

550
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:52,159
Thank you.

551
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,959
You did a good job already.

552
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,919
Thank you so much.

553
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,120
Chief Celestial Taoist, my condolences.

554
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:22,720
Rong Shan.

555
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,600
Death is inevitable.

556
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:27,879
Accept it.

557
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,000
Rong Shan.

558
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,879
Rong Shan?

559
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:39,120
Rong Shan.

560
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,959
Rong Shan.

561
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,080
Rong Shan!

562
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,560
Master Tian…

563
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,199
LONG LIVE TAOISM

564
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,360
-Zhang… -Baobao.

565
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,240
Don't say anything now.

566
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,120
Ms. Bao.

567
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,280
Ms. Bao.

568
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:51,040
Xu San said your mood hasn't been good lately

569
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,879
and asked me not to ask you anything for now.

570
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,760
Is it because you are sad?

571
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,560
I think I can understand

572
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:02,199
what sadness is now.

573
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,879
When a long-time friend dies,

574
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,439
you feel sad.

575
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,159
When a family member dies,

576
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,719
you feel sad.

577
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,959
When your loved one dies,

578
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,439
you feel sad too.

579
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
You have only met Master Tian a few times.

580
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,719
He isn't your family.

581
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,719
Do you love him?

582
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,639
Why are you in love

583
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,840
with someone you barely met?

584
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,679
Ms. Bao.

585
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,800
I refused to inherit Tianshidu.

586
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:43,760
So I cannot get the answer you want from Chief Celestial Taoist.

587
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:45,959
I'm sorry.

588
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,520
Ms. Bao.

589
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,320
I think

590
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:00,600
you should give up on the past.

591
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:02,120
It has been so many years after all.

592
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,360
Maybe they already…

593
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,000
Ms. Bao.

594
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,480
You're not alone.

595
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,639
I also no longer have a home.

596
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:26,080
But I can promise you

597
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,080
that I will stay by your side

598
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,839
like Mr. Xu or Doggy did.

599
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,799
You can boss me around.

600
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,799
You're lying.

601
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,199
You have a home.

602
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:40,600
You have it.

603
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,719
All of you have it.

604
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:44,440
It's in here.

605
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,200
Ms. Bao.

606
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,279
You will have what we have.

607
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:08,920
I will help you find the truth.

608
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,640
I will find your home.

609
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:42,440
Grandmaster Tian.

610
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,400
Thank you for keeping my grandpa's secret for years.

611
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,279
Jinzhong.

612
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,880
You must be tired

613
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,600
from all these years.

614
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,600
Sleep well now.

615
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:32,799
Master.

616
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,000
Don't dwell in grief.

617
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,400
Your health is important.

618
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Jinzhong.

619
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,640
You will not die in vain.
