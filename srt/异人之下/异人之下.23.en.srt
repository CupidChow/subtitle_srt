1
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,240
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,759
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

3
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:35,040
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,360
Chaos Golden Space Rip!

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,199
Darn it.

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,680
You even thought of jumping off a building

7
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,919
to avoid doing work.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,440
If I were the leader of Wudang Sect,

9
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:52,559
I would expel you too.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,320
Fine. I'll get up there now.

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,239
Relax. Zhuge Qing has dealt with it.

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,760
Alright, then.

13
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,680
Eleven of them.

14
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,480
Ms. Bao.

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,679
We can get credit for sending them to the company, right?

16
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:10,039
Yes.

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,720
You're so snotty.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,360
You must be the leader.

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,720
How about this?

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,320
Tell me who sent you here

21
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:20,720
and I'll let you guys go.

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,479
Brat.

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,960
Save it.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
My business

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,720
is based on trust.

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,440
If I tell you,

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,119
I'll run out of business.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,839
If I don't tell you,

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,440
there's nothing you can do.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,839
There's nothing I can do?

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,839
Ms. Bao.

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,839
Tell him what I can do to him.

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,759
Sure.

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
Nice one.

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,479
See?

36
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,040
This is a work injury.

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,840
I've reported it to the company.

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,359
Our company is united.

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,760
A collective with love.

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Starting today,

41
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,239
your name has been put on the list in the company.

42
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,440
You beat me up so badly.

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,320
From now on,

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,200
you will be the main concern of our company.

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,000
You can kiss goodbye to your business.

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,000
You're framing me!

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,600
Am I?

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,880
You knew from the get-go

49
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,200
that he was this despicable,

50
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,799
that's why you asked me to find him, right?

51
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,959
How would I have known?

52
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
I guess

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,480
that's a serendipitous bonus.

54
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
I will never tell you.

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Just come at me.

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,480
Why did you approach my family?

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,440
Taoist Wang.

58
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,320
We haven't done anything to your family yet.

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,320
Relax.

60
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,519
Don't you dare do anything!

61
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Tell me.

62
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,679
Who sent you?

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,840
How many more of you are out there?

64
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:08,799
Are you telling me or not?

65
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,640
You…

66
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,600
Wang Ye.

67
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:13,359
Don't do it.

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
That's right, Wang Ye.

69
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,160
I've beaten myself up so badly, yet he refuses to speak.

70
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,799
Let's talk about what we should do next.

71
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,040
If we want to find who's behind it now,

72
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,239
don't you think it's time you two use your phantasmagoria?

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,720
What's with that look? Did I say something wrong?

74
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,119
You are right.

75
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,640
This is my business.

76
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,359
I should bear it alone.

77
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:44,840
Don't say that.

78
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,399
If it was that easy,

79
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,440
you could have done it in the first place.

80
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,359
Let's do it together.

81
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
Count Lian in.

82
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,079
Let's do it with the three of us.

83
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,440
Do it together?

84
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,040
Is this a joke?

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,880
Wait a minute.

86
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,239
Can't you two do it and give me the answer?

87
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,679
Wang Ye.

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,600
-Can you set the Four Pillars? -I can.

89
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,760
What did you mean by the three of us together?

90
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,880
How can three people do divination together?

91
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,320
So there's something you can't do.

92
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,920
This is a unique skill of the Marquis family.

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,200
We discovered long ago

94
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,680
that phantasmagoria isn't unique to individual sorcerers.

95
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,039
Once you enter it,

96
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,320
it is all the same.

97
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,599
Ms. Bao.

98
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,079
You must stand watch for us.

99
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:23,039
One more thing.

100
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,440
Don't let those guys get away.

101
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,440
Piece of cake.

102
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,760
Handled it.
They can't move now.

103
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,840
I love Ms. Bao's style.

104
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,760
Come on.

105
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,880
Let's find an empty space.

106
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:54,880
Zhang Chulan.

107
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,000
Is your eye okay?

108
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,159
I'll rub it back to normal.

109
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,200
Wang Ye, I think this space looks good.

110
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,120
Let's do it here.
First off,

111
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:03,240
Wang Ye has to be the one laying out the array.

112
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,400
Qimen's Four Pillars will move every two hours.

113
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,880
This array can only be used

114
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,760
when the Four Pillars are in the right spots.

115
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,360
That means the Three Wonders and Six Flags,

116
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,640
Eight Doors,

117
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:15,000
Nine Stars,

118
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,960
and Eight Gods

119
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,039
must all fall in their respective houses.

120
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,880
We can only wait for the perfect timing.

121
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,760
That's why this array is extremely impractical

122
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,919
to the Zhuge family.

123
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,560
But we have Wang Ye.

124
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,120
So this exacting demand

125
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,320
won't be a problem.

126
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,240
The second step.

127
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,840
Someone who can mobilize qi needs to land on the house

128
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,080
to be a sacrificial offering.

129
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,080
According to old folks,

130
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,880
my ancestor, Kongming, once planned to gather

131
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,880
the fifteen offerings of the Three Wonders and Six Flags

132
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,320
to gain exceptional powers

133
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,359
through this array.

134
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,560
Sadly, he did not succeed in the end.

135
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,840
But of course,

136
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,080
there are only three of us.

137
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,080
We aren't incarnations,

138
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,520
nor are we asking for powers.

139
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,520
It's just an inquiry.
It should be alright.

140
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:49,320
Later, I will stand on Bing Fire.

141
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,440
Wang Ye, you stand on Ding Fire.

142
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,000
Chulan clashes with Yi Wood.

143
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,200
Use the Gold Brilliance Spell.

144
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,640
Ms. Bao.

145
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:58,120
Guard the three of us.

146
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,280
We each take a spot of the Three Wonders.

147
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,280
I will take us

148
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:03,200
into the phantasmagoria through this array.

149
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,320
Let's begin, Wang Ye.

150
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,359
Okay.

151
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,840
Qimen's Immaculate Scrutiny.

152
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,960
Zhuge Qing,

153
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,120
this must be your real reason to come for me.

154
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,039
You want to see Qimen Manipulation again

155
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,359
using any excuse.

156
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,440
Everything is still the same.

157
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,599
It is changing.

158
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:35,799
Alright.

159
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:41,919
Well,

160
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,120
where do I go?

161
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,960
Stand there.

162
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,400
Let's begin.

163
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,039
Li,

164
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,280
Bursting Flame.

165
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,719
Gold Brilliance Spell.

166
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,760
Li,

167
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,039
Firefly Flowing Light.

168
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,479
Qimen First Array.

169
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,599
Revert Array.

170
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,280
What is this place?

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,120
Zhang Chulan.

172
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,239
You and Wang Ye

173
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,840
are now both in my phantasmagoria.

174
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,400
In your language,

175
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,000
that means you are in the world of my mind,

176
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
while your bodies

177
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,960
are being guarded by Ms. Bao outside.

178
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:27,919
That's awesome.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
Chulan, didn't you mention the lottery?

180
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,000
Try asking for the next winning lottery numbers in your head.

181
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:38,439
Ask? How?

182
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,959
Do I just think about it?

183
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,280
This is the answer.

184
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
If you break it,

185
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:47,800
you will obtain the answer.

186
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,640
I can't open it.

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,079
Will it be easier for you two to open it?

188
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,760
Smart.

189
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,880
These numbers

190
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,199
mean nothing to the two of us.

191
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,439
That's why we can easily obtain them.

192
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,199
Since you two are inside my phantasmagoria,

193
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,600
these informations can be shared.

194
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,120
What happens if we tell someone else

195
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:29,319
the winning lottery numbers?

196
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
That would be deceiving God.

197
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:32,600
Your fortune would be reduced.

198
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,720
At least

199
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,079
you'll face various misfortunes.

200
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,640
At worst you'll face a brutal death.

201
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,319
The punishment's severity

202
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,880
depends on the impact of the disclosed information on the world.

203
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,120
But if you relay the information in vague words,

204
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,360
perhaps it could lessen the effect of the punishment.

205
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,959
This is why we sorcerers

206
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,199
tend to beat around the bush.

207
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,439
Alright, Chulan.

208
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,800
You have got the basic idea.

209
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:08,319
Let's begin.

210
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,040
This is what we came in to ask.

211
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,839
The identity of the person behind this incident.

212
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,079
That's huge!

213
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,280
This looks way bigger than the ball for the winning lottery numbers.

214
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,760
Indeed. Otherwise, the three of us wouldn't need to be here.

215
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:19,959
On top of that,

216
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,959
your vitality will be consumed and damaged here.

217
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,000
It's not too late to back out.

218
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,560
I knew about all this already.

219
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,600
No need to worry.

220
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,880
Wang Ye.

221
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,160
You need to pay me more

222
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,360
for my reduced lifespan.

223
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,480
Let's get to it.

224
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,439
Chulan.

225
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,480
Attack this glowing ball at full force with Lightning Technique.

226
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,839
Why is my Lightning Technique like this?

227
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
In this Distribution,

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
you entered the phantasmagoria through the Yi Wonder.

229
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,079
So you're now in the form of Yi Wood.

230
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,400
And I

231
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,000
am Bing Fire.

232
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,719
I am Ding Fire.

233
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,319
The glowing ball is growing bigger.

234
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,439
We can't break it!

235
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,719
It's resisting!

236
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,760
Did you think such important information

237
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:18,040
could be easily obtained?

238
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,920
Prepare to put your lives on the line!

239
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:28,040
Zhang Chulan.

240
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Hang in there!

241
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,319
We did it.

242
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,880
If I did it alone,

243
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,640
I would probably need to sacrifice half my life.

244
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,959
What do you think, Wang Ye?

245
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,199
Now you've seen

246
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,920
the beauty of Marquis's Qimen.

247
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,439
Wang Ye.

248
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,800
Don't forget the additional fee.

249
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,719
Now we know the answer.

250
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,360
The person behind this

251
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,199
is the number one of Shu Sect.

252
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,560
One of the Ten Elders,

253
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:40,360
Chen Jinkui.

254
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:42,520
Life is easy for you sorcerers.

255
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:45,040
You can easily get the answers you want.

256
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,880
If you two hadn't brought me here,

257
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,079
I would never get to experience something like this.

258
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,719
Why don't we ask a few more questions

259
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,680
before the array ends?

260
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,920
Don't even think about it!

261
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:03,839
Zhang Chulan.

262
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,079
What did you ask?

263
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,079
Is this the truth behind the Jiashen Calamity?

264
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,160
Zhang Chulan!

265
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,000
Zhang Chulan!

266
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,319
Stop!

267
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,520
Give up.

268
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,439
Even ten or a hundred of us won't be able to break it,

269
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,959
let alone the three of us.

270
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Zhang Chulan!

271
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,000
Wake up!

272
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,199
What on earth did he ask?

273
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,120
Wake up now!

274
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,719
It's gone wild.

275
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,760
They have all gone wild.

276
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,560
I need to set their qi right.

277
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,240
Well, I guess this will do.

278
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,120
Zhang Chulan!

279
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,520
Duck!

280
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,800
Ms. Bao?

281
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:46,520
What's going on?

282
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,400
You're awake. We need to go now.

283
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,760
Undo!

284
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:53,400
What just happened?

285
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,520
It hurts!

286
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:57,920
Feng Baobao. It's going to break!

287
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:01,560
Are you awake?

288
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,959
I noticed that your qi

289
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,000
had all gone haywire.

290
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,319
So I unblocked your pulses.

291
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,479
Zhang Chulan.

292
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,920
What on earth did you ask?

293
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,719
You nearly got us both killed. You know that?

294
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Answer me.

295
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,199
Forget it, Zhuge Qing.

296
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,479
It was our fault too

297
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,800
for bringing a non-practitioner.

298
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,199
I'm sorry.

299
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,800
You all got hurt because of me.

300
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,479
You never received training for Qimen's Scrutiny.

301
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,920
Being bewitched is inevitable.

302
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,520
If I failed to wake up in the phantasmagoria,

303
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,760
what would have happened?

304
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,079
If you had failed to wake up,

305
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,439
our identity as the Three Wonders wouldn't hold anymore.

306
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,240
I wouldn't be able to undo the array.

307
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,880
And you…

308
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,160
If you insisted on attacking the answer,

309
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,959
you would be crushed for sure.

310
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,280
The two of us would eventually be swallowed by the answer.

311
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,719
We'd sink within the phantasmagoria

312
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,520
and become walking corpses.

313
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,599
Ms. Bao. We're lucky you helped us in time.

314
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:00,160
I can't thank you enough.

315
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,120
Don't mention it.

316
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:03,199
Alright.

317
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,440
Regardless,

318
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,800
it was worth taking this risk.

319
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,839
At least we now know

320
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,000
the enemy we are facing.

321
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,000
Leave the next step to me.

322
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,280
I got paid, so I need to do my job.

323
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,280
My job isn't done yet.

324
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,320
So you are Zhang Chulan,

325
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:38,399
the champion of the Outsider Martial Arts Contest?

326
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,360
Master Chen.

327
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,600
Those were just some petty tricks.

328
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,399
I certainly can't be compared to you.

329
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,520
Tell me. Why are you suddenly here to see me?

330
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,800
Here's the thing, Master Chen.

331
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:53,320
You know Wang Ye, right?

332
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:55,800
I don't.

333
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:56,960
I have never met him before.

334
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,680
You don't know him?

335
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,280
You have never met him before?

336
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,000
That's weird.

337
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,200
I heard from others

338
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,080
that you planted many people around his family.

339
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,280
Master Chen.

340
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,840
Don't get mad.

341
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:14,080
I was only asked to come

342
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,480
and talk to you.

343
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,480
Wang Ye thinks so.

344
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,720
Just go at him.

345
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,639
Don't get families involved.

346
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,240
If both parties are furtive like this,

347
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,720
isn't this business tricky to handle?

348
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,480
Master Chen.

349
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,240
I have another suggestion for you.

350
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,080
If you really want to go to war with Wang Ye,

351
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,720
fight him one-on-one.

352
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,560
Or gather 50 people

353
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:53,800
to beat him up.

354
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:55,480
Just don't involve his family.

355
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,480
By the way,

356
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,399
I heard that those friends of yours were quite pricey.

357
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,919
How about telling them to leave?

358
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,600
What methods did you use?

359
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,360
Not only did you find out who hired us,

360
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,919
you even got them to cancel the order.

361
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,919
Luck.

362
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,320
It was all luck.

363
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,960
Sorry about the past few days.

364
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,280
Everyone gets a share.

365
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,919
Please don't refuse it.

366
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,480
Regardless of how you were treated,

367
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
that was the doing of Zhang Chulan the NDT employee.

368
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:23,159
Now, things are over.

369
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:24,720
Though we aren't friends,

370
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,040
we certainly aren't enemies.

371
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,000
We might even need your help in the future.

372
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,040
This money is just a small kind gesture

373
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,320
from Mr. Wang.

374
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:33,800
We hope all of you have a good time here.

375
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,840
Wang Ye.

376
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,240
I won't apologize to you.

377
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
We were just getting paid

378
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:41,240
to do things.

379
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,000
It's nothing personal.

380
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,960
If you need help in the future, contact us.

381
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,360
You can consider it done.

382
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,639
Everyone, goodbye.

383
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Take care.

384
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
Thanks, Chulan.

385
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,639
The money was supposed to be yours,

386
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,480
but you gave it to them as a favor.

387
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,280
To be honest,

388
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,720
I learned something from you.

389
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,840
No big deal.

390
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,200
What should we eat, Ms. Bao?

391
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,720
Roast duck.

392
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,040
Let me do it.

393
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:13,480
It's finally over.

394
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,720
I haven't had a proper meal in days.

395
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,679
Over?

396
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,879
It's over?

397
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,720
Basically, yes.

398
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,280
We just haven't wrapped it up.

399
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,399
Is it that simple?

400
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,919
What else do you expect?

401
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,320
Barge into Chen Jinkui's house and wipe out his family?

402
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:32,040
Listen.

403
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,159
Neither of you has shown your hands

404
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,800
It's the perfect time for both to step back.

405
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,560
Why did he withdraw his order?

406
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:39,560
That means he has concerns about it.

407
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:41,760
It's easy to settle if that's the case.

408
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,200
You are stronger than him.

409
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,120
But have you wondered

410
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,120
why dealing with this was such a headache for you?

411
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,439
It's because you were against a guy with no shame.

412
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,639
A guy with no shame would do anything to achieve his goal.

413
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,720
That's why he could play with people like you as he pleased.

414
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,919
But what if a shameless guy meets a shameless guy?

415
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,280
Before completely falling out with each other,

416
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,600
everyone will act with caution.

417
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:04,000
Because once they fall out,

418
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,679
it will be a battle of who can go lower.

419
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,080
So in order to protect your family,

420
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,679
you must tell them

421
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,960
that you have no shame either.

422
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,080
Once this is over,

423
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,560
leave your home and go somewhere.

424
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:19,520
You can't protect your whole family on your own.

425
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,320
Instead, you will be exposing your weakness.

426
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:23,520
That's why you must leave and let someone else protect them.

427
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,960
I've thought about that.

428
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,320
But

429
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:31,520
who can I entrust my family to?

430
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,320
What?

431
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:37,720
Zhuge Qing.

432
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,399
You seem to have a lot of free time.

433
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
How about

434
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,399
a part-time job at my place?

435
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,000
No.

436
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,879
How about this? I'll recommend three people to you.

437
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,840
My friends

438
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,520
are better than your bodyguards, right?

439
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,840
Each of them is really skilled.

440
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,760
So consider hiring them.

441
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,879
The tall one.

442
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,639
He can be your personal bodyguard.

443
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,879
The girl can be Mom's personal bodyguard.

444
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,800
The short one can be Yi's family bodyguard.

445
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:25,080
You have everything planned.

446
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:27,040
Are you planning to leave again?

447
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
A few years ago

448
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,639
after you graduated from university,

449
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,960
you wanted to become a monk.

450
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:36,760
I got so angry that I slapped you.

451
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,320
I've waited so long.

452
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,040
You finally came back from Wudang.

453
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:43,320
But in the end,

454
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,919
you still have to leave.

455
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,360
Dad.

456
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:49,360
If you are still angry,

457
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:50,639
you can give me another slap.

458
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,919
My son.

459
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:00,520
You're a grown-up now.

460
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,840
You have to walk

461
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:03,960
your own path.

462
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:08,800
I only have one thing to ask of you.

463
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,080
When you're out there,

464
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,879
no matter what danger

465
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,800
or trouble you face,

466
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,720
don't shoulder everything alone.

467
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,679
Come home.

468
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:20,240
You have me.

469
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,080
I will.

470
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,520
Dad.

471
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,040
I know you are rich and capable.

472
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,840
But I really don't need

473
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,240
luxury cars and mansions.

474
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,200
Let my two big brothers have those things.

475
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,600
You're right.

476
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,280
That's why

477
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,080
there is nothing I can do about you.

478
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,520
Come on, Dad.

479
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,639
Don't say that.

480
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Actually…

481
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,919
I rely on you more than them.

482
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,720
Because I have you here,

483
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,080
I get to have more freedom to choose

484
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,760
and become myself.

485
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,520
Dad.

486
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,960
Thank you.

487
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,439
I will hire

488
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:15,520
your friends.

489
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,320
Tomorrow, enjoy a meal with your mother.

490
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:21,600
Don't bring this up.

491
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,480
Well…

492
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,800
I will soothe her later.

493
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
My son.

494
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,120
Just

495
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,480
leave quietly.

496
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,879
Ms. Bao.

497
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,040
Was there cucumber in the hotel's breakfast?

498
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,480
From the kitchen.

499
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,240
Did you enter their kitchen?

500
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,679
They were pretty nice.

501
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,120
Did you take it in front of them?

502
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,280
Mr. Zhang, we have brought your car to the entrance.

503
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,679
This is your car key.

504
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:33,280
Thank you.

505
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,960
You made so much money.

506
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,199
Why are you still so stingy?

507
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,000
Wang Ye, I should thank you.

508
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,080
If I don't have to get back to work,

509
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,360
I would like to stay at your hotel for a few more days.

510
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:45,560
Don't mention it.

511
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:46,520
This time,

512
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,919
I should be thanking you instead

513
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,199
for getting my family out of the Jiashen Calamity.

514
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,120
I will handle the rest on my own.

515
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,639
I'll be off, then.

516
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,560
Zhang Chulan.

517
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,040
Feng Baobao.

518
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,840
Till we meet again.

519
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,520
By the way,

520
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,040
I've transferred the extra money back to your account.

521
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,879
You don't want the money?

522
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,480
You've brought me into the phantasmagoria.

523
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,199
I was too weak to get my answer.

524
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,360
You don't owe me anything.

525
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:18,919
Who knows when we'll meet each other again?

526
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,000
I haven't seen anyone roll down a window in years.

527
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,760
I'll roll it for you once more.

528
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,600
It's enough. You should get going.

529
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:36,199
Wang Ye.

530
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,360
Thank you.

531
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,000
Though I only got a vague glimpse of the truth,

532
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,320
now I know must find Lyu Liang.

533
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:45,439
I hope you will also find your path.

534
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,760
You've sent off those two weirdos?

535
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,600
It's suddenly so quiet.

536
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,120
I'm not used to it.

537
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,199
What about you?

538
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,159
Are you planning to go back?

539
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:06,360
I'm not going back.

540
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:07,879
I'm going to wander and look around.

541
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:10,639
If it hadn't been for you,

542
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,879
I wouldn't have met so many interesting people and things.

543
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:16,600
I've gotten a little addicted.

544
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,360
How about you?

545
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,879
I don't know.

546
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,080
I've been trying to figure it out these few days.

547
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,840
How does Zhang Chulan do things

548
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,439
with such ease?

549
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,800
Well,

550
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,399
I'm not trying to brag.

551
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:41,040
But I'm considered smart.

552
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,760
Since I was a child,

553
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,360
I could handle everyone around me.

554
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
My parents.

555
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,600
My teachers.

556
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,679
My classmates.

557
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:53,240
Even my two elder brothers.

558
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,760
I could make all of them happy.

559
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,919
But whether it was relationships or achievements,

560
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,760
I just did it to make other people happy.

561
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,840
I found those things to be such a bother.

562
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,679
That's why

563
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,240
after graduating from university,

564
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,919
I went to Wudang to cultivate my mind.

565
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,399
You know what?

566
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,000
Afterward,

567
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,919
whenever I face people

568
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
I had this inexplicable sense of superiority.

569
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,919
I looked at you foolish people

570
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,720
wearing yourselves out

571
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,399
over those little desires.

572
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:37,000
But look at me.

573
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,040
So unfettered

574
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,320
and free.

575
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:41,679
While all of you are still working hard in life,

576
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,600
I have gone beyond secularity.

577
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:46,720
But

578
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:49,600
this sense of superiority had disappeared these last few days.

579
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,439
It turns out there were things I couldn't handle.

580
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,159
Someone free of all vulgarity like me

581
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:04,439
had no choice but to turn to the most unbearably vulgar fellow.

582
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:09,840
Out of all the choices,

583
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,439
why did you choose the worst one?

584
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,600
It is what I want to do.

585
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,600
Whatever the outcome is,

586
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,159
I will bear the responsibility alone.

587
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,800
I don't know what Zhang Chulan asked in the phantasmagoria.

588
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,280
But the truth he has to face

589
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,399
is a disaster.

590
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:26,280
Now, I believe

591
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,720
that even if he gets on that train one day

592
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,280
and finds the truth,

593
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,560
he will be able to face any challenges with a calm heart.

594
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,879
Looking at those two,

595
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,439
I realized how foolish I was.

596
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,320
What they have now

597
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,600
and I don't

598
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,919
is a worldly past.

599
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,919
That's the result of being carved and polished.

600
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,040
Compared to them,

601
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:59,720
my only advantage

602
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:02,879
was being born into a better life.

603
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,439
I have been avoiding society.

604
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,639
Who am I to talk about going beyond secularity?

605
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
Wang Ye.

606
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,520
Whatever it is.

607
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,000
You gained something from this.

608
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
That's a good thing.

609
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,000
But please don't be like Lian.

610
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,840
He has absolutely no shame.

611
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,720
That's not what I meant.

612
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,800
Actually, I've been thinking about this.

613
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:36,439
Grandmaster told me to leave Wudang.

614
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Perhaps there was a deeper meaning to it.

615
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,040
I should come out to the world

616
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
to become a practitioner

617
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,360
and find out what I'm capable of.

618
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,719
My departure

619
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,480
will also let my family return

620
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,719
to their peaceful lives.

621
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
I'm off.

622
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,679
Just like that?

623
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:20,360
Ms. Bao.

624
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,040
Do you still have cucumbers? I want one.

625
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:27,760
SOUVENIR OF OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST

626
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,760
LYU LIANG

627
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,360
It's me.

628
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,040
You really dare to show up.

629
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,399
Aren't you afraid I'd kill you?

630
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,080
What's so funny?

631
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,800
If you want to kill me,

632
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,159
do it now.

633
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,239
Tons of people want me dead.

634
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:10,520
Dying in your hands

635
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,880
is my best option.

636
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,319
Why?

637
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,319
You can't do it?

638
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,480
It's because we're the same kind, am I wrong?

639
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,520
Who says we're the same kind?

640
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
You tricked me.

641
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,120
I know the secret of the Eight Supremes.

642
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,360
Zhang Chulan, this is my only way…

643
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:32,799
Darn it.

644
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,319
What are you staring at? I'm not that shameless, okay?

645
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,839
I sneaked out to meet a scum like you.

646
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,199
I obviously had to come prepared.

647
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,639
You haven't changed.

648
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,719
This is an important memory that belongs to your grandfather and me.

649
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:48,639
It holds the truth behind the Jiashen Calamity.

650
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,920
But I'm the only one who can open it.

651
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,920
I'm giving it to you.

652
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,279
Not because I trust you,

653
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,799
but because you'll come and find me.

654
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,880
-What just happened? -No time to explain.

655
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,799
Go! Now!

656
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,839
-Split up. -Alright.

657
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,000
Sinister Pleasure is gone.

658
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,360
All I can do is hide.

659
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,560
I don't have the power to carry on finding the truth.

660
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,120
This day will eventually come.

661
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,920
I have no choice but to return to that place.

662
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,880
Zhang Chulan.

663
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,440
I have marked all the memories

664
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,279
that are related to you.

665
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,000
I hope we can meet again.

666
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,960
You are probably the only one who can help me.

667
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,040
What's the matter?

668
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,240
Do you still want to run?

669
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,600
Long time no see,

670
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,520
Lyu Gong.

671
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,360
If you missed me,

672
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,759
you could just call me.

673
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
I've missed you too.

674
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,960
It has been years since I've gone back.

675
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,759
So come with me to meet Grandpa tonight.

676
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,120
Sure.

677
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:09,680
It has been years.

678
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,799
I hope he is still in good health.

679
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,440
What did you do?

680
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,720
Enough.

681
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,640
Old Master wants him alive.

682
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,480
Did you think
