1
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,279
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:31,639
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,920
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,879
Well,

5
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,199
shall we do this?

6
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,080
Wang Ye!

7
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,399
Are you trying to escape?

8
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:23,960
Don't follow me. Let's part ways.

9
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,920
Go 2 km south, 500 m east, and 1 km north.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,640
Past the bridge and market, there's a park.

11
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,640
Let's meet there.

12
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,920
-What was that? -What was that?

13
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:34,119
Go!

14
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,360
Qian, diversion.

15
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,720
Stop gawking. Give chase!

16
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,120
Stop running, Ms. Bao.

17
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,280
We got rid of them.

18
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,280
By the way, where did Wang Ye say to meet?

19
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,480
You guys are so slow.

20
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,600
Are we?

21
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,640
It's not that easy to get rid of us.

22
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,760
Are you going to run again?

23
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,799
No.

24
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,119
I can't run anymore.

25
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,560
You're so arrogant.

26
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,000
Are you going to do this in public?

27
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,119
I don't mind.

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,480
Nobody knows who we are anyway.

29
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,880
I didn't expect

30
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,320
that the third son of Wang Weiguo of Zhonghai Group

31
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:01,200
would be a sorcerer.

32
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,440
Tell me.

33
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:05,959
Why are you after me?

34
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,160
To challenge you.

35
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,560
Okay.

36
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,159
Distribution.

37
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,680
Is this

38
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,560
Marquis's Qimen?

39
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm afraid that I have no time for tea.

40
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
Let's attack together!

41
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,960
No problem.

42
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,919
Let's end this quickly.

43
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,520
Taiyuan.

44
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,640
Yunmen.

45
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,440
Jiuwei.

46
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,039
Well, I guess that's enough.

47
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:53,800
Shall we talk?

48
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,080
No.

49
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,960
From now on, we'll take you seriously.

50
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,359
LI

51
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,960
Li, Flaming Star!

52
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,120
We can fight

53
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,560
but don't damage public property.

54
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,640
We can afford to repair it!

55
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,320
REST

56
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,159
DEATH

57
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:41,880
Eight Doors.

58
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,159
Move!

59
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,919
They're doing this for real now.

60
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,440
Tai Chi.

61
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,680
Entangle.

62
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,359
Stick.

63
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,000
Extract.

64
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,120
Sanjin.

65
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,919
One uses Earth Pillar Bagua,

66
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,760
while the other uses Human Pillar Eight Doors.

67
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,719
Bengjin.

68
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,440
Move. Block.

69
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,840
Knock!

70
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,200
Eight Divine Forces.

71
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,479
Six Matches.

72
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,280
These three people.

73
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,520
Judging from their skills,

74
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,120
within their pillars,

75
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,320
each of them is around Zhuge Qing's level.

76
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,960
Grandpa, your grandson is calling you!

77
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,320
ZHUGE FOX

78
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,679
-Hello? -Hello, Wang Ye.

79
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,919
How dare you!

80
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,320
-I wanted to call you -Look, it's Zhuge Qing!

81
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,640
to inform you about something.

82
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:26,679
What's with your tone?

83
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,960
What do you think?

84
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,039
I just got off the plane.

85
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,960
I'll meet you later.

86
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,159
Me?

87
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:33,280
-Hi, Qingqing! -I have a question for you.

88
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,799
What is it?

89
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,840
I didn't expect that you

90
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,120
would resort to this kind of trick.

91
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:41,480
You met those three fools, didn't you?

92
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,199
Great. Please help me.

93
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,079
Teach those three fools

94
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,280
a good lesson.

95
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,240
A gift from us. It's good for your skin.

96
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,560
Thank you.

97
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,720
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

98
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,680
I've been asked to do this.

99
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,079
I have no choice.

100
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,360
Shall we continue?

101
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,600
Didn't he say

102
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,480
that we need to go 3 km east

103
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,120
and then 3 km west?

104
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,480
Go 3 km north first, then go 3 km west.

105
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,880
-Go west, then go north. -Go north, then go west.

106
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,680
-First, go west. -Go north first! It's north first.

107
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
-Go east first. Yes! -That's right!

108
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:37,280
-Go east first. Then go west. -Yes.

109
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,000
-Follow my lead! -Okay.

110
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,680
JINDINGXUAN

111
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,280
THE THREE GREAT ZHUGE MASTERS ARE PUNISHED BY NDT EXPRESS

112
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,800
FOR USING THEIR SUPERPOWERS ILLEGALLY

113
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,319
AND DAMAGING PUBLIC AMENITIES.

114
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,800
THE ZHUGE SIBLINGS HAVE APOLOGIZED AND COMPENSATED FOR THE DAMAGES.

115
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,520
After the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

116
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,839
I returned to my hometown.

117
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,880
To be honest, my clan's elders

118
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,800
didn't blame me for losing to you.

119
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,079
On the other hand, the youngsters were so elated,

120
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,120
especially these three.

121
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,800
Am I right?

122
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,079
"Gosh, look at you now, Zhuge Qing."

123
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,959
They threw a tantrum.

124
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,800
They wanted to meet Taoist Wang, who defeated me, in person.

125
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,640
Didn't you say

126
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,199
that you couldn't fathom why I lost?

127
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,079
Do you understand now?

128
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,640
Yes.

129
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,880
It's all nonsense.

130
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,959
So the three of you picked a fight with me

131
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,839
just to test my capability, did you?

132
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,280
By the way,

133
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,280
how did you locate me?

134
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,640
That was really easy.

135
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
The son of Zhonghai Group's president became a monk.

136
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,680
At the time, it was considered breaking news.

137
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,520
You three are lucky.

138
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,680
Taoist Wang only made it into the top eight.

139
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,720
-Top eight? -Top eight?

140
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,480
He's so incredible, yet he's only in the top eight.

141
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,880
If that's the case,

142
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,360
is Zhang Chulan even more powerful?

143
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,520
You may eat first.

144
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,640
I'm heading out for a walk.

145
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,839
What's the matter with you?

146
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,839
You seem different

147
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,680
from when you were on the mountain.

148
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,640
You seem rather tense.

149
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,880
When you were at Mount Longhu,

150
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,800
you were so relaxed.

151
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
I…

152
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,480
What's with the shades?

153
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,480
Cameras are everywhere.

154
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,600
There's no need to worry.

155
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:32,839
Give me your hand.

156
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:40,839
Let me read your palm.

157
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,520
Taoist Wang,

158
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,000
your ophryon is dark.

159
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,000
It shows that you're in deep trouble.

160
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:52,560
I shall give you some advice.

161
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,480
Ophryon?

162
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,400
Aren't you observing my palm?

163
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,240
Actually,

164
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,880
after I lost to you at Mount Longhu,

165
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,400
I was thrown off balance.

166
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,760
It wasn't until I left the mountain and heard the rumors that I knew

167
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,760
that the skill you used was one of the Eight Supremes,

168
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:17,680
Qimen Manipulation.

169
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,600
And I know

170
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,839
people would do anything to obtain the Eight Supremes,

171
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,319
without thinking of the consequences.

172
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,439
I suppose when the Eight Supremes were introduced

173
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,880
back in the Year of Jiashen,

174
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,199
it was just as chaotic.

175
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
How about you?

176
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,199
Me?

177
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:41,319
I want to get it too.

178
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,079
Although I already have Marquis's Qimen,

179
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,360
I still want more.

180
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,040
Whenever I have this thought,

181
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,680
I feel ashamed.

182
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,959
Even though I truly want it,

183
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,480
I won't act on it.

184
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,000
I won't even accept it if offered.

185
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,319
That's because

186
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,240
I'm the kind of person

187
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:05,680
who is noble and righteous.

188
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,719
I don't think so.

189
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:12,839
Most importantly,

190
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,319
I don't want to end up

191
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,760
like you and Zhang Chulan,

192
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,959
targeted by everyone.

193
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,880
I heard that Sinister Pleasure had caught him a few times.

194
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,520
That's right.

195
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,079
I'm indeed a bit bothered.

196
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:29,880
The current situation…

197
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,719
How should I put it?

198
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,640
I think I overestimated myself before.

199
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,480
Recently, I've been followed.

200
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,520
My family is being targeted too.

201
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,079
However, my family knows nothing.

202
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,480
Well,

203
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,959
if you had given in and let me hit you with Tai Chi,

204
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,319
all this wouldn't have happened.

205
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,240
Are you blaming me now?

206
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:55,360
I won't take the blame.

207
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,680
That's right.

208
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,120
I did promise,

209
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,360
that I'll help you when you're in trouble.

210
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:07,839
But this time, it's beyond my capability.

211
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,400
I know someone who can help you.

212
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,319
I get it. This is your dad's friend.

213
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,439
This is your mom's friend.

214
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,439
They're Outsiders.

215
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,280
Some Outsiders might be targeting your brother's family,

216
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,280
so you asked me over

217
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,280
to investigate the mastermind behind it, right?

218
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:24,800
Well, this is no easy feat.

219
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,839
You're so dumb. It's just a simple case.

220
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,120
Even I know what to do.

221
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,560
Ms. Bao,

222
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,479
are you having another flash of quick wit?

223
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,920
I've come up with nothing night after night.

224
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,040
Do you have a solution?

225
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,880
Don't say that I should bury all of them.

226
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,680
Are you dumb?

227
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,680
Just give them whatever they want.

228
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,120
You're right, Ms. Bao.

229
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,880
Taoist Wang, to monks like you,

230
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:52,079
aside from your own life, nothing else matters, right?

231
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,280
Just give them whatever they want.

232
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,439
How about this?

233
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,400
Give your Qimen Manipulation to me.

234
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,240
After all, they already want my Qi Apotheosis.

235
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:01,120
Having Qimen Manipulation too won't do any extra harm.

236
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,120
Zhang Chulan,

237
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,719
why don't you give your Qi Apotheosis

238
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
to those who want it?

239
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,199
I wish I could do so.

240
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,760
But I don't know how to do it.

241
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,599
Otherwise, I would have given it to them by now.

242
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,240
The more people master it, the safer I am.

243
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:15,439
I can't hand the skill over to them yet

244
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,319
or the Jiashen Calamity will repeat itself.

245
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,040
The world would be in even more chaos.

246
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,959
I have to carry this burden on my own.

247
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,719
Besides, I made a promise to Master Hong.

248
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,680
Who is Master Hong?

249
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,479
Did he teach you Qimen Manipulation? Where is he?

250
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,839
Instead of saying that he taught me,

251
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,760
I would say that he inspired me.

252
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,040
Master Hong is no longer around.

253
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,800
That's complicated, then.

254
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,719
If so, we can only sit this out.

255
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,760
As you said, you can protect yourself.

256
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,079
You can hire Outsiders to protect your family.

257
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,560
I'll source them from the company for you.

258
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
Our service is good and affordable.

259
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:49,400
I don't trust others.

260
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,319
Besides…

261
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,160
I have a suitable candidate.

262
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,599
It can't be me, right?

263
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,439
Why are you looking at me? I have other tasks.

264
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,199
Other tasks?

265
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,120
To stake me out?

266
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,280
Actually,

267
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,040
you're the most suitable one to do this.

268
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,719
Zhang Chulan,

269
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,959
you're from the company.

270
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,199
You've been kidnapped before.

271
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
You handled stalkers like them previously.

272
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,079
Moreover, you're right here.

273
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,760
What are the odds?

274
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,280
Zhang Chulan.

275
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,240
Don't you want to know who is targeting Wang Ye

276
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:34,800
and coveting Qimen Manipulation?

277
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:39,040
If I'm not wrong,

278
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,199
you're here because of Qimen Manipulation, right?

279
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,560
Just see it as doing a friend a favor.

280
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,000
We won't make you do this for free, right?

281
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,880
Of course. Name your price.

282
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:53,880
My rates are expensive.

283
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:54,880
No worries.

284
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,040
I'm loaded.

285
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,199
One hundred million.

286
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:03,120
It's a deal.

287
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,079
We're friends, so let's make things clear.

288
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,639
I'll send the contract to you tonight

289
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,079
and wire you the deposit tomorrow.

290
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:10,159
Is that fine?

291
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,359
Sure.

292
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,520
I'll make the preparations.

293
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:23,919
90 HOURS UNTIL THE MASTERMIND IS FOUND

294
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,280
Ms. Bao, you're too bold.

295
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,800
How could you name a price like that?

296
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,000
Was it too little?

297
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,320
Little?

298
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:35,720
I stuck a finger out for 10,000.

299
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,639
Yet, you asked for 100 million without thinking.

300
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,919
I'll explain it to him, then.

301
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,280
We must be honest.

302
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,560
We should keep our word.

303
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:44,480
Well,

304
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,280
one hundred million it is.

305
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,480
We'll slightly be at a loss.

306
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,240
Wang Ye must know something about the Jiashen Calamity.

307
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,680
We have to test him out.

308
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,639
-I have a big watermelon. -I have a big watermelon.

309
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,000
-It's so round. -It's so round.

310
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,960
-I cut it once. -I cut it once.

311
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,919
-And I cut it again. -And I cut it again.

312
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,720
-Half for you. -Half for you.

313
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,480
-Half for me. -Half for me.

314
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,040
Serve it on the table.

315
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,960
Serve it

316
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,200
on the table.

317
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,000
Son,

318
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:29,879
is this the authentic Tai Chi

319
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,200
that you learned on the mountain?

320
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,120
Yes.

321
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,440
I find it rather unreliable.

322
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,720
I won't do it.

323
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,679
I'm not doing this.

324
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,679
Dad,

325
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,560
you just need to cut watermelon like this every day.

326
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:43,560
It's more effective than taking kangaroo essence

327
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:44,760
or tiger bone wine.

328
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,040
Son, you've been quite obedient since your return.

329
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,080
Tell me. What do you want?

330
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,040
Dad, I have an emergency,

331
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,480
and I need some money.

332
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,560
How much do you need?

333
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,960
One…

334
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,800
Son, you scared me.

335
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:16,000
Come on, Dad.

336
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,399
It has been years.

337
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,480
It's my first time asking you for money.

338
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,240
Just join the company, then.

339
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,679
All of the company assets will be yours.

340
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,360
You can have some pocket money,

341
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,560
but I won't give you

342
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,639
this money.

343
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,840
Never mind.

344
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,040
I didn't mean it.

345
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:35,560
By the way, Dad,

346
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:37,120
I'll be going out later.

347
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,679
I won't come back tonight.

348
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,240
Where are you going again?

349
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,760
I'm going

350
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,399
to Baiyun Temple.

351
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,399
Just now,

352
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,159
I suddenly recalled that I haven't seen my seniors there

353
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,639
for a long time.

354
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,120
I miss them so much.

355
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,159
I want to visit some elders there too.

356
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,360
When I was at Mount Wudang,

357
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,280
they greatly encouraged me.

358
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,520
I must visit them today

359
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,679
and chat with them.

360
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,200
-Seniors! -Stop!

361
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,520
It's just a little money!

362
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,240
Dad,

363
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,639
you will have to give me more.

364
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,679
All these years on the mountain,

365
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,040
I had a poor and simple life.

366
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,320
Fine.

367
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:31,720
I'll wire a few million to you first.

368
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,840
I'll wire the rest to you in a few days.

369
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,800
I won't ask what you're going to do

370
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:37,800
with the money

371
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:40,440
even if you use it for clubs

372
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,440
and pubs,

373
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,720
or even waste all of it.

374
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,480
But you must promise me one thing.

375
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:49,760
Please go on.

376
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,560
You mustn't go to temples anymore!

377
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,520
-How much is this? -Five yuan.

378
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,639
You received a payment on Alipay

379
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,080
for two million yuan.

380
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,080
Is selling sweet potatoes that profitable?

381
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,200
It's my ringtone.

382
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,320
Wang Ye, the money…

383
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,399
Boss Ye, we have received the payment.

384
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,280
Don't worry, we have started to work.

385
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,520
Ms. Bao,

386
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,840
doesn't the company have portable equipment?

387
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:52,080
It has all been taken.

388
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,919
You need to pay.

389
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,399
A sweet potato is only worth a few yuan.

390
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,439
We now have two million.

391
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,679
We need to find something for Boss Ye.

392
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,919
Did you find anything?

393
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,800
Have a look.

394
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:25,120
The person on Mrs. Wang's left is an Outsider.

395
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:27,240
The person in the second last row

396
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,240
is also an Outsider.

397
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,600
The one leading the dance

398
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:31,879
is also an Outsider.

399
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,159
72 HOURS UNTIL THE MASTERMIND IS FOUND

400
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:00,760
Wang Ye is already troublesome enough.

401
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,040
Now, there's Zhuge Qing.

402
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,840
We're doomed.

403
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,720
It could be simpler.

404
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,879
You can go to Zhuge Qing.

405
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,080
He knows Enhance Hearing.

406
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,399
How much money would we have to share with him?

407
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:14,760
After this job,

408
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,240
I need to buy something from the leader of Beggars' Gang.

409
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
What are you waiting for? Give chase!

410
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,080
By the way, it has been three days.

411
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,840
Has Zhang Chulan contacted you?

412
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,919
Not yet.

413
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,800
By the way,

414
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:47,399
your job is done here, right?

415
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,960
Why are you still here?

416
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
We are friends, aren't we?

417
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,520
At times like this,

418
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,120
the more help you get, the better.

419
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,280
Or do you think

420
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,240
that I'm not skillful enough

421
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,399
and will hold you back?

422
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,040
You just find this enjoyable

423
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,720
because it happens once in a blue moon.

424
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,120
So you're here to join the fun.

425
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
I'm not that horrible.

426
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:21,240
Actually,

427
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,840
I've been thinking.

428
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,960
Did Zhang Chulan

429
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,120
run away with the money?

430
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,480
I think you should call him.

431
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,720
Perhaps

432
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,439
he's already in another city now.

433
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,879
I don't think he's such a person.

434
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,639
LIAN

435
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,679
Who says that I'm not in the Capital?

436
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,320
How's that?

437
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,720
I'll do my job if I get paid.

438
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,280
How's your progress?

439
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:58,120
Everything is going smoothly.

440
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,879
We've identified 11 individuals.

441
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,120
Also,

442
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,919
please part ways

443
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,360
and walk around the area.

444
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
I'll have a look.

445
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,960
He's so fair.

446
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,560
How is it?

447
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:46,360
The view is great, isn't it?

448
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:49,000
-It's clear. -Here's the invoice.

449
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,040
Didn't I give you a deposit?

450
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,320
That is called a labor fee.

451
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,600
This is for additional charges.

452
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Hold on.

453
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,960
Twenty catty of sweet potatoes, 120 yuan.

454
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,199
What is this?

455
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,000
We have leftovers. Do you want some?

456
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:12,320
Listen, there are 11 Outsiders in total.

457
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:14,280
They have different roles to get close to your parents,

458
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,480
your brother, and his family.

459
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,080
But actually, they're in the same gang.

460
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,080
There are three people in that building.

461
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,120
Two men and one woman.

462
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:22,120
They eat separately,

463
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,960
ordering eight food deliveries daily.

464
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,560
Two people share the bedroom. One gets the couch.

465
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:26,879
The woman showers at 8 a.m.

466
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,800
One man showers at 10 p.m.

467
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,360
The man in the living room is the worst.

468
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:31,280
He hasn't showered at all.

469
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,800
And he doesn't go to sleep until 3 a.m.

470
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:36,240
However, the woman wakes up at 6:30 a.m.

471
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,840
Hence, our operation time is from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.

472
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:45,439
You make a good point.

473
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,360
So what should we do now?

474
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,679
Well, our team

475
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,679
is to be led by Ms. Bao.

476
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,800
We must listen to her orders like slaves.

477
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,120
It's still early.

478
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,560
Let's play eight rounds of mahjong.

479
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:03,840
We'll take action at 3:30 a.m.

480
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,240
I agree.

481
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,199
Come on.

482
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,040
8 HOURS UNTIL THE MASTERMIND IS FOUND

483
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:27,120
Two Bamboos. Two Dots. One Dot.

484
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:33,679
Five Dots.

485
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,120
Wang Ye, draw your tile.

486
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,080
Self-draw win!

487
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,120
Pure suit hand with four kongs.

488
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,320
I don't need my receipts reimbursed now.

489
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,439
Let's get to work.

490
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,760
ACTION

491
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,159
The three of you.

492
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,840
From now on, you have to keep quiet.

493
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:18,120
Take the masks off.

494
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,199
I'll do it.

495
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:05,240
It's not locked.

496
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,439
He's asleep.

497
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,240
You, you, and you,

498
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,159
handle him.

499
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,360
Got it.

500
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:22,399
I'll enter the room

501
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
and handle the other one.

502
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,399
All right.

503
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:19,520
To knock someone out,

504
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,399
just hit the right spot with the right force.

505
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,959
You don't have to tear the place down.

506
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,800
You had better not try to run away.

507
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,480
Don't just tape their mouths.

508
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,159
You need to make sure to stuff their mouths

509
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,919
to restrain their tongue movement.

510
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,199
If you just tape their mouths, they can still speak.

511
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:53,520
NDT Express is a legitimate company,

512
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
right?

513
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:56,800
Don't mind the details.

514
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,600
I've been waiting so long to do this.

515
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,480
Stuff their mouths before you tape them.

516
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,879
Ensure that the stuffing will not be pushed out by the tongue.

517
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:12,919
What is this for?

518
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,000
WANG WEIGUO

519
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,800
LIU CHUNHUA

520
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,560
Answer me.

521
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:27,480
Why are my parents' photos up there?

522
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,120
I had to figure out your mom's interests

523
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:30,199
in order to befriend her.

524
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,360
Zhang Chulan.

525
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:37,879
Please.

526
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,760
I'll pay you any amount.

527
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,720
Please handle these people for me.

528
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,120
I will do anything as long as I get paid.

529
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,840
However, there's a tiny problem now.

530
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:53,199
How will we move these people outside?

531
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:59,600
We can't guard them till the morning, right?

532
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,959
Even if we put each of them into a sack,

533
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:05,480
we'll be exposed if they move.

534
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:09,120
Idiot, stop moving.

535
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,959
You're no better than him.

536
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,080
You three idiots,

537
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:14,199
get out of here now.

538
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,320
Wait for me in the car.

539
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,199
Don't worry.

540
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,520
I've sent their phone numbers and personal details

541
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,840
to the company.

542
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,240
The company will soon check their recent financial status

543
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,439
and call history.

544
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,240
Wang Ye,

545
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,240
we'll surely find something.

546
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,600
Here she comes.

547
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,280
Ma'am, two savory crepes.

548
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,919
What is inside the boxes?

549
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,679
Goods.

550
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:30,320
Please add more.

551
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,959
Sir,

552
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,000
this is for you.

553
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,399
She's fearless, isn't she?

554
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,399
She must be a habitual offender.

555
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:53,520
All right. Their superpowers are sealed.

556
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,840
Wang Ye, there are 11 of them.

557
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:58,600
You need to hire a cleaner.

558
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,240
You said there are 11.

559
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,760
Where are the remaining eight?

560
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,919
The three stalkers are here.

561
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,319
Ms. Bao, keep watch here.

562
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,880
The three of us will climb up there.

563
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,839
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.

564
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,600
Wang Ye,

565
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,279
there's no need

566
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,319
to waste energy.

567
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,799
Why didn't you guys tell me sooner?

568
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,679
Wang Ye, I can't do this anymore.

569
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,040
I'm a bit dizzy.

570
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,279
Can't you produce fire?

571
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,960
Start a fire and force them to come down.

572
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,880
That won't do.

573
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,040
I think it's doable.

574
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,520
I'll do it. Li.

575
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,160
People will notice if we make a scene.

576
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,160
Fireball!

577
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:18,839
Zhuge Qing,

578
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,560
your little fire snake

579
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
was quite fast.

580
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,360
Who are you calling little?

581
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,520
Is your body unable to handle those few steps?

582
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:51,240
What could it be?

583
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:52,520
You're making such a big fuss.

584
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,240
Watch…

585
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,400
It's indeed a problem.

586
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,680
Someone extracted the oxygen here with their superpower.

587
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,240
What should we do, then? We've only gone a few stories.

588
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:09,160
How many are left?

589
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,120
Ten total.

590
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,240
We still have seven stories left.

591
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,600
What should we do?

592
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,600
Well, what else?

593
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,640
Do this in one breath.

594
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,960
We lost them.

595
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,160
We haven't seen Wang Ye for days.

596
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,200
Do you think he left the Capital?

597
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,640
You managed to pass through the anaerobic zone that I created.

598
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,799
Xun,

599
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,640
Wind Reflection!

600
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,560
Wang Ye, don't worry about us.

601
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,480
We can handle this.

602
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,720
Don't let him escape.

603
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:16,759
It's okay.

604
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:17,880
It's one-on-one.

605
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,880
We can always run

606
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,279
and let Ms. Bao clean up for us.

607
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:21,319
All right.

608
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,440
Boulder Toss!

609
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:35,279
Xun, Wind Rope!

610
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,880
Aren't you here to capture me?

611
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,720
If you stay so far away from me,

612
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:33,080
you won't be able to get me.

613
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,960
Speak.

614
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,080
Who sent you here?

615
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,319
I'll tell you.
