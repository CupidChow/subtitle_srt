1
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,080
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:32,680
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,120
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,720
Die, all of you!

5
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,599
Ms. Bao.

6
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,320
Why didn't you dodge it?

7
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,360
You told me to stand here.

8
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,240
See?

9
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,520
I didn't move.

10
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,160
The bleeding isn't stopping.

11
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,679
Ms. Bao, I am so sorry.

12
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,399
Ms. Bao!

13
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,800
Wake up!

14
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,559
Open your eyes, Ms. Bao!

15
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:58,679
I…

16
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,960
I won't run away again.

17
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:02,440
I'll…

18
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,720
I'll be your obedient servant from now on.

19
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,640
That wiped your smirk away.

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,359
Now you've witnessed the might

21
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,079
of my Dragon-Piercing Awl.

22
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,920
I must have lost my mind

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,680
expecting anything from a scoundrel who ambushes a girl

24
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,519
who has lost the will to fight!

25
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,920
Chulan,

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,880
let me see.

27
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,079
Xingtong, come here.

28
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:50,600
Dad, let me handle it.

29
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,840
What are you doing?

30
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,600
Chulan, don't worry.

31
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:05,400
This is Dispatch of Detained Spirits, our family heirloom.

32
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,880
The primordial spirit that we detain

33
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,840
will grant us some of the power they had

34
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,239
when they were alive.

35
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,160
The spirit I summoned

36
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:20,640
is the healer

37
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,280
known as one of the Nine Great Savants,

38
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,640
Mr. Wang Zizhong.

39
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,600
When he was alive,

40
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,160
he was a miraculous healer.

41
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,040
Her liver has been pierced.

42
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,399
Her qi can't be balanced.

43
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,320
Chairman Feng.

44
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,959
Had I stepped in in time,

45
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,959
none of this would've happened.

46
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,000
Move aside.

47
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,720
Have you lost your mind?

48
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:50,760
She could die!

49
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,200
Don't worry.

50
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,160
Her life is our responsibility.

51
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,720
Zhang Chulan,

52
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,560
is this how you protected Baobao?

53
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,079
Xu San, give me a hand.

54
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,119
When did Baobao become so heavy?

55
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,200
By the way, Chairman Feng,

56
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,519
regarding the incident that took place here today,

57
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,159
NDT Express will punish those responsible.

58
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,800
We will pay for the damage

59
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,479
inflicted on your staff and property.

60
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,560
Chairman Feng, so…

61
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,479
Don't worry.

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,800
I will give NDT Express an explanation.

63
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,880
Can you please drive faster?

64
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,120
The guy from the Feng family provided first aid.

65
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,039
Calm down a little.

66
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,919
A PLACE TO EAT

67
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,240
I like that restaurant.

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,599
We can get some food there later.

69
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,960
This is not the way to the hospital.

70
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,880
Their salt-fried meat with potatoes

71
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,280
pairs well with rice.

72
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,159
And the sautéed guts smell amazing.

73
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,640
Have you lost your mind?

74
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:15,960
Head to the hospital!

75
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:18,000
We should first send them back.

76
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
Chulan?

77
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,280
I told you to wait inside the room.

78
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,520
Why did you come out?

79
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,440
This is your last meal.

80
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,479
Have something decent.

81
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,599
Xu San and I

82
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,400
bought your favorite food for you.

83
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,880
While you're still breathing,

84
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,440
enjoy the tasty smell of it.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,599
If you have anything to tell her,

86
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,800
you should do so now.

87
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,599
Ms. Bao.

88
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know if you can hear me,

89
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,599
but I have to tell you.

90
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,479
You apologized to me,

91
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,800
but I still owe you an apology.

92
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,880
Over the years, aside from my grandfather,

93
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,719
no one has treated me like you did.

94
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:10,359
You risked your life to keep me safe.

95
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,320
Ms. Bao,

96
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,520
you gave me

97
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:16,560
the warmth of a family that I never had.

98
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,039
I stubbornly argued with you not long ago.

99
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,159
I regret it now.

100
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,719
Chulan.

101
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,359
What is your plan

102
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,880
for after her passing?

103
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,520
Ms. Bao wants me to go to Mount Longhu.

104
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,440
So that is where I will go.

105
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,880
She wants me to join the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

106
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,840
I will do what she wants

107
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,799
and win Tianshidu.

108
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,880
So stop whining and start training.

109
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Ms. Bao. What's going on?

110
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,680
I took a nap. I woke up because I was hungry.

111
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,479
Xu Si said you were dying!

112
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,400
What is going on?

113
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:20,520
We're not very sure either.

114
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:22,479
But Baobao has a powerful self-healing ability.

115
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,159
I stopped the Feng boy from healing her

116
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:25,640
so her secret wouldn't be exposed.

117
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,680
You lied to me in the car!

118
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,159
You don't get so sad very often.

119
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,599
We couldn't bear to interrupt you.

120
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,359
I had to pinch my leg to hold my laughter.

121
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,799
Zhang Chulan, I recorded everything.

122
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,680
Go to Mount Longhu

123
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,960
and be the champion.

124
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,239
Win Tianshidu.

125
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:43,960
Tie this to your legs.

126
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,239
We'll continue our training today.

127
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,719
We're patrolling the mountainside.

128
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,919
If you ever complain,

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,479
I'll teach you a lesson.

130
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,400
Did you buy all these for me?

131
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,680
Yes, these are all yours.

132
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,200
Ms. Bao.

133
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,840
Simmered snow fungus.

134
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,440
This should bolster your qi.

135
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,280
Ms. Bao, I…

136
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,440
I can't…

137
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,520
I can't run anymore, Ms. Bao!

138
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,560
What did you say?

139
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,880
Is it too slow?

140
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,799
Okay!

141
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,919
19 DAYS UNTIL THE OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST

142
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,800
13 DAYS TO GO

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,240
12 DAYS TO GO

144
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,760
10 DAYS TO GO

145
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,920
7 DAYS UNTIL THE OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST

146
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,600
Lamp,

147
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,280
turn on the lights.

148
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Master Lu.

149
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,560
Master Fang.

150
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,120
Master Hong asked me

151
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:35,640
to relay a message to you.

152
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,120
He went ahead of you.

153
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,640
You need not be sad about his passing.

154
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:21,160
I know the whole truth now.

155
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,800
What should I do?

156
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Don't touch it!

157
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,400
Remember to stop the man I was.

158
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,000
Do not let him find out the truth.

159
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:04,400
It seems I have no choice

160
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,040
but to visit Mount Longhu myself.

161
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,880
MOUNT LONGHU

162
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,680
Lingyu, are you awake?

163
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,560
What is it?

164
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,800
Grandmaster asked for you.

165
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Just yesterday,

166
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,400
Mr. Lu and Grandmaster were on the phone.

167
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,079
He took a flight to Mount Longhu to show his support overnight.

168
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,439
He supposedly brought a special guest with him.

169
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,640
-A guest? -Yes.

170
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,360
The guest came specially for you.

171
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,560
For me?

172
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,800
Mr. Lu.

173
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,199
LU JIN

174
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,560
Lingyu.

175
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,520
-Come out! -Stop it.

176
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:06,959
You kept saying you wanted

177
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,599
to meet Spirit Master Lingyu.

178
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,880
Now that we are here,

179
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:10,800
why are you hiding?

180
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,640
Lingyu, I must apologize

181
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,199
for spoiling my granddaughter rotten.

182
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,800
Don't mind her.

183
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,560
Lingyu,

184
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:23,280
I was told you've been training meticulously

185
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,839
in preparation for the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

186
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,560
I am not interested in Tianshidu.

187
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,480
I just don't want to bring shame to my master.

188
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,040
Linglong,

189
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,079
this is your first time here.

190
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,560
When I was a young man,

191
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,240
I was a regular guest on this mountain.

192
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,760
It has been ages since I last came here.

193
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,560
I've grown old myself.

194
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,480
I'm afraid I'm running out of time to be here.

195
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,959
You're not old. You're only a little over a century old.

196
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,160
Mr. Lu,

197
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,760
the contest is three days from now.

198
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:51,880
You summoned the elders

199
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,800
when the contest is just around the corner.

200
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,839
Privately, they have

201
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,319
some doubts and objections.

202
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,079
Fear not.

203
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,560
I have my own reason

204
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,800
for bringing them here.

205
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,160
Your master and I are so close.

206
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,400
He wants to announce the Outsider Martial Arts Contest

207
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,199
to the entire Outsiders' world.

208
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,439
I have to help him

209
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,240
accomplish this great undertaking.

210
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,959
Yes.

211
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,160
Yes.

212
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,599
I'm going to see your master.

213
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
Linglong.

214
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,360
Show Linglong around the place.

215
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:30,599
Have a look around.

216
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,079
Don't go, Grandpa!

217
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,760
Spirit Master Lingyu.

218
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,120
Our country has some truly picturesque views.

219
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,880
Let's have a look around the mountain.

220
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:43,120
Sure. Make yourself at home.

221
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,839
I caught a cold.

222
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,880
Are you all right?

223
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,280
We do have an infirmary here.

224
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,920
I'll feel better after some walking.

225
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,839
Actually,

226
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,800
I've had a fever since this morning. My temperature is 39 degrees Celsius.

227
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,120
Is it 39 degrees Celsius?

228
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,959
I'm lightheaded.

229
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,240
Impressive.

230
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,839
Chief Celestial Taoist,

231
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,560
you announced that the heir selection will be an open contest.

232
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,199
Only the Ten Elders can intervene.

233
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,319
In that case,

234
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,479
they can go after your title

235
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,479
and get their hands on Qi Apotheosis.

236
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,280
This allows the stranger Zhang Chulan

237
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
to participate in the Outsider Martial Arts Contest

238
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,079
and compete for a place to inherit the title.

239
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,719
I can understand why they reacted this way.

240
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,560
All these people

241
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,079
covet Qi Apotheosis.

242
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,959
But I don't get it.

243
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,280
If you take Zhang Chulan in,

244
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,160
those old geezers may hate it,

245
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,599
but they won't object.

246
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,280
Why do you insist on putting him

247
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,959
in the contest?

248
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,280
The Jiashen Calamity

249
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,520
left too many enduring complications.

250
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:51,360
Zhang Chulan is the key to it all.

251
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,479
But without some training,

252
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,240
the duty is too heavy for him.

253
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,160
The Jiashen Calamity?

254
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,880
So is this what worries you?

255
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,120
I'll give you a hand.

256
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:04,079
From the hottest fire comes the strongest steel.

257
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,240
Take a seat.

258
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,079
I didn't summon you.

259
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,280
It was Lu Jin who gathered you here.

260
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Take a seat.

261
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:26,400
Master Jiekong, Guan Shihua, and Na Ruhu

262
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,359
couldn't make it.

263
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:29,479
They wanted me to apologize on their behalf.

264
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,400
Very well.

265
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,439
THE TEN ELDERS

266
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,240
A GROUP CONSISTING OF THE MOST RESPECTED OUTSIDERS.

267
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:42,560
WHENEVER THERE ARE CONFLICTS BETWEEN FACTIONS OF OUTSIDERS,

268
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,319
THEY SHALL FACILITATE AND NEGOTIATE TO MAINTAIN PEACE.

269
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,719
Lu Jin,

270
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:49,079
I thought we had settled the details

271
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,680
for the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

272
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,920
What else could warrant a meeting?

273
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,479
The Outsiders' world has this long-standing rule.

274
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,400
For the sake of this contest,

275
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,800
each of you

276
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,720
has sent your most capable apprentice.

277
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,200
I appreciate your effort and thoughts.

278
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,079
But what about me?

279
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:15,000
What have I done?

280
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,359
Unless I make some meaningful contributions

281
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,200
and show my support,

282
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,079
I shall not feel relieved.

283
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,200
ONE OF THE EIGHT SUPREMES

284
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,360
INFINITE HEAVENLY TALISMAN

285
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,520
I'm sure we all know what this is.

286
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,919
Could it be one of the Eight Supremes,

287
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,200
Infinite Heavenly Talisman?

288
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,520
Indeed.

289
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,800
Let's all drop the act.

290
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,600
It's what you're after.

291
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,560
For this Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

292
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:14,320
Infinite Heavenly Talisman

293
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,960
shall be placed here.

294
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,480
I summoned all of you

295
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,360
to inform you

296
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,240
that the winner of this contest

297
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,760
shall be additionally rewarded Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

298
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,639
Lu Jin.

299
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,080
If you offer your Infinite Heavenly Talisman,

300
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:30,040
I fear it would--

301
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,240
Chief Celestial Taoist.

302
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,240
All those years ago, the Mount Longhu sect and the Lu family

303
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,120
chose not to intervene

304
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,120
in the tragedy of the Jiashen Calamity

305
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,520
to save our own necks.

306
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,280
By doing so, we left loose ends that linger to this day.

307
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,520
It's our sin.

308
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,320
We should make amends.

309
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,560
We shall not sit idly by again.

310
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:50,600
The world seeks the Eight Supremes, right?

311
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,960
There's no need to fight.

312
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,919
Take it.

313
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,240
3 DAYS UNTIL THE OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST

314
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,480
HU FAMILY VILLAGE

315
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:08,000
Xia He.

316
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,639
Today is your birthday.

317
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,639
I wish you

318
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,679
a happy birthday.

319
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,280
You are truly gorgeous today.

320
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,440
Xia He.

321
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,760
May you always remain youthful.

322
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,919
You are gorgeous today.

323
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,919
Let's cut the cake.

324
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,360
Blow out the candles.

325
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,879
-Who is it? -Who is it?

326
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,440
SHEN CHONG

327
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,919
Hey.

328
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,679
Honey.

329
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,440
I didn't think you would be the first to get here.

330
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,960
Happy birthday.

331
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,000
Thank you.

332
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,399
This gentleman is Shen Chong.

333
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,919
He runs a loan business.

334
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,639
The elder, Hu Sheng.

335
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,840
HU SHENG

336
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:19,800
The younger, Hu Jie.

337
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:21,120
HU JIE

338
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,679
Nice to meet you.

339
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,919
I came unprepared.

340
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:25,560
A token

341
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:26,960
of my goodwill.

342
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,399
Thank you, Shen Chong.

343
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,879
Appreciated, Shen Chong.

344
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,679
She mentioned you are

345
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,720
in the loan business.

346
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,320
So what types of loans do you give out?

347
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:40,360
Normally,

348
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,919
people make money with mortgage loans.

349
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,840
But if you want to take a loan from me,

350
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,200
you don't need a mortgage.

351
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,520
If you ever need a loan from me,

352
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,760
I'll lend you as much as you need.

353
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,159
What if the borrower runs away?

354
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,399
Run away?

355
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,520
No one ever runs from me!

356
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,919
I can show you how to make even more money.

357
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,440
My money begets more money.

358
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,679
Excuse me. I need to answer this.

359
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,200
Hello?

360
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,200
When the deadline comes, you must pay up.

361
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,600
Calling me doesn't change a thing.

362
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,679
You have two hours!

363
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,560
Why don't you take a look inside the red packets

364
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:35,600
that he gave you?

365
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,159
What is this?

366
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Take a deep breath.

367
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,120
-This is qi! -This is qi!

368
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,120
This is his gift for you.

369
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,800
To think someone actually gives out qi as presents!

370
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:08,320
Did you think the loan business he mentioned

371
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,760
involved any money?

372
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,280
This is impressive.

373
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,679
Xia He.

374
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,120
Let's have some cake.

375
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,320
Blow out the candles.

376
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:30,320
DOU MEI

377
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:32,360
-Hello. -Hello.

378
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:33,919
I would like to talk to Xia He.

379
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,679
Come in.

380
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,679
Xia He.

381
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,120
Dou Mei.

382
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,320
Welcome.

383
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:53,720
Silly lass.

384
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:56,000
Happy birthday.

385
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,280
Thank you.

386
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,320
Dou Mei is a psychiatrist.

387
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:02,120
Her most remarkable skill

388
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,480
is seeing through your heart.

389
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,560
Take a look at my brother. See what he's thinking right now.

390
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,439
Hu Sheng, you're so mean.

391
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Am I?

392
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,280
You prepared a present.

393
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,879
But you're worried Xia He won't like it

394
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,240
and might make fun of you.

395
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,800
What present?

396
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:27,399
Why didn't you show us?

397
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:31,439
Check my brother.

398
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,679
See what he's thinking.

399
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:40,280
You booked a river-view hotel suite

400
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
and want to lure Xia He there.

401
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,720
Ms. Dou Mei, you must have read too many detective novels!

402
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:49,439
You're talking nonsense.

403
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,560
I did read a novel once.

404
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:55,320
It's The Other by Borges.

405
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,600
It's a story about two brothers who fall for the same woman.

406
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,200
Then they have a falling out

407
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,639
and start a fight.

408
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,040
Do you think the elder brother kills the younger brother?

409
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,360
Do you think the elder brother kills the younger brother?

410
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:16,439
Or is it the other way around?

411
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,639
It will never happen between me and Hu Jie.

412
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,720
My brother

413
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,760
has always been an introvert.

414
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,760
But deep down,

415
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,600
he still loves me.

416
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:27,679
Am I right?

417
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:32,320
It's almost time.
Let's begin.

418
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:34,720
What's the hurry?

419
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,919
-Yes. -We can start now.

420
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,200
Come in.

421
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,840
GAO NING

422
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,879
I like the decor.

423
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,480
What took you so long?

424
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,800
It's never too late for the good stuff, right?

425
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,120
Only vegetables?

426
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,080
Where is the meat?

427
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,360
Xia He doesn't like meat.

428
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:00,800
Today is her birthday.

429
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:04,600
Another new friend.

430
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:05,600
Are these the two?

431
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,439
Yes. They're brothers.

432
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,600
Hu Sheng and Hu Jie.

433
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:09,560
Hello.

434
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:10,879
The food has been eaten.

435
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
If you don't mind--

436
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,960
I don't mind.

437
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,040
I'll get us another chair.

438
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,360
Never mind.

439
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:17,399
You and your brother

440
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,840
can share a seat.

441
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:20,919
This is my house.

442
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,879
I get to decide

443
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,360
where each guest sits.

444
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:28,040
Why don't you two fight each other?

445
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
The winner gets the chair.

446
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,159
Are you kidding me?

447
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,520
Had you not been Xia He's friend,

448
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,320
you wouldn't have gotten the chair.

449
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,360
Do I look like I am kidding?

450
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,000
TWELVE BEWITCHMENTS ARRAY

451
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:50,800
You two are brothers, right?

452
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,639
But not everything in this world

453
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,439
comes in two portions.

454
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,360
There is only one chair.

455
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,560
That is all you have.

456
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,240
Look at Xia He.

457
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,879
You both like her,

458
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,560
but there will always only be one of her.

459
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,080
Does it mean

460
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,760
one of you will never win her over?

461
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,360
Hu Jie!

462
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,040
Give me your blessing.

463
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,240
Hu Sheng.

464
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:41,800
I love Xia He just as much. Why should I give you my blessing?

465
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:43,040
Who do you think you are?

466
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:55,399
What is this?

467
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,960
Is this the present

468
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,399
that you prepared for Xia He?

469
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:06,000
This music box doesn't even have a lid.

470
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,919
-I-- -Do you call this a present?

471
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,679
You should be ashamed to give her this!

472
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,040
You should be ashamed!

473
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,720
Hu Jie, listen closely.

474
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,560
You only exist to help me put a smile

475
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:19,480
on Xia He.

476
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:23,560
You should take a look at yourself.

477
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,960
Remember who you're speaking to.

478
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,399
What makes you think you are good enough for her?

479
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,159
-Have you lost your mind? -Come on!

480
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,919
Let's see who will be the winner tonight!

481
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,560
You're not even fit to be my rival!

482
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:43,159
Xia He is mine!

483
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,720
Who do you think you are?

484
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:49,840
Lei Yanpao.

485
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,240
Put an end to it.

486
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,760
Okay.

487
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:04,000
Hu Sheng.

488
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,800
Wake up, Hu Sheng.

489
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:07,080
They are

490
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:08,679
Wine, Lust,

491
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,120
Wealth, and Qi,

492
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,080
the Four Crazies.

493
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,280
THE FOUR CRAZIES

494
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,399
Xia He is mine!

495
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,639
That's enough.

496
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:24,159
This isn't what we agreed on.

497
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,199
But you are the cause of the mess.

498
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,840
Xia He is mine.

499
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,399
Go to hell!

500
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,199
What a shame.

501
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,199
Hu Jie is no match for his brother anyway.

502
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,959
Do you want to borrow some qi from me?

503
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,919
I guarantee you can win this fight.

504
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:47,800
Come on.
CONTRACT

505
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,639
Press your thumb on the contract,

506
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,520
and you'll become so much stronger.

507
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,520
Hu Sheng.

508
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:56,919
Hu Sheng.

509
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:03,679
SHEN CHONG, HU JIE

510
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,879
SOUL-BREAK PALM

511
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,080
Die!

512
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,840
Hu Sheng, calm down!

513
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:30,919
Hu Sheng!

514
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:32,360
Calm down!

515
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,879
Xia He is mine!

516
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,959
You borrowed my qi, so you must pay up.

517
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,959
You can pay with your brother's qi.

518
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,120
Shen Chong.

519
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,240
Don't take it too far.

520
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,760
Xia He is mine!

521
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,840
Xia He is…

522
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,600
I defeated my brother.

523
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,679
I did it!

524
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,199
Hu Sheng.

525
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,240
Hu Sheng, what's wrong?

526
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,399
Hu Sheng?

527
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,000
Hu Sheng?

528
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,560
I killed him.

529
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,760
I killed him.

530
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,480
It was you guys.

531
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,840
It was you guys.

532
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,520
You made me kill him!

533
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,919
Hu Sheng?

534
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Hu Sheng?

535
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,040
Does it hurt,

536
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,000
my child?

537
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:17,879
Even the most heartbreaking pain

538
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,000
will fade with the passage of time.

539
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:24,800
In that case,

540
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,199
why not overcome this pain?

541
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:32,280
It's all right if you can't do it.

542
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,639
I will help you.

543
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,600
At this point,

544
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,439
there's no use thinking about it.

545
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
We will keep this secret for you.

546
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:51,199
From now on,

547
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,879
you are one of us, Sinister Pleasure.

548
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,120
So allow me to introduce myself.

549
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:05,760
You were right about us.

550
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,159
We are Wine, Lust, Wealth, and Qi,

551
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,320
the Four Crazies of Sinister Pleasure.

552
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,760
Dou Mei, the Intoxicator, is Wine.

553
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,560
She can intoxicate you

554
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:16,240
until you forget all of your sorrows and pain.

555
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,879
Xia He, the Bone Scraper.

556
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,679
She can incite all of your desires.

557
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,159
LUST, THE EXHILARATION OF OBSESSION

558
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:24,439
The Source of Malice, Shen Chong.

559
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,399
He is Wealth.
SOURCE OF MALICE

560
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,919
You experienced it just now.

561
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,120
How did it feel to siphon someone else's qi?

562
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,879
As for me, I am Qi.

563
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:36,760
I can amplify your emotions

564
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,240
and render you deranged.

565
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:40,199
Don't worry.

566
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
No other Outsiders will trouble you again

567
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,719
as long as the four of us are here.

568
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,760
You will go to Mount Longhu on your brother's behalf

569
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,399
to join the Outsider Martial Arts Contest

570
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,080
and win Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

571
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,760
No.

572
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,040
You used the qi I lent you

573
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,399
to defeat your brother.

574
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,520
The more qi you absorb,

575
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
the more powerful you become.

576
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,000
By the time you're at Mount Longhu

577
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,719
for the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

578
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,120
all of the Outsiders there will be your quarries.

579
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
You will become

580
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,080
even stronger.

581
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,879
If you present yourself as Hu Sheng,

582
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,480
no one will suspect you.

583
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,360
All right.

584
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,800
The four of us don't get

585
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,199
to gather around very often.

586
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,639
Xia He, get over it.

587
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:30,159
Let us all wish you

588
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,520
a happy birthday.

589
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,120
-Happy birthday to you -Xia He.

590
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:38,840
-Xia He, happy birthday. -Happy birthday to you

591
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:42,040
Happy birthday to Xia He

592
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,600
For me, my birthday

593
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,679
is reliving a dream of the past.

594
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,919
Many years ago, on your birthday,

595
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,560
on the street you liked,

596
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:58,360
the two of us met.

597
00:33:58,959 --> 00:33:59,879
Xia He,

598
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,879
today is your birthday.

599
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,560
Happy birthday.

600
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:25,920
Xia He, happy birthday.
