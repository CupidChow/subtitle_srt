1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,479
Now that Xu Xiang is dead,

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,040
the entire Outsiders' world is in chaos.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,080
Chief Celestial Taoist,

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,000
now that Xu Xiang is dead, Mount Longhu has lost its protector.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,160
But the Outsider Martial Arts Contest isn't over yet.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,240
What if the villains

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,560
of Sinister Pleasure

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,799
take the opportunity to sneak inside?

9
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:29,919
Don't worry.

10
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,800
Although Mr. Xu has met his demise,

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,800
the company has already

12
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,440
dispatched a new person in charge here.

13
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:37,640
A new person in charge?

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,839
Sorry about that, everyone.

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,839
I'm late.

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,960
Say,

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,839
NDT has run out of personnel, hasn't it?

18
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,440
They actually dispatched you two to take over your dad's job?

19
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:49,599
Your dad fell for Sinister Pleasure's trick

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,320
even though he was a veteran.

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,879
This responsibility is too heavy.

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,000
You two can't afford to bear the responsibility.

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,080
I know my brother and I

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,400
are way inferior to our dad.

25
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,239
However, despite our limited strengths,

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,280
we still possess a tiny bit of righteousness.

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,200
However, the world is too vast.

28
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,720
We can't watch over the entire world.

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,360
However, we will never slack off

30
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,520
as long as it's within our abilities.

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,960
My dad worked for NDT for half of his life.

32
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:16,000
He encountered countless dangers.

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,039
Why was he able to persist for so long?

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,880
It's all because of his determination.

35
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,360
We're still young

36
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,600
and lacking in many aspects.

37
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:24,479
However, I can promise you guys this.

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,119
We won't allow any other accidents to happen

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,000
during the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,520
Do you guys have any questions?

41
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,759
In that case, I'll leave this to you two.

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,440
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,119
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

45
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:15,120
Chief Celestial Taoist, I've brought them here.

46
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,959
Chulan,

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,680
pay your respects.

48
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,519
When it comes to seniority,

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,320
this man is considered your grandmaster as well.

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,359
This is Tian Jinzhong.

51
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,840
Back then, me,

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,200
Jinzhong,

53
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,880
and your grandfather, Huaiyi,

54
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,640
were best friends on Mount Longhu.

55
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,880
Grandmaster Tian.

56
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,519
I have to kowtow to you then.

57
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,760
It's my first time being this close to such an embarrassing act.

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,679
I think I know what a boot-licker means now.

59
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,959
This must be Mr. Lu Jin.

60
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,040
I have to kowtow to you too.

61
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,079
No need. Spare the formalities. I don't deserve it.

62
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,239
Don't say that, Mr. Lu.

63
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,920
Of course, you deserve it.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,600
The Outsider Martial Arts Contest wouldn't be this exciting

65
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,720
if you didn't take out Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

66
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,720
Zhiwei. Jinzhong.

67
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,359
This brat is mocking me.

68
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,200
He's pretty daring.

69
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,040
Of course.

70
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,560
I'm his grandmaster, after all.

71
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,079
Fine then.

72
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,880
I guess I landed you in trouble.

73
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,200
Now, I owe you a favor.

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,880
I'll promise you one thing.

75
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,040
I'll fulfill your request

76
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,079
as long as it's not harmful or immoral.

77
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,120
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

78
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,280
By the way,

79
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:35,760
who is this?

80
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,079
She's my colleague in NDT.

81
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,280
She's a contestant as well.

82
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,079
Lu Jin.

83
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,880
Let's get straight to business.

84
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,359
Alright. We interrogated Yu Huadu.

85
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,480
We found out that Hu Jie

86
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,600
was the puppet of the Four Crazies.

87
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,160
Sinister Pleasure manipulated

88
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,200
Yu Huadu's hatred for Xu Xiang

89
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,480
and used him

90
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,959
to kill Xu Xiang.

91
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,920
However, Yu Huadu

92
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,399
has no idea about what Sinister Pleasure is planning.

93
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,080
In your opinion,

94
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,400
why did Sinister Pleasure

95
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,000
make their appearance here?

96
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,599
They certainly wanted to obtain your Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

97
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,479
That is surely one of their targets.

98
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,640
I'm talking about the main target

99
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,159
besides that.

100
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,080
Don't tell me you're saying

101
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,880
that they're targeting me.

102
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,919
No matter if it's you or Infinite Heavenly Talisman,

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,919
both you and the item will act as bait.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,120
As long as sorcerers of Sinister Pleasure take the bait,

105
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,840
we'll capture all of them

106
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:49,960
on Mount Longhu.

107
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:52,919
Chulan,

108
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,440
you've met both of your elders.

109
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,599
Don't worry.

110
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,039
The contest will resume.

111
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:02,240
You should head back and rest.

112
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,039
Baobao.

113
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,840
Chulan,

114
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,280
you may speak.

115
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,719
Grandmaster,

116
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,960
Lyu Ci told me that my grandpa

117
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,960
colluded with sorcerers of Sinister Pleasure.

118
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:19,039
Is that true?

119
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,640
Grandmaster, I know

120
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:22,960
that you're only willing to tell me about it

121
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:23,960
after I win the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

122
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,000
But this incident is too…

123
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,240
Zhiwei.

124
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,440
Look at how desperate you're making him.

125
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,760
I don't know why you're hiding

126
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,240
that stupid incident from him.

127
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,039
I'm not from Celestial Taoist Mansion.

128
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,960
So I don't need to obey your sect rules.

129
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,919
I'll tell him if you don't want to.

130
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,560
You guys, leave the room.

131
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,479
Leave now.

132
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,200
I didn't intervene

133
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,880
in the incident back then.

134
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,359
I don't know about the details.

135
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,560
However, regarding the incident with your grandfather,

136
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,479
it was true.

137
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,280
Your grandfather did collude

138
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,039
with sorcerers of Sinister Pleasure.

139
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,080
It's more than just collusion.

140
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,960
They even became sworn brothers.

141
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,280
Of course, your grandfather wasn't the only member to do so.

142
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:30,479
Back then, there were members from other righteous sects

143
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,760
who took part in the ceremony.

144
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,039
Lian's grandfather was truly a bold person, huh?

145
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,039
Everyone.

146
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,479
You guys are eavesdropping on the grandmasters' conversation

147
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,880
in broad daylight.

148
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,599
Yu, Qing, shut up.

149
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,400
I'll give each of you one sandalwood bracelet later.

150
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,520
Why is there no sound now?

151
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,280
Guys, don't fight back!

152
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:21,520
That's my grandpa's Infinite Heavenly Talisman!

153
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,799
Grandpa, we are sorry!

154
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,039
Please let us off!

155
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,359
You don't need any altar

156
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,479
or utilize your qi, huh?

157
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,640
Lu,

158
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:36,760
you could cast it at will just now.

159
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,719
Have you mastered

160
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,880
Infinite Heavenly Talisman?

161
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,280
Jinzhong, you flatter me.

162
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,960
I haven't mastered it completely.

163
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,039
Chulan,

164
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,840
this is Infinite Heavenly Talisman,

165
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,400
a talisman created by my best friend,

166
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,159
Zheng Zibu from Maoshan Shangqing Sect.

167
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,359
Zheng Zibu,

168
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,120
and predecessor of Feng Zhanghao, All-Encompassing Guild's leader

169
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,679
and the shaman of Liangshan,

170
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,080
Feng Tianyang,

171
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,440
all of them were present at the ceremony.

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,159
A total of 36 individuals

173
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,640
joined the ceremony.

174
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,159
People refer to them as

175
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,159
The 36 Thieves.

176
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,440
THE 36 THIEVES

177
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,640
Although the pact they made was discreet,

178
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:21,640
people still caught hold of the news.

179
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,880
All righteous sects

180
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,880
found it tricky

181
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,320
when they saw their members

182
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,120
colluding with sorcerers.

183
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,640
Therefore,

184
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,719
they formed an alliance

185
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,240
and issued a kill order

186
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:34,559
on The 36 Thieves.

187
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,280
They mentioned nothing about their crimes

188
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,559
or reasons for the hunt.

189
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,679
They did it

190
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,000
in order to protect

191
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,640
their sects' reputation.

192
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,560
They hoped that all 36 of them

193
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,760
would vanish forever.

194
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,840
Back then, I was the eldest son of the Lu family.

195
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:52,000
I knew what was going on.

196
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:54,800
However, as it involved many people,

197
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:58,400
I dared not help Zheng Zibu out.

198
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,240
They said I had never done anything bad.

199
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,439
Such nonsense.

200
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,720
Grandmaster,

201
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,040
if so, how did you treat my grandfather back then?

202
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,240
I wasn't the only one.

203
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:16,199
This guy was involved in the incident too.

204
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,360
Back then, from Celestial Taoist Mansion,

205
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:20,079
only the two of us left the mountain

206
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,160
to pursue your grandfather.

207
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,120
Grandmaster Tian,

208
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,480
-what about you? -Idiot.

209
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,480
Don't overthink it.

210
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,480
I've let down many people in my life.

211
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,040
However,

212
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,520
I didn't let your grandfather down.

213
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,360
The collusion between your grandfather, Zhang Huaiyi,

214
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,640
and sorcerers of Sinister Pleasure

215
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,040
did bring our sect

216
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,640
plenty of trouble.

217
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,920
I still remember

218
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,880
that sect leaders from other sects

219
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,680
kept putting pressure on my master.

220
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,480
He was the Chief Celestial Taoist back then.

221
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,720
His name is Zhang Jingqing.

222
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,120
However, your founding ancestor was known

223
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:57,760
for defending his disciples.

224
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,439
He ordered both of us to look for Huaiyi.

225
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,000
As long as we could bring Huaiyi back in secret,

226
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:06,000
he could punish him according to the sect's rules.

227
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,240
Other sects would have no way

228
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:10,439
to interfere with the private affairs of our sect.

229
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
Back then, Zhiwei and I

230
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
split up to look for your grandfather,

231
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,360
Zhang Huaiyi.

232
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,120
However, we couldn't find him in the end.

233
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:21,280
Not only that, but I was also attacked

234
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,040
when I was looking for him.

235
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,160
Qing.

236
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,079
Yes, sir.

237
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,680
Second Grandmaster.

238
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,839
Lend me a hand.

239
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,959
Even now, I don't know who they are.

240
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
They interrogated me

241
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,160
about the whereabouts of Zhang Huaiyi.

242
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,880
I had no idea.

243
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,600
But they didn't believe me.

244
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,160
Thus,

245
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,520
they damaged my meridians

246
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,560
and chopped off my limbs.

247
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,480
Now,

248
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,839
I'm a useless cripple.

249
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,360
Grandmaster Tian,

250
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
so you became like this because of my grandfather.

251
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,839
Chulan,

252
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,760
I'm not telling you this

253
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,480
to complain about the hardships I endured.

254
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,000
After I was wounded,

255
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,120
there was no way for me

256
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:35,839
to practice martial arts.

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,040
However, this allowed me to focus solely

258
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,480
on practicing my static qigong.

259
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,520
After all these years,

260
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,120
my mastery of static qigong

261
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,560
has made tremendous leaps and bounds.

262
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:51,280
I've heard about it too.

263
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
You never slept a wink

264
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,120
over the last several decades.

265
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,400
When you're brimming with qi, you don't crave food.

266
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,000
When you're brimming with spirituality,

267
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:02,319
you don't crave sleep.

268
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,240
Now,

269
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:07,120
I'm brimming with both qi and spirituality.

270
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,480
I don't need sleep

271
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,800
to sustain myself.

272
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,880
Grandmaster Tian,

273
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,199
you do look on the bright side of things, huh?

274
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,199
Child,

275
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,439
I don't know how you've spent your life out there

276
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,360
all these years,

277
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,560
but I know

278
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,199
that it must've been tough.

279
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,040
Naturally, your grandfather knew

280
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,360
that his master could defend him

281
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:35,480
once he returned to the sect.

282
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,439
But he didn't come back.

283
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:40,680
He was afraid he might drag the sect down.

284
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,680
That was why he would rather run and hide

285
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,439
for the rest of his life.

286
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,480
Child,

287
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,680
don't blame your grandfather for this.

288
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
I don't blame him at all.

289
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,439
I just wish to ask him

290
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,319
why he kept hiding the truth from me.

291
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,520
He had no one to depend on back then.

292
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,560
There were some things that he could not tell you.

293
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,719
That fool,

294
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,480
he didn't need to resort to this.

295
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,800
You wouldn't need to suffer that much

296
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
if he brought you

297
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,040
to the sect

298
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,480
in the first place.

299
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,400
All these years,

300
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Zhiwei and I

301
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:47,079
have never hated your grandfather,

302
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,000
Zhang Huaiyi.

303
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:55,240
Grandmaster.

304
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,040
Since you're Huaiyi's grandson,

305
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,240
that makes you our grandson too.

306
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:04,400
Chulan,

307
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,680
no matter

308
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,599
what the final result of this contest may be,

309
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
Celestial Taoist Mansion

310
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,760
will always be your home.

311
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,360
If

312
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,040
Zhiwei bullies you,

313
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,640
just tell me.

314
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:25,439
I'll use Legend of the Phoenix

315
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,839
to blast him

316
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,680
when he's meditating.

317
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:38,880
Did I offend you?

318
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,839
Why would I make things difficult for Chulan?

319
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,560
You guys know that I'm a sensitive soul,

320
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,240
yet you guys still hold such a touching reunion in front of me.

321
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,199
Zhiwei, Jinzhong, congratulations.

322
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,880
You guys got yourselves a grandson now.

323
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,319
What were they telling Zhang Chulan just now?

324
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,400
I'm talking to you!

325
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,680
So you're Feng Baobao

326
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,680
from NDT, huh?

327
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:50,040
Stop!

328
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:57,719
Ms. Bao, stop it!

329
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:00,240
-Baobao! -Ms. Bao!

330
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:01,599
Baobao!

331
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,880
Baobao, what's wrong with you?

332
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,199
I don't know, either.

333
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,800
Ms. Bao, it will be fine. I know how you feel.

334
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,120
You will have what I have too.

335
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,719
I'll find them back for you.

336
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,800
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST, TOP 16 CONTESTANTS

337
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,040
ZHANG CHULAN VS TANG WENLONG

338
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:36,319
Dude.

339
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,800
Who is Tang Wenlong, and what's his ability?

340
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,839
Tell me about him.

341
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,240
Tang Wenlong's true ability

342
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,680
is that once he unleashes his poisonous miasma,

343
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,240
his qi will turn toxic.

344
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:52,240
There's no way to get close to him.

345
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:53,599
He's bragging to everyone

346
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,079
that he's going to get rid of you in this match.

347
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,800
According to my prediction,

348
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,240
this is the last time we shall meet each other.

349
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:15,520
-Zhang Chulan is shameless! -Zhang Chulan is shameless!

350
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,319
-Zhang Chulan is shameless! -Zhang Chulan is shameless!

351
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:22,720
Tang Wenlong!

352
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,919
It all falls on you now!

353
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,480
Don't let this shameless scum win by accident!

354
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,879
Tang Wenlong!

355
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Dear Taoists.

356
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,720
I won't go down there this time.

357
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,560
Tang Wenlong!

358
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,960
You must defeat Zhang Chulan!

359
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,600
Don't let that shameless scum win!

360
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,560
Stop the hate.

361
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:48,879
Haven't you heard of this saying before?

362
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,680
If you hate someone too much, you'll end up becoming their fan.

363
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Morning, Tang.

364
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:54,159
Stop trying to cotton up to me.

365
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,440
I'm not here

366
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,560
to compete today.

367
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,600
I'm here to make you a cripple.

368
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,040
Tang,

369
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,200
if I'm not mistaken,

370
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,720
this should be our first encounter.

371
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,120
Your grandfather, Zhang Huaiyi,

372
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,600
killed seven members of Tang Sect on Mount Siguniang.

373
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,280
Even my martial uncle, Yang Lie,

374
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,879
died at his hands.

375
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
You will

376
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,879
repay the debt on his behalf.

377
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,879
Tang,

378
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,080
it's all in the past, you know?

379
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:21,120
There's no need for you

380
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,080
to prevail over me and be so aggressive.

381
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:24,520
Begin the match.

382
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,879
Once he unleashes his poisonous miasma,

383
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,879
there's no way to get close to him.

384
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,879
Does Zhang Chulan actually possess such speed?

385
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,679
POISONOUS MIASMA

386
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,480
Tang Wenlong has unleashed

387
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,879
his poisonous miasma.

388
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,399
Zhang Chulan will be poisoned

389
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,560
if he attempts close-quarters combat again.

390
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:59,120
Countless lightning bolts spark all around Zhang Chulan's body.

391
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
At the same time, he struck Tang Wenlong with the bolts.

392
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,280
Tang Wenlong has been surrounded

393
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,879
-by the lightning bolts. -What is this?

394
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,800
LITTLE WHITE WORM

395
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,480
The lightning bolts are striking Tang Wenlong.

396
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,639
Black smoke starts to appear.

397
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,480
Zhang Chulan can actually control these lightning bolts remotely

398
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,159
without getting close to his opponent!

399
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,679
This is unbelievable.

400
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,960
Zhang Chulan has become a different person entirely.

401
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,879
He defeated Tang Wenlong in an instant!

402
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,120
Tang Wenlong lost

403
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:35,919
because he underestimated his opponent.

404
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,760
However, Zhang Chulan was well-prepared

405
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,600
before engaging his opponent.

406
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,800
Revenge breeds revenge, you know? It's an endless cycle.

407
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,000
Have you turned into his fan now?

408
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,159
That's impossible.

409
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,520
He's a shameless scum.

410
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,480
How could he…

411
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,240
I'm sincere this time.

412
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,080
I don't know if he's shameless or not.

413
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:01,879
But you're mistaken about something.

414
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Even if he's shameless,

415
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,520
that doesn't mean he's incompetent.

416
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:08,320
It's my defeat.

417
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,159
Zhang Chulan versus Tang Wenlong.

418
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,760
The winner

419
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,200
is Zhang Chulan.

420
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,600
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST, TOP 16 CONTESTANTS

421
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,360
ZHANG CHULAN, PROCEEDS TO THE TOP EIGHT.

422
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,879
TANG WENLONG, ELIMINATED

423
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,320
ZHANG LINGYU, LU LINGLONG

424
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,000
Zhiwei. Jinzhong.

425
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,919
Look.

426
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,040
Lingyu and Linglong

427
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,200
are a match made in heaven.

428
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,360
Lu Linglong

429
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
versus Zhang Lingyu.

430
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,720
The winner is Zhang Lingyu!

431
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,600
Zhang Zhiwei! Stupid Taoist!

432
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,399
Don't run away!

433
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,560
Zhiwei!

434
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:32,320
Slow down!

435
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:33,840
I can't afford to slow down.

436
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,800
I can slow down,

437
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:36,760
but Lu won't slow down for me.

438
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,679
Then you should let me go.

439
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,800
You're the one he's after.

440
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:41,320
What has this got to do with me?

441
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:42,760
So, you're disregarding our ties as fellow disciples now, huh?

442
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,760
Fine. I'll toss you like a javelin

443
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,760
and send you to Lu Jin.

444
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,200
Lingyu is your disciple!

445
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,480
I can't touch him!

446
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,720
However, I'll put his debt

447
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,720
on your tab,

448
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,720
you stupid Taoist!

449
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,879
Fine.

450
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
You think Lightning Technique of Mount Longhu are strong, huh?

451
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:59,240
Fine! Stop right there!

452
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,800
Let's see if my Lightning Talisman can't strike you down!

453
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:03,000
Lu Jin,

454
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,600
we're already over 100 years old. Why are you acting like a thug?

455
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,360
Can you save your dignity for once?

456
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,679
Forget about my dignity!

457
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,360
Today, I will imitate your disciple!

458
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,679
I don't care about my dignity!

459
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,560
I'll fight you even at the expense of my life!

460
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:15,800
Can't you let the young guys

461
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:17,600
resolve their issues themselves?

462
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,120
Come! Let us raise our glasses!

463
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,520
I know it's a contest,

464
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,879
but we're friends when we're not competing.

465
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,840
To our friendship!

466
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:26,960
-Cheers! -Cheers! To our friendship!

467
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,320
Cheers!

468
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,840
It's just a bottle of beer.

469
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,120
What's with the huge reaction?

470
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,639
Sorry about that.

471
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,200
I'm used to practicing with my hidden weapons.

472
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,439
That was a conditional reflex.

473
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,280
Baobao, you should go there.

474
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,720
You don't need to keep us company.

475
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,040
Go and make friends with them.

476
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,080
Go ahead.

477
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,040
They got along with each other in such a short time.

478
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,480
They've put down their guard

479
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,760
to understand

480
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,240
and become friends with each other.

481
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
That's pretty nice.

482
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,120
Zhang Chulan,

483
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,720
to be honest,

484
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,879
I'm seeing you in a different light now.

485
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,280
I saw courage and strength in you.

486
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,040
If so, Tang,

487
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,679
let's talk about something.

488
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,080
I think that we shouldn't be affected

489
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:45,000
by the feuds of our previous generations.

490
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,840
We don't even understand the reason behind it.

491
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,639
Don't you think it's not worth it if we let it affect our relationship?

492
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,159
You do have a point.

493
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,240
If so,

494
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,840
let's have a real match some other day.

495
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:58,679
What do you think?

496
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,800
Can we stop fighting?

497
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:02,480
Fighting is bad.

498
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,679
We should play things like mahjong instead.

499
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:13,520
Crazy girl, don't just drink by yourself.

500
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,639
From an exchange of blows, friendship grows, you know?

501
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,879
I could tell that you were adept at martial arts

502
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,000
after exchanging blows with you.

503
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,800
Here. To you.

504
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,560
Let's put down our feud

505
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,360
and drink until we get hammered tonight.

506
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,480
Alright.

507
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,679
Let me finish this first.

508
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,679
CHINESE BAIJIU

509
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,439
Are you challenging me?

510
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,600
I'm from Haidong, you know?

511
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,720
How dare you challenge me to a drinking contest?

512
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,879
Give it to me. I'll have some strong liquor with you.

513
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,040
Do you have a glass?

514
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,320
Lian,

515
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:08,679
you're something else.

516
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,720
You're not bad at all.

517
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,360
Do you know? Your odds are 1-to-250 now.

518
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,840
If you do win the contest,

519
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,639
I will have to escape to the Moon because of all the bets that I took.

520
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,919
Isn't that better?

521
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,600
You can practice speaking the moon language on the Moon.

522
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:19,960
Zhang Chulan

523
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
is the focus of attention indeed.

524
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,480
By the way,

525
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,960
I heard that you fought him before.

526
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,840
Was he truly as unbearable as the rumors claim?

527
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:30,240
I'm always curious about something.

528
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,800
Have you always hated

529
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:33,120
Zhang Chulan?

530
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,720
I don't hate him.

531
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,760
You do.

532
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,800
And it's very obvious.

533
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,360
Don't tell me it's because he knows how to use

534
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:42,199
your Five Elements Yin Lightning?

535
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,520
Zhuge Qing, where are you going?

536
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,040
You guys are gossiping.

537
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,280
I'm uninterested in gossip.

538
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,280
Please excuse me.

539
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,480
Let's talk about Zhang Chulan.

540
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,960
Even if he does master Five Elements Yang Lightning with his perfect body,

541
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,399
he still can't affect your position on Mount Longhu.

542
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,240
Shixue, stop trying to provoke me with your words.

543
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,600
ENHANCE HEARING

544
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,679
I knew that.

545
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,919
I always knew that.

546
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,879
I just dislike the kid.

547
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,600
Back then, I committed a huge mistake

548
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,000
all because of one wrong thought.

549
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,439
Therefore, I wasn't able to inherit Five Elements Yang Lightning,

550
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,679
which I consider perfect.

551
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,320
But I can't blame anyone else for that.

552
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,960
I deserved it.

553
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,800
And now, I'm venting my anger on Zhang Chulan.

554
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,159
That proves that my level of cultivation isn't enough.

555
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,159
We've known each other for a long time.

556
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,320
Why don't you tell me

557
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,639
who drew your first blood?

558
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,320
So, Zhang Lingyu

559
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:39,840
has such a dark history.

560
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,040
I swear that I won't tell anyone.

561
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,040
That's impossible.

562
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,520
You're only asking me this so that you can spread the secret.

563
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:49,040
I won't tell anyone.

564
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,040
I'm begging you.

565
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,360
Please tell me.

566
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,679
Indeed. I should find a chance

567
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,639
to apologize to Zhang Chulan.

568
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,679
Zhang Chulan,

569
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,639
I'll teach you a Jinwei saying.

570
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,919
If you pronounce it wrong, you have to drink.

571
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
No problem!

572
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,560
Drink up!

573
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:05,159
Fire persimmon.

574
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,679
Live persimmons.

575
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,840
-You're wrong! -Drink up!

576
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,679
Bottoms up!

577
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:38,280
Lian!

578
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,280
Wait.

579
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,159
Lian,

580
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,960
what does your seal look like?

581
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,760
What does it look like?

582
00:27:57,879 --> 00:27:59,360
Zhang Chulan,

583
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,360
show us your seal.

584
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:03,199
My seal?

585
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,760
Why do you want to see that?

586
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,679
You misunderstood me.

587
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
I'm not interested in you.

588
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,919
That seal is an Outsiders' technique that will soon be lost.

589
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,960
We just wish

590
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,280
to observe it closely.

591
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
You wish to observe it closely?

592
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:17,040
Do you believe that I'll poke your face with it?

593
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
I'm going to throw a fit!

594
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,360
Gold Brilliance Spell!

595
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,360
Calm down!

596
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,600
Don't be angry.

597
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,720
That's not what we meant.

598
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,760
However, such an Outsiders' technique has been lost for a long time.

599
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,000
And there's no record of it in the ancient manuals.

600
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,959
That's right.

601
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,120
We just don't want to miss out on the opportunity

602
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:31,959
to observe it closely.

603
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,080
Just for a little while.

604
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:40,840
We're buddies, right?

605
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:42,840
I'll show it to you guys.

606
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,879
Let's go!

607
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Shixue! We did it! Hurry!

608
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,199
Zhang Chulan,

609
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,720
you're a man who is going to achieve great things.

610
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,480
You shouldn't mind such minor details.

611
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,480
Zhang Chulan,

612
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,000
now, no one else has the right

613
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,720
to bear the seal except for you.

614
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,720
That's right.

615
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,320
You have to expand our horizons today.

616
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,159
Show us something new.

617
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,679
Do you guys wish to see it that much?

618
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,439
We do!

619
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,879
If so,

620
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:23,879
I'll show it to you guys!

621
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,959
I saw it!

622
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,959
I saw faint qi symbols

623
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,480
flowing on it.

624
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,480
But it's a little…

625
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:49,639
It's too blurry!

626
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,199
It's simple if you don't want it to be blurry.

627
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,320
I just need to utilize the true qi in my body.

628
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,800
Gold brilliance,

629
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:01,320
cover my body.

630
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,679
See the invisible,

631
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,800
hear the unhearable.

632
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:07,879
Here you go!

633
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,600
Indeed.

634
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:23,560
That seal

635
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:25,080
is made with unique symbols.

636
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,360
This is so wonderful!

637
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,399
It's totally different

638
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,600
from the superfluous design they make nowadays.

639
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,520
All these symbols show hints of Classicism.

640
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,959
They're uniquely modest! And they're filled with mysterious beauty!

641
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,959
This isn't Classicism!

642
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,320
This is…

643
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:39,159
This is Bohemianism!

644
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,280
What do you think?

645
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,439
I'm a cool dude, right?

646
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,399
I will make you guys speechless!

647
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,560
Friendship forever!

648
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,679
What was I thinking?

649
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,199
Did I actually want to apologize to a person like him?

650
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,480
Master was wrong.

651
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,000
He shouldn't have allowed such an idiot

652
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,280
to join our sect.

653
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,520
Every generation has its heroes.

654
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,320
These young ones

655
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:47,199
will take on our responsibility.

656
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
I didn't come here

657
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,679
to compete today.

658
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:09,560
I'm Zhang Lingyu from Mount Longhu.

659
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:11,679
I'm looking forward to your ultimate techniques.

660
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,240
I'm looking forward to our match too.

661
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,199
I came to Mount Longhu

662
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,199
to find like-minded friends.

663
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,439
I wish to prove

664
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,919
that infinite possibilities exist within me.

665
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,320
I'll show you guys my family's secret technique.

666
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:35,560
We, the Deng Brothers, will definitely surprise you guys.

667
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:36,879
Witness our strength!

668
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,760
-Making friends is my priority here. -I will surprise the Outsiders' world!

669
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,679
I'm here to spar with other martial artists.

670
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,240
We will win Infinite Heavenly Talisman!

671
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,879
I want everyone to remember my name!

672
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,800
Chief Celestial Taoist.

673
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:22,480
What are you doing here?

674
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,159
What's wrong with your eyes?

675
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,719
It's so lively over there.

676
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,040
Lu Jin just had to punch me in the eyes.

677
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,159
Aren't you joining them?

678
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:33,439
I don't even have enough sleep during the daytime,

679
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,679
let alone during nighttime.

680
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,600
How about one sip?

681
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:41,840
It's pretty nice.

682
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,120
Come, let me help you.

683
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,280
Wang Ye.

684
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,520
You came to me at such a late hour.

685
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,000
What are you up to?

686
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,320
I'm not up to anything.

687
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,639
I'm here to resolve your issue for you.

688
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,719
Resolve my issue for me?

689
00:33:58,199 --> 00:34:00,439
I came here to tell you

690
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,760
that you don't need to fret about Zhang Chulan for now.

691
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,320
At least he won't be eliminated

692
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,520
before he faces me.

693
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,360
I know

694
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:09,239
you care about Zhang Chulan very much.

695
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:11,360
However, as Chief Celestial Taoist of Celestial Taoist Mansion,

696
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,679
you're thinking about interfering with your junior's affairs, am I right?

697
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:14,759
Chief Celestial Taoist,

698
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,719
please don't do it.

699
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:17,719
Forget about doing it.

700
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:19,279
Don't even think about it.

701
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,600
Once you do it,

702
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,279
not only will Celestial Taoist Mansion's reputation be ruined,

703
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,440
but your destiny will also be altered.

704
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,639
What?

705
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,279
You…

706
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
You shouldn't be

707
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:45,080
so curious about me.

708
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:46,960
It's bad for you.

709
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,759
You're right.

710
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,639
And I don't want to cause trouble for myself.

711
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,719
But Wang Ye,

712
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:52,799
judging from your tone,

713
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,679
it seems like you joined this contest because of Zhang Chulan.

714
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:56,679
That's right.

715
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,279
However, my intention

716
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,480
is the opposite of yours.

717
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,920
I'm here

718
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,600
to stop him from being the champion.

719
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,960
I'm here to stop him from inheriting Tianshidu.

720
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,799
You have your own reasons

721
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,560
for wanting Zhang Chulan to be the champion.

722
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,799
And I have my own reasons

723
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,360
for stopping him.

724
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,799
If you want to eliminate him,

725
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,440
you have to eliminate Zhuge Qing first.

726
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:18,160
Even if it's Zhang Lingyu we're talking about,

727
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,920
I dare not guarantee

728
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,400
that he'll win against Zhuge Qing.

729
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,080
Are you confident that you can win against him?

730
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,400
About that,

731
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,600
I guess so.

732
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,600
Why don't I

733
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,480
give you a test?

734
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,000
Well.

735
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,160
Alright.

736
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,640
Pardon me for the rudeness, then.

737
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:45,839
Chaos Golden Space Rip!

738
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,759
He's strong.

739
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,000
I only used Chaos Golden Space Rip once against that old man

740
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,720
and I almost collapsed from exhaustion.

741
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,799
Is this the power of a Celestial Taoist?

742
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,560
This is pretty interesting.

743
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,200
I was actually detached

744
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:13,000
from the world momentarily.

745
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,759
You manipulate time

746
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,319
to force your opponent to follow your rhythm.

747
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:20,040
I was wrong about you.

748
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,000
I assume

749
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,200
Yunlong wasn't your only teacher.

750
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,839
Wang Ye,

751
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,240
you can pursue whatever you intend to do.

752
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,920
Whether or not Zhang Chulan can proceed,

753
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,120
that doesn't depend on you

754
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,400
or me.

755
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,799
It depends on no one but himself.

756
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,880
Chief Celestial Taoist,

757
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,200
pardon me for my rudeness.

758
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:48,400
I shall take my leave.
