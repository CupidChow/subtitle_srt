1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,760
After the Mount Longhu incident,

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,000
recently many fugitives from Sinister Pleasure

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,719
were struck by lightning on Xiangchun Road.

4
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,360
Thunderstorms struck many parts of Maqiao Street.

5
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:17,880
NDT security maintenance officers

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,360
have visited the scene.

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,560
NDT's investigation found that everyone who got struck

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,759
was a fugitive from Sinister Pleasure.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,439
The source of the lightning remains unknown.

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,759
Stay safe

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,799
on your travels.

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,240
Let's go.

13
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:58,160
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

14
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:03,600
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

15
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:06,039
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

16
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:06,960
Here.

17
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,239
Let's have another toast.

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,519
Astringent and bitter flavors make a good tea.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,640
This tea is good.

20
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,200
That's quite a compliment, Mr. Wang.

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,920
If you like it, I'll send you some.

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,640
Lyu,

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,840
you have to try it.

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,280
You all brought me here and forced me to stay.

25
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,120
Did you invite me for a meeting or tea?

26
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,079
Lu,

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,680
if we didn't force you here,

28
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,560
you would be looking for Chief Celestial Taoist

29
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,400
on your own.

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,239
Sinister Pleasure disrupted the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,440
They killed Tian and burned Mount Longhu.

32
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:48,480
This kind of deep grudge

33
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,480
only knocked down a dozen or so people.

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,840
What's wrong?

35
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,760
Right now,

36
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,920
Chief Celestial Taoist has decided to wipe out Sinister Pleasure.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,560
He has violated the foundation of Outsiders' law

38
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,040
by illegally using superpowers for revenge.

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,480
If this continues,

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,200
there will be unimaginable consequences.

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,880
Could it be that you want Chief Celestial Taoist

42
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,239
to wipe out Sinister Pleasure

43
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,000
and Lyu Liang for you?

44
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:10,959
Lu Jin.

45
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,040
Let me tell you.

46
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,200
Don't think you are

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,799
his only old friend.

48
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,200
Since today is a discussion,

49
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,840
I will make myself clear.

50
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,239
Regarding Chief Celestial Taoist's matter,

51
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,920
I advocate

52
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:27,440
-to not interfere. -Right.

53
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:32,200
Although Chief Celestial Taoist

54
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,640
doesn't seem to care about anything,

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,920
once he makes a decision,

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,519
no one can stop him.

57
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,040
After Master Tian's death,

58
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,079
Chief Celestial Taoist has been in seclusion.

59
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,399
There's adequate staff on Mount Longhu.

60
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,799
But it's strange

61
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,720
that the man brought by Chief Celestial Taoist to accompany him

62
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,280
was not Zhang Lingyu,

63
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,679
but the fourth-ranked disciple, Zhao Huanjin.

64
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,359
ZHAO HUANJIN

65
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,280
Enough.

66
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,359
From the moment you entered the room,

67
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,320
you have been on your phone.

68
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,600
Are you addicted

69
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,119
to fortune-telling?

70
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,880
You calm down.

71
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,839
As for Huanjin, I know him.

72
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,280
He is very obedient.

73
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,159
By leaving Zhang Lingyu behind to guard Mount Longhu,

74
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,719
it seems that Chief Celestial Taoist

75
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,640
didn't leave himself an option.

76
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,680
This time, he seems to be determined

77
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,479
to have his way.

78
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,200
Chief Celestial Taoist

79
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,599
is about to take action again.

80
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,599
TIANHE BUILDING

81
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,960
Excuse me, I'm here for Mr. Liu Bihua.

82
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,919
Your name, please?

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,719
Zhang Zhiwei.

84
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,880
Bihua.

85
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,479
What do you think I should do?

86
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,280
Stop crying.

87
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,640
Why is my life so miserable, Bihua?

88
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,640
You've seen everything that's going on here.

89
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:09,080
The company has recruited several new partners.

90
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,240
They are doing serious business.

91
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,479
There is nothing I can do

92
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,840
about Sinister Pleasure.

93
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,360
Stop crying, okay?

94
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
Mr. Liu, you have an old friend visiting you.

95
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,200
An old friend of mine?

96
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,240
What's his name?

97
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,200
Zhang Zhiwei.

98
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,359
Okay,

99
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,280
I got it.

100
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,159
I'll be right there.

101
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,840
Bihua,

102
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,840
why did your face

103
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,520
take on a ghastly expression?

104
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,560
I'm going to meet a friend.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,240
Wait for me here.

106
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,039
Can you please not leave me alone?

107
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Bihua!

108
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,400
Mr. Liu.

109
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,479
Chief Celestial Taoist,

110
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,880
what brought you here?

111
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,440
Look at what Sinister Pleasure

112
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,560
had done.

113
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,840
Hear me out.

114
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,919
What happened on Mount Longhu has nothing to do with me.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,120
Sinister Pleasure and I no longer get along.

116
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,960
You know this as well.

117
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,039
Even if I were given a chance to help them,

118
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,520
I wouldn't dare to do it.

119
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,120
Do you know about everything

120
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,680
that happened on the mountain?

121
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,560
So you should've heard

122
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,240
about why I came down from the mountain, no?

123
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,120
When Gong Qing became the interim leader,

124
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,120
you contributed money and effort.

125
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,799
You have contributed a lot to Sinister Pleasure all these years,

126
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,919
right?

127
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,680
I'm here

128
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,000
to ask you a favor.

129
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,240
I want to see him.

130
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Chief Celestial Taoist,

131
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,840
I left Sinister Pleasure a long time ago.

132
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:14,960
I can't help you

133
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,200
with this.

134
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,960
You'd better leave.

135
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,359
Bihua.

136
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,280
Why aren't you back yet, Liu?

137
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,520
Zhangâ€¦

138
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:31,880
You were there

139
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,320
on Mount Longhu, right?

140
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,719
Run!

141
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,479
Bihua.

142
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,200
Ask Gong Qing to show up.

143
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,719
Otherwise, starting today,

144
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,159
I'll be against Sinister Pleasure.

145
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,520
I will disable any members of Sinister Pleasure that I see.

146
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,919
without mercy.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,120
To disable anyone he sees?

148
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,199
Looks like the Chief Celestial Taoist will not stop

149
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,039
until he locates Gong Qing.

150
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,600
No way.

151
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
We must stop Chief Celestial Taoist.

152
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,480
We cannot let him continue to act so recklessly.

153
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,439
If this goes on,

154
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,040
the company will punish him severely.

155
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,400
Reckless?

156
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,720
I think this is just right.

157
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,920
Hit it where it hurts most.

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,560
Chief Celestial Taoist knows this better

159
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,680
than any of us.

160
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,240
What if Gong Qing doesn't show up?

161
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:57,560
Are we going

162
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,720
to stand by and watch

163
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,520
Chief Celestial Taoist kill all of them?

164
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,240
When that day comes,

165
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,920
don't think the Lyu family

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,720
can get away with it.

167
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,640
By then, the situation

168
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,160
will be like the Year of Jiashen.

169
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,120
We old fellows

170
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,760
either accomplish nothing

171
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,480
or make things worse.

172
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:19,079
We don't stand up when we should,

173
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,120
and we don't take responsibility when we should.

174
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,280
What is the purpose of keeping this kind of Ten Elders?

175
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,680
Lu, this is way too far.

176
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,920
Aren't we holding the meeting

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
just to discuss Chief Celestial Taoist?

178
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:33,959
Lu,

179
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,720
if you are willing to take responsibility,

180
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,720
I, Lyu Ci,

181
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:38,280
will be in the game.

182
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,480
Destroy the tower. Do you get that?

183
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Oh myâ€¦

184
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,040
What's wrong, San?
Your toilet is clogged?

185
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,480
Take a look.

186
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
What's there to see?

187
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:55,800
-Toilet unclogging. -I'm dead.

188
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,319
It's free of charge if it doesn't work.

189
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
This advertisement flyer

190
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,280
is Sinister Pleasure's communication channel.

191
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,480
If they need to communicate something

192
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,959
they will print important information on the advertising page

193
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,240
in encrypted form.

194
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,520
They don't know that we have the decryption method,

195
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,319
so they are still using the old encryption.

196
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,800
The information inside

197
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,120
is about Chief Celestial Taoist.

198
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:25,760
Chief Celestial Taoist said that he wanted to see Gong Qing.

199
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,120
Otherwise,

200
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,480
he'll wipe out Sinister Pleasure.

201
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,680
It's a mess now.

202
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,800
Those from Sinister Pleasure will do anything to protect themselves.

203
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,959
The only way to solve this

204
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,079
is to find Chief Celestial Taoist swiftly.

205
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,439
Did you hear what I said--

206
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,520
Do you guys have anything to add?

207
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,920
MISSING PERSON

208
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,439
A MILLION YUAN FOR A 100-YEAR-OLD MAN

209
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,000
Master Lingyu.

210
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,880
Master Rong Shan has been cleaning for a week.

211
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,760
He has not come out or said a single word.

212
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
You should talk to him.

213
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,920
Rong Shan.

214
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,160
The dead cannot be resurrected.

215
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,600
If Master Tian were still alive,

216
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
he would not want to see you like this.

217
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,760
Master Tian is gone.

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,480
Master is gone too.

219
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,360
It's all my fault.

220
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,360
Lingyu.

221
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,319
Are you leaving too?

222
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:40,360
Chief Celestial Taoist,

223
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:43,199
we really don't know where Gong Qing is.

224
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,400
After leaving Mount Longhu,

225
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,360
we heard nothing from him.

226
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,199
Do you remember

227
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,560
what I told you last time?

228
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,800
You decide

229
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,360
which path to take

230
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,760
and what kind of person

231
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,040
you want to be.

232
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,719
Looks like you still don't get it.

233
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,680
I'll ask you one last time.

234
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,079
Where is Gong Qing hiding?

235
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,400
We really don't know.

236
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,480
GAO NING AND DOU MEI OF SINISTER PLEASURE

237
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,040
ARRESTED BY NDT FOR THE HU FAMILY VILLAGE CASE

238
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,640
SEVERE CONCURRENT PUNISHMENT FOR MULTIPLE OFFENSES

239
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,800
Lingyu,

240
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,800
I heard from Yu

241
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,040
that these days,

242
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,319
you're taking care of everything on the mountain.

243
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Lingyu, you've been working hard.

244
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,439
This is part of my job.

245
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,560
It's not easy

246
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,959
to do your job well.

247
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
CELESTIAL TAOIST MANSION, FANG QIANHE

248
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,680
Actually,

249
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
there's one thing

250
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,199
I haven't been able to figure out.

251
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,480
Master has been practicing for decades

252
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,800
and has long given up

253
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,959
the desire for revenge and anger.

254
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,640
I've never seen him like this before.

255
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,719
Master Qianhe,

256
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,800
why did he leave the mountain this time?

257
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,439
Tao models itself after nature.

258
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,280
Charms are formed through your emotions.

259
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,079
The fallen leaves on the ground are easy to sweep

260
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,520
but ones in the heart are hard to remove.

261
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,040
Master left the mountain.

262
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,280
I think it was to sweep the fallen leaves in his heart.

263
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,360
Keeping your heart peaceful

264
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,040
is easier said than done.

265
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,680
People always say

266
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,479
to think twice before you do something.

267
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,280
For those of us who practice Taoism,

268
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,640
we emphasize thinking.

269
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:54,280
But above all, we emphasize on doing.

270
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,920
This is the unity of knowledge and action.

271
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,640
Lingyu,

272
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,280
you were born with gray hair.

273
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,199
You were abandoned at the foot of the mountain,

274
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,040
and Master adopted you.

275
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,800
I know you respect him the most.

276
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,680
Remember Master's teachings.

277
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:12,120
Doing good deeds without accumulating merits

278
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,280
will not attain the state of perfection in Taoism.

279
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,280
Master is like this,

280
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,439
and so are you.

281
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,520
Go ahead and do what you have to do.

282
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,520
I have also circled the earth once.

283
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,360
It's time for me to return to Mount Longhu.

284
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,719
The purpose of life

285
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,240
is not necessarily to please others.

286
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,920
The same goes for you.

287
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,280
Your disciple

288
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,560
lacks nothing,

289
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,079
but he's too serious.

290
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,760
You're too serious.

291
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,719
I really enjoyed watching

292
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,359
your battle with Zhang Chulan.

293
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,560
I thought you had finally found closure

294
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,199
and accepted yourself.

295
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,160
Lingyu.

296
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,199
Whatever the reason,

297
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,319
this is who you are now.

298
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,640
Accept it.

299
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,719
Accept who you are now.

300
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:33,439
Doing good deeds without accumulating merits

301
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,439
won't attain the state of perfection in Taoism.

302
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,319
Go ahead and do what you have to do.

303
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,839
After many days of extreme weather

304
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,319
with strong thunder and lightning as well as heavy rain,

305
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,760
the weather in our city has finally cleared up.

306
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:54,280
The beautiful weather

307
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,079
also lifted the mood.

308
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Okay.

309
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,640
I got it.

310
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,879
Master, there is a letter from Liu Bihua,

311
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,520
and the address has been given.

312
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:10,839
Eat the dishes.

313
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,960
Master,

314
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,440
I don't trust Liu Bihua very much.

315
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,760
How about I go and have a look?

316
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,879
When dealing with Sinister Pleasure,

317
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,200
you can never be too careful.

318
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,520
Is the food not to your liking?

319
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,200
Huanjin,

320
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:31,960
don't go vegetarian just because you're with me.

321
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,200
Order some meat for yourself.

322
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:37,440
Okay.

323
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,200
Ma'am, one braised pork belly.

324
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,320
More pork, please.

325
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:42,280
Sure.

326
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,600
Huanjin.

327
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,159
You are 42 this year, right?

328
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,120
Yes.

329
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,520
Don't you have any plans to get married yet?

330
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,480
Master,

331
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
I actually want to stay at Mount Longhu,

332
00:17:57,639 --> 00:17:59,040
and stay with you forever.

333
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,040
In the past few years working as a driver

334
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,399
I heard

335
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,040
you gave your 3,000 yuan monthly pay

336
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,360
to Youyi's wife and child.

337
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,120
This is what I should do.

338
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,399
Youyi's family

339
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,800
is my family.

340
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:22,360
Huanjin,

341
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,560
I asked only you to leave the mountain with me this time.

342
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,399
What do you think?

343
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,639
I will do whatever you tell me to do, Master.

344
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,679
If you won't say it, I won't harbor wild guesses.

345
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,040
Then let me ask you.

346
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,240
If something goes wrong with me

347
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:41,159
this time

348
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,200
and I tell you to run away,

349
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,399
what will you do?

350
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,840
Then I'll run away at once.

351
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,679
Your pork is here. Enjoy your meal.

352
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:02,840
Great.

353
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:05,040
Then I want you to eat the meat now.

354
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,480
Then I will eat the meat.

355
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,240
He has informed Chief Celestial Taoist

356
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,480
as per your request.

357
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,000
Bihua,

358
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,919
you'd better shape up.

359
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,480
Has everything been arranged?

360
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:59,240
Sinister Pleasure's masters who can come are all ready.

361
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,000
Chief Celestial Taoist is too strong.

362
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,320
Our only chance of winning is to make good use of our men

363
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:04,440
and take them by surprise.

364
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,960
Extend my greetings to Chief Celestial Taoist.

365
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,360
Master, here it is.

366
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,720
Master,

367
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,960
you are an old man.

368
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,080
What are you doing here?

369
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:28,639
I will do

370
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,320
whatever they do.

371
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:31,720
Can your heart bear it

372
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,240
at this age?

373
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,480
I'm over 18.

374
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,440
NO ENTRY FOR THOSE UNDER 18

375
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,600
Taoist, I didn't mean to disrespect you.

376
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:39,520
We open a store

377
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
to do business.

378
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:41,919
It's more lively

379
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:44,120
next door.

380
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,600
Why don't you go and check it out?

381
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,399
I'm old.

382
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,800
I can't dance anymore.

383
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:27,639
Taoists, what would you like to drink?

384
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,480
We are waiting for someone.

385
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,399
I'm sorry, but there's a minimum spend.

386
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,399
If so, I'd like a lemonade with more ice.

387
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,000
Okay.

388
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,399
Where is Gong Qing?

389
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,159
You may ask him.

390
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,560
Your lemonade is here.

391
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:42,760
Chief Celestial Taoist.

392
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,919
The Interim Leader of Sinister Pleasure, Gong Qing,

393
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,800
asked me to send you

394
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,120
his regards.

395
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,639
Gong Qing is not here, right?

396
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,159
We can fight you

397
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,760
without the interim leader.

398
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,879
You must have worked hard

399
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:33,439
to gather so many people.

400
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,120
GOLD BRILLIANCE SPELL

401
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,439
Chief Celestial Taoist!

402
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,480
Tell Gong Qing

403
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,679
that in three days,

404
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:08,800
I will be waiting for him at the Ganbei grassland.

405
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:11,600
TIANHE GROUP WAS FOUND TO BE A FRONT

406
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,560
FOR SINISTER PLEASURE'S ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.

407
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:14,000
THE CASE HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED AND HANDLED BY THE RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS,

408
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,960
AND THE SYNDICATE WAS WIPED OUT.

409
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,240
RELEVANT INDIVIDUALS PLEADED GUILTY AND WERE PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY.

410
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,240
YU HUADU, A MEMBER OF SINISTER PLEASURE WAS ARRESTED

411
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,919
FOR KILLING XU XIANG, THE GM OF NDT LUBEI REGION.

412
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,399
NDT ISSUED ARREST WARRANTS

413
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,919
FOR OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED IN SINISTER PLEASURE.

414
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Master.

415
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,960
Huanjin.

416
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:34,720
Huanjin,
I'll go after you.

417
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,600
Sure.

418
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,159
Has everything been arranged on the mountain?

419
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,679
Everything on the mountain

420
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,240
has been handed over to Qianhe.

421
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,000
I appreciate your hard work.

422
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:52,679
Master,

423
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,159
I've let you down.

424
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:01,199
Sinister Pleasure is enormously wicked.

425
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,919
I wouldn't stop you from wiping out Sinister Pleasure.

426
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:07,720
But I'm asking you

427
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,040
to show mercy on someone.

428
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:11,800
Xia He?

429
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:17,240
Xia He still has a shred of conscience.

430
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,240
It's just that she went down the wrong path.

431
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,159
Please give her a chance to turn over a new leaf, Master.

432
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,879
Master.

433
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,399
Have you already

434
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,760
met her?

435
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Lingyu,

436
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,960
get up.

437
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:53,520
Let's head upstairs for now.

438
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,000
It's the first time in the past few years

439
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,399
that I've seen you so anxious.

440
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,360
No matter how anxious I am,

441
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:09,960
it's still too late.

442
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,080
Master,

443
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,480
I'm a good-for-nothing.

444
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,000
I violated your teachings

445
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,000
for a woman from Sinister Pleasure.

446
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,520
I disgraced you.

447
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,679
This woman has a name.

448
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,960
Her name is Xia He.

449
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,399
Lingyu,

450
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,800
isn't it human nature

451
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:39,520
to be anxious about the one you love?

452
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,520
You have been pursuing perfection and avoiding mistakes

453
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,080
since you were a child.

454
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:51,720
But there is no real perfect being

455
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,240
in the world.

456
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,560
I have been hoping

457
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:56,679
for you to make a mistake

458
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,480
for so many years.

459
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,320
Because

460
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,120
it takes more courage

461
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,480
to admit that you are not perfect.

462
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,919
On the last day of the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

463
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,280
you have to make a decision that you don't usually make.

464
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,520
Do you know why?

465
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:20,879
Because you care about other people's opinions too much

466
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,800
and never make your own choices.

467
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:27,320
But if a person wants to grow,

468
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:28,760
he must be brave enough

469
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,560
to be honest with himself

470
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:32,240
and be himself.

471
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,040
As for me,

472
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,280
I am just a passer-by

473
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,480
in your life.

474
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,720
Lingyu,

475
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,399
you finally made a choice.

476
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,000
From now on,

477
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,159
you are no longer a Mount Longhu disciple,

478
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,840
and I am no longer your master.

479
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,280
Go ahead and cry.

480
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,040
You will feel better after this.

481
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:21,199
As I get older, I talk more.

482
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Say no more.

483
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,959
Let Xia He tell you

484
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,840
the rest of the story.

485
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,800
Remember my words.

486
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
All the detours you've taken

487
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,120
are the necessary paths of life.

488
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,080
Xia He is waiting for you at the place where you were late.

489
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,560
Go.

490
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,760
Master.

491
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,760
You're late.

492
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,360
I'm late.

493
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,840
Too late.

494
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,959
But fortunately,

495
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,399
I got here in time.

496
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,639
I waited here for you all night the other day.

497
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,439
But you didn't show up.

498
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,399
I'm sorry.

499
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,080
Only now I do know

500
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,840
what my choice is.

501
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,280
Everyone is looking for us.

502
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,000
You should learn from me and hide yourself.

503
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,000
I have decided to go to the Ganbei grassland.

504
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:28,879
Has Tian Jinzhong's memory been unlocked?

505
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,800
I finally understand

506
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:35,280
why you went all the way to create such fuss.

507
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:38,199
Great, give it to me.

508
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:39,800
Are you sure?

509
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:41,639
It's super exciting.

510
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,439
Stop beating around the bush.

511
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,639
I thought I would miss out on all this,

512
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,080
but I didn't expect that after all the ups and downs,

513
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:26,320
it was still Zhang Chulan.

514
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,840
Congratulations,

515
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,639
you are one step closer to Wu Gensheng.

516
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,520
Is it so?

517
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,320
Why do I feel I'm further and further away?

518
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,480
I have always wanted to be the Leader of Sinister Pleasure

519
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,760
like Wu Gensheng.

520
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,480
Reunite Sinister Pleasure.

521
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,879
Practice the philosophy of Sinister Pleasure.

522
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,159
Staying true to yourself

523
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,360
begins from within.

524
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,360
It's a pity

525
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:55,760
that I am now in this predicament.

526
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
In that case, why don't you find a place to hide now?

527
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,080
Sinister Pleasure can be reformed after the storm.

528
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,639
I can't hide this time.

529
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:02,639
More importantly,

530
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:04,520
Chief Celestial Taoist has an answer

531
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,600
that I must know now.

532
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,400
Once I'm on the road,

533
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,679
there'll be no turning back.

534
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,480
Lyu Liang,

535
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,759
you now possess the biggest secret in the Outsiders' world.

536
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,639
These secrets are extraordinary enough

537
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,600
to cause complete chaos

538
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,520
and even reenact the bloody events of Jiashen Calamity.

539
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,360
This dispute is very likely to start

540
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,319
because of you.

541
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,839
Your decisions are closely linked

542
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,560
to the fate of the entire Outsiders' world.

543
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,120
Do what you want and refrain from what you don't.

544
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,799
There will be corresponding consequences for getting the truth.

545
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,679
Lyu Liang, take extra care of yourself.

546
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:41,199
I guess we'll never meet again.

547
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,960
The consequences?

548
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,360
My whole life is full of consequences.

549
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,480
I have the truth I've been looking for,

550
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,319
and I'm getting closer to it.
