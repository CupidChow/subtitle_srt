1
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:27,320
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,600
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,960
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:44,879
The sect leader is here.

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,360
Everyone, stand in line to welcome our new sect leader.

6
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:06,920
Everyone,

7
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:09,360
would you like to join me

8
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,160
in recreating

9
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,560
the true Sinister Pleasure?

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,560
Lyu Huan,

11
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,759
this day has finally come.

12
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,080
TEN YEARS AGO

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,080
Lyu Huan, come after me.

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,520
LYU HUAN, 10 YEARS OLD

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,520
Lyu Liang, wait for me!

16
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,080
LYU LIANG, 11 YEARS OLD

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,880
Lyu Liang, I'm going to overtake you!

18
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,800
Go faster!

19
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,880
Not so fast, Lyu Huan.

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm catching up!

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,520
Nice job!

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Impressive!

23
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,559
Lyu Huan, don't be sad.

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,920
I'll let you win from now on.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,280
Really?

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,160
Lyu Liang, it's eight o'clock.

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,559
Hurry! Great-grandpa set our curfew at eight!

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,119
Why did they leave?

29
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,039
Outside the pavilion

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,040
By the ancient path

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,760
The green grass joins the…

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,600
We are in big trouble!

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,200
No, you are in big trouble.

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,000
Great-grandpa never scolds me.

35
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,880
The headmaster will do an inspection tomorrow,

36
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,760
so we cleaned the school tonight.

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,640
Lyu Liang, we are from the Lyu family.

38
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,400
Do you think lying will work?

39
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,440
Lyu Gong will draw your memories from this afternoon to check.

40
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,320
Then what should I do?

41
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,920
Come closer. I'll teach you a trick.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,799
-Go faster… -I'm catching up…

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,679
Lyu Liang,

44
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,239
what do I have in my hand?

45
00:02:58,359 --> 00:02:59,760
It's the memory of us

46
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,320
passing 20 levels in the racing game.

47
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,640
Lyu Liang, what did we do this afternoon?

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,560
This afternoon?

49
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,079
Didn't we have class?

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,600
Why can't I remember?

51
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,200
Lyu Liang,

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,519
look.

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,640
Aren't these our memories from this afternoon?

54
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,840
I pulled this out of your head earlier.

55
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,560
I have erased

56
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,679
the memories

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,320
in your head.

58
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,760
How can that be?

59
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,679
The Soul Whisperer

60
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,079
can only extract memories.

61
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,840
It can't erase memories in the head.

62
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,760
Not even Lyu Gong knows how to do it.

63
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,600
The Lyu family's Soul Whisperer can't do this.

64
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,200
The Lyu family isn't the only one that practices Soul Whisperer.

65
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,359
Who did you learn it from?

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,119
An old lady.

67
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,600
That was the first time I discovered

68
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,359
the secret behind Soul Whisperer.

69
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,280
It was also the secret that the Lyu family had kept

70
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,399
for years from the Outsiders' world.

71
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,280
LYU'S FAMILY MANSION

72
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,160
Lyu Liang, you had better be honest with me.

73
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,799
Where did you go this afternoon?

74
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,320
I don't remember.

75
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,480
I must have been in class.

76
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,240
You've gotten really smug now.

77
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,079
You can't even be bothered to make up a lie.

78
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,400
Then I'm going to see what you were up to.

79
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,760
Lyu Gong, it hurts.

80
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,000
Lyu Gong,

81
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,360
you are still so clumsy

82
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,320
in using Soul Whisperer.

83
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,640
Can't you do it stealthily?

84
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,039
As expected, I can only count on Lyu Liang and Lyu Huan

85
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,159
in your generation.

86
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,080
Hello, Great-grandpa.

87
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,320
Lyu Huan,

88
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,280
why are you only having your meal now?

89
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,479
I just came back,

90
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,960
so I got it from the kitchen.

91
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,320
You shouldn't be eating cold food.

92
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,599
I'll make you something hot and fresh.

93
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,479
It's fine, Great-grandpa.

94
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,080
I'm almost done eating.

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,479
This isn't right.

96
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,599
Your memories

97
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,919
from this afternoon are gone.

98
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,680
Did you erase them?

99
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,120
I really don't remember.

100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
Turn your hand.

101
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,840
Three, two, three, four.

102
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,200
Five, six, seven, eight.

103
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,680
Okay, students. Dismissed.

104
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,240
Look. His memories from this afternoon are gone.

105
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,479
You must have broken those memories.

106
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,599
See?

107
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,200
I always told you to practice,

108
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,400
but you refused.

109
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,359
Now you can't even do

110
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,320
such a simple thing.

111
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,280
Who is to blame?

112
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,320
Get up.

113
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:03,200
I'll let you off today.

114
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,159
Huanhuan,

115
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,520
I'll make you something hot to eat.

116
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,919
Does your head still hurt?

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm much better now.

118
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,960
Lyu Huan, what's going on?

119
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:38,039
What is this?

120
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,120
You'll know once I put it back in.

121
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,080
And there's this too.

122
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,479
These are the remaining coins from this afternoon.

123
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,479
Hold onto them.

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,880
What's wrong?

125
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,640
You mentioned an old lady last night.

126
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,280
Who is it?

127
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,320
Where is that old lady?

128
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,840
Is she related to the Lyu family?

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,359
I should have

130
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,919
erased that part yesterday

131
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,440
before returning your memories.

132
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,120
Stop asking.

133
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,520
I won't tell you.

134
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,599
You mustn't tell anyone either.

135
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,359
Pinky promise.

136
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,200
Don't tell anyone for the rest of your life.

137
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,000
I've been pondering a question since last night.

138
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,560
This is my skin and body,

139
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,840
while the Sprite is my memories of over ten years.

140
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,080
So it's me, Lyu Liang, right?

141
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,440
This is the memory I have erased.

142
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,320
Part of the glass is now empty.

143
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,200
What if the memories I pour back in aren't mine

144
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,440
but yours?

145
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:38,360
In that case,

146
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:39,720
what is this now?

147
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,400
Is it still Lyu Liang?

148
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,600
It tastes like Sprite.

149
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,720
It's still Lyu Liang.

150
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,319
What if I empty all the memories in my life?

151
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,240
Then I pour in your memories.

152
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,880
Now, this glass holds Cola.

153
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,920
They are your memories.

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,199
But the glass belongs to me.

155
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,760
So is this Cola or Sprite?

156
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,760
Is it you, Lyu Huan,

157
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,160
or me, Lyu Liang?

158
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,560
DUANMU YING

159
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,360
Who told you this?

160
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,280
My brother, Lyu Liang.

161
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,640
I named it the Cola-Sprite Theory.

162
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:21,520
Lyu Liang.

163
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,959
What does he call Lyu Ci?

164
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,600
The same as me.

165
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,720
We call him Great-grandpa.

166
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,240
The fourth generation of the Lyu family looks promising.

167
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,760
You don't say.

168
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,160
My brother Lyu Wen's baby

169
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,760
was born this morning.

170
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,000
I will be an aunt from now on.

171
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,680
The fifth generation is here now.

172
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:43,800
The fifth generation?

173
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,560
He should be coming today.

174
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,560
Hold her.

175
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,920
Great-grandpa,

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,160
whenever the Lyu family

177
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,760
has a newborn baby,

178
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,280
you place them in the wine cellar.

179
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,199
Why do you do that?

180
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,160
Don't ask why.

181
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,280
Just wait here.

182
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,920
Great-grandpa,

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,079
do you bathe the baby in some wine

184
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,240
so they can possess the Soul Whisperer?

185
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,199
Great-grandpa, did I get it right?

186
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:44,920
Lyu Gong,

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,240
have you entered the wine cellar before?

188
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,319
Was my guess right?

189
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,880
Have you been down there before?

190
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,959
I haven't.

191
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,120
That was all just a guess.

192
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,959
Madam,

193
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,959
how are you related

194
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,760
to my great-grandpa?

195
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,760
Why does he keep you locked up in here?

196
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,520
Listen carefully.

197
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm not some good old lady

198
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,040
or granny.

199
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,560
The Lyu family and I

200
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,079
are sworn enemies.

201
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,199
If you come here again…

202
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,560
I will kill you one day.

203
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:06,439
Quickly go and hide.

204
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:25,319
Take a look.

205
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,560
You didn't take

206
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,560
any of the tonic that I brought you.

207
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,520
You need to get enough nutrients.

208
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:36,079
You are a woman,

209
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,760
but you are so much tougher than Feng Tianyang.

210
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:42,360
Now that I think about it,

211
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,360
I have taken care of you for almost 60 years now.

212
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,959
You are 80 this year, aren't you?

213
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,319
I remember when you first came into the Lyu family,

214
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:55,240
you refused to say a word

215
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:57,079
about the Double Quan Palm.

216
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:58,760
If it were someone else,

217
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:01,400
I would have killed you long ago.

218
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,719
But I was soft-hearted.

219
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,920
I let you live.

220
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,520
I took care of you.

221
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,319
I couldn't bear to let you die.

222
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:19,680
Now it seems

223
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,839
that good things do happen to good people.

224
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,360
My efforts for you

225
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:26,280
were not in vain at last.

226
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,800
It has been so many years since the Jiashen Calamity happened.

227
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,920
I finally figured it out.

228
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,800
The Double Quan Palm

229
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,880
isn't some secret manual.

230
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,760
When I forced you to write it down

231
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,040
so my family can practice it,

232
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,640
you weren't able to write it.

233
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:42,880
That's because it is something

234
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,079
that comes from the blood.

235
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,680
If descendants of the Lyu family

236
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,599
had your blood,

237
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
they would master the Double Quan Palm.

238
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,479
It's too late for me.

239
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,199
It's also too late

240
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,160
for my children.

241
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Since the Lyu family's third generation,

242
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,719
I have been thinking.

243
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,920
How can I make them

244
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,040
have your blood?

245
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,079
I cannot let you die

246
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,079
because descendants of the Lyu family

247
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
need to have your blood.

248
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:42,439
I kept experimenting

249
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,680
and trying.

250
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,439
By Lyu Gong's generation,

251
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,839
I have greatly succeeded.

252
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,880
Especially Lyu Liang.

253
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:54,240
He is able to erase memories.

254
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,520
However,

255
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,439
I changed its name.

256
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,760
I named it Soul Whisperer.

257
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,240
This amount of blood should be enough

258
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,000
for a 3.7 kg baby.

259
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,880
You must take care of yourself.

260
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,760
Once the baby is a month old,

261
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,800
I will need even more blood.

262
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:40,159
I said all that to you just now

263
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,280
because I was hoping you could tell me

264
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,440
all that the Double Quan Palm can do.

265
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,680
Since it can erase memories,

266
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,480
can it also alter memories?

267
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,760
And eventually,

268
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,159
can it create a completely new person?

269
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,440
Whether it can erase memories

270
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:00,720
or alter memories,

271
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,080
those aren't from the blood.

272
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Those have to be learned.

273
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,840
Nonsense.

274
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,200
Then how come Lyu Liang knows it?

275
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,919
Go and ask him.

276
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,720
I will never tell you.

277
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,879
Don't think I won't kill you

278
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,240
just because you are important!

279
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,720
Listen.

280
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,320
The Double Quan Palm has now been passed down

281
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:25,919
to the Lyu family's fifth generation!

282
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,679
From now on, the Lyu family

283
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,040
can give blood to the next generation on our own.

284
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,240
I can kill you anytime.

285
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:52,879
But anyway,

286
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,639
I should thank you for living until 80.

287
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,440
You have provided for five generations of the Lyu family.

288
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:00,639
Because of you,

289
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,159
every drop of blood of the Lyu family

290
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,440
has become very precious.

291
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,720
Very precious indeed.

292
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,200
Come out.

293
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:45,760
Madam,

294
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,320
did I also get a blood transfusion back then?

295
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,399
Do I also have your blood in me?

296
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,840
I had never asked you

297
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,240
for your name.

298
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,080
Lyu Huan. That's my name.

299
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,520
Lyu Huan.

300
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,200
Come closer.

301
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,520
Let me take a look at you.

302
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,879
Earlier, you told me

303
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,399
about the Cola-Sprite Theory.

304
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,879
My mind was a mess earlier.

305
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,480
I didn't catch what you said.

306
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,879
Can you tell me about it again?

307
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,560
LYU ANCESTRAL HALL

308
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,760
Lyu Huan, where were you just now?

309
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,240
What is everyone waiting for?

310
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,879
For Great-grandpa to name the baby.

311
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,840
Every time,

312
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:56,520
we have to wait half an hour for that.

313
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
LYU ANCESTRAL HALL

314
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,600
The baby is here.

315
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,320
-There they are. -What is the baby's name?

316
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,840
Ying.

317
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,159
The name of my child is Lyu Ying.

318
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,840
Please take your seats, everyone.

319
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,960
-Okay. -Good!

320
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,840
Lyu Huan, the banquet is starting!

321
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,040
I didn't pay much attention

322
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,679
to Lyu Huan's strange behavior that day.

323
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,600
But what happened next

324
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,080
changed everything for me.

325
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,600
That's what happened.

326
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,360
What? Lyu Huan was pushed off the cliff by Lyu Liang?

327
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:45,679
They can't even find her body?

328
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,240
In our family, besides Lyu Huan,

329
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,720
the most gifted practitioner of Soul Whisperer

330
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,200
is Lyu Liang.

331
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,040
That kid wouldn't have killed her

332
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,360
due to jealousy, would he?

333
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,879
Where is Lyu Liang right now?

334
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,560
Lyu Gong brought him back to the ancestral hall.

335
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:04,159
What should we do with him?

336
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,080
I will give the family an answer.

337
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,840
Seventh Aunt.

338
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,200
Ask Third Uncle to come to the ancestral hall.

339
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,080
How did it go?

340
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,439
I've questioned him all night,

341
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,919
but he refused to say anything.

342
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I even extracted his memory qi orb.

343
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,240
Look.

344
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,760
Just like last time,

345
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,560
it's empty with no memories.

346
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,760
Lyu Liang,

347
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,600
tell me the truth.

348
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,560
How did you push Huanhuan off the cliff?

349
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,360
Great-grandpa, I really don't remember.

350
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,000
Is Lyu Huan really dead?

351
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,200
She is!

352
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,000
You killed Lyu Huan!

353
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,439
Lyu Huan.

354
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:15,840
Lyu Huan.

355
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,480
Lyu Liang.

356
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,520
Look up.

357
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,720
Who taught you

358
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,679
how to erase memories?

359
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,960
What are you talking about?

360
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,919
Stop playing dumb.

361
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,159
You keep losing your memories.

362
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Great-grandpa even blamed me for messing it up last time.

363
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,840
Great-grandpa, I really don't remember.

364
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,720
Lyu Huan and I are the closest.

365
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,600
I would never hurt her.

366
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,240
That's right. Third Uncle, Seventh Aunt.

367
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,439
You two were there that day.

368
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,840
Tell them

369
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,639
whether I am being falsely accused.

370
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,879
Third Uncle, Seventh Aunt.

371
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:03,480
Please.

372
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,720
Show your qi orbs.

373
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,840
Let him see the truth for himself.

374
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:18,399
We were harvesting in the mountains at the time.

375
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,720
Lyu Liang! Lyu Huan!

376
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,560
It's dangerous! Be careful!

377
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,840
At first,

378
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,720
we didn't notice anything strange.

379
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,560
But Lyu Liang suddenly pushed Lyu Huan.

380
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,280
How can that be?

381
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,800
How could I possibly push Lyu Huan off the cliff?

382
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:45,919
Great-grandpa,

383
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,360
he should be punished

384
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:50,040
according to the family rules.

385
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,080
No.

386
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,360
He cannot die.

387
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,840
Every drop of blood of the Lyu family

388
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,199
is very precious.

389
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,280
Lock him up for now.

390
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,120
Lyu Huan.

391
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,199
Lyu Huan.

392
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,960
Lyu Liang,

393
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,960
I have erased

394
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
the memories

395
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,360
in your head.

396
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,399
How can that be?

397
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,720
The Lyu family's Soul Whisperer can't do this.

398
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,679
The Lyu family isn't the only one that practices Soul Whisperer.

399
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,879
Who did you learn it from?

400
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,960
An old lady.

401
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,480
I had indeed lost that part of my memory.

402
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,679
But how could I possibly kill Lyu Huan?

403
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,080
At the time, everyone in the Lyu family

404
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:47,240
blamed me for Lyu Huan's death.

405
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,199
They kept me locked up in the cellar at the mansion.

406
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,439
They forced me to admit I killed her.

407
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,679
LYU LIANG, 20 YEARS OLD

408
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,040
During those long and dreadful days,

409
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,360
I was waiting for an opportunity.

410
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:05,960
On the day of the family dinner,

411
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,879
Lyu Gong came to mock me.

412
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,199
Finally, the moment had come.

413
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:28,600
Lyu Liang,

414
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:29,720
it has been years.

415
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,600
You still refuse to admit it.

416
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,120
You would rather be locked up here

417
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:34,240
than say a word.

418
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,720
Why does the Lyu family have someone like you?

419
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,360
Lyu Liang.

420
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's okay.

421
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,360
If you refuse to admit it,

422
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,120
we'll keep you locked up in here until you do.

423
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,919
From that moment on,

424
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,879
I was determined

425
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,520
to find Lyu Huan

426
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,840
and the truth behind what happened back then.

427
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,879
All of this is connected

428
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,639
to the old lady that Lyu Huan mentioned.

429
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,080
Where did she and Lyu Huan go?

430
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:10,480
I was determined

431
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,679
to find the truth behind that incident.

432
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,040
In order to find the truth,

433
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,439
I joined Sinister Pleasure.

434
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,600
Lyu Liang from the Lyu Village.

435
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,760
You killed your younger sister,

436
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,679
thus becoming the Lyu family's strongest Soul Whisperer practitioner.

437
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:33,280
You even ran away from home.

438
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,280
The entire Outsiders' world is looking for you.

439
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:38,959
That's impressive, Lyu Liang.

440
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,240
You're crazier than the members of Sinister Pleasure.

441
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,080
I want to become a member.

442
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,840
Do you really want to join Sinister Pleasure?

443
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:54,800
I think you just want Sinister Pleasure's protection.

444
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:56,240
Can't I?

445
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,520
I'm sure my Soul Whisperer will come in handy one day.

446
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:02,679
If you can't make the call,

447
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,000
get the Interim Leader.

448
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,959
There's no need for that.

449
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,480
You can join Sinister Pleasure.

450
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,720
How do I do that?

451
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,240
As long as you declare yourself

452
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,120
a member of Sinister Pleasure,

453
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:19,399
Sinister Pleasure will accept you.

454
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,959
Is it that simple?

455
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,280
It's that simple.

456
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,240
I have always been aware

457
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,240
that it would be difficult to achieve

458
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,760
what I want to do on my own.

459
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,560
Joining Sinister Pleasure

460
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:35,320
was the most suitable move

461
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,919
to realize all my plans.

462
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,159
That's why I hid in the organization.

463
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,760
Be it Interim Leader

464
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,639
or Sinister Pleasure's plans,

465
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,679
it was all part of my plan.

466
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:46,760
I did it!

467
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,720
Through unlocking the memories of Zhang Huaiyi and Tian Jinzhong,

468
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,159
I basically confirmed my speculations.

469
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,639
The Lyu family's Soul Whisperer

470
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,360
is indeed closely connected

471
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,639
to the Jiashen Calamity.

472
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,879
Sinister Pleasure was gone.

473
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,480
All I could do was hide.

474
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,760
I no longer had the strength to keep finding the truth.

475
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,520
This day still came eventually.

476
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,360
I had no choice but to return to that place.

477
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,639
What

478
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,520
was the Double Quan Palm.

479
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,959
Great-grandpa.

480
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:34,560
Just when I thought

481
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:36,360
that all my plans

482
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,879
had to end here,

483
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:42,560
perhaps I received a blessing from God.

484
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:46,240
I was reborn

485
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,520
in darkness.

486
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,159
Even though you killed Lyu Huan,

487
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,560
I'm sure you didn't mean it.

488
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:04,560
I didn't do it!

489
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:07,120
I sincerely wished that you weren't the killer.

490
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:09,040
You deserve to die for betraying your clan.

491
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,879
What is the Double Quan Palm?

492
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:13,159
This is the Lyu family's biggest secret.

493
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,719
You must protect it.

494
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,679
He cannot die.

495
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,280
Every drop of blood of the Lyu family

496
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,760
is very precious.

497
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,520
The Double Quan Palm

498
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,800
is something that comes from the blood.

499
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,240
Lyu Gong.

500
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,719
Lyu Gong?

501
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
Lyu Liang.

502
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,080
No.

503
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,799
This is impossible.

504
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,560
You grew back your limbs.

505
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,159
How did you grow back your limbs?

506
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,279
You're not Lyu Liang.

507
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,239
You're not him!

508
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,639
You punk.

509
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,120
Do you think you're that great now?

510
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,120
How did a stupid and filthy old fool like you

511
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,080
become one of the Ten Elders?

512
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,319
Have you heard of this saying?

513
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:54,400
"Living on to old age

514
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,759
is to be a pest."

515
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,400
You cut off my limbs,

516
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,720
but it became my chance

517
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,520
to obtain the Double Quan Palm.

518
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,720
You don't have to glare at me like that.

519
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,600
My hands and legs

520
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,440
don't belong to the Lyu family anymore.

521
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,319
Let me show you

522
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,120
the true

523
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,720
Double Quan Palm.

524
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,480
ONE OF THE EIGHT SUPREMES

525
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,360
DOUBLE QUAN PALM

526
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,360
You stole Duanmu Ying's Double Quan Palm,

527
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,600
but you barely scratched the surface.

528
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,000
The old lady whom Lyu Huan talked about

529
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,040
was actually Duanmu Ying.

530
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,240
Weren't you eager to obtain the Double Quan Palm?

531
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:04,799
I'll tell you now.

532
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,200
Not only can the Double Quan Palm control memories,

533
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:08,680
but it also allows the body

534
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:10,920
to regenerate.

535
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,360
Go.

536
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,360
Call everyone to the ancestral hall.

537
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,040
Understood.

538
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,960
Sadly, you no longer have the chance

539
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,720
to obtain the Double Quan Palm.

540
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:29,520
LYU ANCESTRAL HALL

541
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,240
Take a look.

542
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,360
These are the livestock you raised.

543
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,279
Eight years ago,

544
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,040
at this very spot,

545
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,160
all of you said I killed Lyu Huan.

546
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,440
But you clearly knew

547
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,160
how much I adored Lyu Huan.

548
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,440
But in the end,

549
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,160
not a single person

550
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,920
came forward to speak up for me

551
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,960
or raise suspicions.

552
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,000
You used the Soul Whisperer to torture me.

553
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,400
You turned my memories upside down.

554
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,240
You forced me to admit to your truth!

555
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,120
You talked about getting justice for Lyu Huan.

556
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,839
But do you really care about lives?

557
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:47,040
You only like to be a hypocrite.

558
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,000
You don't care if anyone dies.

559
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:55,160
Lyu Huan was the only person

560
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:57,640
I could cherish

561
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,520
in this world.

562
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,920
But all of you accused me of killing her.

563
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,440
I never understood it before.

564
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,880
I am also part of the Lyu family.

565
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,799
Why did all of you do that to me?

566
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,759
But I get it now.

567
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,720
That's because this family

568
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,400
doesn't need

569
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:35,920
even a tiny bit

570
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,759
of what is called true happiness.

571
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,120
Growing up,

572
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,160
everyone told me

573
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,960
that every drop of blood of the Lyu family

574
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,600
is very precious.

575
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,319
But in the end,

576
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,799
it was his blood that was the most precious!

577
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,200
You were all aware of it,

578
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:00,480
but you helped him do evil!

579
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,520
Fine!

580
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,600
Aren't you all for evil?

581
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,759
You don't care if your loved ones die, right?

582
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,960
Today, I will give you a taste

583
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:21,000
of what it's like

584
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,440
to lose the person you love most

585
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,040
and all your best memories.

586
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,440
All of you are conspirators

587
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,560
and accomplices.

588
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,759
I will let you live

589
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,960
the rest of your lives

590
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,440
in the beauty of your memories

591
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,160
and the void of reality.

592
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:10,839
This is the ending you deserve.

593
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,759
From today on,

594
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:47,200
call me Sect Leader of Sinister Pleasure.

595
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:49,200
-Yes, Sect Leader! -Yes, Sect Leader!

596
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,480
SECT LEADER OF SINISTER PLEASURE
