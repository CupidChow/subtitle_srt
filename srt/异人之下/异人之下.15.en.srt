1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,080
Hello.
Grandmaster.

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,360
Your Qimen Manipulation was exposed, right?

3
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:24,040
I had no choice.

4
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,959
My opponent was too strong.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,360
I had to use that.

6
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,119
-How did you know I used-- -Why are you coming back to Wudang?

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
After that terrible bloodbath,

8
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:38,199
Wudang suffered heavy casualties.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,320
I've already booked a flight back…

10
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:43,720
The Jiashen Calamity!

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,960
THE 7TH DAY OF THE 2ND MONTH THE YEAR OF JIASHEN

12
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:49,760
Taoist Wang.

13
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,640
Are you guys

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,199
going back?

15
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:57,519
Apparently.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,080
Zhuge Bai.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,599
You should work on your bravery.

18
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,320
Why should I?

19
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,880
I have tons of them.

20
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:11,160
Jeez, you're way too slow.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,399
I'll wait for you down there.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,080
Hey.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,840
Take your own suitcase.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,080
No!

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,080
Why are you struggling with just one suitcase?

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,160
Drop the act, drama king.

27
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,160
What's in your suitcase?

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,080
Bye.

29
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:01,559
Bye.

30
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,919
Right, Taoist Wang.

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,120
Actually, you gave Zhang Chulan the chance.

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,000
But he made his choice.

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,320
I'm here to provide you with a choice,

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,720
not to make the choice for you.

35
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:20,480
Speaking of which, it's your own choice

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,280
to present yourself in Mount Longhu, right?

37
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,000
You…

38
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,600
You used Enhance Hearing against us.

39
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,880
Since you've already made the choice,

40
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,320
no need to feel torn

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,760
or pull a long face.

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,519
I didn't pull a long face.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,880
In fact, you and Zhang Chulan are the same.

44
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,239
You did something you shouldn't.

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,480
Well,

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,239
I actually detest troubles.

47
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,320
But if you're in trouble,

48
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:49,920
I'll give you a hand.

49
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:51,959
It's not that I'll go out on a limb for you.

50
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,239
That sounds rather pretentious.

51
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,760
But I'll do anything in my power

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,320
to help you.

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
Off you go.

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,200
I shouldn't have befriended you.

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,480
I can't have my own secrets.

56
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,440
I need to remain mysterious, you know?

57
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,640
But I want to be your friend.

58
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,720
Bye!

59
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,480
Perhaps I might come to you

60
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,760
when I get bored one day.

61
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,519
I said, I will.

62
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,359
What's with him?

63
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,119
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

64
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,480
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

65
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,799
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

66
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,040
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST TOP EIGHT

67
00:03:57,119 --> 00:04:00,440
FENG SHAYAN VS FENG BAOBAO

68
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,200
Next round,

69
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,480
Feng Shayan

70
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,760
versus Feng Baobao.

71
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:08,440
Feng Shayan

72
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,480
is the elder sister of Feng Xingtong.

73
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,280
She is no pushover.

74
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:14,720
Do you remember

75
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,839
her fight with Jia Zhengliang in the last round?

76
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,200
Mind you,

77
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,760
Feng Baobao isn't weak.

78
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,760
Up till now, we can't figure out

79
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,240
which sect Feng Baobao comes from.

80
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,760
The duel between two tough ladies

81
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,200
must be epic.

82
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,760
Here comes Feng Baobao!

83
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,560
Feng Baobao.

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,240
I've been waiting

85
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,640
to have a spar with you.

86
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:05,840
What are you looking at?

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,360
Zhang Chulan.

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
I'll fight you after this, right?

89
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,440
No problem.

90
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,840
Where are you going?

91
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:15,840
Come back!

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,479
I'm here to remove obstacles for Zhang Chulan.

93
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,919
Given your current strength,

94
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
you're harmless to him.

95
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,760
My job is done.

96
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,479
Feng Baobao,

97
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,320
you're in the middle of the contest.

98
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,760
Do you want to resign?

99
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,880
Feng Baobao, you scoundrel!

100
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,280
Mr. Feng.

101
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,359
What are you…

102
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,640
Never mind.

103
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:55,080
He can handle this.

104
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,359
Shayan,

105
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,840
Last night, I told you to put your feet up.

106
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,280
You don't have to come today.

107
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,280
-Dad-- -I told you before.

108
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:06,359
You're no match for Feng Baobao.

109
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,840
Everyone knows you're injured.

110
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,159
They won't look down on you if you don't come here.

111
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,520
Instead, they will think that you comported yourself well.

112
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,680
I know you have a problem with Feng Baobao,

113
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,719
thinking that you'll lose face if she defeats you.

114
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
Grow up.

115
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,599
No, it's not about that, Dad.

116
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,760
What's your reason, then?

117
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,440
She has already cut you some slack,

118
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,200
yet you wanted to raise a fist against her.

119
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,320
Do you think your behavior is dignifying?

120
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,760
Apologize to Feng Baobao

121
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
and admit your defeat.

122
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,560
By minimum cost,

123
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,440
do you mean me?

124
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,240
Yes.

125
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,479
Shayan,

126
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,320
you're the only one in this family

127
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,599
who doesn't harness Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

128
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,599
But you should know

129
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,120
that I've never held it against you.

130
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,599
Isn't that right?

131
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,000
Feng Baobao.

132
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,880
I…

133
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,960
Cut that out!

134
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:07,760
Taste this.

135
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:18,680
Zhengliang.

136
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,840
Listen to me and stop this game.

137
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,880
You should know where you are.

138
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,200
Why must I listen to you?

139
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,200
Don't you lecture me.

140
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,400
You're her father, not mine.

141
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,120
You can't tell me what to do.

142
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,799
Don't talk to my dad like that.

143
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,560
I'm helping you.

144
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Zip it!

145
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:32,599
Feng Baobao.
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880
I'm the one to blame.

147
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,919
Why are you apologizing to her?

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,520
You've been wanting to challenge this opponent this whole time.

149
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,440
Is that so wrong?
You're furious because you feel humiliated.

150
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:40,520
Is that wrong too?

151
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:41,760
You obey any orders he gives.

152
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,880
You're his child,

153
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
not his dog.

154
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,039
I said, zip it!

155
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
Stay here if you want.

156
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:51,919
Dad.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,479
I've crossed the line.

158
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,960
I admit my defeat.

160
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,640
Shayan.

161
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,000
Feng Baobao.

162
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,280
I'm sorry about my girl.

163
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,320
Shayan.

164
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,239
Wait for me, Shayan.

165
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,280
Shayan.

166
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,679
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

167
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Also, you beat me so hard.

168
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,560
How nice.

169
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,840
Feng Shayan versus Feng Baobao.

170
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,039
The winner is

171
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Feng Baobao.

172
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,679
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST TOP EIGHT

173
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,039
FENG BAOBAO ADVANCED TO THE TOP FOUR, FENG SHAYAN IS ELIMINATED

174
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,840
I don't think this is good, though.

175
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,079
This was going to be my first real fight here.

176
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,480
But now I've effortlessly advanced to the final.

177
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,480
Are you happy?

178
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,120
Next round,

179
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:42,400
Round of 16.

180
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,439
Feng Xingtong

181
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,760
versus Wang Bing.

182
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,120
FENG XINGTONG, WANG BING

183
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,680
Really?

184
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,720
Do you possess a qi spirit too?

185
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,319
Very well.

186
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,079
It's time for me to show mine off.

187
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,280
This is ridiculous.

188
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,400
This is a humiliation for Master Kunsheng.

189
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,199
-Exactly. -He summons Master Kunsheng

190
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,160
as if it's a pet.

191
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,319
Chairman Feng.

192
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,079
You're here too, Mr. Wang.

193
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,240
My grandson Wang Bing

194
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:27,680
is against Xingtong in this round.

195
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,319
Of course, I must be here.

196
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,800
Come on, Master Liu.

197
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,680
Please lend me your power.

198
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,839
Hey, come down.

199
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,240
Animal,

200
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:48,439
come to my summon now.

201
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,079
Dispatch of Detained Spirits?

202
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,000
Mr. Wang.

203
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,360
-You-- -Watch the match.

204
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,000
Do you know that too?

205
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,439
He's not invoking the qi spirit.

206
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,199
He's consuming the qi spirit instead.

207
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,000
Once I consume that animal,

208
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,319
I'll become invincible.

209
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,640
Oh, no! Master Liu is in danger.

210
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,079
Let's fight them!

211
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
Gentlemen.

212
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,199
Do you not know the rules?

213
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,360
You're not allowed

214
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,319
to intervene.

215
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,240
I, Deng Youcai--

216
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:47,480
Youcai! Don't do it.

217
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,400
Don't invoke any qi spirits

218
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,360
in front of them.

219
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:53,880
Master Liu has never suffered such a humiliation

220
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,240
when it was with us.

221
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:59,319
The one who stole Master Liu from you was Feng Xingtong.

222
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,760
Put your blame on this brat.

223
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,480
Darn it!

224
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,520
I guess I'm left with no choice.

225
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,400
Grandpa Zizhong,

226
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,120
I'm counting on you now.

227
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,719
If I'm not mistaken,

228
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,880
this qi spirit

229
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,880
is the medical savant Mr. Wang Zizhong, am I right?

230
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,120
Grandpa Zizhong,

231
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:30,800
please transform into needles

232
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,839
as a supplementary.

233
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
Pierce into my major meridians

234
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,240
to circulate the qi throughout my body.

235
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,880
Even though it's going to have a severe impact on my body,

236
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,600
that's the best option for now.

237
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,760
I can never allow Master Liu

238
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,280
to be taken by this twerp.

239
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,920
Brat!

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,920
You are determined to screw things up for me, huh?

241
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,040
Master Liu,

242
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,959
come

243
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,800
here!

244
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:58,959
Detained Spirit.

245
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,800
Set free.

246
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,120
Thank you, Xingtong.

247
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,880
Take Master Liu and leave.

248
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,000
Leave Zhangxi.

249
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,120
Now!

250
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,959
Wang.

251
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,920
I admit--

252
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,199
I won't allow it.

253
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Let go of me.

254
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,439
Bloody hell.

255
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,079
You made me miss such a wonderful tonic.

256
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,400
Compensate for my loss!

257
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,800
Right, I almost forgot it.

258
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
The thing you invoked just now was intriguing.

259
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,199
Show yourself.

260
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,880
Sheesh, an old man?

261
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,280
Fine.

262
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,800
Let me taste it.

263
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,199
I shall see what I can get

264
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,560
after eating this old man.

265
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,040
Let go of Grandpa Zizhong.

266
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,959
Let go of him!

267
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,000
Come back!

268
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,280
Darn it!

269
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,760
I've reached my limits.

270
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,599
Grandpa Zizhong.

271
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,880
Dear Xingtong,

272
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,360
you're going to inherit my healing skills.

273
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:26,560
All right?

274
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,280
FENG XINGTONG, SIX YEARS OLD

275
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,240
Sure!

276
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:30,319
FENG XINGTONG, SIX YEARS OLD

277
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,680
Zhenghao.

278
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,079
I asked for you

279
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:43,880
because I want to know more

280
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,000
about Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

281
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,079
Is it as amazing as you said?

282
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,959
Well, I was drunk last time, and I was just bragging.

283
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,439
Cut that out.

284
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,880
We're friends, aren't we?

285
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,439
I know the weight

286
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,199
your word

287
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,920
can carry.

288
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,040
Zhenghao.

289
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,040
Let me be frank with you.

290
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,920
I'm nearing my end.

291
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,160
At one's death, their primordial spirit disperses,

292
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,439
their qi turns into thin air,

293
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,800
while the body turns into earth.

294
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,120
Can Dispatch of Detained Spirits

295
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,400
keep the primordial spirit intact

296
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:26,199
and nourish the wielder

297
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,439
in the form of a qi spirit?

298
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,760
In addition, the wielder can inherit

299
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:31,880
the primordial spirit's ability.

300
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:32,880
Is that true?

301
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,160
Yes.

302
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,760
I'm sorry to tell you that it's true.

303
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,479
Xingtong.

304
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,479
Come here.

305
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,920
Are you calling me, Grandpa?

306
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,280
Tell me.

307
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,280
Has your father taught you that?

308
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,199
Yes.

309
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,439
You'll inherit my healing skills

310
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,439
after my passing, all right?

311
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,839
-Sure! -How dare you!

312
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,959
Don't yell at him.

313
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
You're scaring him.

314
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,160
Sit here.

315
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,199
My boy is too insensible.

316
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,880
But what you said just now

317
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,560
-is kind of reckless. -Reckless?

318
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,760
Will the spirits you detained

319
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,199
suffer?

320
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,680
No, they won't.

321
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,000
Unless we mean to harm them.

322
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:12,360
That's perfect, then.

323
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,319
But I revere you as a senior.

324
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,199
The Feng family must not summon you like a tool--

325
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,439
It's okay.

326
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,520
Bodies have their limits, but primordial spirits could be retained.

327
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,959
I've already donated

328
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,120
my body.

329
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,680
After my death,

330
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,880
they can use it for research purposes.

331
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,560
To be helpful to the younger generation

332
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,680
is something wonderful

333
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,760
for a physician like me.

334
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,959
Zhenghao.

335
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,959
I adore this boy.

336
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,400
And I trust you too.

337
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,599
I'm counting on you.

338
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,479
Sir.

339
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,719
Is it because

340
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,400
you can't forget about your wife?

341
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:01,319
You want to stay in this world for a while more,

342
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,640
even with your primordial spirit.

343
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,760
Zhenghao.

344
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,319
Please.

345
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,599
Xingtong.

346
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,680
Kneel.

347
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,640
Grandpa Zizhong.

348
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,120
Get up.

349
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,160
Grandpa Zizhong.

350
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I adore this boy.

351
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,400
After my death,

352
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,240
please make my primordial spirit

353
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,760
useful.

354
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,359
Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

355
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,200
Crush it into thin air.

356
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:17,119
Scatter.

357
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,680
Grandpa Zizhong.

358
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,520
I'm so sorry.

359
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:41,120
Mr. Feng.

360
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,760
How petty of you.

361
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,760
You'd rather shatter this old thing

362
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,680
than give him to me.

363
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,399
Chairman Feng.

364
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,040
It's only a match between two young men.

365
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,399
Let's not intervene, all right?

366
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,560
This is not a match.

367
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:06,040
Wang Bing is going to kill Xingtong!

368
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,000
Chairman Feng.

369
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,680
Just now, you asked me

370
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,840
how our family managed to master Dispatch of Detained Spirits, no?

371
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,120
The one who imparted us with the skill

372
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,240
is your own grandfather,

373
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,159
Feng Tianyang.

374
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,960
What are you doing?

375
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,080
How dare you--

376
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,840
The contestant has already fallen.

377
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,720
This match has ended.

378
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:47,480
If you haven't had enough fight

379
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,800
you can fight me.

380
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,679
Get that arrogance off your face.

381
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,800
Even your Chief Celestial Taoist

382
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:58,360
has to respect my great-grandpa.

383
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,360
Feng Xingtong versus Wang Bing.

384
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,679
The winner is

385
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,760
Wang Bing.

386
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:12,120
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST TOP EIGHT

387
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:16,639
WANG BING ADVANCED TO THE TOP FOUR; FENG XINGTONG IS ELIMINATED

388
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,200
Where are you going?

389
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,919
That old geezer can't even manage his grandson well.

390
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,240
I'll do it for him.

391
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,159
Stand right there.

392
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,399
Chairman Feng.

393
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,720
My grandson has crossed the line.

394
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,679
I told him to hold back.

395
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,000
I didn't expect

396
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,520
Xingtong would hurt so badly.

397
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
Shayan. You may leave.

398
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,320
Leave the room.

399
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,800
She can stay.

400
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,879
Mr. Wang.

401
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
You should tell me

402
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,600
how your family

403
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,879
managed to master Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

404
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,800
Like I said,

405
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:44,679
it was your grandfather who taught us.

406
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,399
I know you don't believe this.

407
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,560
But think about it carefully.

408
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:54,200
As descendants of creators the Eight Supremes,

409
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,960
Zhang Huaiyi

410
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,520
and Zhang Chulan

411
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,080
have been in hiding

412
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:01,919
for their whole life.

413
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,440
But the Feng family

414
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,280
have been living such a glorious life.

415
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,320
It's because my father

416
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,520
protected your family back then.

417
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,440
Back then, after your grandfather, Feng Tianyang,

418
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,480
was separated from the other traitors,

419
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
he fell into the hands of the Wang family.

420
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:33,800
Mr. Wang.

421
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:35,879
I beg of you!

422
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,639
I will do anything for you

423
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,000
as long as you spare me.

424
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,919
Mr. Wang, please!

425
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,560
I beg of you!

426
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:48,080
I didn't expect Feng Tianyang to be so spineless.

427
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:49,919
He kept begging my father

428
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,560
to spare his life,

429
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:53,080
and he promised to do anything for us.

430
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,720
If you hand over the skills of Dispatch of Detained Spirits

431
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,879
to the Wang family,

432
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,679
I'll let you live.

433
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,000
Not only that, I'll keep your whole family safe

434
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,560
with the influence of the Wang family.

435
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:03,480
Feng Tianyang didn't hesitate.

436
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,439
Aside from handing over the skills,

437
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,000
he swore to Heaven

438
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,760
that he wouldn't impart the complete skills

439
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,720
to his descendants, if he had any.

440
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,360
To repay our kindness,

441
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:33,720
he even gave away

442
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,600
the names of the Eight Supremes he knew.

443
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:38,320
Sadly,

444
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,960
he didn't know about the other Eight Supremes

445
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,840
that thoroughly.

446
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:46,399
Eventually, the other leaders

447
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,600
agreed to spare Feng Tianyang.

448
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:50,480
They probably knew

449
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
about the deal between my father and Feng Tianyang.

450
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:53,480
Therefore,

451
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,639
they didn't ask for his skills.

452
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,439
Because everyone

453
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,080
knows clearly

454
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:02,439
that whoever captures the creator

455
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,720
will obtain the Eight Supremes.

456
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,320
Why

457
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,800
didn't the elders mention this before?

458
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,200
Sit.

459
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,679
This was highly confidential

460
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,520
in the Outsiders' world back then.

461
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,159
Naturally,

462
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,639
you wouldn't know about it.

463
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,080
You know about it now, huh?

464
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,840
The glories that you enjoy now

465
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,800
are all thanks to each and every kowtow

466
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:30,879
that Feng Tianyang did

467
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,480
and his betrayal against his accomplices.

468
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,040
The Wang family

469
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,960
protected you.

470
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,280
How do you feel now?

471
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,280
Mr. Feng.

472
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,399
Your grandfather

473
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,320
never told you

474
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:52,120
about this glorious story, did he?

475
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,800
Dad!

476
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,280
You enlightened me.

477
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,840
I've been accepting Wang family's kindness

478
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:16,240
and yet I didn't know about it.

479
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,560
My hubris blinded me,

480
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:19,639
and I even thought I could deal with you as an equal.

481
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,320
Feng Zhenghao. Don't give me that.

482
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:23,520
To be frank,

483
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,800
I truly

484
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:27,320
despise you.

485
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,520
Mr. Wang,

486
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,120
it's understandable that you loathe me.

487
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,480
Looking back

488
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,280
on my shameful act before you,

489
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm so ashamed that I want to find a hole to crawl into.

490
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
What are you doing?

491
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:51,280
I kowtow

492
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,159
not because of you.

493
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,280
I kowtow

494
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,879
to appreciate your father's kindness in sparing the Feng family.

495
00:24:57,639 --> 00:24:59,000
From now on,

496
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,000
I, Feng Zhenghao,

497
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,800
am at your beck and call.

498
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,760
All-Encompassing Guild

499
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,679
is at your service.

500
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,520
What are you doing?

501
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,360
Come on. Get up.

502
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,439
You don't have to do this, Chairman Feng.

503
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,280
I was just reminiscing about the old past with you.

504
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,600
Chairman Feng.

505
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:19,800
No need to overthink it.

506
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,480
No.

507
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,320
You're right to have enlightened me.

508
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:25,320
Today,

509
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,240
I came here to clear up your confusion.

510
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,360
Chairman Feng, you're a sensible man.

511
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:32,679
I'm glad about this.

512
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,000
Well, it's getting late.

513
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,439
Wang Bing has a match tomorrow morning.

514
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,320
I shall leave now.

515
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:39,040
Sure. Let me see you out.

516
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:46,199
Our families have such a long history before.

517
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,720
We should get closer to each other.

518
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,679
Exactly.

519
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,960
Well, you may stop here.

520
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,360
Mr. Wang. Take care.

521
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
Shayan.

522
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,840
You can't accept what has happened just now, right?

523
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,520
I knelt not because I was afraid of them.

524
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,240
My concern is that the Jiashen Calamity would resurge.

525
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,040
Compared to this secret,

526
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,600
that mere grudge

527
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,159
is nothing.

528
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,159
You have to endure this.

529
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,520
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST TOP FOUR

530
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,639
FENG BAOBAO, ZHANG CHULAN, ZHANG LINGYU, WANG BING

531
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,159
FENG BAOBAO, ZHANG CHULAN

532
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,399
Feng Baobao and Zhang Chulan, please enter.

533
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,159
Feng Baobao.

534
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,919
Let's start.

535
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,679
Go
to

536
00:26:58,679 --> 00:26:59,560
hell!

537
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:01,399
Feng Baobao.

538
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,960
Zhang Chulan.

539
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,679
I'll finish you!

540
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,760
You're great, Zhang Chulan.

541
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,840
I'm no match for you.

542
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,399
Zhang Chulan

543
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,280
versus Feng Baobao.

544
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,439
Zhang Chulan won.

545
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,399
-It's rigged! -It's rigged!

546
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,800
-We want a refund! -We want a refund!

547
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:56,840
By the way, fellow audiences,

548
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:58,439
no one is allowed

549
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,720
to intervene in the middle of a match.

550
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,360
But when the match is over,

551
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:05,360
Celestial Taoist Mansion isn't responsible

552
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,320
for what happens in the arena.

553
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:11,000
-Shameless! -Punch him!

554
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,199
Ms. Bao, get up now.

555
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,320
We're busted.

556
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:18,280
Get up now.

557
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,919
I can't stand this anymore.

558
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,480
I must go down

559
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,800
and punch the crap out of him!

560
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:24,879
Zhang Chulan!

561
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,560
You're dead meat!

562
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:27,800
Charge!

563
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,760
Lian.

564
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
I'm at my limits now.

565
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,320
Rascal.

566
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:38,399
Do you take us for a fool?

567
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,800
Put some effort into your acting, wouldn't you?

568
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:42,639
You're infuriating!

569
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:51,760
They have such keen eyes, right?

570
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,639
They can even figure this out when my acting is so convincing.

571
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,919
Are you kidding me?

572
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,959
That was the dumbest acting I've ever seen.

573
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,000
Zhang Lingyu.

574
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,399
Come on and start now.

575
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,679
They won't beat me if you start your match right now.

576
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,080
I will still beat you.

577
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,879
After finishing him, I'll beat you up tomorrow.

578
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,800
This is bad.

579
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:13,320
This brat has totally ruined our company's image.

580
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:15,360
That's too fake indeed.

581
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:17,320
Why couldn't they pretend

582
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,760
using my 18 Formidable Ways?

583
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,800
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST TOP FOUR

584
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:40,800
ZHANG LINGYU VS WANG BING

585
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,399
What else have you got?

586
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,000
Show them all.

587
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,199
You're not going to take this down.

588
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:22,320
DISPATCH OF DETAINED SPIRITS

589
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,439
Go!

590
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,480
LIGHTNING PALM

591
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,399
How can this be?

592
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,879
No one can defeat me.

593
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,560
You're a fake!

594
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,159
No one could beat my skills this easily.

595
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:42,120
Impossible.

596
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,679
It's Feng Xingtong's fault.

597
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,000
He should've let me swallow his Serpent Spirit.

598
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,480
That old guy, Lu Jin, is wrong too.

599
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,080
Why did he present Infinite Heavenly Talisman

600
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,639
as the prize?

601
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,959
Great-grandpa is wrong too.

602
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,679
He shouldn't have sent me for the contest!

603
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,560
He should have just asked for it from Lu Jin!

604
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,080
Are you done?

605
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,879
I thought the most shameless rascal I'd seen

606
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,080
was Zhang Chulan.

607
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,720
To my surprise,

608
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,120
you're worse.

609
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,800
You're wrong.

610
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:17,360
All of you are wrong.

611
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,840
Not only are you shameless,

612
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:21,840
but you're also a wimp.

613
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,360
I was born

614
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,199
to be at the summit.

615
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,199
Obtaining everything I want is my privilege.

616
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:46,439
I want Master Liu.

617
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,760
I want Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

618
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,360
They should all be mine.

619
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:54,439
But

620
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:58,320
why are there so many obstacles in my way?

621
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:00,719
Why are trashes like you

622
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,080
in my way?

623
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,399
You're wrong.

624
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,520
All of you are…

625
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,840
Wang Bing versus Zhang Lingyu.

626
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:16,199
The winner is

627
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Zhang Lingyu.

628
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,679
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST TOP FOUR

629
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,560
ZHANG LINGYU ADVANCED TO THE FINAL WANG BING IS ELIMINATED

630
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,240
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST FINAL MATCH

631
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,360
ZHANG CHULAN, ZHANG LINGYU

632
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:26,280
THE FINAL MATCH

633
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,280
Lingyu.
Come here.

634
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,679
Let's have breakfast together.

635
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,800
Yes, Master.

636
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:33,760
Lingyu.

637
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,439
I held this contest

638
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,480
for the sake of Zhang Chulan.

639
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:39,360
Do you blame me?

640
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,120
I wouldn't, Master.

641
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:43,120
You don't blame me,

642
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,240
or you dare not to blame me?

643
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,840
Master.

644
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,280
I'm indebted to you.

645
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,439
Your personality, character, and cultivation

646
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,639
are my lifelong pursuits.

647
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:55,280
Hence, I'll never blame you

648
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,639
for whatever decision you made,

649
00:32:57,639 --> 00:32:59,120
even if I don't understand it.

650
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,280
Well,

651
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm relieved

652
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:05,159
to hear this from you.

653
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,520
Before the final match,

654
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,280
I have something to tell you.

655
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,040
You don't have to be concerned

656
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,480
about me.

657
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,959
Do your best.

658
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,719
Cut him down to size.

659
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,800
I mean, the grandson of that big-eared Zhang Huaiyi.

660
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,520
After many vigorous rounds,

661
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,120
the senior member of Celestial Taoist Mansion,

662
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:40,360
ZHANG LINGYU

663
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:42,320
and the inheritor of Qi Apotheosis,

664
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,360
Zhang Chulan

665
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,840
have advanced to the final match

666
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:48,240
of the 100th Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

667
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,639
It starts now.

668
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,280
Bring it on.

669
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,159
Show me what you've got.

670
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
Today, between you and me,

671
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,199
only one of us

672
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,719
will walk out of this arena.

673
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,960
FINAL SHOWDOWN BETWEEN CHIEF CELESTIAL TAOIST'S CANDIDATES
