1
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:26,919
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,400
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,040
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,559
NDT EXPRESS

5
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,640
They said they would see me off.

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,480
In the end, none of them turned up.

7
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,440
Let's go!
Chulan.

8
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:54,839
Xu San? Xu Si?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,440
What's with all the luggage?

10
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,080
I thought you guys were seeing me off.

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,800
We applied for leave from the company.

12
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,440
We'll spectate you on Mount Longhu. We'll treat it as a vacation.

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,560
Tell the company not to worry.

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,600
I'll definitely be the champion.

15
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:10,560
You don't need to go.

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,399
Who said we were keeping you company?

17
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,479
It's not like you're the only one who's attending

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,960
the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,039
Didn't they say

20
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,080
only a few people like me were able to attend it?

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,479
Who else is attending it?

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,960
The rules changed long ago.

23
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,280
Wait for me!

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,560
Wait for me!

25
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:35,199
Ms. Bao is going too?

26
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,280
So I was just Ms. Bao's training partner all along?

27
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,679
You aren't good enough

28
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,119
to be my training partner.

29
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,720
Ms. Bao, since you're going, there's no point for me to go.

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,640
Don't worry.

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,240
Baobao is there to deal with difficult opponents on your behalf.

32
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:54,839
How?

33
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,559
You'll know by then.

34
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:07,800
All done.

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Please raise your arms.

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,120
Higher.

37
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,000
What is this?

38
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,840
A toy.

39
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,799
What about this?

40
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:01,440
That's a toy too.

41
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,720
Security!

42
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,760
Remember to save me!

43
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:10,120
ZHANGXI PROVINCE

44
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,519
I won't say much.

45
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,840
You must keep a low profile when we arrive at Mount Longhu.

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,880
Most of the people who have heard about you

47
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,160
will try to plot against you.

48
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,920
Remember to always conceal your identity.

49
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,239
Hurry! It's him!

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,799
He's here!

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,120
Hurry!

52
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:34,840
Am I that popular now?

53
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:37,920
Did you even understand what I said just now?

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,679
Yes, I did. Keep a low profile, right?

55
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,480
I'll lay low.

56
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,280
-Zhuge Qing! -Zhuge Qing!

57
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,959
ZHUGE QING FROM THE ZHUGE FAMILY OF LUDONG

58
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,399
Come on! Hurry!

59
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,760
One, two, three!

60
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,560
-Zhuge Qing, my love! -Zhuge Qing, my love!

61
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,560
-I gave you my heart! -I gave you my heart!

62
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,959
-Love you! -Love you!

63
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,120
LOVE QING

64
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,479
So he's Zhuge Qing?

65
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,599
He can't act or fight at all.

66
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,599
Why is he popular?

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,960
It doesn't make sense at all!

68
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,640
Who's that?

69
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:27,200
Who do you think you are?

70
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,560
Xu Si, am I right?

71
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,400
Listen.

72
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,640
Zhuge Qing and I are the same.

73
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:36,680
We were born on the same day.

74
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,200
Didn't you know?

75
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,360
Zhuge Qing is here to attend the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,840
He's an idol.

77
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,320
Why is he attending the contest?

78
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,240
As a spokesperson?

79
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,120
He did just become the spokesperson of a rum brand.

80
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,560
Don't belittle him.

81
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,520
He's the best successor of the Zhuge family.

82
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:55,159
He's also favored to win the championship.

83
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,080
That means

84
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,560
he's the biggest obstacle you'll face on your way to be the champion.

85
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,240
Zhuge Qing's signature is so cool!

86
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,719
I want one too!

87
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,719
Here.

88
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,159
Zhuge Qing, sign here!

89
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,320
Love you!

90
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,039
Love you guys too.

91
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,760
What kind of stupid contest is this? I can't even bring my PA here.

92
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,599
Zhuge Bai, please look after me.

93
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,080
Zhuge Qing,

94
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,400
are you that popular?

95
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:45,840
Of course.

96
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,159
You see,

97
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,760
I would've been famous across the world

98
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,440
if it's not for the fact that I am a member of the Zhuge family

99
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,880
and that I have missions to accomplish as an Outsider.

100
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,200
I just don't know how long this stupid contest will take.

101
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,039
I have a new drama shoot starting next month.

102
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,880
Zhuge Qing, I'm sure there'll be plenty of experts this time.

103
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,880
Zhuge Bai, you're already an expert yourself.

104
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,039
I'm serious.

105
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,039
It's just that you haven't left the house for some time.

106
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,159
You don't know

107
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,400
how strong you are.

108
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,039
Let's forget about the seniors for now.

109
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240
Among our peers,

110
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,960
we only need to be wary of Zhang Lingyu.

111
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:16,960
The rest

112
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,120
are not worth our attention.

113
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,560
I heard that there's a person called Zhang Chulan.

114
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,520
He's the successor of a certain apotheosis.

115
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,400
Maybe he's super strong.

116
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,039
No matter if it's Qi Apotheosis

117
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,440
or Infinite Heavenly Talisman,

118
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,159
my true goal for joining this contest

119
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,640
is to see what kinds of other techniques

120
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:34,440
are comparable to the secret technique of the Zhuge family.

121
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, no.

122
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,400
What's wrong?

123
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,159
I forgot to bring my sunscreen.

124
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,599
Zhuge Bai, it's sunscreen, you know?

125
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,960
Buy one for me online right now.

126
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,520
Buy me one with a strong SPF.

127
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,320
They do deliver it to Mount Longhu, right?

128
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:11,719
Mount Longhu is the best.

129
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,479
You can only see a landscape like this here.

130
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,120
It's much better than what I saw in the promotional film.

131
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,840
Of course, it's different when you come here personally.

132
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,840
After all, it's a blessed land that was passed down a millennium ago.

133
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:23,880
It's a place filled with talented individuals.

134
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,440
You should enjoy the view while you can.

135
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,440
You won't be in the mood once the contest starts.

136
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,159
Why are you going inside?

137
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,680
Have you bought your tickets?

138
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,440
I'm here to attend the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

139
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,520
I don't care. You have to buy a ticket first.

140
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,039
To be honest,

141
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,799
Chief Celestial Taoist invited me here.

142
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,479
This is my invitation card.

143
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:01,200
I don't care!

144
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,359
Ms. Bao, how do we differentiate between Outsiders and ordinary people?

145
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,719
We have a gesture.

146
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,840
All Outsiders know about it.

147
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,120
What do you mean by that? Go and buy your tickets! Hurry!

148
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,960
I just want to see how silly you can be.

149
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,239
I bought the tickets long ago.

150
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,159
Is it 250 yuan per person?

151
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,439
Everyone is equal when it comes to entrance tickets.

152
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,079
By the way, don't go around by yourself when we reach there later.

153
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:42,559
Is there a toilet nearby?

154
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,959
I think it's over there.

155
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:46,360
Wait, Baobao is missing.

156
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
She was still here just now.

157
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,400
Where's the toilet?

158
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,680
I think it's over there.

159
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,680
Thank you.

160
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,000
I need to use the toilet.

161
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,959
Ms. Bao, what are you doing?

162
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,560
This mister over here is the 127th sect leader of Beggars' Gang.

163
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,439
He said he wanted to read my palm because of my unique constitution.

164
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,880
Beggars' Gang? And he knows how to read palms?

165
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,000
Young lady,

166
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,199
judging from what I've seen,

167
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,240
you have an affinity with Beggars' Gang.

168
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:18,439
Really?

169
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,040
You see, fate has led us to meet.

170
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,439
Today, I'll show you

171
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,720
the treasure of the sect.

172
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,280
This is a heavenly item

173
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,199
called the Red Spotted Glass Beads.

174
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,520
It's a treasure that the ex-ex-sect leader found here a few centuries ago.

175
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:38,680
When the sect leader was training here,

176
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,400
he encountered a 10,000-year-old fire dragon.

177
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,319
They fought for more than 80,000 rounds.

178
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,120
It was perilous and intense!

179
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:46,640
Listen! They were…

180
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,839
Young lady,

181
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,800
that's not the point.

182
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,640
The thing is, our sect leader made this

183
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,959
using the core he extracted from the dragon after killing it.

184
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
It's the Red Spotted Glass Beads!

185
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,040
I'm sure fate led us to each other today.

186
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,600
Listen. I'm not asking for 98,000 yuan

187
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,839
or 9,800 yuan.

188
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm only asking for 998 yuan. Don't you think it's cheap?

189
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:10,280
It's so cheap. I'll buy it!

190
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,240
Baobao,

191
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:13,199
he came all the way here just so he could slay a dragon.

192
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,400
How could you believe that?

193
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,400
This was only made after 80,000 rounds of intense fighting.

194
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,360
I want it!

195
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,560
She's paying 998 yuan for nothing.

196
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,800
How much higher is her wage compared to mine?

197
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,680
You should go if you can't hold it in.

198
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,920
Don't break them.

199
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,360
WASHROOM

200
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,040
What's the matter?

201
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,240
It's nothing.

202
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,719
If so, why are you staring at me?

203
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,480
I was just looking around casually.

204
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,120
Do you call that casual?

205
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,400
I'll file a complaint

206
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,719
to your superior.

207
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,719
You must be Zhang Chulan.

208
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:41,160
Do you know me?

209
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,199
Are you an Outsider too?

210
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,040
Why are you attending the contest?

211
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,360
If you're an Outsider,

212
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,480
you should know about my story.

213
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,680
I heard that you were affiliated

214
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,680
with Mount Longhu somehow.

215
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,640
All of my secrets

216
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,199
are related to Mount Longhu.

217
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,839
So if I become the champion,

218
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,640
I can meet Chief Celestial Taoist and ask him about my secrets.

219
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,839
So you're attending it to see Chief Celestial Taoist, huh?

220
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,920
But you're wrong about one thing.

221
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,120
What is it?

222
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,160
It isn't that difficult

223
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,000
to see Chief Celestial Taoist.

224
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,880
What do you mean by that?

225
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,040
Follow me.

226
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,280
Chief Celestial Taoist, look here. Look here!

227
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,040
Chief Celestial Taoist, take one step forward.

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,800
Chief Celestial Taoist, take one step forward.

229
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,199
Give me a cool pose.

230
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,400
Wait, he's Chief Celestial Taoist?

231
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:52,719
I told you already.

232
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,800
It isn't that difficult to see Chief Celestial Taoist in person.

233
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,680
Is Zhang Lingyu attending the contest too?

234
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,880
Of course.

235
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,760
He's Zhang Lingyu, you know?

236
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,760
Chief Celestial Taoist, can you answer a few more questions?

237
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:05,719
My master is tired.

238
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,160
If you guys have any questions, you guys may ask me.

239
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,199
Chief Celestial Taoist?

240
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:12,480
I'm Wang Ye from Wudang Sect.

241
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,959
Greetings, Chief Celestial Taoist.

242
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:16,480
He's so thick-skinned.

243
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,079
He called himself the King of Wudang?

244
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,240
Wang Ye?

245
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,880
How's your grandmaster doing?

246
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,040
So his name is Wang Ye?

247
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,400
He's as energetic as ever.

248
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,719
Chief Celestial Taoist, look.

249
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,079
Look who I've brought to you.

250
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,120
You must be Chulan, right?

251
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,520
Call me Grandmaster.

252
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,800
Your grandfather

253
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,480
imparted the Gold Brilliance Spell and Lightning Technique to you.

254
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,400
Although you aren't a disciple of Mount Longhu,

255
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,760
I'm your grandfather's senior.

256
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,839
So

257
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,160
you have to address me as Grandmaster.

258
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,959
Grandmaster.

259
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,040
Lingyu,

260
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:04,040
this is Zhang Chulan,

261
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,160
whom I asked you to invite.

262
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,599
You guys have already met, right?

263
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,520
Yes.

264
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:08,640
Zhang Lingyu,

265
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:09,760
I did some thinking.

266
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:10,959
When it comes to seniority,

267
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
I have to address you as Martial Uncle.

268
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,160
Lingyu,

269
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,880
you can entertain our guests.

270
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,199
I need to speak with Chulan.

271
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,360
Yes, Master.

272
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:25,839
Be careful, Grandmaster.

273
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,240
Grandmaster,

274
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:36,880
has this place always been like this?

275
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,199
Yes.

276
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,360
Look at this well.

277
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:43,199
The water is still clear and sweet even after a millennium has passed.

278
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,880
Back then, my master produced elixirs

279
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:45,800
with this very water.

280
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,160
Your grandfather and I

281
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,199
had to come here and get water for him every day.

282
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,079
Back then…

283
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,880
Forget it.

284
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:56,880
Here.

285
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,680
Try it.

286
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,400
What's the matter?

287
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,079
Grandmaster, it's nothing.

288
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,479
I feel like you're just like my grandpa.

289
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,959
Both of you feel endearing to me.

290
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
We had the same master.

291
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,079
Of course, we're similar.

292
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Have a seat.

293
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:27,079
Speaking of which,

294
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,319
you don't resemble Huaiyi at all.

295
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,719
That dwarf.

296
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,079
How did he get himself such a capable grandchild?

297
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,280
My goodness.

298
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,280
I always thought that my grandfather's name was Zhang Xilin.

299
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,640
I only found out that his name was Zhang Huaiyi recently.

300
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,199
That's a fake name he used to prevent any trouble.

301
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,319
You won't find anything with that name.

302
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,640
Grandmaster,

303
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,680
actually, I'm here

304
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,240
because I have something to ask you.

305
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:59,640
You can ask me any question after you become the champion.

306
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,800
Grandmaster, I don't like to fight.

307
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,120
I just want to know the truth.

308
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,199
But I don't have the answer you're looking for.

309
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,520
You have to win the contest.

310
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,520
Only then

311
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:10,880
can you inherit Tianshidu.

312
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,959
The truth you wish to know

313
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,400
is inside Tianshidu.

314
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,680
Everyone is talking about Tianshidu.

315
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,199
What exactly is Tianshidu?

316
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,240
You'll know once you become the champion.

317
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:21,800
Grandmaster,

318
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,680
there are all sorts of top-tier martial artists

319
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,400
joining this contest.

320
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:27,959
I'm not sure if I can win the contest.

321
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,640
Why don't you tell me something

322
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,520
on my grandfather's account?

323
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,880
You were daring enough to come here and participate

324
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,479
in the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

325
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,839
I'm sure you know whether you can win the contest or not.

326
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,160
There are two parts to Mount Longhu.

327
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,120
All this while,

328
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,560
they're holding a Buddhist ritual in front of the mountain.

329
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,040
Many tourists will be attending it.

330
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,880
But the Outsider Martial Arts Contest

331
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,599
is a sparring contest between Outsiders.

332
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,760
Ordinary people

333
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:54,160
won't be able to see them.

334
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,240
I'm sure you have noticed it coming from the front.

335
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:59,319
There are tourists everywhere.

336
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,719
We have no way

337
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,079
to erect a wall

338
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,560
to prevent them from watching.

339
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,319
However,

340
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,240
Mount Longhu has a natural advantage.

341
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,680
Tourists can never reach the place

342
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,720
the Outsiders can.

343
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,079
What kind of place is it?

344
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
The contest venue

345
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,080
is on the opposite mountain.

346
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:48,399
Guys, please go ahead.

347
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,960
I think a place like this

348
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,960
usually has cable cars lying around.

349
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,840
All of you are talented youths

350
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,280
with extraordinary abilities.

351
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,720
The Outsider Martial Arts Contest

352
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,639
is an important stage for you guys to exhibit your skills.

353
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,080
It's something extraordinary.

354
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,879
Therefore, you have to use the main path

355
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,000
to get on the main road.

356
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,560
Main road?

357
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,560
Where exactly is the road?

358
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:32,879
Celestial Taoist Mansion

359
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,560
always does such useless stuff.

360
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,159
Slow down.

361
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,399
Don't choke.

362
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,399
I know.

363
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
Here, have some garlic.

364
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,080
Did you see that? Have some water.

365
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,480
My younger sister is the best.

366
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,520
How many skewers you've taken on our way here?

367
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,520
Are you that hungry?

368
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Aren't you Deng Youfu and Deng Youcai?

369
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:50,120
Hold it right there!

370
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,280
What Deng Youfu?

371
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,240
Please address me as

372
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,720
-Smith. -Cut it out.

373
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,600
What Smith?

374
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,600
How many years have you studied overseas?

375
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,720
Do you know where North even is?

376
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,159
No matter how you pretend,

377
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,000
you still grew up eating the food

378
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,720
grown by our parents.

379
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,280
You cannot forget your roots.

380
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:11,360
Sister, grab onto me.

381
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,280
All right.

382
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,560
Love you.

383
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,520
Dad! We have to hurry!

384
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,639
Sweetheart,

385
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,840
I'm going to let go now.

386
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:22,960
Okay!

387
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,240
Here you go!

388
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,159
Your dad is pretty daring, huh?

389
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,320
Sweetheart!

390
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:41,879
I'm coming!

391
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,159
Dear, I know my fault now!

392
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,639
I'll skin you alive if you dare to throw our daughter like a chakram again!

393
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,159
Dear, I won't do it again!

394
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,919
I detect abnormal qi values inside this suitcase.

395
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,760
I think there's something hazardous inside.

396
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,760
Everyone, stand back!

397
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Move aside. Don't move.

398
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,480
Senior, what's wrong?

399
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,399
Let me do it.

400
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,120
What are you doing here?

401
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,760
What are you looking at?

402
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,600
I'm just checking their luggage

403
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:34,919
to see if they've brought any restricted goods.

404
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,800
Don't be afraid. It'll be fine.

405
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:39,560
Just walk ahead bravely.

406
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,240
Our company has the best doctor in the Outsiders' world.

407
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,440
Even if you fall from here, I'm sure they can save you.

408
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,000
Ms. Bao, are you trying to console me here?

409
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:11,840
Ms. Bao,

410
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,879
why don't you go first?

411
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,639
You're making me nervous.

412
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,080
If I go first,

413
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,919
you'll definitely turn back.

414
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,919
Excuse me. Please make way.

415
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:29,879
Ms. Bao, are you okay?

416
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,360
Sorry about that!

417
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,080
JIA ZHENGLIANG FROM THE JIA FAMILY OF THE NORTHWEST

418
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,679
I'm Jia Zhengliang.

419
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,439
I have a useless brother

420
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,120
called Jia Zhengyu.

421
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,399
I heard that he was beaten up by a female employee of NDT

422
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,960
a few days ago.

423
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,439
I heard that she has long hair

424
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,560
and a messy look.

425
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:03,879
I think you're wearing NDT's uniform.

426
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:12,800
What are you doing?

427
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,679
Feng Baobao,

428
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,320
no matter what kind of trash he is,

429
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:27,720
he's still my elder brother.

430
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,280
I'm looking forward to our fight later.

431
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,560
By then, I will avenge that idiot

432
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:34,639
in front of everyone.

433
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,360
Chulan, don't waste your energy.

434
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,879
Relax.

435
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,600
I'll transport you there with telekinesis.

436
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,879
No need for that!

437
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
It's not embarrassing for me to climb there myself!

438
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,240
It's embarrassing when I need other people's help!

439
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,280
You guys are not waiting for me at all?

440
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,560
How is it?

441
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:41,520
Can you still stand?

442
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:47,879
I'm totally fine.

443
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,040
This is

444
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
a piece of cake for me.

445
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,600
Is this

446
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,159
the Outsiders' world?

447
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,159
I'll see if there's anything fun here.

448
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,240
Ms. Bao, where are Xu San and Xu Si?

449
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,480
They went to check the stage.

450
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Zhang Chulan?

451
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,520
Mr. Feng? Are you here too?

452
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,360
Yes. Are you here to join the contest?

453
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,360
My sister is here too.

454
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,520
Do you still remember

455
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,480
you two almost got married before this?

456
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:46,639
Ms. Feng…

457
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,879
Hello, I guess.

458
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,280
Feng Baobao?

459
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,439
Have you already recovered?

460
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,600
Who are you?

461
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,080
I'm Feng Xingtong.

462
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,080
We met at All-Encompassing Guild--

463
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,320
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

464
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,360
You were seriously wounded back then. I was so scared.

465
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,800
-How did you recover-- -Feng Baobao.

466
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,040
You defeated almost everyone in All-Encompassing Guild back then.

467
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,800
Today, I shall engage you in a match

468
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,360
in the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

469
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
Chulan, don't worry.

470
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,639
We aren't targeting

471
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,159
Tianshidu or Infinite Heavenly Talisman this time.

472
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,320
My dad just became one of the Ten Elders after all.

473
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:33,560
Members of the family

474
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:35,399
should show their support by coming here.

475
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,080
This time, you're the main lead.

476
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:40,760
Everyone in the Outsiders' world is talking about you.

477
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,159
You know the Gold Brilliance Spell and Lightning Technique

478
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,320
without being a disciple of Mount Longhu.

479
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:47,639
Everyone wants to see you.

480
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,439
Can you lower your volume?

481
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,399
Do you need me to borrow a microphone for you?

482
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:53,879
Some people can speak loudly

483
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,199
even without a microphone.

484
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:05,879
Let's give a big hand

485
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,800
to our youthful Outsiders!

486
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:09,280
It's time for them

487
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,840
to make their appearances!

488
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,960
All right. The first to enter the venue

489
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,280
is one of the most remarkable individuals among them.

490
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,800
He's both an idol and an expert martial artist.

491
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:15,480
The descendant of Zhuge Liang himself.

492
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,199
The most outstanding sorcerer,

493
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,679
Zhuge Qing!

494
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,280
His Qimen techniques

495
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,320
can neutralize his opponents' attacks immediately.

496
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,080
He's definitely a force to be reckoned with.

497
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,639
All right.

498
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,000
Next up is

499
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,760
Wang Ye from Wudang Sect.

500
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,879
Look at the state he's in.

501
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,840
I'm sure he hasn't slept a wink for seven days

502
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,600
to prepare for the contest.

503
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:38,000
He's so undisciplined.

504
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,480
All right. Next,

505
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,919
coming inside

506
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,840
is the moneygrubber, Bai Shixue.

507
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,320
She may look pure and frail,

508
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,040
but she's known for her ultimate technique,

509
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,240
which is devouring other people's Qi.

510
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
Who knows

511
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:52,919
how much qi she has devoured until now?

512
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,720
This contest has gathered

513
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,560
all kinds of young and talented Outsiders.

514
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:58,760
Some of them are already pretty famous.

515
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,520
Some of them are making their first appearances,

516
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,879
but they're strong as well.

517
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,800
They have limitless energy and bravery that all youngsters have.

518
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:06,240
Let us hope

519
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
that they can spar with each other

520
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,960
and break their limits in this contest!

521
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,560
Besides Tianshidu,

522
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:12,800
the winner will also

523
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:14,960
receive Infinite Heavenly Talisman!

524
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,760
This has never been seen before

525
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,040
thoroughout history!

526
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,840
I heard that many contestants are sure that they will win.

527
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:23,760
This contest will definitely be an intense one.

528
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,159
All right. Next,

529
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,560
coming inside

530
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,480
is the Feng Siblings from All-Encompassing Guild.

531
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,800
Feng Shayan and Feng Xingtong!

532
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,040
Look!

533
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,399
The Feng Siblings

534
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,080
have brought their servants

535
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:38,600
with them as well!

536
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:40,639
SERVANT A, SERVANT B

537
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,879
ZHANG CHULAN, FENG BAOBAO

538
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,240
Servant?

539
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,000
Was he referring to me?

540
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,959
Lastly, the crowd favorite

541
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,000
is entering the venue.

542
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,360
It's Zhang Lingyu from Celestial Taoist Mansion!

543
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,360
I heard that he has perfected his techniques,

544
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:25,639
Gold Brilliance Spell and Lightning Technique.

545
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,399
He's super strong!

546
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,399
-Lingyu! -Lingyu!

547
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,320
-The perfect being! -The perfect being!

548
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:42,840
-Lingyu! -Lingyu!

549
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:44,399
-The perfect being! -The perfect being!

550
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,199
-Zhuge Qing, my love! -Zhuge Qing, my love!

551
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,480
-I gave you my heart! -I gave you my heart!

552
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,199
-Zhuge Qing, my love! -Zhuge Qing, my love!

553
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,000
-I gave you my heart! -I gave you my heart!

554
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:03,439
Don't take it to heart.

555
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,840
I assume you haven't seen all these people before.

556
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:10,439
Let me introduce them to you.

557
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,439
Look, the guy with a coat

558
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,040
who looks like a crosstalk artist,

559
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,120
that's Xiao Xiao. He's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

560
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,360
The girl beside him

561
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,879
is Zhi Jinhua.

562
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:24,399
Let's forget about her abilities for now. She's very intelligent.

563
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,120
You see, the more intelligent a woman is,

564
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,080
the scarier she is.

565
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,480
Why are you helping me out?

566
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,040
My dad hasn't given up yet.

567
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,399
He still wants you to join All-Encompassing Guild.

568
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:42,760
Of course,

569
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,679
it would be better

570
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,439
if you could become his son-in-law.

571
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,679
I can make things more comfortable for you.

572
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,560
The toughest opponents you will face

573
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,480
might be those two.

574
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,639
The crowd favorites

575
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,800
of the contest

576
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,439
are already

577
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,240
sizing each other up!

578
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,439
I'm the descendant of Zhuge Liang,

579
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,840
Zhuge Qing.

580
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,199
I'm Zhang Lingyu

581
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,320
from Mount Longhu.

582
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:24,840
-Zhuge Qing, my love! -Zhuge Qing, my love!

583
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:26,000
-I gave you my heart! -I gave you my heart!

584
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,560
-Zhuge Qing, my love! -Zhuge Qing, my love!

585
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:29,639
-I gave you my heart! -I gave you my heart!

586
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,120
I have long admired you, Lingyu.

587
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,399
I never expected to see you here in person.

588
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,199
You're flattering me.

589
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,480
I'm just a Taoist living on a mountain.

590
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,120
There's nothing noteworthy about me.

591
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,600
You're too modest.

592
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:45,080
Actually, I came to Mount Longhu

593
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,639
so that I could spar with you.

594
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:50,040
I'm ashamed.

595
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,560
The monastic should let go of all conflicts and desires.

596
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:54,040
However, I'm still looking forward

597
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,080
to your ultimate technique.

598
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:58,159
Why is Zhang Lingyu so popular?

599
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,719
It's because

600
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,159
he's the perfect being,

601
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,520
Zhang Lingyu.

602
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:09,040
Don't tell me he has the seal too.

603
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,840
I'm looking forward to our match too.

604
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,800
The perfect being, huh?

605
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,240
Spiritual Master Lingyu.

606
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,360
Do you still remember me?

607
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:29,959
I had meals in your temple before.

608
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,120
As for him, you should've seen him before.

609
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,120
I heard that the match between you two ended as a draw.

610
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,560
Is that true?

611
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,679
You should speak up more if you don't know what to say.

612
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,240
He hates me in the first place.

613
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,520
Don't say something like ending as a draw.

614
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,520
Zhuge, Xingtong,

615
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,399
I shall take my leave. We shall meet again next time.

616
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,159
I will take my leave too.

617
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,199
You were ignored.

618
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,919
So you said

619
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,639
you knew everyone here?

620
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,600
Didn't I tell you before?

621
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:13,719
Well,

622
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,760
I may be mediocre when it comes to superpowers,

623
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,240
but I'm definitely great

624
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,679
at gathering intel.

625
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,159
Seriously?

626
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,280
Your intel is all trash.

627
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,399
Mr. Feng.

628
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,280
The key to gathering intel

629
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,639
is deciding the main points.

630
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:28,679
Do you get that?

631
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,280
Gathering intel from everywhere

632
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,719
without classifying them

633
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,159
is the act of an amateur.

634
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:34,840
Zang Long,

635
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:36,560
what are you doing here?

636
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,199
Why can't I be here?

637
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,959
You're so capable,

638
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,480
so you must know him, right?

639
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,000
I already told you.

640
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,600
I only gather intel related to important individuals.

641
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,399
I don't have time to analyze a layman.

642
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,560
The Eight Supremes are here.

643
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:58,360
I'm sure everyone will give it their all.

644
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,480
Bai Shixue

645
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,360
held a prize quiz recently.

646
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,919
We can make a bet.

647
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,240
It's a bet on who will win the contest.

648
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,120
Zhuge Qing is the second favorite contestant.

649
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:09,440
Zhang Lingyu is the most favorite contestant.

650
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,159
However,

651
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,279
there's one more person I'll recommend.

652
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:15,520
Although he's the third favorite contestant,

653
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,319
he gives out a solid performance.

654
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,600
Who is it?

655
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,679
Zhang Chulan.

656
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,319
The successor of Qi Apotheosis.

657
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,040
However,

658
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,239
I heard

659
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,199
that he doesn't know how to use Qi Apotheosis.

660
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,560
That's impossible.

661
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,000
He already used it twice before.

662
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,239
He used it on Zhang Lingyu

663
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,239
and Zhuge Qing.

664
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:40,440
Qi Apotheosis is an extraordinary technique.

665
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,920
When he uses the technique,

666
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,639
the sky will change colors and the world will be turned upside down.

667
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,560
The two fights

668
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,839
were intense

669
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
and exceptional.

670
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,120
They leave behind a trail of death everywhere they go.

671
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,239
He gave both Zhang Lingyu

672
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:55,560
and Zhuge Qing a sound beating.

673
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,799
He's amazing.

674
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,680
Yes. I'm not lying.

675
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:02,839
Will you bet on him?

676
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,279
I'll bet 1,000 yuan on Zhang Chulan.

677
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,680
-Ms. Bao, have you lost your mind? -Hey, what are you doing?

678
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:08,720
Not only are you not supporting my business,

679
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:10,240
but are you also stopping her?

680
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:11,279
Here.

681
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:15,400
Got it.

682
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,720
Girl, what's your name?

683
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,560
I'm Feng Baobao.

684
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,720
Feng Baobao?

685
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:22,839
Girl, are you here to be a Celestial Taoist too?

686
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,400
I'm not here to be a Celestial Taoist.

687
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,400
Zhang Chulan is here to be a Celestial Taoist.

688
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,040
My job is to get rid of all the opponents that get in his way.

689
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,759
Now, let's give a big round of applause

690
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:45,600
to the main organizer of this contest.

691
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,440
Coming from Celestial Taoist Mansion of Mount Longhu,

692
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,960
the 99th Chief Celestial Taoist,

693
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,440
Zhang Zhiwei!

694
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,680
Everyone,

695
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:04,920
sorry for the long wait.

696
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,440
Besides being an annual worship event,

697
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,720
the Outsider Martial Arts Contest has always been a chance

698
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:15,400
for qi practitioners to interact with each other.

699
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,440
Since you guys are raring to go,

700
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,680
I won't take up your time.

701
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:22,640
This time,

702
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,759
there are 128 contestants in total

703
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,720
for the current Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

704
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:29,040
However,

705
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,400
there will only be one champion.

706
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,759
The 100th Outsider Martial Arts Contest

707
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,960
begins now!
