1
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,919
Dad.

2
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,920
Where?

3
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:34,960
Do I have to go?

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,320
Fine.

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,280
Come on, Shayan.

6
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,879
Something came up. I can't go. Go ahead without me.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,559
That won't do. You have to go.

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,600
You guys can go ahead.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,640
I'll arrange it for you.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,720
He should be somewhere on this street.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,399
BARBECUE STALL

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,280
Zhang Chulan?

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,039
Are you

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,479
talking to me?

15
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,039
It's him. Get him in the car.

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,280
How can he be so gross?

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,039
Don't let him in.

18
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,240
Get another car here.

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,880
What are you doing?

20
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,839
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

21
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,039
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

22
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,840
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

23
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,799
Mr. Zhang,

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,920
you're awake.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,040
Where am I?

26
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,959
This is the pool

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,120
in the presidential suite of All-Encompassing Hotel.

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,720
How did I end up here?

29
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:26,640
Well,

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,200
you are our VIP guest.

31
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:30,640
How can I be a VIP guest here?

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,400
Because someone booked this room for you.

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,720
Who?

34
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:34,680
Come on.

35
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,359
Get him changed.

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,320
Yes.

37
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,560
Who are you?

38
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,959
Where are my clothes?

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,760
I threw those rags away.

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,079
Seriously? Those were expensive!

41
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,959
Never mind. You wouldn't get it.

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,880
That's right.

43
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,280
Why am I here?

44
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,560
Follow me.

45
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm talking to you! Show me some respect!

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,679
I'm doing my best

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
by not beating you up.

48
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,560
Are you an Outsider too?

49
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,840
I guess you're not that dumb.

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,000
Only Outsiders are interested in me.

51
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,160
What's your superpower?

52
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:42,480
Picking up men from the streets?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,880
Don't flatter yourself.

54
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,600
By my standards,

55
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,000
you're not even a man.

56
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,760
Where are we going?

57
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,839
Who are you taking me to?

58
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,799
You'll know once you're inside.

59
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,399
What's the big deal?

60
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,959
It's just a hall.

61
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,880
Broaden your horizons while you can.

62
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,399
You won't get this chance again.

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,720
What?

64
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,720
Why did you stop?

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,280
My toes are itchy.

66
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,159
Immature.

67
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,120
Your company isn't doing all that well.

68
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,840
There's barely anyone here.

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,440
It's a far cry from NDT Express.

70
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,080
It's so-so.

71
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:29,920
It's only valued at 300 billion.

72
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,520
Don't touch anything.

73
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:32,880
You can't afford to pay for it.

74
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,039
Valued at 300 billion?

75
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,520
Is this All-Encompassing Guild?

76
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,159
ALL-ENCOMPASSING GUILD

77
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,320
ALL-ENCOMPASSING GUILD

78
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
ONE OF THE EMERGING SECTS OF THE OUTSIDERS' WORLD.

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,440
A FAMILY BUSINESS FOUNDED BY FENG ZHENGHAO.

80
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,919
PRIORITIZES PROFITS ABOVE ALL.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,120
THEY HAVE BUSINESSES ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

82
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,000
IN RECENT YEARS, IT HAS RISEN TO BECOME A POWERFUL FORCE.

83
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,760
What's your connection to Feng Zhenghao?

84
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,960
He's my dad.

85
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,599
My name is Feng Shayan.

86
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,280
FENG SHAYAN, YOUNG LADY OF ALL-ENCOMPASSING GUILD

87
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,479
Ms. Feng,

88
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
I'm sorry about earlier.

89
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,159
Here, let me add you on social media.

90
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,320
Behave yourself when you meet my dad.

91
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:27,599
Come in.

92
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,800
Chulan!

93
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,840
FENG ZHENGHAO

94
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,960
Welcome!

95
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,479
CHAIRMAN OF ALL-ENCOMPASSING GUILD

96
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,840
Chulan.

97
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,840
Chairman Feng.

98
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,120
We finally meet. Let me introduce you.

99
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,640
This is Master Jia Zhengyu who came from the West.

100
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,599
He's famous in the Outsiders' world.

101
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,280
I'm trying to recruit Master Jia

102
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:50,880
to join our guild.

103
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,800
Chulan,

104
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,440
I extend the same invitation to you.

105
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,599
Do join our guild.

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,520
Chairman Feng, I really know nothing

107
00:05:58,599 --> 00:05:59,680
about Qi Apotheosis.

108
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
It's all right.

109
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't rush your decision.

110
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,280
Think it over.

111
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,440
This is my daughter, Shayan.

112
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,640
Have you become acquainted?

113
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,039
What do you think?

114
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,200
We just met.

115
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,479
You can try to woo her.

116
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,840
You can't expect her to be the one pursuing you.

117
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:20,080
Well,

118
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,599
Chairman Feng, why don't Iâ€¦

119
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,240
Master Jia, please wait in the parlor.

120
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,799
Shayan, wait.

121
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,039
You too, Chulan. Come here.

122
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,400
Have a seat.

123
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:34,919
Shayan, make a pot of good tea.

124
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,080
Take a seat.

125
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,280
Chairman Feng,

126
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,719
you've never met me.

127
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,280
You don't know anything about me,

128
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:51,080
and you're trying to set me up with your daughter?

129
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,120
Don't you think you're going too far

130
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,479
for Qi Apotheosis?

131
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,479
Chulan,

132
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,400
I do know things about you.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,719
You grew up with your grandfather.

134
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:01,560
He died when you were ten.

135
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,400
You've been in an orphanage ever since.

136
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,680
Isn't that right?

137
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:07,479
That's quite a thorough investigation.

138
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,200
After learning that you're the descendant

139
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,880
of the creator of Qi Apotheosis,

140
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,400
I ran a background check on you.

141
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,599
I learned

142
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,200
that you have a good character.

143
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,320
And your powers live up to my family's expectations.

144
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,239
As a dad,

145
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,560
it's not strange that I would want to entrust my daughter

146
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,799
to someone like you.

147
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,719
Besides, Sinister Pleasure

148
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,760
couldn't get anything from you.

149
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,799
More importantly,

150
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,560
you're a contender for Tianshidu.

151
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,159
That makes you even more appealing.

152
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,599
It's true that we don't know each other,

153
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,680
but our ancestors

154
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,599
had a close connection.

155
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,520
Our ancestors

156
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,520
held the same power.

157
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:45,680
They were created

158
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,919
in the last Year of Jiashen.

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,960
No one knows

160
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:49,880
how they came to discover these powers,

161
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,039
but they shocked the entire Outsiders' world.

162
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,799
There are eight powers in total,

163
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,000
what we know today as the Eight Supremes.

164
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:58,479
Your grandfather, Zhang Xilin,

165
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,200
was the beholder of Qi Apotheosis.

166
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,520
My grandfather, Feng Tianyang,

167
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,200
passed Dispatch of Detained Spirits

168
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,719
down to me.

169
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,840
It's also one of the Eight Supremes.

170
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,479
The Eight Supremes?

171
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
May I see it?

172
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,599
When you become a member of our guild,

173
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,919
I will show you everything.

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,239
This is also

175
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
why I want you to join the Feng family.

176
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,919
We both inherited the Eight Supremes.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,159
Become part of my family.

178
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,760
Let us uncover the truth together.

179
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,359
I told you not to make a decision now.

180
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,199
You can rest up here.

181
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,360
Consider this your home.

182
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,400
Get some rest.

183
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,800
Dad!

184
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,240
Are you actually setting me up with that brat?

185
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,280
Brat?

186
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,959
Do you think NDT Express

187
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
would take an interest in a mere brat?

188
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,000
Zhang Chulan is worth

189
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:57,600
far more than you can imagine.

190
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,520
Right now,

191
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,280
he had a falling out with NDT Express

192
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,079
and has no one to turn to.

193
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,880
This is our best opportunity to rope him in

194
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,439
with minimum cost.

195
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
By minimum cost,

196
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,240
do you mean me?

197
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Yes,

198
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,120
but it's not only you.

199
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:20,839
Compared to what Zhang Chulan brings to the table,

200
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,240
all costs are trivial,

201
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,880
including myself.

202
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,720
Right now, Zhang Chulan

203
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,640
is a blind box.

204
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,160
If he really possesses Qi Apotheosis,

205
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,600
combined with our Dispatch of Detained Spirits,

206
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,040
we will be closer than anyone else

207
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,880
to uncovering the true secret of the Jiashen Calamity.

208
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,760
I've told you many times.

209
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,760
This is the greatest treasure in the world.

210
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,120
The weight of this deal

211
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:46,640
is worth more than every investment

212
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,480
All-Encompassing Group has ever made.

213
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,680
The opportunity is right before us.

214
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,959
How can we not seize it?

215
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
What about me?

216
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,400
So am I just a bargaining chip to you?

217
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:02,360
I have many ways

218
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:03,760
to make Zhang Chulan stay.

219
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,240
There is only one reason

220
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:08,760
why I involved you.

221
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,520
It's for your future happiness.

222
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,160
What future happiness will I have

223
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,680
from dating someone like him?

224
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,480
One mustn't judge a book by its cover.

225
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,760
Zhang Chulan might seem useless now,

226
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
but there is one thing I am sure of.

227
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,760
His heart is in the right place.

228
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,199
He is someone trustworthy.

229
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:34,920
Come here, Shayan.

230
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:39,400
In our position,

231
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,680
a lot of people and matters

232
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,959
are not what they used to be.

233
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
The people who approach you have their own agenda.

234
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,480
It's even harder to judge

235
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,400
if someone is worth trusting.

236
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,040
Zhang Chulan doesn't try to woo you

237
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,199
or hide his vulgarity

238
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,680
and tactlessness

239
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,800
because he has

240
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,199
no designs for you.

241
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,199
But I don't like him.

242
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,680
Shayan,

243
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,640
you're the only one in this family

244
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,880
who doesn't harness Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

245
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,319
But you should know

246
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,240
that I've never held it against you.

247
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Isn't that right?

248
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:24,680
NDT EXPRESS

249
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,079
I messed up.

250
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,400
Zhang Chulan left.

251
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,199
I messed up.

252
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,719
-Sorry, this number is unavailable. -I messed up.

253
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,360
I messed up.

254
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:35,600
Zhang Chulan left.

255
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,120
That Zhang Chulan is something.

256
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,319
-I messed up. -He turned Baobao into a depressing mess.

257
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
He was brought to All-Encompassing Guild last night.

258
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,520
Zhang Chulan left.

259
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,439
I messed up.

260
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,120
-Hey, Wang. -Zhang Chulan left.

261
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:49,240
How much does it cost to remove a leg?

262
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,400
Can you stop fooling around?

263
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,040
What if he actually joins their guild?

264
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,360
Why are you so riled up?

265
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:57,000
Just have Baobao bring him back.

266
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:58,719
It's not that big of a deal.

267
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,120
It's not that easy.

268
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:02,160
He left because he had a falling out with Baobao.

269
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,520
I messed up.

270
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,959
Zhang Chulan left.

271
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,760
-Only she can fix it. -I messed up.

272
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:07,880
Talk to her.

273
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:08,959
Not a chance.

274
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,199
Baobao has never given in to anyone in all these years!

275
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,520
What do you suggest we do, then?

276
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,560
How are we going to explain it to Dad

277
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,160
if he joins All-Encompassing Guild?

278
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,800
I'll apologize to him.

279
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
I'll find Zhang Chulan

280
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:27,800
and tell him I was wrong.

281
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,600
Wait, Baobao!

282
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,319
You can't go like that.

283
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,719
Let me give you a makeover.

284
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,319
A makeover?

285
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,680
An apology should be passionate.

286
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,160
Look how lively she is!

287
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,640
Nobody apologizes dressed like that!

288
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:51,680
Baobao, put your hand down.

289
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,400
Xu Si,

290
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,959
I find your taste to be highly disagreeable these days.

291
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,199
It's too dirty.

292
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,199
My taste?

293
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,120
If it were up to me,

294
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:07,480
I would get some guys to beat him up

295
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,040
and drag him back.

296
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,480
Do you not like my way?

297
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
You do it, then.

298
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,599
Baobao

299
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,719
has a good complexion.

300
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,560
She just doesn't know how to dress herself.

301
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,839
Look.

302
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,719
She looks lovely.

303
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:28,880
With her height,

304
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,040
doesn't she look

305
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,760
like a knowledgeable beauty in the city?

306
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Xu San,

307
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,760
I knew you had an eccentric aesthetic,

308
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,640
but I didn't think it would be this bad.

309
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,800
Is Baobao going to a job interview?

310
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,360
An apology should be sincere.

311
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,520
More importantly, the recipient should feel her sincerity.

312
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,560
Fine.

313
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,599
You win, Xu San.

314
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:55,760
Did you want to see me, Xu Si?

315
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,199
Baobao.

316
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,439
Calm down, Baobao.

317
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,120
She's one of us. Calm down.

318
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,800
Yes, Ms. Bao.

319
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,000
I've already accepted NDT Express's punishment.

320
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:10,680
I'm on probation.

321
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,000
Please give me a chance

322
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,360
to redeem myself!

323
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,800
Win-win.

324
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,199
Save the pleasantries for later.

325
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Liu Yanyan,

326
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,400
give us a hand.

327
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,560
She doesn't need too much work.

328
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,360
The key is a clean and good posture.

329
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,360
So heels are essential.

330
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,120
They make your physique look taller,

331
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:37,479
your body shape better,

332
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,680
and your booty firmer.

333
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,000
Baobao!

334
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:43,439
Are you sure about this?

335
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,240
Baobao,

336
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,079
you have to be careful.

337
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,040
All-Encompassing Guild is an Outsider group.

338
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,959
-Baobao. -Its members are all strong Outsiders.

339
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,400
Feng Baobao,

340
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:02,160
don't tell me you've never worn heels.

341
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,520
Ms. Bao,

342
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,120
since I already used my superpower,

343
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,599
does that make me an Outsider now?

344
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,839
If so, should I return to being a normal person tomorrow?

345
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,240
Or should I act like an Outsider?

346
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,079
I said, come back!

347
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,719
Zhang Chulan.

348
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,240
This is Mr. Liang.

349
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:36,400
He's an expert TCM physician hired by the guild,

350
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,079
specializing in muscle and vein therapy.

351
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,400
He's an Outsider himself.

352
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,760
Let him help you relax.

353
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,240
It will benefit your Qi circulation.

354
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,880
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

355
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,199
Please don't take it personally.

356
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:53,079
I'll make myself comfortable, then.

357
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:02,800
How about it?

358
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,359
Join our guild,

359
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:06,959
and you can enjoy this every day.

360
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,959
What have I done

361
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,120
to warrant Ms. Feng

362
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:14,400
making such elaborate arrangements for me?

363
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,880
Is this all Chairman Feng's idea?

364
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,719
Mr. Liang, leave us.

365
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:35,359
It doesn't matter

366
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:36,599
if it's my dad

367
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,640
or me.

368
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,479
What matters is

369
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,760
I can make you feel even better.

370
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,760
What are you doing?

371
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:50,079
This is my sincerity.

372
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,240
Can you feel it?

373
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:53,400
Not in the slightest.

374
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,040
You're a far cry from Mr. Liang.

375
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,599
Is that so?

376
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,520
Don't you like it?

377
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,920
I don't.

378
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:06,040
How about this?

379
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,839
-What about this? -Enough.

380
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,919
Do you like it?

381
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,200
What about now? Do you like it?

382
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,319
Yes.

383
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
It feels great.

384
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,280
Miss, are you all right?

385
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,480
Can I help you?

386
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,840
Can you get me Zhang Chulan?

387
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:40,360
I don't know that person.

388
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,399
Which department is he in? I'll look him up.

389
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,159
Can I see Chairman Feng, then?

390
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,360
He should know.

391
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,320
Sorry, the chairman has an important meeting.

392
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,600
He isn't receiving any guests.

393
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:51,720
Sirs,

394
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,200
what are you doing?

395
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,240
Are you dumb, miss?

396
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
We're escorting you out.

397
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:57,320
I asked you a question politely.

398
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:58,480
But you're using force.

399
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,680
I can't accept this.

400
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,280
Sorry for dislocating your joints,

401
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,720
but I have to see Zhang Chulan.

402
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,080
NO AUTHORIZATION. PLEASE CONTACT STAFF.

403
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:43,080
There's an intruder!

404
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,840
THE THREE CADRES OF ALL-ENCOMPASSING GUILD

405
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,399
Mr. Liang's and my skills

406
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,280
should be enough to convince you to stay.

407
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,960
Never in my wildest dreams

408
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,520
could I ever imagine that the young lady of the Feng family

409
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,080
would give me a massage.

410
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,360
Don't you like it?

411
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,960
Too many things have happened this week.

412
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,800
All of a sudden, I'm liked by so many.

413
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,200
They all want me to join them.

414
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,320
NDT Express,

415
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:45,399
All-Encompassing Guild,

416
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,639
and Mount Longhu.

417
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,399
Suddenly, I've been given so many options.

418
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,200
But when I think about it,

419
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
they're not choices at all.

420
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,399
You guys forced them on me.

421
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,399
What do you mean?

422
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,480
Are you saying I'm coming on to you?

423
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,080
Can I get a foot massage?

424
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,600
The Feng family does value your potential.

425
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,639
But which of those other factions doesn't?

426
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,040
At least we're upfront,

427
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,200
and our offer is great.

428
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,120
Great?

429
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:28,560
I am my dad's most prized daughter.

430
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,320
If nothing else,

431
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:33,600
I will be the heir to All-Encompassing Guild.

432
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,159
Do you think I'm not good enough for you?

433
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay.

434
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,800
You are.

435
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
You are.

436
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,679
Chairman Feng would use his daughter

437
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,560
as a bargaining chip for someone like me.

438
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:47,919
Here's the problem, Ms. Feng.

439
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,480
Are you really worth that much to him?

440
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,720
There are a lot of things you don't know.

441
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,720
What don't I know?

442
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,159
It's for Qi Apotheosis, right?

443
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,720
I told you I knew nothing about it,

444
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,159
but none of you would believe me!

445
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,360
I see Chairman Feng is determined

446
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,520
to take a risk with you.

447
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,560
With risks come rewards. I know that.

448
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,720
But what if he loses?

449
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,560
Chairman Feng is a smart businessman.

450
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:09,040
He must be aware of that.

451
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,879
I'm curious as to how he talked you into this.

452
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,560
Did he tell you

453
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,800
that this was all for your own good?

454
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,360
I was right.

455
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,159
Chairman Feng wouldn't make you

456
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,360
date a complete stranger

457
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,600
if he really cared about you!

458
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,560
Stop lying to yourself, Ms. Feng!

459
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:26,560
You're just a pawn

460
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:28,159
in his schemes!

461
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,159
You might not even be worth as much as me.

462
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,919
He would sacrifice his precious daughter for someone like me.

463
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,960
All he probably did

464
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,320
was say a few meaningless things

465
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:36,639
to convince you to do this.

466
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:43,520
Who do you think you are

467
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,879
to compare yourself to me?

468
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,600
I decide what I'm worth.

469
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,919
Zhang Chulan,

470
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:55,560
you've exhausted my patience.

471
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:57,120
One way or another,

472
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,840
you're staying.

473
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,679
Ms. Feng, a strange woman barged into the building.

474
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,960
No one can stop her.

475
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,919
She's about to break into the chairman's office.

476
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,399
Zhang Chulan,

477
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,679
stop right there.

478
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,760
Well, your enthusiasm is a little too much for me.

479
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,000
I'll be leaving now.

480
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,720
What was that?

481
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,960
How did you hit me from there?

482
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,399
Teleportation?

483
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,360
That's right.

484
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,480
This is my superpower.

485
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,080
HUNDRED STEP FIST

486
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,960
You're not leaving

487
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,600
unless you can defeat me.

488
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,679
Ms. Feng,

489
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,679
don't make me get rough with you.

490
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,800
Bring it on!

491
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,760
I'm not coming back!

492
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,320
What was that?

493
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:20,879
Where's Zhang Chulan?

494
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,480
I don't want to fight anymore!

495
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,120
You're scary!

496
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,840
I don't want to fight anymore.

497
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,639
Well?

498
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,760
Did you get her?

499
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:40,080
FENG XINGTONG, YOUNG MASTER OF ALL-ENCOMPASSING GUILD

500
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,200
Their tibias have been dislocated.

501
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,960
Be careful when you move them.

502
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,360
Xingtong!

503
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,439
Yaya.

504
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,399
Are you okay?

505
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,840
I'll be right there.

506
00:23:57,879 --> 00:23:58,760
Master Jia,

507
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,360
I'm terribly sorry.

508
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,480
Something urgent came up.

509
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,200
Please give me a moment.

510
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,159
Is there an intruder?

511
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,360
A strong one from Sinister Pleasure?

512
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,720
Apparently, it's someone from NDT Express

513
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
with the surname Feng.

514
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,120
Chairman Feng,

515
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,879
since I've decided to join All-Encompassing Guild,

516
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,639
I'll take care of this small matter

517
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,639
for you.

518
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,720
Where's Zhang Chulan?

519
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,200
Zhang Chulan?

520
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,360
I was born with a purpose,

521
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:34,879
and I'll deploy my talent to the fullest, for my life's course.

522
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,879
A thousand taels of gold may be squandered,

523
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,840
but they will be recovered.

524
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,000
Do you know where Zhang Chulan is?

525
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,399
This is disappointing.

526
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,000
I thought I would be up against a formidable opponent.

527
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,120
But it turned out to be a little lass.

528
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,800
You're not worth my time.

529
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,399
No one will tell me where Zhang Chulan is.

530
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,639
I'm getting

531
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,000
annoyed.

532
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,439
Complaints aside,

533
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,280
this is my job.

534
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,399
All right.

535
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,360
Torrential Palm!

536
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,159
Is that Jia Zhengyu from the Northwest?

537
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:48,080
The chairman has a good eye.

538
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,760
He is on a different level.

539
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,000
He overpowered that lass all by himself.

540
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,280
He is good.

541
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,560
I didn't let that palm land fully on me.

542
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,520
But why is my body numb?

543
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,639
Little lass,

544
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,240
what do you think of my Torrential Palm?

545
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,639
It's qi.
The key lies

546
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,800
in the qi wrapped around his hands.

547
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:14,280
Qi that flows like water.

548
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,399
Its attack

549
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,720
seeps into your skin like water

550
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,040
and damages internal fluids and organs.

551
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,520
Even an iron wall is defenseless against it.

552
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,760
Well, little lass?

553
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,760
Wait.

554
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,080
Don't talk to me right now.

555
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,600
My brain fluid is churning.

556
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,320
All good now.

557
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,639
What? What technique is that?

558
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,800
Your head is invincible!

559
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,679
Torrential Palm's only drawback

560
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,679
is that it cannot kill a foe in one go.

561
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,879
OBJECT MANIPULATION

562
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:58,639
Is that hidden weapon your other trick?

563
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,360
Hidden weapon?

564
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:03,480
This is no hidden weapon, little lass.

565
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,240
This is the Dragon-Piercing Awl!

566
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,919
No, this isn't telekinesis.

567
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,280
Telekinetic powers

568
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,439
cannot execute attacks with such precision.

569
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,040
This guy knows object manipulation.

570
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,760
Mr. Feng, what is he using?

571
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,040
This is object manipulation.

572
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,080
Users constantly imbue a specific object with qi

573
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,560
using a secret technique from a young age.

574
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:44,320
That enables them to control the item

575
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,800
and turn it into their weapon.

576
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,280
Of course, telekinetic power users can also manipulate objects

577
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,159
but not as accurately

578
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,480
and at the cost of more qi.

579
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,280
If it takes significant power

580
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,320
for a telekinetic user to move an object,

581
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,679
then for an object manipulator,

582
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,960
it's as easy as moving a few fingers.

583
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:04,120
In ancient times,

584
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,240
if an object manipulator

585
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,720
was seen by ordinary folks,

586
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,080
myths and rumors would spread,

587
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,919
giving them another name,

588
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,679
sword master.

589
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,399
Little lass,

590
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,679
you're a real pain.

591
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,320
You managed to hold your own against me for so long.

592
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:22,800
I almost don't want to destroy you.

593
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:25,360
Mister, you're tough too.

594
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,960
It has been a long time

595
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,159
since I've encountered a foe that gives me a headache.

596
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,120
Just a headache?

597
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,560
You say that as if you have ways

598
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:34,520
to deal with me.

599
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,240
Not exactly.

600
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,520
I came to look for Zhang Chulan.

601
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,560
For some reason,

602
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:41,320
Liu Yanyan made me wear these.

603
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:43,399
She said it would make my booty look firmer.

604
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,560
I don't get it.

605
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,000
But if Zhang Chulan likes them,

606
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,480
I don't want to take them off.

607
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:50,360
But mister,

608
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,800
you're too tough.

609
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:53,639
I can't win if I wear these.

610
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,919
I've destroyed your Gold Brilliance Spell.

611
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,800
Without its protection,

612
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:13,120
you won't last against my fists.

613
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:17,879
What's so funny?

614
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,840
Did I hit your head too hard?

615
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Ms. Feng,

616
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,639
this fight is exhausting

617
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,879
and a waste of time.

618
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,240
Why don't we make a bet?

619
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,159
A bet?

620
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,399
On what?

621
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:39,399
If I can resist your elusive punches,

622
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,760
I win,

623
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
and you let me go.

624
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,199
If I lose,

625
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:45,679
I'll join All-Encompassing Guild.

626
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,520
You?

627
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,360
Defeat my Hundred Step Fist?

628
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,760
Deal.

629
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,439
You lost.

630
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,399
You don't play fair!

631
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,199
We haven't said we're starting yet.

632
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:08,000
I got him in the teeth.

633
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,679
I'm ready. Let's begin.

634
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,760
I'll see how you can defeat me.

635
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,600
Impossible.

636
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,600
How did you know where my punch would be?

637
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,080
Let's see if you can do it this time.

638
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,879
Ms. Feng, you lost.

639
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,639
How?

640
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,240
Figure it out yourself.

641
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,399
I'm leaving.

642
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,439
Wait.

643
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,560
You're not going back on your word, are you?

644
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,600
I never go back on my word.

645
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:50,879
Leave if you want.

646
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,399
But I have a question.

647
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,879
I've only ever seen Lightning Technique used as a defense,

648
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:56,040
but I've never known it

649
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,320
to be able to predict moves.

650
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,120
Do you mean this?

651
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:01,760
I call this Little White Worm.

652
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,879
I invented it after I learned Lightning Technique.

653
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:05,600
Now I know

654
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,399
why my dad wanted me to recruit you.

655
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,199
Fine. Wait and see.

656
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,679
The next time you and I duel,

657
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,919
I'll defeat this skill of yours.

658
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,040
Look at yourself right now.

659
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,800
Your entire posture relaxed

660
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:18,360
once you decided to let me go.

661
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,439
You don't want to date me at all.

662
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,199
You rascal!

663
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,760
You've been trying to provoke me from the beginning, haven't you?

664
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,000
By the way,

665
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,800
I have another question.

666
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:35,760
If it weren't for your dad,

667
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,199
would you care if I stayed or left?

668
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,520
Why would I care?

669
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,800
I just didn't want you to walk away so easily.

670
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:44,120
You can't stop me anyway.

671
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,800
Honestly,

672
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:49,480
I just want someone who cares about me.

673
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,199
She doesn't need powerful parents,

674
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:52,639
money,

675
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:54,280
or authority

676
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,560
as long as she cares about me.

677
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,199
That's all that matters.

678
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,840
Mister, you have no idea

679
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,520
how terrifying these are.

680
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,480
It would take me years

681
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,800
to master fighting in these.

682
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,760
Is my first battle in All-Encompassing Guild

683
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,480
going to be a disgrace?

684
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,840
We've fought for so long.

685
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:38,800
Isn't this girl tired yet?

686
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:39,959
I shouldn't have stepped in

687
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,280
for Feng Zhenghao.

688
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,719
This is boring. I'm done.

689
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,240
It's pointless to fight you.

690
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,639
I'm just looking for Zhang Chulan.

691
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,199
Can you let me pass?

692
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,480
She gave up. Thank heavens.

693
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
My reputation is saved.

694
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:58,159
You've done well to last this long.

695
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,399
I've got a soft spot for the talented.

696
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,760
I have to make myself look good

697
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,159
in front of the chairman.

698
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,959
Consider it a reward.

699
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,159
Beg me,

700
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,919
and I'll think about it.

701
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,199
Please.

702
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
Please let me pass.

703
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,639
Please.

704
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,360
Don't you know how to ask someone for a favor?

705
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,760
Kneel.

706
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,480
You're kneeling.

707
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,760
I can go now.

708
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:32,480
I told you to kneel before me!

709
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,480
Not the other way around!

710
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,000
You're annoying.

711
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,080
By the way,

712
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,320
can we talk about something?

713
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:57,560
Speak.

714
00:33:57,639 --> 00:33:58,639
Your hands are magical.

715
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:00,280
Add me on social media, I'll refer you to two clients.

716
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,760
Die!

717
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,159
Heels

718
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,759
really are terrifying.

719
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,679
Zhang Chulan.

720
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,679
Ms. Bao?

721
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:53,679
Are you the crazy lady

722
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,159
they were talking about?

723
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,720
Are you here

724
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,360
to take me back?

725
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,120
Zhang Chulan,

726
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,480
come back with me.

727
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,400
Why should I go just like that?

728
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,480
What do you take me for?

729
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:13,319
I'm sorry. I apologize, Zhang Chulan.

730
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,759
Did I hear that right?

731
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,880
You, Feng Baobao,

732
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,360
actually apologized to me.

733
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:29,120
You were right.

734
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
I shouldn't decide what you do with your life.

735
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:41,480
So

736
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,680
did you force your way into All-Encompassing Guild

737
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:45,600
on your own

738
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,360
to bring me back?

739
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,000
Do you expect me to go back just like this?

740
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,319
I'm not an idiot.

741
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,080
If you're here to apologize,

742
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:02,279
that means you'll do what I say, right?

743
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:04,000
Yes.

744
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,120
You'll do whatever I ask!

745
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,960
Let me think about it.

746
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,880
Stand here until I come up with something!

747
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,680
Now you know what I'm made of.

748
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:24,040
After everything he's said and done,

749
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,160
all he did was make her stand.

750
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,680
Just how scared of her is he?

751
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:42,200
Chairman Feng,

752
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:44,240
you've been very nice to me.

753
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:46,200
But I have to go.

754
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:47,480
I did have a misunderstanding

755
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,600
with the company,

756
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,240
but I signed the contract.

757
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:51,720
Please understand.

758
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,400
So is this your decision?

759
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:58,759
Zhang Chulan,

760
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,319
do you think you can come and go

761
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,600
as you please

762
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,200
at All-Encompassing Guild?

763
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:15,120
Is this

764
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,400
one of the legendary Eight Supremes,

765
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,799
the Feng family's ultimate skill,

766
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,720
Dispatch of Detained Spirits?

767
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,799
This skill allows the user

768
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,040
to recapture qi spirits and primordial spirits

769
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,240
for his own use

770
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:29,279
and enhance his power.

771
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:30,880
Zhang Chulan, allow me.

772
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,000
Ms. Bao,

773
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,480
I told you to stand there.

774
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,080
There are some things I have to settle by myself.

775
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,000
Zhang Chulan,

776
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,279
don't force my hand.

777
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,319
Such pressure.

778
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,560
So this is the true power

779
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,319
of the legendary Eight Supremes.

780
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,480
Even I have never seen

781
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,200
the primordial spirit that my dad summoned.

782
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,359
It has strong bloodlust.

783
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,120
He won't actually kill Zhang Chulan, right?

784
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,640
What do I do now?

785
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,240
Zhang Chulan, don't be a fool.

786
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:05,319
Surrender.

787
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,000
Sorry, Chairman. My mind is made up.

788
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,520
Little brat,

789
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,200
you're not playing fair.

790
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,440
You knew I wouldn't kill you on the spot,

791
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,160
given my high standing.

792
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,400
You're the real deal, sir.

793
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,960
You've seen through my every thought.

794
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,120
Even so, you actually stood firm

795
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,080
in the face of my qi.

796
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,680
That's a rare sight.

797
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,319
I like you even more now.

798
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,400
Go with her.

799
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,120
Thank you, sir.

800
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,120
I'm going to become

801
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,359
a man like you!

802
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Who is he?

803
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,359
I don't know.

804
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,200
A man who fought me.

805
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:06,440
Little lass,

806
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,520
we're not done yet!

807
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,799
He is persistent.

808
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,359
What do we do? Do we fight?

809
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,480
Master Jia,

810
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,120
forget it.

811
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,319
Go and get yourself treated.

812
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,600
Feng Zhenghao,

813
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,600
don't talk to me like that!

814
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,480
But if you attack him,

815
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,480
you can probably take him out in one hit.

816
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Die!

817
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,160
Die, all of you!

818
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,120
Ms. Bao.

819
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,319
Why didn't you dodge it?

820
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:02,240
You told me to stand here.

821
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:12,759
See?

822
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:13,920
I didn't move.
