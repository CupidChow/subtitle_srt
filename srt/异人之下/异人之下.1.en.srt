1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,360
As the common adage goes,

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,000
"There will always be someone

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,360
better than you out there."

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,239
And out there,

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,759
those extraordinary people

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,680
with extraordinary power

7
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,160
are called

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,119
the Outsiders.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
OUTSIDERS

10
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:25,320
It was said

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,599
that many years ago,

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
several Outsiders

13
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:28,880
discovered the Eight Supremes

14
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:30,520
in a mysterious place.

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,040
Those eight abilities,

16
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,480
endowed with immense power,

17
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,559
tore the Outsiders' world asunder.

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,519
To obtain those abilities,

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,400
the Outsiders fought and waged war

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,720
among each other.

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,480
It took place during the Year of Jiashen,

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,600
and thus it was called

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,640
the Jiashen Calamity.

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,879
Following the deaths or disappearances of several legendary figures,

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,280
the secret was left buried.

26
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,680
The wheel of time continues to turn.

27
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,879
Peace is about to be broken.

28
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:57,919
Our story

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,959
begins one evening.

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,800
What a bunch of jerks!

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,840
They look down on me.

32
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,440
They deny me swills of alcohol!

33
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,360
But I have my own alcohol anyway!

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,280
And one day,

35
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,080
I…

36
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:25,479
I'll leave this lousy place!

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,880
Hey, buddy.

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,160
Don't mind if I do.

39
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,119
A man needs his rest.

40
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,360
Get up.

41
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,720
Let's drink.

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,959
Goodness gracious! I'll never drink again!

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,040
We have got the body.

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,239
Let's go.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,959
On this fateful night,

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,440
as this body was unearthed and plundered,

47
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,000
the unfinished business

48
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,400
of the Year of Jiashen

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,040
resurfaced.

50
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,840
The Outsiders' world

51
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,000
will receive a reckoning.

52
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,400
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

53
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,239
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,079
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,320
This doesn't make sense.

56
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,560
There are no grave goods

57
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,000
in this forsaken place.

58
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,000
These few are lucky.

59
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,359
That one had it worse.

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,320
Just take a look.

61
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,799
Even the body is gone.

62
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,560
I saw it with my own eyes yesterday.

63
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,320
Look.

64
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,600
What kind of grave robbers

65
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,519
take an old body too?

66
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,120
How old is it again?

67
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,600
And whose grave is it?

68
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,560
GRAVE OF ZHANG XILIN

XINPU CITY

72
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,040
XINPUKAI UNIVERSITY

73
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,320
My dear juniors,

74
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,480
allow me to introduce

75
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,040
the pride of this university.

76
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:50,160
In his first year here, he led our gymnastics team

77
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,720
to a group gold medal and a solo gold medal

78
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,560
in the National University Games.

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,519
In his second year, he quit the gymnastics team

80
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
and became a researcher.

81
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,560
Chulan.

82
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,079
Are you nervous?

83
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,640
No.

84
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,720
Have you been through this before?

85
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,079
I have faith in you.

86
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Go.

87
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,040
…a veritable academic pioneer.

88
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,839
Now, let's welcome

89
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,359
our stellar alumni

90
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,359
to the stage.

91
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,120
Who is this guy?

92
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,719
-What the heck? -Where is Wu?

93
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,200
Where is Wu?

94
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,360
Bring Wu here.

95
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:06,960
ZHANG CHULAN, MR. NOBODY, PATIENCE 98%

96
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

97
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,000
how are you?

98
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,760
Good!

99
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,960
We are young.

100
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,159
We can tolerate diversity

101
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,560
and otherness.

102
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,200
A future of infinite possibilities

103
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,919
lies before us.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,479
And we also have a lot of…

105
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,440
What is it?

106
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,840
Hope!

107
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,760
-Hello? -Yes, hope!

108
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,960
Village Director?

109
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,919
Who?

110
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,599
Someone stole my grandfather's body?

111
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,479
Screw you!

112
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,719
You must be crazy!

113
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,080
LAST STOP, JIULONG VILLAGE

114
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,479
GRAVE OF ZHANG XILIN

115
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,400
Village Director.

116
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,280
What happened here?

117
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:05,479
If I had the answer,

118
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,440
I wouldn't have called you here.

119
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,039
Chulan, you are your grandfather's only family.

120
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,200
Now that his body is stolen,

121
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,039
I need you to tell us how to proceed.

122
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,239
Don't worry about it.

123
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,840
I will find my grandfather's body.

124
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:58,120
Your grandfather?

125
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,479
My grandfather is Zhang Xilin.

126
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,719
I am his granddaughter, Zhang Baobao.

127
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,640
I'm your sister.

128
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,520
We've finally met.

129
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,080
You're crazy.

130
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,560
I don't have a sister!

131
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Zhang Yude, son of Zhang Xilin, is my dad.

132
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,679
The Zhangs moved to this village 14 years ago.

133
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,960
The family has three members, one in each generation,

134
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,760
Zhang Xilin, Zhang Yude, and Zhang Chulan.

135
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,000
You're Zhang Chulan, 22 years old, a university student.

136
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,679
Grandpa was killed when you were ten.

137
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,840
Zhang Yude then came to my mom.

138
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:33,120
I never knew

139
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:34,679
that the Zhangs had a daughter.

140
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,600
My mom

141
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,880
only told me recently.

142
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,400
She asked me to visit Grandpa's grave.

143
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,240
Liar.

144
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:44,319
What can a photo prove?

145
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,880
So this is how Zhang Xilin's son looks.

146
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
Honestly, she does

147
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,280
take after him.

148
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,840
Right? Look at the eyes.

149
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,880
And the mouth.

150
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,000
I was so wrong!

151
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:56,600
I always thought that he adopted Chulan.

152
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,160
Is now the time for gossiping?

153
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
This is beyond the point!

154
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,400
The point is this woman might be a liar!

155
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,920
Village Director, say something.

156
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,040
I am a Zhang. I will handle Grandpa's affairs.

157
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,240
Thank you, Village Director.

158
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,600
If you need my help,

159
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,280
let me know.

160
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,800
We have already informed the police.

161
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,800
If you find a lead,

162
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,439
do share it with me.

163
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,319
I shall let you two catch up.

164
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,880
Let's go.

165
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,079
-Yes! -Come on!

166
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Enjoy.

167
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,160
Village Director!

168
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,640
She is a stranger!

169
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,319
GRAVE OF ZHANG XILIN

170
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,240
Grandpa.

171
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,760
I made pork knuckles today.

172
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,120
It's a pity that you can't have it.

173
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:16,319
GRAVE OF ZHANG XILIN

174
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,680
Chulan,

175
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,079
I'm making pork knuckles for you today.

176
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,800
GRAVE OF ZHANG XILIN

177
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,199
For years,

178
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,880
we seemed to be running from something.

179
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,000
But you never told me why.

180
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,480
Your grave was defiled.

181
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,120
Your body was stolen.

182
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,760
Can you visit me in my dream

183
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,880
and tell me

184
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,240
who our enemy is?

185
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,319
GRAVE OF ZHANG XILIN

186
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,880
That impostor.

187
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,880
I bet you stole my grandfather's body.

188
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,199
I have got you now.

189
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,640
This is evidence.

190
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,040
Don't come near me!

191
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,319
What did you kill just now?

192
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,079
Don't worry. I saw nothing.

193
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,240
I will not tell anyone.

194
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:24,120
Thank you so much. I owe you a meal.

195
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,439
What are you doing?

196
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,760
I saw nothing! I swear!

197
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,800
Help! Somebody!

198
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,920
Don't yell. No one can hear you.

199
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,000
Help!

200
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm the only one who can hear you

201
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,520
and I'm not saving you.

202
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,240
You're insane! What do you want?

203
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,880
You've seen too much.

204
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,199
I have no choice

205
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,240
but to bury you.

206
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:58,199
What did I see for you to bury me?

207
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,599
Are you a thug?

208
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,880
You can't just bury someone!

209
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,480
Baobao,

210
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,839
I'm Zhang Chulan.

211
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,680
Your dear brother!

212
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,560
You won't bury me, will you?

213
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,160
We are family.

214
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:29,959
Do you know?

215
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,319
When I first saw you,

216
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,000
I felt a connection.

217
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,160
It's like we have met somewhere.

218
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,880
By the way, Baobao, that old prick--

219
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,560
I mean our dad.

220
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,839
Is he all right?

221
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,120
A mad impostor claiming to be my sister

222
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,120
is using a cleaver

223
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,360
to kill sand monsters!

224
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,240
Right.

225
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:19,439
This must be a fever dream.

226
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,120
That's right. I'm still in my dorm.

227
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,640
I did not go back to my hometown.

228
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,240
The stress must have gotten me.

229
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:39,880
Wake up.

230
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:43,360
Wake up!

231
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:46,280
Wake up to my happy place!

232
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,280
Idiot.

233
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,280
-Bye. -Are you leaving me?

234
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,040
It's your happy place. Face it yourself.

235
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,120
Kill them

236
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,000
and bury me later!

237
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,079
Get away from me!

238
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,680
Help!

239
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,160
How did it go, Baobao?
It's too late.

240
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,959
Zhang Xilin's grave was excavated.

241
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,680
And his body is gone.

242
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,599
We're late.

243
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,000
Also, Xu San, I was ambushed by thralls.

244
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,479
Thralls?

245
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,199
Only the Thrall Masters of Xiangxi practice this craft.

246
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,199
Are they meddling too?

247
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:11,359
But why are they interested in Zhang Xilin's body?

248
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,359
Help!

249
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:16,760
Who's there?

250
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,479
Zhang Chulan.

251
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,000
Why is he shouting?

252
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
He is surrounded by thralls.

253
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,359
Did you leave him to face them alone?

254
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:26,240
Don't worry. He won't die.

255
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,439
What do you mean? He's an ordinary person!

256
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:55,599
I told you.

257
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,199
He won't die.

258
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,560
Don't jinx it, Baobao.

259
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,040
Was all this hassle

260
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,359
just to steal Zhang Xilin's body?

261
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,560
He sure is lucky.

262
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:28,319
He managed to escape from a group of thralls.

263
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:29,639
Did someone help him in secret?

264
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:33,600
Baobao.

265
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,720
Have you been to a university?

266
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,320
University? What's that?

267
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,720
You have a sense of humor now.

268
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,200
I'll get you a student ID.

269
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,919
Get ready to go to school.

270
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,600
So do I have another identity now?

271
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,120
Your name will still be Baobao.

272
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,639
So do I no longer need

273
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,960
to find Zhang Xilin's body?

274
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,520
Xu Si and I will do that.

275
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,040
GRAVE OF ZHANG XILIN

276
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,440
Help!

277
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,159
Help!

278
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:04,800
Go away.
Help!

279
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,960
Help!

280
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,520
Stay away!

281
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,040
Stay away!

282
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,040
Help!

283
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:19,760
Stay away.

284
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,960
Don't come near me!

285
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,639
Don't come near me!

286
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,879
Is my lecture that repulsive?

287
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,399
Of course not, Mr. Yi.

288
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,639
Your lecture

289
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,040
is captivating and enlightening.

290
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,720
I was supposed to shout that internally,

291
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,080
but it was begging to be let out.

292
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:51,080
Then tell me

293
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:52,440
what I was talking about.

294
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,760
You were talking about…

295
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,800
At the origin of time…

296
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:02,120
At the origin of time…

297
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,760
-all is simple. -all is simple.

298
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,960
As it evolves, it becomes complex.

299
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,840
As it evolves, it becomes complex.

300
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,280
What is it now?
She…

301
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,679
When did she come?

302
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
When you were dozing off.

303
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,600
Is there a problem?

304
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,159
Mr. Yi, she is not a student here.

305
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,960
This is my student ID.

306
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,639
Her student ID is fake!

307
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,679
Who actually wears their student ID on a lanyard?

308
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
I did it so that I won't…

309
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,360
lose it.

310
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:49,520
Zhang Chulan,

311
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,879
go back to sleep.

312
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,240
Don't disturb other students.

313
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,720
Xuanxue, also known as Neo-Taoism,

314
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,159
was built upon the philosophy of Zhuangzi.

315
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,960
It interpreted Laozi…

316
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,200
Why are you here at my school?

317
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,360
What do you want?

318
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,639
I'm here to study.

319
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:08,679
Study what?

320
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,240
Sweet and sour pork ribs.

321
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,320
River snail noodles.

322
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,480
And a braised egg.

323
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,840
This restaurant looks delicious.

324
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,360
PRIVATE DINING BOOTH

325
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,280
Baobao, I bought you so many things.

326
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,200
Shouldn't you do something in return?

327
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,800
My grandfather's body is gone.

328
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:36,919
We need to find it.

329
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,360
I'm not your sister.

330
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,480
No way.

331
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,360
You are my sister.

332
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,600
When I first saw you,

333
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:46,600
I was surprised by how similar we looked.

334
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,879
We're like two peas in a pod.

335
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:51,960
I'm not your sister.

336
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,280
But you said it yesterday.

337
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,080
That was yesterday. This is today.

338
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,879
So today, you are…

339
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,360
"Xu Baobao,

340
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,800
an exchange student from Taiwan.

341
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,919
My dad just started his business on the Mainland,

342
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,040
offering premium resin-related products.

343
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,960
My hometown

344
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,879
is Zhangtai City, Huyan Province.

345
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,760
I'm not sure about my mom."

346
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,760
Taiwan?

347
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,480
Yet, you're rocking a Sanchuan dialect.

348
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,720
Is this how you lie nowadays?

349
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,000
Listen, I don't care who you are and why you're here.

350
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,280
Leave me alone now

351
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,919
because I will bite.

352
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Sorry, I can't do that.

353
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,919
But wait, I'll call to confirm it first.

354
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,800
Hi. Is this Xu San?

355
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,520
Do I get to do whatever I want

356
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,879
with my possessions?

357
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,360
-Okay. -I'm a human, not a possession.

358
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,040
I have got the answer, Zhang Chulan.

359
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,040
From now on,

360
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,919
you're my slave.

361
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,480
Slave?

362
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,760
Slave, my foot!

363
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,679
Mind your manners.

364
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,679
Let's speak outside.

365
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,159
EXIT TO THE MALL

366
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,200
EXIT TO THE MALL

367
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:12,240
Help!

368
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:14,840
What's the matter?

369
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:16,960
Help me.

370
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,960
What's the emergency?

371
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,159
A woman is chasing me

372
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,120
with a knife!

373
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,600
No way.

374
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,760
In broad daylight?

375
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,879
In a peaceful campus?

376
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,000
Don't lie.

377
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm serious, sir.

378
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,679
Call the police.

379
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,960
She has a knife!

380
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,879
What police?

381
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,120
I am the security guard.

382
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:36,679
She's here!

383
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Stop shouting.

384
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,080
You're freaking me out.

385
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:41,520
Who's there?

386
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,320
Come in!

387
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,280
Hi. Is Zhang Chulan here?

388
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,399
-There she is! -Stop shouting!

389
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,720
You're making me jump.

390
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,960
It's just a girl.

391
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,080
She has a weapon!

392
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:18,679
Listen, young girl.

393
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,120
Listen to me.

394
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,560
Give me the knife. All right?

395
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,679
Is this a knife?

396
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,800
Is this a knife?

397
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,800
How can this be?

398
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,879
Trust me, sir.

399
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,639
I saw her use a knife

400
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,040
to slash a door in half.

401
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,840
She carries a knife with her.

402
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,280
Get up!

403
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,399
Be a man.

404
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,560
Look at you.

405
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:57,200
Stand straight. Lift your chest.

406
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,200
Lift your chin.

407
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,200
Miss.

408
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,159
What's the matter between you two?

409
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,960
-I am his-- -She wants me to be her slave.

410
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,360
Shut up!

411
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,600
Speak.

412
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:10,000
He is my slave.

413
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,120
I see.

414
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
Now, it's your turn.

415
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,679
You heard it, didn't you?

416
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,199
She wants me to be her slave.

417
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,199
How lucky!

418
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,560
Isn't that great?

419
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,960
Young people nowadays

420
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,879
are so open-minded.

421
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,800
Clean this mess up.

422
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,080
-It's so messy. -Let me do it.

423
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,760
See?

424
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,520
She is so sensible.

425
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:49,159
Wait. Of all people, you're into him?

426
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,399
It's fine. I can train him.

427
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,399
You must take him back

428
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,280
and train him well.

429
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:57,800
Do you still want to run?

430
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,240
Are you running?

431
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,360
He will stop.

432
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:06,720
Do you want to talk?

433
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,439
He said yes.

434
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,600
Let's go.

435
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,159
Go.

436
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,600
Go!

437
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,480
Come on. Don't be shy.

438
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,000
Go now.

439
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,240
Take your toy with you.

440
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,399
Go now. Hurry.

441
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,639
Have fun, okay?

442
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,080
You two are lovely.

443
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:33,080
Find a beautiful place

444
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,480
and talk things out.

445
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,879
What a harmonious couple.

446
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,080
Look at you.

447
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:38,000
All right.
Go.

448
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,280
Go on.

449
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,879
Speak.

450
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,000
What do you want from me?

451
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,879
Show me how you escaped

452
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,760
from those thralls last night.

453
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,679
Now.

454
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,840
Stop playing dumb.

455
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,919
You're hiding something.

456
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,600
I noticed it yesterday.

457
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,800
I abandoned you there

458
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:23,080
to see when you would show your true colors.

459
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,760
Who exactly are you?

460
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,159
Hurry up. Show your power.

461
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,080
You're my slave now.

462
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:34,480
I don't want to use violence.

463
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,040
I swore

464
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,199
not to use my power before just anyone.

465
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,679
You forced me to do this.

466
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,159
PATIENCE

467
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,760
PATIENCE

468
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,480
PATIENCE

469
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,919
Forgive me, Ms. Bao!

470
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,120
I don't know anything!

471
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,679
PATIENCE

472
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,800
Why are you crying?

473
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:22,679
Is this shirt very expensive?

474
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,320
Look at how merciful I am.

475
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:34,639
I only cut your clothes

476
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,959
but not your body.

477
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:41,800
Say cheese.

478
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:43,760
What are you doing?

479
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,919
I'm sending it to the village director.

480
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,679
What for?

481
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,720
A seal.

482
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,240
Can she see it?

483
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,560
Isn't that restricting?

484
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,720
Pervert!

485
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:07,879
You ripped my clothes off.

486
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,879
Now you're concerned about me?

487
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,679
You know what?

488
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,959
Be my slave.

489
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,080
Or I'll upload your photo

490
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:21,159
to the university forum.

491
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Yes, Ms. Bao.

492
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,560
I am now your slave.

493
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:26,959
Feel free to use me.

494
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,120
Boss me around.

495
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,120
Don't call me Ms. Bao.

496
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,120
Call me Master.

497
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:35,760
FENG BAOBAO, AGE: UNKNOWN, IDENTITY: UNKNOWN

498
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,760
Take it.

499
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,240
A Nokia 6310?

500
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:45,120
Where did you get this ancient relic?

501
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:46,720
Other phones are too fragile.

502
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,280
Fragile?

503
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,080
What do you want to do with me?

504
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:52,800
Anyway, Xiaolanzi,

505
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,879
I will contact you by phone.

506
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,800
Xiaolanzi?

507
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:58,600
Xiaolanzi, my foot…

508
00:30:01,879 --> 00:30:03,280
I'll go and fix the door now.

509
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,480
What about me?

510
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,280
How am I supposed to know?

511
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,280
Give me something to wear!

512
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,480
Darling.

513
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,959
-Let's practice dancing over there. -Okay.

514
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,560
What are you doing?

515
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:21,919
We're in public.

516
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,120
I don't want you to be cold.

517
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:24,399
Take my jacket.

518
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,560
Can I have a kiss?

519
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,360
You're naughty.

520
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,240
Xia He,

521
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,280
Zhang Xilin's body is here.

522
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,840
You're very efficient.

523
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,560
We'll meet at the dungeon.

524
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,639
XIA HE, SINISTER PLEASURE

525
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,520
JIASHAN GENERAL HOSPITAL

526
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,080
LYU LIANG, SINISTER PLEASURE

527
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,760
Lyu Liang, come with me.

528
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,879
This dungeon is scary.

529
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,159
Why do we have to meet here?

530
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:58,840
This is the only place

531
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,199
to hide my thralls.

532
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,320
Others

533
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,639
will only see them

534
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,439
as hyper-realistic NPCs here.

535
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:10,520
I have the body you want.

536
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,480
Go.

537
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:27,159
SOUL WHISPERER

538
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:42,719
It's him.

539
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,280
Well done.

540
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,600
I have brought you Zhang Xilin's body.

541
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,919
As for what I want…

542
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,159
That depends on

543
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
whether I can extract what I want from it.

544
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,480
He has been dead for a long time,

545
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:11,560
but I could still extract so much qi from him.

546
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:17,679
What a shame.

547
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,360
These isolated particles

548
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,719
aren't going to provide me with any useful info.

549
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,879
As I said,

550
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,439
I already brought Zhang Xilin's body.

551
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,399
Can I join Sinister Pleasure now?

552
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,639
Unfortunately,

553
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:36,199
the body you brought isn't that useful.

554
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,080
Therefore, we cannot recruit you.

555
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,879
Are you reneging

556
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:41,439
on your promise?

557
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,719
You know very well

558
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,560
how disorganized our organization is!

559
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,480
You can't join us

560
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,959
after completing one simple task.

561
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,679
You need

562
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,520
to hone your skills.

563
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,400
Xia He,

564
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,159
your Ensorcellment has grown more powerful.

565
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,400
You can even seduce the undead now.

566
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,520
Regardless of what shape or size they come in,

567
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,239
everything is a slave to desire.

568
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:36,239
If you don't honor promises,

569
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:38,239
let's forget that we ever met.

570
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,839
Wait!

571
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,440
Leave the body.

572
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,839
I'll give you another chance.

573
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
You claimed that you ran into Zhang Xilin's grandson

574
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,199
and a cleaver-wielding madwoman.

575
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,360
Let's leave the woman

576
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,520
out of this.

577
00:34:57,279 --> 00:34:59,080
But Zhang Xilin's grandson,

578
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,560
by right, should be an Outsider too.

579
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,279
Bring him here,

580
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,279
dead or alive.

581
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,560
And then, you'll be one of us.

582
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,960
Why should I believe you?

583
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,279
What if you renege again?

584
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,279
The exit is over there.

585
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,960
You may leave if you don't want to do it.

586
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,880
Besides, it's not my job to convince you anyway.

587
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,200
Fine.

588
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:20,799
I'll just trust you one last time

589
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,799
and bring you Zhang Xilin's grandson.

590
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:34,200
This is sick.

591
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,440
They practiced until this late.

592
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:44,640
Darling,

593
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,640
I think there's someone up there.

594
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,160
A flasher!

595
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,960
He's naked!

596
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,960
Let's take a photo as evidence.

597
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,600
He's running away. Quick.

598
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,040
Quick! He's gone!

599
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,000
XINPUKAI UNIVERSITY FORUM, HEADLINES

UNKNOWN CREATURE ON CAMPUS?

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,400
A HORROR STORY OR A PRANK?

602
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,520
BY CAMPUS NEWSGROUP

603
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,520
The thunderstorm lately is the result

604
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,120
of a warm and humid air mass passing by.

605
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,839
It's a normal phenomenon,

606
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,279
so do not worry about it.

607
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,120
Remember to bring an umbrella with you during this rainy season.

WANG YE, WUDANG

609
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,000
Ma'am, how much is this?

610
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,640
Here you go.

611
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,960
I like the quality

612
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,080
of your costume.

613
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
Where did you buy it?

614
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,080
Wudang.

615
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,200
Wudang?

616
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,279
Are you a real Taoist?

617
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,000
What is real?

618
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,120
What is unreal?

619
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,120
Dear passengers,

620
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,120
the train to Mount Wudang Station

621
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,480
is arriving soon.

622
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,040
Please stand behind the safety line

623
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,720
and get ready to board.

624
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,640
"The Year of Jiashen"?

625
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:15,960
How does a phantasmagoria

626
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:18,000
manifest itself

627
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,759
without the rite of summoning?

628
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,799
It has been so many years,

629
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,600
but his qi still remains.

630
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,920
How strong was he

631
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,359
when he was alive?

632
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:36,359
I shall dig into his memory.

633
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,279
We must locate his grandson.

634
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,359
Who is this person

635
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,640
in the phantasmagoria?
