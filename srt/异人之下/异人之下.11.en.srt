1
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,279
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,639
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,920
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,280
MEMORIAL TABLET OF XU BAOSHAN

5
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,559
She's not human.

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,440
-She's a monster! -Stay away from them.

7
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:52,400
I knew there was something wrong with her.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,000
Tell them to leave this place at once.

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,640
All these years, did that girl ever change?

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,040
-She's not human. -She hasn't changed at all.

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,839
She hasn't grown even after all these years.

12
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:00,839
Leave our village now!

13
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:02,879
And her skills are abnormally good.

14
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,840
She's acting like nothing has happened.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,160
How scary!

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,480
The bandits will surely return for revenge.

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,080
We mustn't let her stay in the village.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,280
For the sake of our safety.

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,600
Hurry up, chase them away.

20
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,360
The bandits will return for revenge.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,640
Leave our village!

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,560
Wu.

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,600
You can hide here for the time being.

24
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,240
Once Doggy and I find your family, we‘ll come for you.

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,039
Aren't we family, Ms. Zhao?

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,839
Wu.

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,240
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,360
Are you talking about my previous family?

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,679
But they abandoned me, didn't they?

30
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,920
They abandoned me at a cave for no reason.

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Wu.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,839
Did you know?

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,839
When we found you,

34
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,720
you were dressed well.

35
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:04,919
You looked like a daughter from a wealthy family.

36
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,520
Your name as well.

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,320
Feng Baobao.

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,600
If your family doesn't love you,

39
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,200
they wouldn't name you Baobao,

40
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,560
which means treasure.

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,600
Feng Baobao.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,720
That's right.

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,160
You must remember your name.

44
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,959
Besides,

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,280
I have no idea

46
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
about your past.

47
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:29,920
However, from now on,

48
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,440
do not kill anyone.

49
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,079
I'm not killing anyone.

50
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,640
Why would I kill anyone?

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,320
That day,

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,720
you saved us.

53
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,359
However, you killed people.

54
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
We…

55
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,280
Are you talking about that?

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,880
Yes, I killed them.

57
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,600
But you were the one

58
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,400
who caused their death.

59
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:00,720
Doggy.

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,840
Let's go.

61
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,359
Wu.

62
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,679
I'll leave this grasshopper with you to keep you company.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,920
We're leaving.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,560
Wait for us here.

65
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,320
Mom.

66
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:38,519
Where are we going?

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,760
We're going back home.

68
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,720
Never mind her.

69
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,920
-Wu! -Don't you dare!

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,720
If you go to her, I'm not your mom anymore.

71
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,239
Mom. Are you still blaming Wu

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,560
for not saving Dad?

73
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:53,640
She's so cold-blooded.

74
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,079
As cold-blooded as a monster.

75
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:59,280
She doesn't even care about her origin.

76
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,359
Why would she care about your dad?

77
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,040
I'm scared

78
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,560
just looking at her now.

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,600
I'm sorry about her, but it has to be this way.

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,160
Come on.

81
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,880
Three, two, one.

82
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,200
Wu.

83
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,320
You'll get to see our family portrait

84
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,560
in a few days.

85
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,960
Family portrait?

86
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,320
What's a family portrait?

87
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a photo of all of us together.

88
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,479
Ms. Zhao.

89
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
I want to see you smile.

90
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,240
I want to hear you sing.

91
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,120
Does this mean I like all of you?

92
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,919
Ms. Zhao, I like you.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,159
I like Mr. Xu.

94
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,440
I like Doggy.

95
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,800
If Mom realized

96
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,960
she ended up abandoning Wu in the mountains

97
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,400
for decades,

98
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,120
what would she think?

99
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,159
For decades.

100
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,479
I keep coming back to the village again and again.

101
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,159
However, I had never seen Wu again.

102
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,799
Wu.

103
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,680
Wu.

104
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,919
I'll leave this grasshopper with you to keep you company.

105
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,479
Doggy.

106
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,159
From your words,

107
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,440
it has been over forty years.

108
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,440
The person you're looking for

109
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,640
must be old now.

110
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,960
She may even be dead now.

111
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,280
You can't be sure.

112
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,640
Wu won't die.

113
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,320
She's still around for certain.

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
I, Xu Xiang,

115
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,760
swear that as long as I'm alive,

116
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,560
I will find her.

117
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,719
Decades later,

118
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,479
I was considered rather famous

119
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,440
in the Outsiders' world.

120
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,599
How are you doing lately?

121
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,599
How's Xu Si doing?

122
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,560
I really like that brat.

123
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,640
Forget it, let's not talk about him.

124
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:05,840
He's so annoying even if he's just not even ten.

125
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,919
When he gets older,

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,640
I'm sure he'll be a nuisance.

127
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:12,760
Seriously? You're the worst though.

128
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,080
Did you forget

129
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:15,359
you used to detest marriage?

130
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,679
You never listened to anyone.

131
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,080
We thought

132
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,679
you'd surely stay alone for the rest of your life.

133
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,000
Who knows?

134
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,479
You got married and have a family now.

135
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,120
You even have two kids.

136
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,799
You're not here to talk about this, aren't you?

137
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:32,400
Cut to the chase.

138
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,400
What else could I talk about?

139
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm here for the same request, again.

140
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,959
Our company has decided to convert into an express delivery company.

141
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,039
We would like to invite you

142
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,760
to help us out.

143
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,280
Does this job include outstation trips

144
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,319
across the country?

145
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,600
Well, you might even grow sick of going outstation.

146
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,840
For the next few years,

147
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,360
as the field staff of NDT Express,

148
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:01,160
I traveled to numerous states across the country.

149
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,400
Each time I completed my task,

150
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,280
I'd go to the alleys and streets

151
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,120
to ask the locals about Wu's whereabouts.

152
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,560
Have you seen her?

153
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,680
No.

154
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,280
I looked for Wu for another three years,

155
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,600
but to no avail.

156
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,959
In the blink of an eye,

157
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,480
it was spring in the Year of Guiyou.

158
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,800
I was on a business trip to Southeast Asia.

159
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,120
I have a local friend there, Rong.

160
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:33,760
He's a renowned bully in the town.

161
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,199
Visit us again.

162
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,640
Let's not talk about other places.

163
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,800
Because I'm in charge here.

164
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
This is mine.

165
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,400
I'll make you a home here, okay?

166
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,520
No.

167
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,040
I have only one wife now,

168
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,160
yet handling her is already overwhelming.

169
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,040
Why not?

170
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,079
Real men mustn't say no.

171
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,560
You must be capable.

172
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:53,280
No.

173
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
What are you doing?

174
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,839
I'm paying.

175
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,959
What are you paying for?

176
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,199
I'm in charge here.

177
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,040
Excuse me.

178
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,240
What would you like to order?

179
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,760
Two servings of steamed pork bun.

180
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:06,839
Steamed pork buns?

181
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,360
Okay.

182
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,360
Hey. Stop!

183
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,240
The buns are here.

184
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,760
Are these for us?

185
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,760
No. When in society,

186
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,160
you must be loyal.

187
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,120
Baobao shall eat it first.

188
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:52,199
When Baobao is full,

189
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,680
then we'll eat.

190
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,160
-Baobao. -Baobao.

191
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,560
-Are you making a fool out of us? -Are you making a fool out of us?

192
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,719
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,839
I'm too hungry.

194
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,040
There's a lot of food there. I'll get you more food.

195
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,400
Hold on.

196
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,360
She's not just stealing the food, she's stealing it in broad daylight!

197
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,760
Miss, two more servings, please.

198
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,520
I have no idea what she looks like.

199
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,160
She brought away over a dozen servings of buns.

200
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,560
How do I put it into words?

201
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,520
Boss.

202
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,160
Find someone to send me to the airport.

203
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,560
It's her!

204
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,520
Why are you taking my buns again?

205
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,120
Did I wrong you? Catch her, sir!

206
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,280
It's her. Catch her.

207
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,160
It's just buns. She's not a thief.

208
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,120
XIN XING APOTHECARY

209
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:06,680
Young lady.

210
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,719
Why are you wandering the streets alone at night?

211
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,480
Are you lost?

212
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,880
Where is your family?

213
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,000
Family?

214
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,719
I'm looking for my family.

215
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Do you know me?

216
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,480
Follow me.

217
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,520
I'll bring you to them.

218
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,719
Is that all right?

219
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,040
Come on.

220
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,560
Miss.

221
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,800
Do you know where my family is?

222
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,480
Of course.

223
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,160
I'll bring you to them tomorrow, okay?

224
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,120
Alright.

225
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,599
Be good. You can sleep here tonight.

226
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,520
Mr. Liu.

227
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:01,079
How is it? You said you got a high-quality one.

228
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,400
That's her.

229
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
-Is she the one who is mentally ill? -Yes.

230
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:07,280
Well, where is my family?

231
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,959
She looks fine.

232
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,240
It's okay if she's dumb.

233
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,959
As long as her body is fine.

234
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,839
When she falls into the hands of those bosses,

235
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,240
she'd turn mad anyway.

236
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,240
Where is my family?

237
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,160
No one knows you here.

238
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,280
And no one is your family.

239
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,680
Do you get it?

240
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,920
Not here.

241
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,439
They're not here.

242
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,520
Young lady.

243
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,839
We can't find your family,

244
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,560
but we can find you a new family.

245
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,240
If you can't find my family, I won't go with you.

246
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,520
You can't just leave as you please.

247
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:45,760
Go after her!

248
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,000
She's a good one.

249
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,199
Girl.

250
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,599
They're dumb.

251
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,800
They're clueless.

252
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,160
I'm different.

253
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,280
I know about everything.

254
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,040
Do you?

255
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,040
Yes.

256
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:12,240
Just give me your hand

257
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,400
and take the injection.

258
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,439
Then, you'll know too.

259
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,160
Is that true?

260
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,360
Yes.

261
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,800
It's absolutely true.

262
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,479
What is this?

263
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,000
I still don't know about anything.

264
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,520
She has the entire jab.

265
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,599
Even an elephant would be anesthetized now.

266
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,800
Where is my family?

267
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,719
Enough. Get the others.

268
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,000
Are you kidding me?

269
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:47,319
Hurry up.

270
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,680
Didn't you say that you know where my family is?

271
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,640
Tell me now.

272
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,599
Who is she?

273
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,000
Tell me.

274
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:56,959
Wu.

275
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,120
You can hide here for the time being.

276
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,000
Once Doggy and I find your family, we‘ll come for you.

277
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,920
Aren't we family, Ms. Zhao?

278
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,439
I'm sorry.

279
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,000
We're leaving.

280
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,719
Wait for us here.

281
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
Hit her!

282
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:16,520
Mr. Liu.

283
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,560
Let's just let her go, okay?

284
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
Let her go?

285
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,719
Are you out of your mind?

286
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,240
Before this, have we had any good products like her?

287
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:26,520
Now that we've got our hands on such a high-quality one,

288
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,560
we can make a lot of money by selling her.

289
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:31,040
That's enough.

290
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,680
Tell me.

291
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:37,479
Who am I?

292
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,760
Mr. Rong helped me to find traces of Wu in no time.

293
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,959
She was kidnapped by the human traffickers.

294
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,719
Does the girl look like this?

295
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,160
Have a closer look.

296
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,160
Yes. It's her.

297
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,319
Where is she?

298
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,319
Where is she now?

299
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,400
We pretended to be buyers.

300
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:01,120
In a basement,

301
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,520
I saw Wu.

302
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:04,079
Mr. Hu.

303
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,400
She's clean.

304
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:07,280
She's still untouched.

305
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,640
Is this considered clean?

306
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,680
Can you call her untouched?

307
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,079
Calm down, Mr. Hu.

308
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,760
It's just minor injuries.

309
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,640
She's definitely clean.

310
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,479
Wu.

311
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,439
It's a deal, Mr. Xu.

312
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,959
Two hundred thousand dollars.

313
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,160
Tonight at 10 o'clock.

314
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,280
They'd need to check your background.

315
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,400
Don't worry.

316
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,439
Mr. Rong has settled everything for you.

317
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,880
Just wait till tomorrow.

318
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,760
You'll be sent away tomorrow.

319
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,839
Thank you.

320
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:51,880
What?

321
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,959
Thank you?

322
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,439
Are you all right?

323
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,920
Do you think that when you're there, you can live a good life?

324
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,199
How naive of you.

325
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,200
You didn't lie to me.

326
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,040
You found someone who knows me.

327
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,040
Thank you.

328
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,319
You're so naive.

329
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:18,520
I'm selling you away.

330
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,399
Why are you grateful to me?

331
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:22,560
You're crazy.

332
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:24,280
What a psycho.

333
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,480
Mr. Rong.

334
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,399
She's here.

335
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,560
Wu.

336
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,840
Doggy.

337
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,399
Wu.

338
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,960
Wu.

339
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,480
It has been so many years.

340
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,000
Yet you still recognize me.

341
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,120
Wu.

342
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:25,159
I recognized you when I saw you previously.

343
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:28,120
Your smell hasn't changed at all.

344
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,159
Doggy.

345
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,159
They said

346
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,280
that they'd bring me to my family.

347
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:46,040
I passed the evidence of Mr. Hu's and his syndicate's crimes

348
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,120
to the local police

349
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,639
as compensation for Wu.

350
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,520
Since then,

351
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,639
Wu joined the company

352
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,840
as a casual employee.

353
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,159
With the position,

354
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,360
Wu could

355
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,800
change her identity freely.

356
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:12,159
Chulan.

357
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,600
This is the story of the three generations

358
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,760
of the Xu family and Wu.

359
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,520
What does this have to do with Feng Baobao

360
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,560
killing my grandpa?

361
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,399
You never told me and my brother

362
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,560
about this.

363
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:27,320
I kept this from you

364
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,840
for your

365
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,960
and Wu's own good.

366
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,960
After Wu

367
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,000
joined the company,

368
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,320
I continued my investigation into her origin.

369
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:40,760
I discovered

370
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,720
that Wu's background is related

371
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,080
to the Jiashen Calamity.

372
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,960
The majority of those who were involved

373
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,399
in the calamity have died.

374
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,600
There are only a few survivors left.

375
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,560
Your grandpa was one of them.

376
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,040
However, he hid himself.

377
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,040
He escaped the investigation.

378
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,840
Nonetheless,

379
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:09,320
twelve years ago,

380
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,280
I detected an unusual behavior from him.

381
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,040
I was informed

382
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,520
that some well-known seniors

383
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
of the clans

384
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,840
gathered in secret

385
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,120
at Mount Siguniang

386
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
without anyone knowing.

387
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,320
The leader of First Qi Clan.

388
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:26,320
LEADER OF COSMOS CLAN

389
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:28,480
Based on their paths,

390
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,800
it seemed like they were going after something.

391
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:32,960
The other one is the leader of Cosmos Clan.

392
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,120
There are people ahead too.

393
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,560
It has been years

394
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:40,320
since such an outrageous incident happened in the Outsiders' world.

395
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:42,720
There were a dozen corpses along the way.

396
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,000
They're all the veterans

397
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,760
of the Outsiders' world.

398
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,879
I couldn't imagine it then.

399
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,639
Who or which clan

400
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,440
would be powerful enough to kill them?

401
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Who are they?

402
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,720
The one on the left

403
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,600
is the leader of Sanchuan Tang Clan,

404
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,520
Yang Lie.

405
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,440
Who is the other one?

406
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,040
I didn't know then.

407
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,320
But I heard

408
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,080
what Yang Lie told that person clearly.

409
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,720
If

410
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,120
I couldn't acquire

411
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,720
Qi Apotheosis,

412
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,280
I'll let it

413
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,159
vanish together

414
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,360
with you,

415
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,600
old man.

416
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,360
That was my grandpa, wasn't it?

417
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,360
That sounds great too.

418
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:44,560
Regardless of whether it's you

419
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,720
or me,

420
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:51,240
the remainders of the Jiashen Calamity

421
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,560
should all go to hell!

422
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,399
Leaving a better world

423
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,960
for our

424
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,040
future generation.

425
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,520
Well,

426
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:12,240
you leaked your whereabouts intentionally, didn't you?

427
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:20,280
Come out.

428
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,040
Stop hiding.

429
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,600
So many people died.

430
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,520
You killed all of them.

431
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,280
You're a terrific master,

432
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,320
yet you're not in the company's records.

433
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,200
Who are you?

434
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,159
Are you from

435
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:43,439
NDT Express?

436
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,080
Xu Xiang.

437
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:47,360
NDT Express's General Manager of Lubei Region.

438
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,159
The young girl behind the tree.

439
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,919
Come on out too.

440
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,800
Feng Baobao?

441
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:13,439
Do you know me, old man?

442
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:16,320
It's really you.

443
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,200
It has been decades.

444
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,200
You still look the same.

445
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,200
Do you know me?

446
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,919
Do you know my family, then?

447
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,240
Who is my family?

448
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,679
It must be destiny.

449
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
I…

450
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:34,480
At this very moment,

451
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,760
at this place,

452
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,159
I'm seeing you, Baobao.

453
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,120
Please, old man.
Tell me.

454
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,720
I'm sorry, Baobao.

455
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm aware of the truth.

456
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,080
However,

457
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:53,439
I don't want to tell you now.

458
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,080
I'm dying.

459
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,879
I want

460
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,879
to be selfish for once too.

461
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,639
I can't tell you the truth.

462
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,879
However, I can tell you

463
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,600
the way to get closer to the truth.

464
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:14,919
The way to get closer to the truth?

465
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,919
Sir.

466
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,679
We'll get you treated.

467
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,600
You can let us know after that.

468
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,439
The adverse effect of Tang Clan's elixir

469
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,360
is fatal.

470
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,560
Treatment

471
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,720
is pointless

472
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,080
for my injury

473
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:34,399
I want to go home.

474
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,080
Can you send me back?

475
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,159
I miss my grandson.

476
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:50,200
Old man.

477
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,480
Why do you insist on going back when it's so far away?

478
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,399
I…

479
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,200
I promised my grandson

480
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,320
that I'll go home.

481
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,520
Grandpa.

482
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,159
When will you return?

483
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,320
Once you've finished all three pork knuckles,

484
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:06,399
I'll be back.

485
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,840
Go home.

486
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,240
Old man.

487
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,600
We're here.

488
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,240
Feng Baobao.

489
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:39,080
I would like

490
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:40,800
to ask you for a favor.

491
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,960
When I'm gone,

492
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,679
please protect Chulan on my behalf.

493
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,000
If possible,

494
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:53,159
don't let him know about your presence.

495
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,280
Why?

496
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,000
I don't want him

497
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,399
to think that he's special.

498
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,840
And I don't want him

499
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,480
to get involved

500
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
in the chaos of the Outsiders' world.

501
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,639
Is that all right?

502
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,480
I can do you this favor.

503
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
However,

504
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:13,439
can I find my family if I do so?

505
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,120
Just stay by Chulan's side,

506
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,639
then you'll find out the truth.

507
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,679
Old man. Pardon me for asking,

508
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:25,280
but why should we trust you?

509
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,840
I'm the culprit

510
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,919
of the Jiashen Calamity.

511
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,600
Is this

512
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:32,000
enough?

513
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,879
You can choose to trust me

514
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,439
or choose to continue your aimless search.

515
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,320
The choice

516
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:44,399
is yours.

517
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,520
Why would you believe

518
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,439
that we'll do as you say?

519
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,120
I don't believe you.

520
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:52,080
But I believe in Feng Baobao.

521
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,720
Feng Baobao.

522
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,360
Do you believe me?

523
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,919
I believe you.

524
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,280
Thank you.

525
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,439
Feng Baobao.

526
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,040
I can't do this any longer.

527
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,040
I'm holding on with my innate qi.

528
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,240
Please end my life.

529
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,439
If I do as you say,

530
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,480
when can I find the answers about my past?

531
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,960
That depends on your luck.

532
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,320
Besides,

533
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,520
Feng Baobao,

534
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,600
does time carry any meaning to you?

535
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,360
Okay.

536
00:27:31,439 --> 00:27:32,399
I promise.

537
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:34,480
Thank you.

538
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:37,600
Feng Baobao.

539
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,800
When Chulan

540
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:41,960
steps into the Outsiders' world,

541
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:44,760
when he needs

542
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,720
power,

543
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,280
please pass this to him.

544
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,879
I have absolute faith in you,

545
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,320
Baobao.

546
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:57,600
Wu.

547
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,240
It's all right. He's just giving me something.

548
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,040
Do it, Baobao.

549
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,760
To be able to die in your hands,

550
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,480
I consider it a good end.

551
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Hurry up.

552
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,080
Think of it as I'm just clearing out

553
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,399
the paths

554
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,000
for Chulan and the offspring of the Jiashen Calamity.

555
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,120
I'm

556
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:20,560
contented!

557
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:22,439
Hurry up.

558
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,879
Do you

559
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,040
want me

560
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,520
to kneel and beg you to do this?

561
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,720
In the Year of Jiashen,

562
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,280
if only I hadn't boarded the train,

563
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:01,399
things would have turned out differently, then.

564
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,720
The Year of Jiashen?

565
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,000
What train?

566
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,600
Well…

567
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,080
I'll entrust Chulan with you.

568
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,959
Grandpa.

569
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,679
You're back, Grandpa.

570
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,879
What's wrong?

571
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,120
Grandpa.

572
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,520
Grandpa!

573
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:40,639
Grandpa!

574
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:42,560
Grandpa!

575
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,840
Please wake up!

576
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:46,199
Let's go home, Grandpa!

577
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,399
Grandpa!

578
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Let's go home, Grandpa!

579
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,760
He's only ten.

580
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,919
Don't tell me

581
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,080
you're going to look after him

582
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:59,040
and wait until the end of time?

583
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,120
His grandfather is right.

584
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:04,080
I have plenty of time.

585
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,399
I can afford to wait.

586
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,959
From that day onward,

587
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,679
Baobao has been staying by your side,

588
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:15,560
protecting you in secret.

589
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,520
Don't move or I'll hit you.

590
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,240
She waited

591
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,439
for over a decade.

592
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,000
Chulan.

593
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,199
Do you understand now?

594
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,120
That's the story

595
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:36,000
of your grandpa and Wu.

596
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,520
The story sounds bizarre.

597
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,760
How could I believe in that?

598
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,720
You don't have to believe it now.

599
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,600
Stay at the company for the time being,

600
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:48,840
stay by Wu's side and observe.

601
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:52,639
Mr. Zhang is right.

602
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,399
Since our encounter,

603
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,040
I can feel

604
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,879
that something that has been stagnant for years

605
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,240
has started to move again.

606
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,919
Chulan.

607
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,959
You asked me

608
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,720
about the benefits

609
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,320
of joining the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

610
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,000
Listen now.

611
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,800
Me

612
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:17,760
and NDT Express,

613
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,120
we're not gaining anything from it.

614
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:24,280
However, this could help Wu

615
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,879
to find her past.

616
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,439
Chulan.

617
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,159
I'll entrust Wu

618
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:36,760
to you now.

619
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,439
Wu.

620
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
Wu.

621
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,040
Wu.

622
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,520
Doggy!

623
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,840
Did you forget?

624
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,040
I taught you when you were little.

625
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,639
Adjust your qi.

626
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,600
Let it sink to your lower abdomen.

627
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:20,800
Just like this.

628
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,919
Wu.

629
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:50,959
The Huangyang shoulder pole Is soft and flexible

630
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
No!

631
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,040
Doggy,

632
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,120
I left one last slice of meat for you.

633
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,879
Thank you, Wu.

634
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,480
Wu.

635
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,760
I'll leave this grasshopper with you to keep you company.

636
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:48,439
Dad, Mom.

637
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,639
If we can't find her family,

638
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:53,520
Can we make her part of our family?

639
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,719
Ms. Bao.

640
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,920
What did you see?

641
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,799
Doggy

642
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,480
is gone.

643
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,520
When Dad was alive,

644
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,920
he had been to many places.

645
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,199
However, he said

646
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,960
that Mount Longhu was his favorite of all.

647
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,400
He said

648
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,440
that he could forget about the difference between ordinary people and the Outsiders.

649
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,440
Here, he's just

650
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,279
a simple

651
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,480
and free human being.

652
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,200
Dad.

653
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,799
You devoted your whole life to the Outsiders' world.

654
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,640
Now,

655
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,480
you shall rest in peace

656
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:20,520
here at your favorite place, Mount Longhu.

657
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,440
Leave NDT Express

658
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,759
to me and Xu Si.

659
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,279
Dad.

660
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,040
You spent your life to teach me

661
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,520
about responsibility.

662
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,920
I shall remember your words forever.

663
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,080
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

664
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,839
Rest in peace.

665
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,720
Doggy.

666
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
This is for you.

667
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,600
Ms. Bao.

668
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,040
I'll stay by your side

669
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,279
until you find out the truth.

670
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,440
You've been protecting me for years.

671
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,400
From now on, let me do something for you.
