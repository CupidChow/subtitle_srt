1
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:27,880
Surprising, isn't it?

2
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:29,680
It turns out that your grandfather's killer

3
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,200
has been by your side all along.

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,040
What's so funny?

5
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,120
Because that's a big, fat lie.

6
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:44,280
When my grandfather died,

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,280
Feng Baobao would've been eight years old at most.

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,519
The Feng Baobao in this memory is in her twenties.

9
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:50,040
Try harder next time.

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,839
Go now.

11
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,040
Or I'll start shouting.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,199
Think before you lie to me next time.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,000
Why don't you find out yourself

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,919
if I'm lying to you or not?

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,720
Grandpa!

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,320
Grandpa!

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,720
Grandpa!

18
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:34,520
Grandpa!

19
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,160
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

20
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:01,800
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,759
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

22
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,920
I don't care whose face you borrowed.

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,200
Tell me now.

24
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,040
What does Sinister Pleasure want?

25
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:37,280
You must have

26
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:38,480
made a deal with Shen Chong.

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,799
Do you know

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,880
what usually happens to Shen Chong's clients?

29
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,200
To keep their power, they keep murdering people.

30
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,160
But the more they kill,

31
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:48,720
the more qi they lose.

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,720
Eventually, they lose their humanity.

33
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,120
They will then kill their parents,

34
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,359
loved ones,

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,400
children,

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,720
and even their brother.

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,760
You killed Hu Sheng,

38
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,120
didn't you?

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,400
Shut up!

40
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,519
I did not kill anyone.

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,560
I am Hu Sheng!

42
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,840
It will never happen between me and Hu Jie.

43
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:19,799
My brother

44
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,720
has always been an introvert.

45
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,399
But deep down,

46
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,600
he still loves me.

47
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,120
I am Hu Jie.

48
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,679
I killed my brother.

49
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,200
I killed my brother with my own hands!

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,000
No!

51
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,399
Sinister Pleasure did!

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,600
They killed Hu Sheng!

53
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,119
They did it!

54
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,119
Sinister Pleasure.

55
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,920
Can you tell me

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,239
what they want?

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,280
Sinister Pleasure.

58
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,720
It's time to collect what is due.

59
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:04,839
No qi?

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,079
Then pay with your life!

61
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,080
Shen Chong drained his qi remotely.

62
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,200
He's gone.

63
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,760
Yu Huadu disguised Hu Jie

64
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,560
as Hu Sheng.

65
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,599
Gao Ning and Shen Chong

66
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,320
must be behind their deaths.

67
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,200
Xu Si, release an arrest warrant.

68
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,440
Xu San, bring Chulan here.

69
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,800
Don't tell him anything yet. Just say I need him.

70
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:01,560
Where is Feng Baobao?

71
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,599
I just woke up.

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,400
I don't know when she left.

73
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,360
You…

74
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,400
Zhang Chulan!

75
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,919
Do you know who Feng Baobao is?

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,120
Several years ago,

77
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,599
to perfect Flowing Rainbow,

78
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:20,880
I traveled around

79
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,200
to collect the qi of various people for my analysis.

80
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,080
I've been to this country

81
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,400
where the punishment for felons

82
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,520
is the removal of their frontal lobe's white matter.

83
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:31,760
They will forget who they are,

84
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,919
what they did,

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,919
and even the fact that they are human.

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,479
For those criminals,

87
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,000
their qi turns transparent and colorless

88
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,320
after the procedure.

89
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,000
They essentially remove their primordial spirit,

90
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,000
dignity, and pride.

91
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,599
They are robbed of what makes them humans.

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,520
And Feng Baobao is in this state now.

93
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,159
Her primordial spirit was purged.

94
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,880
Zhang Chulan,

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,800
do you really know

96
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,359
who Feng Baobao is?

97
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:04,719
Chulan.

98
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,320
Chulan.

99
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
I've been looking for you.

100
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
My dad wants to see you.

101
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,240
Good.

102
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,479
I have questions too.

103
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,560
Mr. Xu, you asked for me?

104
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,440
Chulan, you're here.

105
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:26,400
Tell me.

106
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,560
Has anyone contacted you lately?

107
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,159
Who do you mean?

108
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,359
Sinister Pleasure.

109
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:34,400
Now that you bring it up,

110
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,760
I think a foreign number texted me once.

111
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,880
What did it say?

112
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,440
Let me show it to you.

113
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,039
Chulan, you…

114
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,159
Dad?

115
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,359
Stay right there!

116
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,919
Move!

117
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,880
Fatty, stop him!

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Stop him!

119
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,280
-Two Zhang Chulans? -You idiot!

120
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:49,080
Don't stop me! Stop him!

121
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,120
Stop him, Lian!

122
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,919
Why are there two Zhang Chulans?

123
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,560
Who are you?

124
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:04,280
YU HUADU MURDERED XU XIANG AND VIOLATED OUTSIDER REGULATIONS

125
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,159
HE HAS BEEN ARRESTED AND IS AWAITING TRIAL

126
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,160
How is Mr. Xu?

127
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,840
The doctor said that he lost a lot of blood

128
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,400
and might not survive the night.

129
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,800
However, he refuses to go to the hospital.

130
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,240
I know my body.

131
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
There is no need to admit me to the hospital.

132
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,280
I need

133
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,319
to tell all of you something.

134
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,319
Coincidentally,

135
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,880
I have some questions too.

136
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,000
Feng Baobao,

137
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,800
did you kill my grandfather?

138
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,400
What are you saying, Chulan? Why would she have?

139
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,839
I'm asking her, not you!

140
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,400
Feng Baobao, I'll ask you again.

141
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,920
Did you kill my grandfather?

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,160
Your grandfather.

143
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,680
Yes, I killed him.

144
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,040
Chulan,

145
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,600
calm down.

146
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,120
Mr. Xu,

147
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,240
when Feng Baobao killed my grandfather,

148
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:04,480
you were there, weren't you?

149
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,439
Take a seat.

150
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:10,240
It's about time that I tell you

151
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,640
what I know about Wu.

152
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,280
You two will stay.

153
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,560
Don't worry.

154
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,079
If we wanted to kill you,

155
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,439
anyone here could have done it anytime.

156
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,160
And you know

157
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,319
we are capable of doing that.

158
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,920
Who is Wu?

159
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,400
Wu is Baobao.

160
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,280
It has been many years,

161
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,640
but this habit of mine won't go away.

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
When I first met Wu,

163
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,719
it was in the Year of Jiashen.

164
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:04,160
YEAR OF JIASHEN

165
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:18,319
I'm afraid of the mountain.

166
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,640
If we don't forage, what do we eat?

167
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,560
You're right.

168
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,120
Miss, why are you here all alone?

169
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:28,439
It's getting dark.

170
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,800
It will be dangerous.

171
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,600
You don't look like a local.

172
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:36,839
This girl

173
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,599
is quite beautiful, isn't she?

174
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,920
What are you doing?

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,439
Don't do this!

176
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,640
This isn't right!

177
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:44,199
She doesn't mind.

178
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,360
Stop it. Stop!

179
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,439
-You two! -What are you doing?

180
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,439
Chase them!

181
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,839
Perverts! How dare you!

182
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,400
Don't come back!

183
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,319
Miss, are you all right?

184
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,079
Miss.

185
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,599
What is your name?

186
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,160
Let us see you home.

187
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Come inside.

188
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,680
I'll get you some warm water.

189
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,120
Come in.

190
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,000
Come in.

191
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,000
Come.

192
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:44,599
Doggy.

193
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,319
XU XIANG, EIGHT YEARS OLD

194
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,920
This is our son.

195
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
His name is Xu Xiang.

196
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,480
You can call him Doggy.

197
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,160
Come.

198
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,640
-I have warm water here. -Sit here.

199
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,319
Come on.

200
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,439
Have something warm.

201
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,199
Warm water.

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,880
What a poor girl.

203
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,240
She seems to have lost her memory.

204
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,719
And she is mute.

205
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,880
She is dressed

206
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,319
like a young lady from a wealthy family.

207
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,400
Let's head into town tomorrow

208
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:43,360
to check which family lost a daughter.

209
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,280
Okay.

210
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,040
I'll get her some food.

211
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,400
Maybe she's starving.

212
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:58,800
Miss.

213
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,240
Go to bed.

214
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,400
Tomorrow, my husband will head to the town

215
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:03,800
to find your family.

216
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,959
You're safe now.

217
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,160
If you need something, let us know.

218
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,560
We'll protect you.

219
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Come on.

220
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:37,920
One, two, three.

221
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,880
Enough.

222
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,160
It's too tough.

223
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,599
Then don't chop it. Come inside.

224
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,719
After you.

225
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,839
Hurry up. Come on.

226
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,719
Close the door.

227
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,599
Close the door.

228
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:01,839
Did you go to the town?

229
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,400
Yes. No one lost a daughter.

230
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,079
The town hall did ask me

231
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,040
to bring her to them tomorrow.

232
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,520
The town hall?

233
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,160
Can they take her in?

234
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,199
I have no idea.

235
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:17,000
That place is for official business.

236
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:18,400
If her family doesn't show up,

237
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,160
she'll be bounced around like a ball.

238
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,319
The poor girl.

239
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,479
But we can't let her stay here for long.

240
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,640
People will talk.

241
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,719
Besides, that's one more mouth to feed.

242
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,240
So what?

243
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,359
I don't care. Give me a solution.

244
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:36,319
What can I do?

245
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,800
Just forget it.

246
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,040
I'll send her to the town hall tomorrow.

247
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,280
Wow! Do it again!

248
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:44,319
Hurry.

249
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,520
Again! Wow!

250
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:49,880
Again! That's amazing!

251
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,359
Do it again. Come on.

252
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:52,839
Hurry.

253
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,800
Chop one more.

254
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,079
Wow!

255
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,800
Again! Hurry.

256
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Again. Wow!

257
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,319
-Amazing! -Your back is acting up.

258
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,599
Should we keep her?

259
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,800
My dad

260
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:07,760
even visited the neighboring towns

261
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,359
to ask around.

262
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,119
He heard nothing about this woman.

263
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
And so,

264
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,319
she stayed at my house.

265
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,280
Back then, it wasn't uncommon

266
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,359
for people to seek refuge in the woods.

267
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,240
Since she refused to speak

268
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,680
or answer our questions,

269
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,000
we called her Wu.

270
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,680
Before my family fell from grace,

271
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,320
they were a literate bunch.

272
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:44,040
And so, teaching Wu how to speak

273
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,800
became my mom's task.

274
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,080
That is a dog.

275
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,879
"Dog"?

276
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,639
Stop chasing him.

277
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,120
You're scaring him.

278
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,280
My mom said

279
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,720
that Wu might have forgotten everything

280
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,240
due to trauma.

281
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,600
She even had proof.

282
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,879
Xu!

283
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,120
Doggy.

284
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,040
This is…

285
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,159
What did she write?

286
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,480
FENG BAOBAO

287
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,240
"Feng Baobao"?

288
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:42,159
Feng Baobao.

289
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,159
This is the only thing that came to my mind.

290
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,520
I think this is my name.

291
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,639
I knew it.

292
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,879
A pretty woman like you

293
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,200
definitely can speak.

294
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,760
She can write too.

295
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,200
My mom became enthused.

296
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,480
She began to teach Wu and me

297
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,639
how to read and write.

298
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,280
She gave up once before

299
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,919
because she deemed me

300
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,399
too stupid for it.

301
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,000
Doggy, look at Wu.

302
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,320
Then look at yourself.

303
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:09,000
Mom, you know my noggin doesn't work.

304
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,200
Besides, Wu already knew how to write.

305
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,360
She just forgot about it.

306
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,240
But now, she recalled it.

307
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:16,720
Wu,

308
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,399
other than your name,

309
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,080
do you recall anything about your past?

310
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,679
Your past.

311
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,800
Wu? Are you okay?

312
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:41,000
-Wu! -What's wrong?

313
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,240
Go get Mr. Xu.

314
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,720
He used to be a physician.

315
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,360
Wu, are you okay? Wu!

316
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,720
Mom, Mr. Xu is here!

317
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,200
-Here we are. -Slow down.

318
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,000
Mom, what is Wu doing?

319
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,159
I don't know.

320
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,720
She got up

321
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,560
and sat down like that.

322
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,159
Her palms face Heaven.

323
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,560
Perhaps she is cultivating qi.

324
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:28,159
-Cultivating qi? -Qi?

325
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:29,639
Cultivating qi

326
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,159
is what mystics do.

327
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,520
When I was younger,

328
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,440
I wanted to cultivate qi under a mentor.

329
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,919
I knelt before his abode for three days.

330
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,480
He took me in as his disciple in the end.

331
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,320
But regrettably,

332
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:44,639
I didn't have the talent for it.

333
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,800
That was my first time

334
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,639
getting to know qi.

335
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,800
At that moment,

336
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,639
I could only feel

337
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,080
a revitalizing breeze

338
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:55,440
around Wu.

339
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,120
Ms. Zhao.

340
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,399
Don't tell anyone

341
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:01,240
about this girl.

342
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,679
You wouldn't want any trouble.

343
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,639
This woman

344
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,720
has a much more complicated history

345
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,679
than you imagined.

346
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,360
Wu, what happened to you during the day?

347
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,080
No idea.

348
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,000
My head felt like bursting,

349
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,520
like something wanted to come out.

350
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,919
And then?

351
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,200
And then I meditated.

352
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,520
I felt better after a while.

353
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,760
Who taught you that?

354
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
That qi thing.

355
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,639
I don't know.

356
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,480
I guess I learned it in the past.

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,919
It allows me

358
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,159
to stir everything inside me.

359
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,159
Once it flows smoothly,
the pain goes away.

360
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,399
It feels good.

361
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,679
No wonder.

362
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,679
You have it inside you too.

363
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,919
I can feel it.

364
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,960
Me?

365
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,800
Do you not believe me? Do it with me.

366
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,560
There's nothing.

367
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,240
I've been sitting like this for a while,

368
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,879
and I feel nothing.

369
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,879
How odd.

370
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,159
I can feel it when I sit like this.

371
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:12,480
Meditate. Let me see.

372
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,639
I see it now. Your thoughts are all over the place.

373
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,120
Your mind needs to be calm.

374
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,040
Come on! How can you tell that my thoughts are all over the place?

375
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,679
Of course, I can.

376
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,919
I don't know what you're thinking about,

377
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,480
but I can feel that you're not calm.

378
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,240
That thing is like water.

379
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,960
Distractions will scatter it.

380
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,520
When you're calm,

381
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,480
it starts to gather and assemble inside you.

382
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,080
Gather and assemble.

383
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,879
It then settles in your tummy.

384
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,639
That was my first time

385
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,240
cultivating qi.

386
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,040
Under Wu's guidance,

387
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,399
cultivating qi

388
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,000
became my daily task.

389
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,679
Fearing that my parents would reproach me,

390
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,200
I kept my training with Wu

391
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,040
a secret.

392
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,200
I think I have become stronger.

393
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,760
Mr. Xu is so dumb.

394
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,240
This is such a simple trick,

395
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,679
yet he couldn't do it after years.

396
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,480
The first step in cultivating qi

397
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,159
is to find the qi.

398
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,919
It's the hardest step

399
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:29,200
and also the most perilous one.

400
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,360
Without Wu's help,

401
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:33,720
even if I followed all the right steps

402
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,480
and trained myself,

403
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,399
I would end up dead

404
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,360
or crippled for life.

405
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:44,040
But of course, I only knew that

406
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,320
much later.

407
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:52,399
The Huangyang shoulder pole Is soft and flexible

408
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Sisters and brothers

409
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,399
Ms. Zhao, what are you singing?

410
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,760
It's quite catchy.

411
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,520
"Huangyang Shoulder Pole".

412
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,480
Do you like it?

413
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:05,240
If so, I can teach you.

414
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,840
The Huangyang shoulder pole Is soft and flexible

415
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,480
The Huangyang shoulder pole

416
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,720
Is soft and flexible

417
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:31,960
The Huangyang shoulder pole Is soft and flexible

418
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:39,679
Sisters and brothers

419
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:50,280
Carrying the rice grains to Liuzhou

420
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,120
Come on, sisters

421
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,760
Looking back,

422
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,560
those were

423
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:14,080
the happiest days of my life.

424
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,199
If only time would cease ticking away.

425
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,879
JIASHEN

426
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,760
FIVE YEARS LATER, YEAR OF JICHOU

427
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,320
Tonight, they'll have to make do with sweet potatoes.

428
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:47,639
They are not pigs, mind you.

429
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,879
Wu, come.

430
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,760
I bought you a duck.

431
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,320
Take it.

432
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:53,960
Take a seat, ma'am.

433
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,879
Here.

434
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Ms. Zhao,

435
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:59,480
don't you find it odd?

436
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,960
She came here

437
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,679
when she was around 18.

438
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,720
It has been five years,

439
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,159
and she still looks the same.

440
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,240
Anyway, forget about this.

441
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,120
I have something to tell you.

442
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:16,439
Wu can't possibly stay in your house forever.

443
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,960
What do you mean?

444
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,919
Wu.

445
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,919
I have good news for you.

446
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:28,800
We agreed

447
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,600
that you should be my daughter-in-law.

448
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,000
What does it mean?

449
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,199
Look.

450
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,480
I already brought you a duck.

451
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,720
Well,

452
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,960
consider this a bride price.

453
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,879
Ma'am, we've already agreed on this.

454
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,879
My goodness.

455
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,159
Come on.

456
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,320
You know my situation very well.

457
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:57,159
You have much to gain

458
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,560
if Wu marries my son.

459
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,840
I quite agree with her.

460
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,159
I disagree!

461
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,159
XU XIANG, 13 YEARS OLD

462
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,320
Does your drooling son

463
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,120
want Wu as his wife?

464
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,600
In his dreams!

465
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,919
Mind your words!

466
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,159
Is Wu very bright now?

467
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,720
She is just as dull.

468
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,040
She's perfect for my son.

469
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,520
No means no.

470
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,120
-Enough. -Wait.

471
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,040
Doggy,

472
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,439
do you fancy her now?

473
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,720
Your son is--

474
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,760
Goodness.

475
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,879
Sit down.

476
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,520
Stop shouting.

477
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,480
We'll let Wu pick.

478
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,280
All right, ma'am?

479
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,480
Ma'am.

480
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
You should give up on Wu.

481
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,399
Her noggin isn't good enough

482
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,399
to understand you.

483
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,360
I can decide for her.

484
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:55,760
We have a lot of ducks here.

485
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,639
But we only have one Wu.

486
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:00,600
This doesn't make sense.

487
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,919
Wu isn't even your daughter.

488
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,240
How can you decide for her?

489
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,199
Wu isn't my daughter,

490
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,159
so I can't marry her off to just anybody.

491
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,600
Ma'am,

492
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:09,879
what if one day

493
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,480
her parents show up?

494
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,679
Imagine that.

495
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,879
How am I supposed to face them?

496
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,480
Nonsense!

497
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,320
You just want to keep her for your son!

498
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,520
Ma'am, I don't know about that.

499
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,960
But I do know that she isn't

500
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,560
going to be your daughter-in-law.

501
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,000
Have fun raising those two idiots

502
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,560
all your life, then!

503
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:33,159
Unbelievable!

504
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,560
Curse it!

505
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:36,879
This is getting on my nerves!

506
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,320
Come inside.

507
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,919
Listen, just now, you were--

508
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,679
Are you stupid?

509
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,040
Her son is dull.

510
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,000
And so is she.

511
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,720
No one in their right mind

512
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,320
would marry their daughter to her son.

513
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,439
Are you trying to ruin Wu's life?

514
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:03,520
But Wu can't stay with us forever.

515
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,240
She's an adult now.

516
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,959
It's not right.

517
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,280
When I'm free tomorrow,

518
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,320
I'll take her to the town.

519
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,959
I'll find her family. All right?

520
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,600
I guess that's the only option we have.

521
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,040
Dad, Mom,

522
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,120
even if we can't find her family,

523
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,840
we can't throw her away.

524
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,120
Can we

525
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,480
adopt her, then?

526
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,959
She is right!

527
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,959
You do fancy her!

528
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,080
Perhaps I can adopt her as my goddaughter.

529
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:50,399
You'll have a sister.

530
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,360
Mom!

531
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,080
I've been thinking.

532
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:57,080
If we cannot find her family,

533
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,320
we can only accept her

534
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:00,480
as our family.

535
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,760
What do you mean?

536
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,959
Are you saying that she's stupid

537
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,720
or that our son isn't good enough for her?

538
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,760
No, I don't think she's stupid at all.

539
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,800
I just think that she's so distant.

540
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:12,080
She's so cold.

541
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,879
Even a dog

542
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:15,560
will show gratitude.

543
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,480
Do you think

544
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,639
she treats us as her family?

545
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,919
You're quite emotional.

546
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
No, I'm not.

547
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,000
Wu.

548
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:29,560
Do you like us?

549
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:30,600
Do you like Doggy?

550
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,360
Like?

551
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,480
What is "like"?

552
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,480
See? She doesn't know what affection is.

553
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,120
-I was just joking. -What is "like"?

554
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,159
I like…

555
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,639
Like…

556
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,000
-Wu? -Like.

557
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,320
-Wu! -Like.

558
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,320
-Okay. Forget it. -Does your head hurt again?

559
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,600
-Like. -Don't think about it.

560
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,399
-Stop thinking. -Like.

561
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,639
Like!

562
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,439
Like!

563
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,280
Like.

564
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,919
-What is "like"? -All right.

565
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,320
Wu.

566
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,760
Stop thinking about it.

567
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,040
I didn't mean it.

568
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,000
All right, now.

569
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,199
The Huangyang shoulder pole

570
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,159
Is soft and flexible

571
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,399
Sisters and brothers

572
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:49,000
Carrying the rice grains to Liuzhou

573
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,399
Come on, brothers

574
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:56,560
Let's go to Liuzhou

575
00:31:56,639 --> 00:31:58,879
Oh, brothers

576
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,360
Three, two, one.

577
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,280
I'll send the photo here in a few days.

578
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,560
Is that all?

579
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:16,080
Thank you!

580
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,159
Thank you.

581
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:19,600
Wu.

582
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,800
We'll get to see the family photo

583
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:23,159
in a few days.

584
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,600
Family photo?

585
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,080
What is that?

586
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:29,639
It's a photo of all of us together.

587
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,600
-Dig in. -Wu.

588
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,399
You have been here for five years now.

589
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,639
We don't know when your birthday is.

590
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,080
I was thinking.

591
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:38,879
We should use the date of your arrival

592
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,159
as your birthday.

593
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Wu, happy birthday.

594
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,240
What is a birthday?

595
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,879
Birthday is the day

596
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,360
you get to eat many good things.

597
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,879
On my last birthday,

598
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,600
Mom boiled two eggs for me.

599
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,240
Two eggs.

600
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,760
Have some more.

601
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,320
So is all this food for me?

602
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:04,919
Well, yes. It's yours!

603
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,360
Eat.

604
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,600
Mine.

605
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:11,280
Mine.

606
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:58,760
Doggy,

607
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,199
I left one last slice of meat for you.

608
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,679
Is it delicious?

609
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:15,080
Say thank you, then.

610
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,719
Thanks, Wu!

611
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,600
Wu

612
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,560
became our fondest family member.

613
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,639
But the blissful days

614
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,120
were soon interrupted

615
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,560
by a tragedy.

616
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,319
Don't resist!
Move it!

617
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,880
Take all food and valuables.

618
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,120
Hurry up!

619
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,360
Don't resist! Stay there!

620
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,120
That's our lamb!

621
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,080
Sit back down!

622
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,640
Gather these villagers later

623
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,319
and burn them alive.

624
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,360
Leave no survivors, lest they expose us.

625
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,759
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

626
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,920
The Huangyang shoulder pole Is soft and flexible

627
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,759
-Sisters and brothers -Hurry up.

628
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,120
They say Liuzhou--

629
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,600
This woman is…

630
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:43,240
Show me your smile.
Boss!

631
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,120
Come.

632
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,000
Sir! Mercy, please. Take everything away.

633
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,799
But not her!

634
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,839
She's still young.

635
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,000
Don't take her away.

636
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,080
I'm begging you. Please!

637
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,120
She's young. Spare her--

638
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,400
I'll kill you!

639
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,839
Doggy!

640
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,160
Boss, what do you think of her?

641
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,240
Stay right there!

642
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,319
Doggy!

643
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:44,240
What a cruel world!

644
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,520
This is not fair!

645
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,680
This is not fair!

646
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Ms. Zhao.

647
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,440
For some reason, when I see you cry,

648
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,000
I feel sad.

649
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,960
This place hurts.

650
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,279
I don't want to see you cry.

651
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,680
I don't want to see Mr. Xu and Doggy

652
00:37:16,759 --> 00:37:17,720
getting hurt.

653
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,880
I want to see you smile.

654
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,759
I want to hear you sing.

655
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,120
Does this mean I like all of you?

656
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,160
Ms. Zhao, I like you.

657
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,200
I like Mr. Xu.

658
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:30,400
I like Doggy.

659
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,759
Wu.

660
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,279
I envy you at times.

661
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,359
You can stay ignorant.

662
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,680
Ms. Zhao, I don't want you to cry.

663
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:50,960
I want you to be happy.

664
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,200
How can I make you happy?

665
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,480
My husband is dead.

666
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,400
What do you think can make me happy?

667
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,279
Ms. Zhao.

668
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,080
All right.

669
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,640
I want all of them dead!

670
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:17,319
That woman

671
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,680
is feisty.

672
00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:19,880
I like that.

673
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,920
All right, Ms. Zhao.

674
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,600
I'll kill all of them.

675
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,640
You pack a punch, lass.

676
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,080
Are you trained?

677
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:56,040
My mom thought that bloodbath

678
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,040
would traumatize me.

679
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,279
Little did she know

680
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,040
that for someone like me

681
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,759
who has one foot in the Outsiders' world,

682
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,040
what I saw was something

683
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,080
that defied all common sense.
