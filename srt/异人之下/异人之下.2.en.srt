1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,440
MOUNT WUDANG

2
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,360
Tai Chi

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,640
is a beautiful martial art

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,560
that combines self-defense and health benefits.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,000
It emphasizes the harmony of softness and strength,

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,840
and the integration of movement and stillness.

7
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:24,439
It doesn't only strengthen your body,

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,919
it also improves your temperament.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,959
The key is that we must practice diligently

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,200
to understand its mysteries.

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,279
As you progress in your training,

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,559
you will advance in skill.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,120
Get up, you rascal.

14
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:42,760
Hurry up and practice.

15
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:44,519
If the grandmaster sees how lazy you are,

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,440
he'll expel you from the sect!

17
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:53,120
Fine.

18
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,599
Wang Ye, where are you going?

19
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,560
I'm aware of my wrongdoings.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,440
I'm going to see Grandmaster for forgiveness.

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,240
Wang Ye, what brings you here?

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,720
Grandmaster,

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,679
your hearing is sharper than ever.

24
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,360
You knew it was me from my footsteps.

25
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,160
I have something serious to ask you.

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,440
Do you think

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,759
a person

28
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:28,600
can be passively pulled into a phantasmagoria?

29
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:30,960
ZHOU MENG, LEADER OF WUDANG SECT

30
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,200
Passively?

31
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,160
I mean that they didn't even intentionally initiate it

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,000
but involuntarily entered the phantasmagoria.

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,960
Phantasmagoria arises from thoughts.

34
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,960
There must be a cause for there to be an effect.

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,679
But not all causes

36
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,080
are within your consciousness.

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,080
And "thoughts"

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,839
don't solely refer to the ones in your mind.

39
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,320
Everything in the world can be one thought.

40
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,440
Everything in the world can be a cause.

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,399
They all have the potential to evoke your phantasmagoria.

42
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:06,839
The thoughts in our minds

43
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,280
are about past events.

44
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:09,840
YEAR OF JIASHEN

45
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,200
Past causes can trigger present effects.

46
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,280
And present events

47
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:16,960
can also bring about future consequences.

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,799
Doesn't that mean we can predict the future?

49
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,680
Grandmaster,

50
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,320
did you ever travel by train

51
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,160
in the Year of Jiashen?

52
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,480
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

53
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:56,880
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

54
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

55
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,359
FOURTEEN YEARS AGO

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
-Come out! Show yourself, Zhang Chulan! -Come out!

57
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,519
-Do you hear me? -What outrageous behavior is this?

58
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,640
Who do you think you are?

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760
Mr. Zhang,

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,480
I can't let your grandson, Zhang Chulan,

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,079
hit my son, Hu, like this for nothing!

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,000
Look at my son, Gou.

63
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,640
Just look at what he did to him.

64
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,640
And look at my son.

65
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,280
His hair is smoking from being hit.

66
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,399
It was a fight. Why did you shock him?

67
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,040
-But Grandpa, they-- -Shut up!

68
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,160
Dear villagers.

69
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,720
ZHANG CHULAN (AGE EIGHT), ZHANG XILIN

70
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:25,880
I'm truly sorry.

71
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:28,440
It's indeed Chulan's fault in this matter.

72
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,399
Well, I promise to compensate you

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,120
for your children's injuries.

74
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,040
Tomorrow morning, I'll go to the city

75
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,519
to borrow money from my relatives.

76
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,560
Once I have the money,

77
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,679
I'll rush back

78
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
and personally deliver it to each of you.

79
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,200
Is this okay?

80
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,760
-Save it! -Borrow money from relatives?

81
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,359
You can't even find your own son.

82
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,280
Zhang Chulan is also a fatherless child.

83
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,079
-Come back! -Look at him!

84
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,600
-He is so unruly! -He has no manners at all!

85
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,840
Please rest assured.

86
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,519
Even if I have to sell everything

87
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,720
or borrow from loan sharks,

88
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,640
I'll definitely compensate all of you.

89
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,079
-No! -Pay up now!

90
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,399
-Pay up now! -Pay up now!

91
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,160
-Pay up now! -Please believe me!

92
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,720
What do I usually tell you?

93
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,040
What should you do

94
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,159
when someone bullies you?

95
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,120
Endure it.

96
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,039
Did you do it?

97
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:22,680
-But Grandpa-- -No buts!

98
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,800
Grandpa, I really can't take it.

99
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,039
You have to even if you can't.

100
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,039
Let it go.

101
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,960
-Grandpa, why did you do that? -It hurts, right?

102
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,000
The next time you can't endure it,

103
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,240
flick yourself several times.

104
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,240
When it doesn't hurt anymore

105
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,520
that means you have endured it.

106
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,560
PATIENCE

107
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,320
You did a good job by standing up for Yu.

108
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,440
But you still got into a fight.

109
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,479
Now, we have to move again.

110
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,320
Chulan, hang in there a little longer.

111
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,520
When we reach our new home,

112
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,479
I'll make you delicious braised pork knuckles.

113
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,039
I don't want to eat. I'm not hungry.

114
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,840
Don't be mad at me.

115
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,960
Grandpa,

116
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,960
do I have a dad?

117
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,359
I'm sure you must be wondering

118
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,880
when your dad will come to fetch you

119
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,039
because I was harsh on you.

120
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,280
Where on earth is he anyway?

121
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,080
I've never even met him.

122
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,479
When you've grown up,

123
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,080
your dad will come for you.

124
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,599
Grandpa,

125
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,359
ever since I was little,

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,240
we have always moved whenever I got into a fight.

127
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,479
Why is that?

128
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,200
It's hard to explain it to you now.

129
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,840
When you grow up,

130
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:09,359
I will tell you everything.

131
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,400
Grandpa,

132
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,240
should I help others or not?

133
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,359
You should.

134
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,359
But you also shouldn't.

135
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,200
You can decide for yourself

136
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,599
when you grow up.

137
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,880
When we reach our new home,

138
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,880
I'll find you a good school.

139
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,039
You'll study hard,

140
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,400
go to high school, and attend university.

141
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,719
After graduating, find a good job,

142
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,080
and then find a girl who loves and cares for you.

143
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,159
Then get married, build a family,

144
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,760
and live a peaceful life like ordinary people.

145
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,120
I'm getting old.

146
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,479
I don't know how many more years

147
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
I can still stay by your side.

148
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,359
That's it.

149
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
That's the way to do it.

150
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,880
No matter what difficulties you face,

151
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,000
you must hang in there.

152
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,200
Don't despair.

153
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,359
Be patient.

154
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,560
You have to be patient.

155
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,159
On the night of a full moon, a mysterious Bum-naked Hero appeared

156
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:13,239
with snow-white butt cheeks!

157
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,080
BUM-NAKED HERO

158
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:16,440
My fellow mates, let's get him!

159
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,000
Find out who this is.

160
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,719
His physique looks pretty decent.

161
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:21,440
I think I've seen this guy before.

162
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,280
Heavens! I can't bear to look at it!

163
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,880
My eyes!

164
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,719
If you see this Bum-naked Hero under the full moon,

165
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,840
you'll meet your true love.

166
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:32,359
True love?
This is shocking.

167
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,479
That snow-white buttock is the shining beacon of hope

168
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,719
for us single folks.

169
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:39,560
Look, my angel is actually out and about with bandages.

170
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,200
What a dedicated effort to spread love.

171
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,440
It must be true. Our true love depends entirely on him.

172
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:45,960
That was you, right?

173
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,159
Is your arm better now?

174
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:59,760
I'm in good health.

175
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,120
Who did it?

176
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,320
It was me.

177
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,679
Do you have a problem with that?

178
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,479
No.

179
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,359
Just be careful next time.

180
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,560
Excuse me.

181
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,239
Pick up the ball, will you?

182
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,359
PATIENCE

183
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:36,079
PATIENCE

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You sounded cocky earlier.

185
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:41,520
Luckily, you are

186
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,240
pretty thick-skinned.

187
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:10,319
You're back early.

188
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,280
I didn't see him all day.

189
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,439
I think he's already asleep.

190
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,240
-Should we invite him online later? -No.

191
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:16,439
He's odd and antisocial.

192
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,640
He even sneaks to the toilet to avoid us.

193
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:20,439
He doesn't have a single friend.

194
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,839
Listen, don't bother with this unlucky guy.

195
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,480
Nothing good ever happens.

196
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,360
Chulan.

197
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,400
Have you been feeling unlucky?

198
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,520
Everything seems to be going wrong lately, right?

199
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,800
-No. -No?

200
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,040
Take this.

201
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,439
Look at you pouting your lips.

202
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:43,520
A soy sauce bottle could hang there.

203
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Do you think I didn't notice?

204
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,640
Listen.

205
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,640
Fate is predestined.

206
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,040
It's beyond your control.

207
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,480
No one can change it.

208
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,079
But luck

209
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,720
is different.

210
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,720
Look at these.

211
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,800
These peaks represent hardships in life.

212
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,800
We may not know

213
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,439
where they will turn in the end.

214
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,040
But wave after wave,

215
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,760
they go up and down.

216
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,439
This shows that when you are at your unluckiest time,

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360
you must hang in there.

218
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:15,079
It's during this persistence

219
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,000
that your luck

220
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:18,880
often starts to rise.

221
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,800
CUTE MASTER

222
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,920
LOADING

223
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,079
CUTE MASTER

224
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,680
She's actually beautiful.

225
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,240
She's really a beauty!

226
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,079
YANYAN, YOUR PROFILE PICTURE IS SO CUTE

227
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,600
CHULAN, LET'S MEET UP TOMORROW

228
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,480
I CAN TEACH YOU HOW TO SKATE

229
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,600
Grandpa was right.

230
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,959
After a streak of bad luck,

231
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,839
good things do come.

232
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,360
I must do my best tomorrow evening.

233
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,480
It's settled then.

234
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,360
Yanyan,

235
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,319
see you tomorrow.

236
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
YANYAN, SEE YOU TOMORROW

237
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,959
Students,

238
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,120
today we're going to talk

239
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:27,400
about divination.

240
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,319
The art of divination

241
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,800
requires adaptability.

242
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,199
Adaptability…

243
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,839
I've been looking for you all morning.

244
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,400
Why are you attending the Classical Chinese Studies lecture?

245
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,719
Listen, I'm going out for a while.

246
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,240
I'll be back at night. Then you'll come with me to see someone.

247
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,719
I can't, Ms. Bao.

248
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,959
I'm busy today.

249
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,360
Master,

250
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:55,920
I am really busy today.

251
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,160
Wait for my call tonight.

252
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:09,319
DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I LOOK LIKE?

253
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,240
SURE

254
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,880
CUTE MASTER

255
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,280
It's just a simple meeting with an online friend.

256
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,280
Don't be nervous.
Stay calm.

257
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,079
Hey, Chulan.

258
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:05,680
Who are you?

259
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,280
It's me, Liu Yanyan.

260
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,839
You look even better in person than in the video.

261
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,079
You can call me Yanyan.

262
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,800
That sounds more familiar.

263
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,800
I already spotted you

264
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,040
when I was at the corner.

265
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,480
Do we know each other before?

266
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,920
Yes, I noticed you

267
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,400
at the freshman registration office.

268
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,959
Are we in the same university?

269
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,920
That's impossible!

270
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,280
I would have known

271
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,839
if our school had such a pretty girl.

272
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,160
Let me show you something.

273
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,040
I dress very inconspicuously on campus.

274
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,439
It's normal

275
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,880
that you didn't notice me.

276
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:48,880
People are like that,

277
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,480
always wearing masks,

278
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,839
moving back and forth,

279
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,880
thinking they can fool everyone.

280
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:56,079
But deep down,

281
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,000
only we know ourselves the best,

282
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,000
right?

283
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,480
He thought I couldn't track him

284
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,760
if he turned off his phone.

285
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:06,079
But we had the tech department

286
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,400
install a tracker on his phone.

287
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,360
Don't worry. We won't lose him.

288
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:11,240
But I never expected Zhang Chulan

289
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:12,719
to have the guts to stand you up.

290
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,640
He's quite courageous.

291
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,479
He doesn't have the guts to do that.

292
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,400
Are you saying someone else got to him?

293
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,120
We'll know after we find him.

294
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:22,640
Today,

295
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,839
I'll use

296
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,760
some "husband-taming" skills on him.

297
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,880
"Husband-taming"?

298
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:30,079
Hold it. What nonsense did Xu Si teach you now?

299
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,599
Xu Si said

300
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,880
"husband-taming" is a supreme art

301
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,719
that every independent woman must master.

302
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,880
It has a crucial effect

303
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,959
on her future life.

304
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,959
What?

305
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:43,719
It means to be an independent woman.

306
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,959
I didn't know you had such a big appetite.

307
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:05,040
It's because I raise worms in my body.

308
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,959
So I don't get full no matter how much I eat.

309
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:13,760
Did you actually believe that, Chulan?

310
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:15,959
You're too adorable.

311
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,079
Just an average amount.

312
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,400
I'll go and pay the bill first.

313
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

314
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,000
MASTER

315
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,560
REPLY WITHIN THREE MINUTES

316
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,079
MASTER

317
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,560
THREE MINUTES ARE UP. YOU'RE DEAD.

318
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,760
MASTER

319
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,120
PREPARE TO BE BURIED TONIGHT

320
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:47,240
Who are you texting?

321
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:48,360
No one.

322
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:49,640
I wasn't texting anyone.

323
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:50,560
Then…

324
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,160
Could it be your girlfriend checking up on you?

325
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,359
I don't have a girlfriend.

326
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,199
Really?

327
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,000
Yes.

328
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,760
Why would I lie to you?

329
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:05,479
That's fortunate to hear.

330
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,920
I don't have a boyfriend either.

331
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,760
Chulan,

332
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,839
I was quite happy when you said

333
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,839
you don't have a girlfriend.

334
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,199
I'll go faster, okay?

335
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,120
Okay.

336
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,079
Chulan, you're great at this.

337
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,839
Where's my grandfather's body?

338
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,280
When did you find out?

339
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,159
I looked you up in the Classical Chinese Studies Dept.,

340
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,879
but your name wasn't listed.

341
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,480
I started to be suspicious then.

342
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,159
My mind was telling me

343
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:33,240
that a romantic encounter out of nowhere

344
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,600
would never happen to me!

345
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,800
And guess what? It was a plot!

346
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,240
One can never truly hide their true colors.

347
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,200
So tell me.
What's your purpose?

348
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,240
Bring him here,

349
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,240
dead or alive.

350
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,879
And then, you'll be one of us.

351
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,600
What the heck?

352
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,280
Did you even gather help?

353
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,399
LIU YANYAN, THRALL MASTER OF XIANGXI

354
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:18,280
Who are you trying to scare with those masks?

355
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,480
Do you think I'm a pushover

356
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,760
that anyone can push around?

357
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,600
What's happening?

358
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,960
How did you control--

359
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,720
They've made their move.

360
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,360
I heard there are mysterious people infiltrating this city.

361
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,720
It looks like the news is true.

362
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:43,159
Do you mean those from Sinister Pleasure?

363
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,879
Don't be careless.

364
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,320
They're not small fries this time.

365
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,560
Get ready to work.

366
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,840
Excuse me. Where is this place?

367
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,679
Sure enough,

368
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,200
you're the descendant of that respected senior.

369
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,280
It's the same power.

370
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,520
Even though it's sealed,

371
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,800
I can still feel

372
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:47,520
the immense power within you.

373
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,919
Is this a seal?

374
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,200
I never expected Zhang Xilin would come up with this move.

375
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,879
Not a bit of his primordial energy has leaked out.

376
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,080
Xia He,

377
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,000
you're not planning to do it here, are you?

378
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,600
At least let me do what I need.

379
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:23,720
After that,

380
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,960
he's all yours.

381
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,760
Then you had better be quick

382
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,639
and don't ruin him.

383
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,760
I'll begin, then.

384
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,360
What are you doing?

385
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,960
We just want to search for something.

386
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,520
Like what?

387
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,960
Your memory, of course.

388
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,439
Memories?

389
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,679
What kind of memories?

390
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,200
Every memory of your grandfather.

391
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,919
I will decide if you know.

392
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,200
How do you decide that?

393
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,600
Allow me to introduce myself.

394
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,480
I'm Lyu Liang from Sinister Pleasure.

395
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,240
I can directly inquire and examine

396
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,000
one's primordial spirit.

397
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,120
I won't extract all of your primordial spirit.

398
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,320
I only need to grasp certain parts of your memories.

399
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,800
Relax a bit.

400
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,159
It'll be over soon.

401
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:22,240
I've brought Zhang Chulan here.

402
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,800
Isn't it time to fulfill your promise?

403
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,320
Can I join you now?

404
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
Congratulations.

405
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,639
From now on, you're a member of Sinister Pleasure.

406
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,960
Is it that simple?

407
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,280
Isn't there an initiation ceremony,

408
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,120
symbols, or things like tattoos?

409
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,800
No need for all that trouble.

410
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:42,800
You only need to publicly declare that you're a part of Sinister Pleasure.

411
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,360
Then why did you make me do so much?

412
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:45,439
Are you messing with me?

413
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,840
Just as you said,

414
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:48,760
Sinister Pleasure is a sect with character.

415
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,720
Having no rules is the biggest rule.

416
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:17,159
Xu San.

417
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,439
Feng Baobao.

418
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,240
You're early for the party.

419
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,560
Baobao, this won't be easy.

420
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:26,520
We brought too few people this time.

421
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,080
It's not just Lyu Liang.

422
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,439
Even Bone Scraper Xia He

423
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,159
and the Thrall Master of Xiangxi are here.

424
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,960
No problem.

425
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,480
I will get rid of them.

426
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,560
Xu San,

427
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,200
your telekinetic power has become stronger.

428
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,679
I've been wanting to have fun with you for a while.

429
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,320
Of course,

430
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,080
it's better to do it in a room.

431
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,840
Today, I don't want to fight you.

432
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,000
Hand over Zhang Chulan,

433
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,280
and you can leave.

434
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,919
You wish.

435
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:13,560
Take Zhang Chulan away.

436
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,240
His memories haven't been extracted yet.

437
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,960
I'm new to Sinister Pleasure.

438
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,080
Let me give you a gift.

439
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,040
Again?

440
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,399
Baobao,

441
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,840
don't underestimate her.

442
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,639
She's Bone Scraper Xia He.

443
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,919
She can awaken people's primal desires and lead them into constant indulgence.

444
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,720
Sinister Pleasure manipulates people's hearts.

445
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,000
Sinister Pleasure.

446
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,040
NO RULES, NO PRINCIPLES

447
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,199
That was a quick reflex.

448
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,639
But unfortunately, you're still no match for me.

449
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,480
Xia He, you're amazing.

450
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,000
Sinister Pleasure

451
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,879
is indeed cool and has character.

452
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,080
Of course.

453
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,199
She's one of the Four Crazies of Sinister Pleasure,

454
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,679
Bone Scraper Xia He.

455
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,159
Put me down.

456
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,040
Okay.

457
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,320
But don't charge again.

458
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,919
Which one of you has never eaten coriander in your life?

459
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,679
Didn't I say to wait for my message?

460
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,919
Intercom interference.

461
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,760
You guys can carry on.

462
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,919
Stop right there.

463
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,520
Xu San,

464
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,720
did you call him here?

465
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,040
That's right.

466
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,480
Since we got Zhang Chulan back,

467
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,320
the agreement for today is void.

468
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,679
We, NDT Express, must take all of you with us.

469
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,720
XU SAN, EXECUTIVE SECRETARY TO THE GM OF THE LUBEI REGION

470
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,639
-With NDT Express, -With NDT Express,

471
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,360
-life is easier! -life is easier!

472
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,000
Mr. Lyu Liang!

473
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,360
-Ms. Xia He! -Ms. Xia He!

474
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:52,639
-Your delivery! -Your delivery!

475
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,639
They're so committed.

476
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,560
NDT EXPRESS OUTSIDER MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION

477
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,280
SAFEGUARDS THE OUTSIDERS' WORLD STABILITY

478
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,840
AND ERADICATES EVIL FORCES AMONG THEM

479
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,760
Do you want to catch us? It won't be that easy.

480
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,439
We must take Zhang Chulan with us today.

481
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,399
Groundhog, go and snatch Zhang Chulan!

482
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,560
-Baobao. -Ms. Bao, help!

483
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,560
Who messed with my plan?

484
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:09,480
Yoyo ball!

485
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,199
Lyu Liang.

486
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,199
They went to the roller coaster area.

487
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,399
Knock them down!

488
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,480
Xu San, catch him.

489
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,480
Don't sway about!

490
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,959
It's soft.

491
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,040
What kind of superpower can make it explode?

492
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,959
Run!

493
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,199
Xu San?

494
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,240
BONE SCRAPER

495
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,399
Xu San,

496
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
you took a blow from my bone-scraping technique.

497
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,480
Let's see how you handle it.

498
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,600
Are you okay?

499
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:55,639
Back off!

500
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,800
I might turn dangerous later.

501
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,159
So this is the bone-scraping technique.

502
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,439
Zhang Chulan.

503
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:34,280
Ms. Bao, help!

504
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,959
Retreat!

505
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:12,240
Can't I choose my own path?

506
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,120
Can I wear a seat belt?

507
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,639
You're not even fastening it properly.

508
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,360
Let's go.

509
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:04,520
I told you wearing a seat belt is important.

510
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,480
Lyu Liang, save me!

511
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,600
I'm a member of Sinister Pleasure too!

512
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,399
So what? You don't even know what Sinister Pleasure is.

513
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,080
POWER SUPPRESSION ELIZABETHAN COLLAR

514
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,679
Ms. Bao, you're finally here.

515
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,719
You didn't answer my call.

516
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Ms. Bao.

517
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,199
Ms. Bao! I'm sorry!

518
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,679
Ms. Bao! No, Ms. Bao!

519
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,719
Ms. Bao, don't kill me!

520
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,199
Ms. Bao!

521
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,520
XU SI, ASSISTANT TO THE GM OF THE LUBEI REGION

522
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,400
Xu Si, your antidote didn't work.

523
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,360
That's because his dosage was too small.

524
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,640
Xu San,

525
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,560
I've told you

526
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,040
that Xia He is not easy to handle

527
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,440
and not to take her lightly.

528
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,400
Do you understand? Will you listen to me now?

529
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,920
My grandfather said luck comes and goes.

530
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,319
When things hit rock bottom, they will eventually get better.

531
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,080
It was a lie.

532
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,960
I have no luck.

533
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,640
Things only get worse.

534
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,839
No one is interested in me.

535
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,600
That Liu Yanyan.

536
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,200
I knew her identity was fake,

537
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:28,160
but I was still hopeful!

538
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:30,960
Do you feel despair for this reason?

539
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,080
No need for that.

540
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,720
Because no one's luck stays bad forever.

541
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,480
Ms. Bao,

542
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,680
you're actually comforting me.

543
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,560
I used to think you were creepy

544
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,040
and sometimes even crazy.

545
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,160
I never expected you to be a good person.

546
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,480
Your bad luck

547
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,080
is not because of bad luck itself,

548
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,680
but because you're an idiot.

549
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:02,680
Put him down.

550
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:08,680
How stupid can you be to believe that some girl

551
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:10,440
would throw herself at someone like you?

552
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,720
Look at your unlucky face

553
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:13,440
and cheap clothes worth only 200 yuan.

554
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,640
If strangers come up to you,

555
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,880
they must be after something.

556
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,160
You're utterly worthless.

557
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,640
Do you really think you're precious?

558
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,040
How about now? Do you feel comforted?

559
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,839
Don't play dead. Get up.

560
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,440
But

561
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,520
this is a courier company.

562
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,720
NDT EXPRESS

563
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:40,120
Get up. I'm taking you to meet someone.

564
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:07,120
XU XIANG, GENERAL MANAGER OF THE LUBEI REGION

565
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,120
Zhang Chulan.

566
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,759
What do you guys do?

567
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:12,040
We are, in fact,

568
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,520
a special management organization for Outsiders,

569
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,279
operating under the guise of a courier company.

570
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:19,480
Come with me.

571
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,359
And what about my abductors?

572
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,520
Who are they?

573
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Sinister Pleasure.

574
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,319
Just like us,

575
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,759
they are also Outsiders with superpowers.

576
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,600
But they are also different from us.

577
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,839
As Outsiders,

578
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,160
they're not willing to take any responsibilities.

579
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,080
Responsibilities?

580
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,279
Outsiders have a bit more power than ordinary people,

581
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,880
and thus a bit more responsibility.

582
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,279
They only care about themselves.

583
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,680
But as Outsiders,

584
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:51,359
we must adhere to the principle of not affecting ordinary people.

585
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,880
We must guard against those who abuse their Outsider abilities

586
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,799
and believe themselves superior to ordinary people,

587
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,160
just like Sinister Pleasure.

588
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,720
We must make the greatest effort

589
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:01,560
to maintain stability in the Outsiders' world.

590
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,319
As an Outsiders management organization,

591
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,160
we may appear to be delivery couriers,

592
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,600
but in reality, we're responsible

593
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,759
for dealing with troublemakers among the Outsiders.

594
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:10,920
Our most important mission

595
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,600
is to protect the ordinary people's world

596
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,640
from being affected by Outsiders

597
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,400
and to prevent any harm to this world.

598
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,400
"In poverty, focus on self-improvement.

599
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,480
In prosperity, help the world."

600
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,120
To be able to uphold the current state

601
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,680
of peaceful harmony day after day

602
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,160
is the ultimate purpose of NDT Express.

603
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,680
That is so complicated.

604
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:57,040
Safety first.

605
00:38:58,279 --> 00:38:59,120
Come with me, Chulan.

606
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,120
I'll show you around inside.

607
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,759
Ms. Bao, aren't you coming?

608
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,880
Welcome to the new world.

609
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,279
NDT EXPRESS

610
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:32,160
AN OUTSIDER SPECIAL MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION

611
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,279
ESTABLISHED TO HANDLE OUTSIDERS AND RELATED INCIDENTS

612
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:35,400
AND MAINTAIN THE BALANCE

613
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,720
BETWEEN THE OUTSIDERS' WORLD AND ORDINARY PEOPLE'S WORLD.

614
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:39,640
OPERATING UNDER THE GUISE OF A COURIER COMPANY,

615
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,319
IT ENSURES THAT OUTSIDERS DON'T DISRUPT ORDINARY PEOPLE'S LIVES,

616
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,319
SAFEGUARDS THE STABILITY OF THE OUTSIDERS' WORLD,

617
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,520
AND ERADICATES EVIL FORCES AMONG THEM.
