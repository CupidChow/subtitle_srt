1
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,279
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,680
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,960
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:44,400
Members of Sinister Pleasure

5
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,640
are inside the room.

6
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,919
Yuan Tao and Fool should have recovered by now

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,360
from the Ganbei Grassland battle.

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,800
Why didn't they join us for dinner?

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
Mr. Xia,

10
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:00,919
are you free for a chat?

11
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,599
We booked a private room

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,600
because we wanted to eat in peace.

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,440
Lyu Liang,

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,479
when did you become this detestable?

15
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:11,679
Leave.

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,600
I told you to leave. Didn't you hear me?

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,320
What is Lyu Liang doing here?

18
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,240
It seems

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,679
I have no choice but to speak with you.

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,720
Am I right?

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,720
Mr. Xia,

22
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:12,960
please clear the table.

23
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,519
We can have a nice chat after this.

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,640
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,560
Erzhuang, did you see that?

26
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,400
That's not the Lyu family's Soul Whisperer.

27
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,959
What was that?

28
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm not sure either.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,959
We must observe them before making a move.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,239
This is more like it.

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,840
Only when we're united

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,239
can we work toward our goal.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,840
I've implanted the memory related to that woman

34
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,320
into your brains.

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,640
I only have one request.

36
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
Find that person

37
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,560
at all costs.

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

39
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,640
You must be careful when you go inside.

40
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,920
Don't worry.

41
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:21,280
Lyu Liang, wait for me!

42
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:22,440
Come after me!

43
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,359
I'm number one!

44
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,040
You cheated!

45
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,760
These are the remaining coins from this afternoon.

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,720
Hold onto them.

47
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:02,480
It has only been a few days.

48
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,760
What's with the grand display?

49
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:06,880
Who are you?

50
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,320
Have you erased your own memories too?

51
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:19,200
Who gave that to you?

52
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,200
You.

53
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:22,479
Unlock your memories

54
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
and tell me the truth.

55
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,760
I gave you two pieces.

56
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,039
Where's the other one?

57
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:52,880
Lyu Liang,

58
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,200
you weren't using the Lyu family's Soul Whisperer just now.

59
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,159
What was that?

60
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,919
You're still as shameless as always,

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,360
Zhang Chulan.

62
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,000
Why don't you check this out first?

63
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,039
No, you must not go back.

64
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,640
We must not let Master know about this.

65
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:16,880
What epiphany did you receive

66
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,440
for you to say something like that?

67
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,400
Dummy.

68
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,840
Let's go. We're running out of time.

69
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,880
I'm coming.

70
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,560
One of them is my grandfather.

71
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,080
Who's the other person?

72
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:34,560
Duanmu Ying.

73
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,719
Just like your grandfather,

74
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,359
she is one of the 36 Thieves

75
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,479
and one of the creators of the Eight Supremes.

76
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
Her supreme is called Double Quan Palm.

77
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
You asked me what I used just now, right?

78
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,560
I was using Double Quan Palm.

79
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,520
Soul Whisperer

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,159
is just a small part of Double Quan Palm.

81
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,760
Now I wield one of the Eight Supremes too.

82
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,359
So why are you looking for her?

83
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,120
I want to clarify something with her,

84
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,760
and I'll kill her after that.

85
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,120
Is she still alive?

86
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,240
Soul Whisperer.

87
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,560
Double Quan Palm.

88
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:29,000
Soul Whisperer.

89
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,000
Double Quan Palm.

90
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,479
Soul Whisperer?

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,840
Ms. Bao!

92
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,840
What's wrong?

93
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:43,960
Why are you so agitated?

94
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,240
Ms. Bao, don't you understand?

95
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,640
Soul Whisperer is Double Quan Palm!

96
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:48,159
What's Soul Whisperer's specialty?

97
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,599
It can manipulate memories!

98
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,400
You suddenly appeared after the Jiashen Calamity

99
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,680
and don't remember any of it.

100
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,840
Have you ever suspected that your memories were tampered with?

101
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,200
The only Eight Supremes that affects memories

102
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
is Double Quan Palm.

103
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:00,760
The wielder is called Duanmu Ying!

104
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Memories?

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,599
I'm sure Duanmu Ying knows your identity and background.

106
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,880
We have to locate her before Lyu Liang.

107
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,200
How can we find her?

108
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,039
Erzhuang!

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,440
Erzhuang isn't replying to me.

110
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:13,159
Xu San.

111
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,080
NDT EXPRESS

112
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,560
Erzhuang is an entity

113
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,400
under the highest level of confidentiality.

114
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,000
Not only did you two steal my glasses,

115
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,560
but you're also posing me a problem.

116
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,799
Xu San, this concerns Ms. Bao's memories.

117
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,840
Two generations of Xus have protected her.

118
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,719
Now, we can finally find out her background.

119
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,840
What's stopping you here?

120
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,359
Chulan, you don't need to provoke me.

121
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,520
I know.

122
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:51,840
You want to locate Duanmu Ying

123
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,960
through Erzhuang.

124
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,440
-Right? -That's right.

125
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,200
Lyu Liang is also looking for Duanmu Ying.

126
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,560
That's why we need to find her before he does.

127
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:02,080
Chulan, you should think twice.

128
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,760
The person you're looking for

129
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,560
is one of the wielders of the Eight Supremes.

130
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,440
Even Sinister Pleasure and the Ten Elders couldn't harm her.

131
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,400
Xu San,

132
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,039
we're not here to negotiate a deal.

133
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,280
If you don't help us out,

134
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,719
we'll come up with a way ourselves.

135
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:17,799
You!

136
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,960
Doggy would've definitely helped me

137
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,280
if he were still around.

138
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,600
Fine, I'll bring you to Erzhuang.

139
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,000
But I don't know if she will help you.

140
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,439
Erzhuang is in the research lab.

141
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,600
You guys can reach out to her directly.

142
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,319
Ms. Bao, Zhang Chulan, hello.

143
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,360
We finally meet.

144
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,800
This is me, Erzhuang.

145
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
Don't feel sorry for me.

146
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:20,920
I'm already used to it.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,439
What do you wish to ask me?

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,600
How did you end up like this?

149
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,920
Something happened to me some time ago.

150
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,280
I ended up like this.

151
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,680
My father utilized all of his resources

152
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,079
to create this machine.

153
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,079
Therefore, I managed to survive.

154
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,319
As repayment,

155
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,560
I have to help NDT

156
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
manage their system and data.

157
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,480
Anyway,

158
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,360
I was able to stay alive.

159
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:50,760
However, I'm living in a different way from you guys.

160
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,560
What about you?

161
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,280
Do you wish to live like this?

162
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,319
I thought it was fun when I was young.

163
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,600
I gradually realized

164
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,520
that although there was nothing and no one I couldn't find

165
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,839
in the world,

166
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,439
I could only stay trapped in this dark room.

167
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
I couldn't go anywhere.

168
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:10,280
Delicious food, fun games,

169
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,480
and all the interesting people

170
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,040
have nothing to do with me.

171
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,319
Afraid that I would be bored,

172
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,360
my father taught me Out-of-Body Technique.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,640
I can leave my body in the form of electromagnetic waves.

174
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,839
That's the reason you see me everywhere.

175
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Did you guys know?

176
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,199
I watched a lot of your videos

177
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,160
during the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

178
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,319
I wanted to join the contest

179
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,920
with you at Mount Longhu so badly.

180
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,680
But I knew

181
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,920
it could only be a dream.

182
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,880
In the end, I'm just a cripple.

183
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,439
I can't even get dressed or eat by myself.

184
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,560
It's fine.

185
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,680
I'll bring you to the next Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

186
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,880
You don't even need to fight.

187
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,600
I'll bury all of your opponents for you.

188
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,199
You'll definitely be the champion.

189
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,520
Right, Zhang Chulan?

190
00:10:58,439 --> 00:10:59,319
That's right.

191
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
Thank you.

192
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,160
-Erzhuang. -I know.

193
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,319
You still want to know about Duanmu Ying.

194
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,920
I can tell you right now.

195
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,680
Duanmu Ying's Double Quan Palm

196
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,079
has two effects.

197
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,160
First, it can alter one's memories and cognition.

198
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,240
Second, it can alter one's body.

199
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:18,439
It can even regrow limbs.

200
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,000
My father has been looking for clues related to Double Quan Palm

201
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,520
ever since I got into an accident.

202
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,959
He hoped that he could restore my body

203
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,120
with Double Quan Palm.

204
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,199
That's when he discovered the Lyu family's Soul Whisperer.

205
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,480
But it's an incomplete version of Double Quan Palm.

206
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,680
It can only extract and replicate memories.

207
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,120
It cannot restore our bodies.

208
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,439
The real Double Quan Palm

209
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,800
is more comprehensive.

210
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,079
One palm can restore bodies

211
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,800
while the other can manipulate memories.

212
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,040
Not only can it extract and replicate memories,

213
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,439
but it can also erase them.

214
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,760
After that, my father received a report from someone.

215
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,160
He learned that Duanmu Ying was imprisoned by the Lyu family.

216
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,959
He came up with a way to save her

217
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
and brought her back to the company.

218
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,079
Since you guys have already found Duanmu Ying,

219
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,640
why are you still in this state?

220
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,640
It's complicated.

221
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,040
I don't know the exact reason either.

222
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,240
I hope you guys

223
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:11,199
can uncover the truth behind everything.

224
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,439
I would've joined you in the investigation

225
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,920
if it weren't for my disability.

226
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:17,439
Go now.

227
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,959
We'll definitely meet again in the future if there's a chance.

228
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,280
Yes.

229
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,240
NURSING HOME

230
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:51,920
Erzhuang sent us the address.

231
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,199
It's a company property.

232
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,880
I'm sure NDT's security guards are there.

233
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,199
What should we do?

234
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,040
We have to get help.

235
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,959
Xu San and Xu Si?

236
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,599
This case has drastic implications.

237
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,120
We mustn't implicate them.

238
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,400
Why aren't they here yet?

239
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,160
I'm done waiting.

240
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,040
Ms. Bao, wait a bit longer. This is NDT's turf. It's dangerous.

241
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,439
Our help will be here soon.

242
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,599
What's going on? Where is he?

243
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,280
Chulan!

244
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,839
Ms. Bao!

245
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,160
Chulan!

246
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,680
He's over there.

247
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,880
Chulan, Ms. Bao, long time no see!

248
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,199
Chulan, what are you doing? Don't be shy.

249
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,240
Turn off the sound system and go there!

250
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:02,000
-All right. -No problem.

251
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,480
You should've told us earlier.

252
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,280
I told you three to keep a low profile.

253
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,959
What's with the getup?

254
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,120
It depends on the occasion.

255
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:11,640
We mustn't embarrass Ms. Bao.

256
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,199
Is this your so-called "help"?

257
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,280
Get your equipment and follow my orders!

258
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,160
There are a lot of people inside.

259
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:43,880
I'm sure there's an ambush.

260
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,479
They all sound like experts.

261
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,439
I hear blunt weapons hitting the ground.

262
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,319
It seems like everyone is armed.

263
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,680
Someone is approaching-- Ms. Bao!

264
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:05,319
We'll cover your back.

265
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,959
You two should find a chance to escape.

266
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,120
Stop playing!

267
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,199
Time to watch our show!

268
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,560
Here I am!

269
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,959
Ladies and gentlemen,

270
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,959
the three of us came here today

271
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:22,120
to deliver warmth and wellness

272
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,439
to all of you.

273
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,800
What is this?

274
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:28,319
What are you guys doing?

275
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,599
Excuse me.

276
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,520
What are you doing? No salesmen allowed.

277
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:34,479
-We aren't salesmen. -We're delivering wellness and warmth.

278
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,280
We're here to deliver warmth.

279
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,959
Ms. Bao, I've searched all other areas.

280
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,400
I couldn't find Duanmu Ying.

281
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,640
This is the last place left.

282
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,719
Let's search it thoroughly.

283
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,079
Zhang Chulan.

284
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:21,680
That's her.

285
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Madam,

286
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,479
we aren't crooks.

287
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,160
My name is Zhang Chulan.

288
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,319
My grandfather is Zhang Huaiyi.

289
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,680
So does she have my memories?

290
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:41,680
I don't even know

291
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,800
if she has her own memories right now.

292
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:47,560
Didn't you notice that she's acting the same way

293
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,160
that the villagers did in Lyu Village?

294
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:55,079
I now understand

295
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,079
why Erzhuang's father sent her to a nursing home

296
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,400
instead of imprisoning her.

297
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,439
She has no qi at all.

298
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,800
No matter what, we should bring her back first.

299
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:09,200
We'll think of what to do later.

300
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:14,879
Guys, it only costs 50 yuan.

301
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,280
Here's the QR code to pay.

302
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,359
Please take them!

303
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,840
Let us dance!

304
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,159
Let us do it.

305
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,399
-Up! -Up!

306
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,760
Let's go.

307
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,000
A self-driving vehicle?

308
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,040
A runaway van?

309
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
Did we call for help?

310
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,480
Does it look like it?

311
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,760
Is the van that advanced?

312
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,919
Thanks, Zhang Chulan!

313
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,360
I'll treat you to a meal later!

314
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,159
Who's that?

315
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,000
Mr. Zhang, did you bring your chauffeur?

316
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,000
It's amazing.

317
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,280
Go after him!

318
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,200
Ms. Bao, we don't need to chase him.

319
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,360
My phone is in the van.

320
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,919
Erzhuang can help us track down his real-time location.

321
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,399
LYU FAMILY MANSION

322
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,200
I'm addressing you as my elder.

323
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,440
You should stop pretending to be senile.

324
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,240
Take a good look around.

325
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,760
You were imprisoned here for several decades.

326
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,200
Doesn't it feel familiar?

327
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:47,960
Where exactly is my sister?

328
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,840
Both you and I are wielders of Double Quan Palm.

329
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,679
I don't need to waste my breath.

330
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,919
This is my sister's memory.

331
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,879
Why do you have it?

332
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:27,840
Where did you keep Lyu Huan?

333
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:29,639
Tell me.

334
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,000
Is Lyu Huan dead or alive?

335
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,960
Tell me and I'll set you free right now!

336
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,800
Lyu Liang,

337
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,000
you're acting just like your great-grandfather.

338
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,159
Zhang Chulan,

339
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,919
you had better stay out of this.

340
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,800
This is our private matter.

341
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:52,360
You spent so much effort and went out of your way

342
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,600
just to find your sister.

343
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,720
I'm so disappointed in you.

344
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,520
Do you still remember the day she fell off the cliff?

345
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,600
She never fell off the cliff.

346
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,240
Duanmu Ying altered their memories

347
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,600
and framed me for her death.

348
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,200
However, I will never forget that day.

349
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,919
The beginning of winter eight years ago.

350
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Do you know how Duanmu Ying left Lyu Village?

351
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,080
I saw it in my great-grandfather's memories.

352
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,600
Someone from the company took her away.

353
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,040
The company received an anonymous call

354
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,879
two days after your sister's death

355
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,040
saying that Duanmu Ying was detained in Lyu Village

356
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,560
Who reported it?

357
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:40,960
I don't know either.

358
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,679
But I retrieved the voice recording before I came here.

359
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,080
Listen.

360
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,840
Hello, this is NDT Command Center.

361
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,879
Hello?

362
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,840
Can you please put Mr. Gao

363
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,720
on the line?

364
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,040
May I know who you are?

365
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,200
Please contact him, okay?

366
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,240
Lyu Huan?

367
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,240
I have something important to tell him.

368
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Please wait a moment.

369
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
It's Lyu Huan.

370
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,560
Duanmu Ying.

371
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,879
Tell me!

372
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
Where exactly is Lyu Huan?

373
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,840
Tell me! Where exactly is Lyu Huan?

374
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,600
I won't tell you.

375
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:34,080
You mustn't tell anyone either.

376
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:37,360
I won't tell you.

377
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,320
You mustn't tell anyone either.

378
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,639
What did you say?

379
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,560
Are you Lyu Huan?

380
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,760
Could it be…

381
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,520
Is this Cola or Sprite?

382
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,520
Is it you, Lyu Huan,

383
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
or me, Lyu Liang?

384
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,120
The Cola-Sprite Theory.

385
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,600
Lyu Huan.

386
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,679
Come closer.

387
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,480
Let me take a look at you.

388
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:30,760
Earlier, you told me

389
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,320
about the Cola-Sprite Theory.

390
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,520
My mind was a mess earlier.

391
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,080
I didn't catch what you said.

392
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,080
Can you tell me about it again?

393
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,679
According to my brother Lyu Liang,

394
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,159
if you get rid of the Cola

395
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,120
in a glass

396
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,520
and fill it with Sprite,

397
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,960
it will cease to be…

398
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
Lyu Liang!

399
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:56,919
What happened?

400
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Duanmu Ying stole Lyu Huan's body

401
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,399
and tampered with everyone's memories.

402
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,879
I'm sorry.

403
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,200
You were the one

404
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,159
who crushed her consciousness

405
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,879
in order to steal her body.

406
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,720
Your useless husk

407
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,840
retains only a sliver of her memories.

408
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,600
I won't tell you.

409
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,600
You mustn't tell anyone either.

410
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,520
GRAVE OF ZHANG XILIN

411
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,919
Dummy.

412
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,879
DUANMU YING, 25 YEARS OLD

413
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,919
Are you saying that her body

414
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,200
holds your sister's remaining consciousness,

415
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,840
which knows only a pair of sentences?

416
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,120
So, to you,

417
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,720
is she alive or dead?

418
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,360
Even if it's only one sentence,

419
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,120
at least she's still alive.

420
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,960
The real Duanmu Ying is inside Lyu Huan's body.

421
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,080
Where is she?

422
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,520
We're looking for her too.

423
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,639
Zhang Chulan,

424
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,879
give me your grandfather's memory qi orb.

425
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,600
I'm sure there are leads in his memories.

426
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,040
I only managed to unlock a portion of it before.

427
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,520
Now that I possess

428
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,080
the upgraded abilities of Double Quan Palm,

429
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:33,120
I may be able to unlock the rest of it.

430
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,960
If you wish to find her,

431
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,280
let's work together.

432
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Do it here.

433
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,399
It might take a long time.

434
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,360
It's fine.

435
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,679
We can wait.

436
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,000
PROGRESS TO REVEALING THE TRUTH

437
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,600
AT 98%

438
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:19,760
What's wrong?

439
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,520
There is a seal in here.

440
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
I don't know

441
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:23,960
what will happen if I unlock it.

442
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,960
I cannot continue.

443
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,639
What if I want to force it open?

444
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,199
It might distort time and space

445
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,919
and open a portal to other dimensions.

446
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,320
It might be very dangerous.

447
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:36,760
Ms. Bao, are you afraid?

448
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,199
No.

449
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,800
What about you?

450
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,600
Don't you wish to see your sister again?

451
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,960
The seal in Grandpa's memories

452
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,800
really opened up a door to another dimension.

453
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,439
Lyu Liang!

454
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,320
Where are we?

455
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:15,840
This person

456
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,320
possesses your grandfather's qi.

457
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:20,560
Is he Grandpa?

458
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,360
Is this a memory we're reliving after breaking through the seal?

459
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,560
If it's a memory,

460
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:36,320
why are we inside of it?

461
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,800
Are we in phantasmagoria?

462
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,679
I don't think it's either.

463
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,959
Is all of this

464
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:46,840
actually qi?

465
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,600
These images are formed

466
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,159
by the lingering qi here.

467
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,480
That means

468
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,959
this event did take place in the past.

469
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,040
Your grandfather looks so young.

470
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,040
It should've been several decades ago.

471
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,439
The Jiashen Calamity.

472
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,600
Who are these people, then?

473
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,159
Why does he look so familiar?

474
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,159
He's Feng Zhenghao's grandfather,

475
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,600
Feng Tianyang, the creator of Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

476
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:20,240
FENG TIANYANG, DISPATCH OF DETAINED SPIRITS

477
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,080
The one in the suit

478
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,280
is Gu Jiting, the creator of Daluo Dongguan.

479
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,360
GU JITING, DALUO DONGGUAN

480
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,480
That bald guy

481
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,760
is Ruan Feng, the creator of Six Vault Immortal Thievery.

482
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,520
RUAN FENG, SIX VAULT IMMORTAL THIEVERY

483
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:39,040
This guy who resembles a teacher is Zheng Zibu,

484
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,280
Infinite Heavenly Talisman's creator.

485
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,919
ZHENG ZIBU, INFINITE HEAVENLY TALISMAN

486
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:44,480
And this chap

487
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,320
is Ma Benzai, the creator of the Divine Forge.

488
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,480
MA BENZAI, DIVINE FORGE

489
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,320
Six of the eight creators

490
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:51,159
of the Eight Supremes are here.

491
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,840
Where are the other two?

492
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,439
Where are Zhou Sheng and Duanmu Ying?

493
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,520
Where are they going?

494
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:08,320
ZHOU SHENG, QIMEN MANIPULATION

495
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,840
This should be Zhou Sheng.

496
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,719
Where's Duanmu Ying, then?

497
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,439
Where is she at this moment?

498
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,320
Is she in that cabin?

499
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,040
Who is this?

500
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,560
He's number four among the 36 Thieves,

501
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:57,240
the world's strongest martial artist,

502
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,520
and Sinister Pleasure's leader.

503
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
Wu Gensheng?

504
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,240
WU GENSHENG, SECT LEADER OF SINISTER PLEASURE

505
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,959
If he is Wu Gensheng,

506
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,399
who is the one inside the coffin?

507
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,000
Is it Duanmu Ying?

508
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,760
Why is he crying?

509
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,719
Am I dead?

510
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:57,879
Ms. Bao,

511
00:33:57,959 --> 00:34:00,399
I think she just resembles you.

512
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,439
You're alive and kicking in front of me.

513
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,000
Plenty of people look similar.

514
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
This is me.

515
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,480
What's her relationship with me?

516
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:19,520
Feng Baobao.

517
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,799
Feng Baobao.

518
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,440
Feng Baobao.

519
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,239
Feng Baobao!

520
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,319
Feng Baobao!

521
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,120
Feng Baobao!

522
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,719
Lyu Huan?

523
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,040
Lyu Huan!

524
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:47,759
Lyu Huan,

525
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,440
is it really you?

526
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,639
It has been so many years,

527
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,799
yet you're still searching for her.

528
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,799
Duanmu Ying.

529
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,480
You were the one who killed Lyu Huan!

530
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,000
The entire Lyu family,

531
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,759
each and every one of you,

532
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:18,680
is spineless.

533
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,600
Aren't you going to kill me?

534
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,120
Get out of my way, then.

535
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,520
Lyu Huan died because of me.

536
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,600
Lyu Huan died because of me.

537
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,839
I shouldn't have brought up the Cola-Sprite Theory.

538
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,880
In the end, they still did it.

539
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,319
Feng Baobao,

540
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,080
it has been so many years,

541
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,080
yet you haven't changed at all.

542
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,759
Ma'am,

543
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:00,160
do you know me?

544
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,000
Not only do I know you,

545
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,799
but I also know your father.

546
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,120
Your father is Wu Gensheng.

547
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,880
Gensheng is our fourth brother.

548
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:19,040
Am I the person inside the coffin?

549
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,240
Am I dead?

550
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:23,960
You're dead.

551
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,759
Let me put it this way.

552
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,400
You were once dead.

553
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,040
Ms. Bao.

554
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,759
Everything is related to karma and destiny.

555
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:23,080
If you wish to know the truth,

556
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,319
then follow me.

557
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,799
PROGRESS TO REVEALING THE TRUTH

558
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,040
AT 99%
