1
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,279
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,599
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,960
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,199
Tell Gong Qing

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,040
that in three days,

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,800
I will be waiting for him at the Ganbei grassland.

7
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,519
You are not who I seek.

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,480
Zhiwei,

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,960
think twice about it.

10
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:08,880
Go home.

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,920
Chief Celestial Taoist,

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,679
you should at least hear us out.

13
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:13,679
Chairman Feng,

14
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:14,880
is All-Encompassing Guild

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,679
trying to meddle in my business now?

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,119
Of course not.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,440
But I will!

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,759
Your business is my business!

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,920
We know you want to avenge Jinzhong.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,839
But there is a limit to your recklessness!

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,479
No one here knows you as well as I do!

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,520
You're not impetuous like this!

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,440
So why exactly are you doing this?

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,360
We have been good friends for years.

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,880
Tell me. Share your woes with me.

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,640
Let me help you!

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,880
They say the older you get, the more obstinate you'll be.

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,839
Lu Jin,

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,000
the only thing I want to do now

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,240
is to wipe out Sinister Pleasure.

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,080
None of you can

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,720
get in my way.

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,880
You old moron, are you provoking me?

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,280
In that case,

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,479
I will fight you!

36
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:00,479
You are Chief Celestial Taoist,

37
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,039
the formidable Sage Tiantong.

38
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,679
You must not be overwhelmed

39
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,720
by your emotions!

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,880
Sorry, Lu Jin.

41
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't have time for you today.

42
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,320
Stay out of my way.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,040
Since you are all here,

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,040
I might as well make this clear now.

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,880
Whatever might happen

46
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,480
in my battle against Sinister Pleasure,

47
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
I want all of you to stay out of it.

48
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,200
Once this is over,

49
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,280
I will accept and serve my punishment.

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,359
Ding Dao'an,

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,399
you're here too.

52
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,399
Why would I miss the chance

53
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,440
to fight the legendary Sage Tiantong?

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,120
I am Tu Junfang.

55
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,320
Greetings, Chief Celestial Taoist.

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,160
Where is Gong Qing?

57
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,760
His presence does not matter.

58
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,880
We are here for you,

59
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,560
Chief Celestial Taoist.

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,399
There can be no villain without a hero,

61
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,799
no good without evil.

62
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,679
The battle on Mount Longhu barely satisfied us.

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,920
Today, all 14 members of Sinister Pleasure

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,280
will fight you,

65
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:45,799
the strongest Outsider there is.

66
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,159
I, Gong Qing, Interim Leader of Sinister Pleasure,

67
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,960
has come to see you, Chief Celestial Taoist.

68
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
As their leader,

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,960
you infiltrated my sect

70
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,840
by posing as a disciple for three years.

71
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,880
Xiaoqingzi,

72
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,640
that was audacious of you.

73
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,880
During my time in Celestial Taoist Mansion,

74
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,320
I have learned many things from you

75
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
and Grandmaster Tian.

76
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,760
I appreciate it.

77
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,719
How dare you

78
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
bring up Jinzhong in front of me?

79
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,080
Grandmaster,

80
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,359
you can easily take my life.

81
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,599
So what is the hurry?

82
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,479
Before I die,

83
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,320
can I ask you a question?

84
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:02,560
Speak.

85
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:05,200
I killed Grandmaster Tian,

86
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,440
so I should pay with my life.

87
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,000
However, you would cross the Ten Elders

88
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,159
and disregard the Outsiders' rules to summon me here.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,280
I don't think my life

90
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,359
is your only goal.

91
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,280
It's about Grandmaster Tian's secret,

92
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:19,440
isn't it?

93
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,680
So I got it right.

94
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,000
You want the world to forget about the Jiashen Calamity,

95
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,240
to avoid similar tragedies.

96
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,400
But do you truly think

97
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:38,240
that we can let it go?

98
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,120
As long as the Eight Supremes exist,

99
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,280
people will be drawn to the truth.

100
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,799
How many more can you kill?

101
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,640
If you truly wish to prevent another disaster,

102
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,280
my life is not the one you should take.

103
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,080
It should be Zhang Chulan's.

104
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,479
He is the grandson of Zhang Huaiyi,

105
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,359
who started the Jiashen Calamity.

106
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,840
Zhang Chulan will be the harbinger

107
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:14,400
of another calamity.

108
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,080
Only when he

109
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,200
and Qi Apotheosis that he carries disappear

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,760
can peace be kept.

111
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,560
You know that.

112
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,039
So you wanted to cage him with Tianshidu.

113
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,359
But he turned you down.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is there something more important than Zhang Chulan

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,320
in Mr. Tian's memory?

116
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:38,640
Everyone knows

117
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,840
that the Eight Supremes caused the Jiashen Calamity.

118
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,400
Little do they know

119
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,440
that the secret behind the Eight Supremes

120
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,640
holds a greater treasure.

121
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,760
You care so much about Mr. Tian's memory.

122
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,520
It's not just because his memory

123
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,039
contains information about the calamity.

124
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
There is other information too.

125
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Secrets that can turn the world of Outsiders upside down.

126
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,919
And that secret is where my ex-leader, Wu Gensheng,

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,080
received his enlightenment.

128
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:07,159
The Valley of 24 Terms.

129
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,200
For me, Zhang Chulan is a wild card.

130
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,000
But it is the same for you.

131
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,200
People with a good moral compass like him

132
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,880
are most likely to stop you.

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,960
Xiaoqingzi,

134
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,719
you are very smart.

135
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,440
But you used your wit in the wrong place and wreaked havoc.

136
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,359
His memory holds a lot of information,

137
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,679
and it cannot fall into the hands of your kind.

138
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,319
The Outsiders' world is no longer united.

139
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,480
Turning a blind eye to it is the greatest ignorance.

140
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,240
The world needs a reshuffle

141
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:39,840
to revert to its original state.

142
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,280
That will happen.

143
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Chief Celestial Taoist,

144
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,760
you won't be able to stop that.

145
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,439
I failed to prevent

146
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,360
the previous calamity.

147
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,720
But this time,

148
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
I won't.

149
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,880
You'll finally make your move now.

150
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:09,400
Kill me here,

151
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,439
and you will pay a hefty price.

152
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,720
You will be barred

153
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,400
from handling Outsiders' affairs.

154
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,000
Our world

155
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:20,439
is not centered around me.

156
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,959
You have your faith.

157
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,120
But so do I.

158
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,360
Interim Leader,

159
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:28,839
the ones who can stop you are out there.

160
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,400
They will prevail.

161
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,760
Justice will prevail!

162
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,000
SAGE TIANTONG VIOLATED SEVERAL OUTSIDER REGULATIONS

163
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:04,680
IN HIS SELFISH QUEST FOR VENGEANCE,

164
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,120
CAUSING ONE DEATH AND SEVERAL INJURIES.

165
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:10,319
NDT EXPRESS HEREBY SENTENCES HIM

166
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,120
TO A LIFETIME OF CONFINEMENT

167
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,319
IN A SELECTED AREA ON MOUNT LONGHU

168
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,720
AND FORBID HIM FROM LEAVING THE VICINITY

169
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,560
Grandmaster.

170
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,600
Chulan, you're here.

171
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,600
Chulan,

172
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,880
I made a mistake.

173
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,160
Today might be the last day

174
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,280
we see each other.

175
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,319
Where people dwell, there will be rules.

176
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,880
Not to mention I made the rules years ago.

177
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,360
But I broke them.

178
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:10,079
So I should accept the punishment.

179
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,560
Gong Qing is dead.

180
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,800
But the secret that Grandmaster Tian kept

181
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,360
was also revealed.

182
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,319
Lyu Liang has his memory.

183
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,480
I'm counting on you

184
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,319
to handle the rest.

185
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,400
I am old,

186
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,680
and I'm tired.

187
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,600
I should have retired a long time ago.

188
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,040
After all, I'm over a century old now.

189
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,079
I'm pretty sure

190
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,839
you can live another century.

191
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,560
Another century?

192
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,160
I would become an antique.

193
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Chulan.

194
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
Can I ask you something?

195
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,319
You are thirsty for the truth.

196
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,439
But what will you do

197
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,839
once you learn the truth?

198
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,079
I actually don't know.

199
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,760
But this is something I must do.

200
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,400
For my grandpa,

201
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,160
for Ms. Bao,

202
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,839
and for myself.

203
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,000
What if someone wants to hurt others with the truth?

204
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,520
You have to know that humans are greedy.

205
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,920
People can do all sorts of things under the banner of self-interest.

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,640
Then I will stop them.

207
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,680
There are so many of them. How can you stop them all?

208
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,079
I will give my life for it.

209
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,439
If only I were as determined as you

210
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,599
back then.

211
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,599
All this wouldn't have happened.

212
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,839
I already did the easy part.

213
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,640
As for the toughest part,

214
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,199
I'll be selfish this time

215
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,640
and ask you to do it.

216
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,920
Grandmaster,

217
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,439
the last person who patted me on the head

218
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,880
was my grandpa.

219
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
You still have a long way to go.

220
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,000
Your grandfather and I

221
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,560
can only see you off.

222
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:29,560
We will not be able

223
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,040
to share the seasons to come.

224
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,719
Grandmaster.

225
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,880
Grandmaster,

226
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,839
can you help me one last time?

227
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,760
Can you destroy the seal

228
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,000
that Grandpa put on me?

229
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,079
CALLING

230
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,120
The number you have dialed is not in service.

231
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,719
Lyu Liang has his memory.

232
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,079
I'm counting on you

233
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,560
to handle the rest.

234
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,199
The Jiashen Calamity.

235
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,719
The Eight Supremes.

236
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,079
The Eight Supremes.

237
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,640
As of now, we have found Dispatch of Detained Spirits,

238
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,800
Infinite Heavenly Talisman,

239
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,280
and Qimen Manipulation.

240
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,959
Qimen Manipulation.

241
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,880
Chulan,

242
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,920
what else did Chief Celestial Taoist tell you?

243
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,520
I already told you everything he told me.

244
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:11,160
That's all.

245
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,959
Now that he was forcefully retired,

246
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,839
the Ten Elders will grow bolder,

247
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,360
let alone the rest of the Outsiders' world.

248
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,719
After all, the one who reined them in

249
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,880
cannot leave Mount Longhu now.

250
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,640
By the way, I've been meaning to ask you this.

251
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,280
Why did you turn Tianshidu down?

252
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
Exactly, Chulan.

253
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,680
You should at least explain to us

254
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,800
why you turned it down.

255
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,719
Ms. Bao,

256
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
what did my grandpa tell Mr. Xu back then?

257
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,079
He said,

258
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,439
"Listen,

259
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,760
you should know that her past

260
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,599
is inextricably tied

261
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,959
to that calamity."

262
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,400
To find out your past,

263
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:07,920
we need to first seek the secret behind the Jiashen Calamity.

264
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,199
My grandpa misled Mr. Xu.

265
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,719
What do you mean?

266
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,520
We're supposed to find the secret to unlock Ms. Bao's past.

267
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,719
But what if we never can?

268
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,079
Then Ms. Bao will stay by my side forever.

269
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,640
I will have a strong ally at all times.

270
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,079
Ms. Bao,

271
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,640
you and Mr. Xu

272
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,160
were set up by my grandpa.

273
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,640
Do you mean

274
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,800
that Zhang Huaiyi lied to my father?

275
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,280
My grandpa didn't lie per se.

276
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,719
The secret of the Jiashen Calamity

277
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,160
can reveal Ms. Bao's past to us.

278
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,479
But Tianshidu itself is an imposition,

279
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,880
a seal.

280
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,880
If I inherited Tianshidu,

281
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,560
Grandmaster would have died.

282
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,760
And like him,

283
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,079
I would know every secret

284
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,959
but wouldn't be able to tell anyone,

285
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,439
including Ms. Bao.

286
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:03,839
Therefore, I would rather be your slave

287
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:07,079
than a keeper of a thousand secrets.

288
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,240
Chulan,

289
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,360
what do you plan to do next?

290
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,280
I want

291
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,200
to keep my promise to my grandpa.

292
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,639
The 36 Thieves and the Eight Supremes.

293
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
I will pursue every lead

294
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,000
until I find the truth about them.

295
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,120
Dude, that's very naive of you.

296
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,280
After all these years,

297
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,879
the 36 Thieves must all be dead.

298
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,879
And you know how secretive and elusive

299
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,800
the wielders of the Eight Supremes are.

300
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:16,080
Who do we know possesses one of the Eight Supremes?

301
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,879
Wang Ai, Feng Zhenghao,

302
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,080
and Lu Jing.

303
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,120
All three of them

304
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,879
are not people you can mess with.

305
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,440
Getting information out of them

306
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,800
is like boiling the sea.

307
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,280
I know all of this.

308
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,760
But you forgot one person.

309
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,280
I will not give up that easily.

310
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,800
Wang Ye, who wields Qimen Manipulation,

311
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:42,879
is my lead.

312
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,520
And from what I know,

313
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:49,520
we're not the only party interested in him.

314
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,440
MOUNT WUDANG

315
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,080
Grandmaster, it's me, Wang Ye.

316
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
I brought congee for you.

317
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,280
Your favorite pumpkin congee with sweet corn.

318
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,480
Grandmaster?

319
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:23,080
Why did you return?

320
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,360
This is my home.

321
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,159
Where else can I go?

322
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,480
I've been back for a week already,

323
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,360
but you refused to see me.

324
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,240
Give me a chance to explain everything.

325
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,720
You told me everything I need to know on the phone.

326
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:40,960
Grandmaster,

327
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,120
are you worried that my display of Qimen Manipulation

328
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,800
will draw unwanted attention to Wudang?

329
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,639
Don't worry.

330
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,879
If anything happens to Wudang,

331
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,080
I will take care of it.

332
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,399
I won't implicate my peers.

333
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,879
Wang Ye, let me get this clear.

334
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
You have been expelled.

335
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:00,480
Even if a disaster strikes Wudang,

336
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,120
it is none of your business.

337
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:06,480
Grandmaster.

338
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,960
I am not your grandmaster!

339
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,639
You're welcome to stay here as a tourist.

340
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,200
But nothing more than that,

341
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,320
Mr. Wang.

342
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,960
WANG WEIGUO, WANG YE'S FATHER
Wang You! Wang Yi!

343
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,760
Stop fighting. Come here.

344
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,520
Come and make a wish.

345
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,879
Almighty God,

346
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,679
please make sure Xiaoxin returns my feelings.

347
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,800
Almighty God,

348
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:49,080
please make sure I get into the top five in this exam.

349
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:50,840
Wang Ye, make a wish too.

350
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:52,639
Deity Zhenwu will make your wish come true.

351
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,320
I don't know what to wish for.

352
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:55,560
WANG YE, SEVEN YEARS OLD

353
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:58,080
Wish for anything you want.

354
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,080
Go.

355
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,919
Dad, forget about Wang Ye.

356
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,399
Let's go to the next hall.

357
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,600
Wait for me.

358
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,040
Sir,

359
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,960
do you think the deity will hear us?

360
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,159
That depends on your wish

361
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,960
and your performance.

362
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,439
Little buddy, do you want to make a wish?

363
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,760
I think

364
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,960
that he'll be overwhelmed

365
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,320
if he has to listen to everyone's wishes.

366
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:25,840
I shouldn't add to his burden.

367
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,439
We were all born with woes.

368
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,399
But not the deity.

369
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,960
He will not get overwhelmed at all.

370
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,240
If you do have a wish,

371
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,679
tell him.

372
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,120
Is he that powerful?

373
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,480
Can I ask him a question?

374
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,800
Sure.

375
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:42,679
Who

376
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,280
am I?

377
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,200
I once thought that Zhang Chulan was the key.

378
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:52,720
But the moment I learned Qimen Manipulation,

379
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,360
I inevitably became one of the pieces in this Jiashen Calamity.

380
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,679
Alas, during my stay in Wudang,

381
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,439
I still haven't found my answer.

382
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,560
Who

383
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,159
am I?

384
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,520
Taoist Wang Ye,

385
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,879
are you heading to the airport?

386
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,639
I can give you a lift.

387
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Come on.

388
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,120
Thank you.

389
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,320
You're welcome.

390
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,879
Taoist Wang Ye,

391
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,280
my father really admires you.

392
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,040
In the contest, he was only interested

393
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,159
in Zhang Chulan and you.

394
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,679
Zhang Lingyu and Zhuge Qing?

395
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,520
He doesn't care about them at all.

396
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,360
Your father has keen eyes.

397
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:09,439
Of course.

398
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,560
What does a Taoist need?

399
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:11,760
Money, of course.

400
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,520
Only poor people turn to religion.

401
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,439
I'll be frank with you.

402
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,760
My dad wants you to join All-Encompassing Guild.

403
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,080
You will be paid 25,000 yuan per month.

404
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,200
After tax.

405
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,600
That's a lot.

406
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,679
Right?

407
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,080
Our guild offers you so much more

408
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,320
than being a Taoist on Mount Wudang.

409
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,159
Look.

410
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,200
We're around the same age.

411
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,679
Compare my outfit to yours.

412
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,439
Once you're rich,

413
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,200
you don't have to be so thrifty anymore.

414
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,639
You can wear or buy whatever you want.

415
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,679
Isn't that great?

416
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,120
So true.

417
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,360
That's the attitude.

418
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,919
This is the contract. Take a look.

419
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:54,600
Ask me if you have any questions.

420
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,280
Take your time.

421
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,600
Just rest for a few days first.

422
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,679
Then I'll have someone pick you up.

423
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,960
Mister, you're going the wrong way.

424
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,560
Just stop by the ramp ahead.

425
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,399
I got you a first-class seat.

426
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,320
Don't be ridiculous.

427
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:13,320
I've never traveled in first class before.

428
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,399
It's fine.

429
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,960
Everyone starts somewhere.

430
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,439
Once you're in my guild,

431
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,600
you can sit in any jet you want

432
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,240
till you get sick of it.

433
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,560
Mister, just stop there.

434
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,520
Taoist Wang Ye, it's not this one.

435
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,760
You're in the wrong hangar.

436
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,679
Come back to the car.

437
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Boss Ye.

438
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,199
Du!

439
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,320
It has been a while.

440
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,879
I told you many times

441
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,919
to stop calling me that.

442
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,159
Is he your chauffeur?

443
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,399
Thank you for your work.

444
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,480
My pleasure.

445
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,399
Mr. Feng,

446
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,280
do you need a lift to the Capital?

447
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,879
It's okay, Boss Ye.

448
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,159
I'm sorry. I mean Taoist Wang Ye.

449
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,199
Well,

450
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,320
I should head back

451
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:27,760
and update my father.

452
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,439
I'll leave you be.

453
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
Taoist Wang Ye.

454
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,480
ALL-ENCOMPASSING GROUP

455
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,879
See you later.

456
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:53,080
THE CAPITAL

457
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,560
Du,

458
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:00,840
are we in the wrong place?

459
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,080
Our house has never been this big.

460
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,240
Mr. Wang bought another 30 acres of land last year

461
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,080
and expanded the area.

462
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,159
He's old now,

463
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,800
and you're always absent.

464
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,159
He thought this place was too empty,

465
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,600
so he built several mansions

466
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,240
to attract more tenants

467
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,720
so he wouldn't feel as lonely.

468
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,000
Didn't he find it tiring?

469
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,639
Boss Ye.

470
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:35,000
You need a change of clothes.

471
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,159
What's wrong with my clothes?

472
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,120
Mr. Wang is sick.

473
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,040
Try not to get on his nerves.

474
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:44,000
Put this on.

475
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,720
Did you get the news already?

476
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
It sure travels fast.

477
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:16,679
Mom, I'm back.

478
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,919
Wang Ye!

479
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,639
I've missed you!

480
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,040
Let me see if you gained weight.

481
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,480
You're such a big boy now.

482
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,320
Ms. Zhao found you a date.

483
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,600
I saw her photo.

484
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,760
-She's beautiful! -Mom.

485
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,360
Where is Dad?

486
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:36,600
He's in the bedroom.

487
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:37,600
Listen,

488
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,520
he hasn't been feeling well lately.

489
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,679
You…

490
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,800
Wang Ye!

491
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Dad.

492
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,040
Wang Ye.

493
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,159
What happened to you?

494
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:57,720
We consulted the best doctor there is.

495
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,679
Your dad has nervous breakdowns

496
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,600
from constantly worrying about you.

497
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:04,320
He has insomnia, depression,

498
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,879
headaches, and body aches.

499
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,240
-And he-- -Enough.

500
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,720
Stop.

501
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,120
Let me talk to our son.

502
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,679
Dad.

503
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,800
Wang Ye.

504
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,879
I'm fine.

505
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,879
I just think a lot about you.

506
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Several days ago,

507
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,120
Taoist Zhou rang me up and said

508
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,240
that you were no longer

509
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,480
part of Wudang

510
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,879
and would come home soon.

511
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:40,720
When I heard that,

512
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,720
my condition improved so quickly.

513
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,480
I left Wudang today.

514
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,959
How did you know several days ago?

515
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,480
Taoist Zhou and I

516
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
have known each other for years.

517
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,800
We are very close.

518
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,959
I'm glad you're here.

519
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,199
You can help me run the business now.

520
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:04,720
Look at my health.

521
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:10,240
I'm not long for this world.

522
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,120
And my memory

523
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,840
has been failing me lately.

524
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,720
Dad.

525
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,480
Where is your medicine?

526
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:25,600
Dad.

527
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,959
Nervous breakdowns,

528
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,760
depression,

529
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,080
and insomnia.

530
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,720
I don't see

531
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,280
any relevant medications at all.

532
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,439
But I do see supplements such as Liuwei Dihuang pills,

533
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,959
boxthorn,

534
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,000
dried seahorse,

535
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:58,480
and kangaroo essence.

536
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,360
Wow!

537
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,159
There are even pills to stay hard.

538
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,600
My son.

539
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,520
Wang Ye, this is…

540
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:16,639
Dad,

541
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,879
the only sickness you have seems to be erectile dysfunction.

542
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,800
You look very healthy.

543
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,320
Why did I feign sickness?

544
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:27,679
To make you stay here, of course!

545
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,720
Look.

546
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,919
You're all healed.

547
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:32,320
You're annoying.

548
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,399
Take a look at these beads.

549
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,760
Are they good?

550
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,520
Where did you get this from?

551
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,560
I made a friend recently.

552
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:44,840
He gave them to me.

553
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,000
He said they were blessed.

554
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,240
A friend whom you met lately?

555
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,360
Wang Ye, do you want to play too?

556
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,520
Let's invite your dad and Wang Yi.

557
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,959
We can play eight rounds.

558
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,120
Mom, where are your friends?

559
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,320
They left.

560
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,360
My son is back. Of course, they left.

561
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,480
They can read the room.

562
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,600
Did you meet them lately too?

563
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,719
Yes. Why?

564
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,760
They are quite friendly.

565
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,159
They're not after our money.

566
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,120
Money isn't what they want, all right.

567
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,360
Du, you're an Outsider too.

568
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:40,360
Have you noticed

569
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:42,399
anything unusual lately?

570
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,760
Did any Outsiders visit us?

571
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,120
No.

572
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,120
Why do you ask?

573
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:47,840
I checked the lock.

574
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,000
I found traces of qi on them.

575
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,360
I checked my room too.

576
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,159
At first glance, nothing was out of place.

577
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,040
Until I saw that areas I rarely touched

578
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,639
were clean

579
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:02,199
and spotless.

580
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,719
That's when I knew

581
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,520
someone used qi to restore things

582
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,240
after they were done searching.

583
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:10,959
Did they rummage through Mr. Wang's room too?

584
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,280
My parents are sleeping now,

585
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,639
so I haven't checked.

586
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,560
But when I opened my dad's drawer in the afternoon,

587
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:19,120
it was quite messy.

588
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:20,439
There was no trace of qi.

589
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,439
Are they after Mr. Wang

590
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,120
or you?

591
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,360
Me,

592
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:27,800
of course.

593
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:30,040
What do they want from you?

594
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:35,360
I cannot tell you.

595
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:37,240
Du, tell me.

596
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,639
If something happens,

597
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:40,560
will you help me?

598
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:42,320
Sure.

599
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,320
Good.

600
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:45,760
Hire several Outsiders

601
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,480
to guard this place in secret.

602
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,080
Don't let my parents find out.

603
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:50,080
Don't worry.

604
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,280
Leave it to me.

605
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,679
Okay.

606
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,159
What is your superpower?

607
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,719
Ordinary people blink 10 to 20 times per minute.

608
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,320
Each blink will take 0.2 seconds.

609
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:10,120
My superpower is that I don't need to blink.

610
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,319
Watch this, Mr. Wang.

611
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,279
Next.

612
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,799
Du,

613
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,639
what superpower is this?

614
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,279
Ordinary people need to use detergent or something soapy

615
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,480
to make bubbles.

616
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,400
But not him.

617
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,880
He can produce bubbles on his own.

618
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,880
I see.

619
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,839
Next.

620
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,159
-Stop. -Stop!

621
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,639
-Stop. -Stop.

622
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,600
Mr. Wang, look.

623
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,440
The shirt was soaking wet just now.

624
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,759
Thanks to my ability,

625
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:04,680
it's dry now.

626
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,200
Where do you work?

627
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:12,560
In a laundromat.

628
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
Wonderful.

629
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Next.

630
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:23,920
Stop.

631
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,480
You may leave now.

632
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,400
Thank you.

633
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
Du.

634
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,560
Do you have any competent candidates?

635
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,520
What?

636
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,319
Are they not competent enough?

637
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:41,759
They are the cream of the crop.

638
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,000
They usually aren't for hire.

639
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,240
I went out of my way to bring them here.

640
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Fine.

641
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,120
They will do.

642
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,839
Okay. Give me two million yuan.

643
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,279
Two million yuan?

644
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,360
Well, they are professionals.

645
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,839
Two million yuan is a bargain.

646
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,799
Du, I have no money.

647
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:05,960
How about this?

648
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,960
Take it from our family account.

649
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,960
I can't.

650
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,560
I'm just your father's assistant.

651
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,200
I cannot touch your savings account.

652
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:15,200
You…

653
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,160
Amazing.

654
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,960
Now that's a real professional.

655
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,880
Why don't you come in?

656
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,920
Lian?

657
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,960
Why are you two here?

658
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,440
Well, we just drove here.

659
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,279
I wanted to ring the doorbell,

660
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,480
but I realized it was late.

661
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,279
I was planning to spend a night in my car

662
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:58,120
before visiting you tomorrow.

663
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,720
Isn't it cold here?

664
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:00,720
Find a hotel.

665
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,720
I'm too poor to afford it.

666
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:03,960
But you're a champion.

667
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,799
Yes, but they offered me either Tianshidu

668
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,279
or Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

669
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,600
They didn't give me cash.

670
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,799
Since we all need money…

671
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:13,359
Come.

672
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,400
Let's make some money.

673
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,359
Zhang Chulan, aren't we supposed to stake out his place?

674
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,640
Why is he here?

675
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,200
Lian,

676
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,200
are you staking out my place?

677
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,160
Here's the thing.

678
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,440
We were supposed to follow someone,

679
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,359
but that someone was staking out your place.

680
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,080
Someone was staking out

681
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,400
in front of my place?

682
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,440
Let's go.

683
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,600
We're meeting Jin Yuanyuan,

684
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,640
the queen of investment.

685
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,640
She was a prodigy.

686
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,720
At the age of 19, she was already helping her dad manage a wealth of assets.

687
00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:58,560
She also holds her drink very well.

688
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,600
No one has managed to outdrink her.

689
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,799
By the way, Feng Baobao,

690
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,120
I heard you can drink a lot too.

691
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,120
Your task is to entertain her.

692
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:10,799
What about me?

693
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,960
You will protect me.

694
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,000
From what?

695
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,759
Her love bombs.

696
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:24,680
Wang Ye,

697
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:26,640
so you've returned after years of fun

698
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,680
on Mount Wudang.

699
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,480
A thermos in a bar?

700
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,359
Excuse me.

701
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Bring him some wine.

702
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,920
Cheers.

703
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,560
Ms. Jin,

704
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,240
I have a favor to ask of you.

705
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:49,640
Can you lend me some money?

706
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,880
I will pay you back with interest.

707
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,759
Have I ever turned you down?

708
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,480
But explain this to me.

709
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,960
I confessed to you here last time.

710
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,440
And the next day, you became a monk.

711
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
Why did you do that?

712
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,839
What?

713
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,839
Duty called. I had no choice.

714
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:14,799
So if I confess

715
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,359
to you again tonight,

716
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,359
will you run to another temple tomorrow?

717
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,839
Ms. Jin!

718
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,880
Ms. Jin, do not worry.

719
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,319
After his stay at Mount Wudang,

720
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,600
he has come to the realization

721
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,759
that you are his soulmate.

722
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,359
Do these two work for your dad?

723
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,880
No, they are my friends.

724
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,160
They deliver things.

725
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:41,640
We work in logistics.

726
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,560
Wang Ye, do you have friends now?

727
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,920
Cheers.

728
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,240
Your friend here can hold her drink.

729
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
How much do you want?

730
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,359
Two million yuan.

731
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,400
That's not a problem.

732
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,600
But shouldn't you

733
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,160
pay a deposit?

734
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,040
Such as?

735
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,640
Me?

736
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,839
Cheers.

737
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,120
It really is beer.

738
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
Wang Ye,

739
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,359
where did you meet her?

740
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,359
Cheers.

741
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,040
What do we do now?

742
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,240
Wake her up. I'll drink with her.

743
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,480
No need.

744
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,960
She already agreed to lend me money.

745
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,759
However, she's completely wasted.

746
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:11,720
Yes.

747
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,839
Aren't you good at divination?

748
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,040
You could even divine the lottery number.

749
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:34,520
-But you couldn't divine this? -Money.

750
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:38,080
-Money. -Money.

751
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:41,319
Money.

752
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,040
Money.

753
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
-Money. -Here.

754
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,799
Money.

755
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,480
Clean yourself up.

756
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,160
Get inside.

757
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,120
Get inside my car.

758
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,759
Get inside.

759
00:41:56,839 --> 00:41:59,640
This stupid sports car can't carry many passengers at all.

760
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:14,319
Are you sober now?

761
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,080
By the way,

762
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,480
I forgot to ask you.

763
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,680
Why were you looking for me?

764
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,040
You must have heard

765
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,960
that I refused to inherit Tianshidu.

766
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,600
What? You refused it?

767
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:38,279
I tried so hard to stop you from seeking the truth.

768
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:39,720
And you turned it down in the end?

769
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:41,880
That's why I came to you.

770
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,600
Can you divine the truth for me?

771
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,040
Do you think I'm a fortune teller?

772
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,600
Someone is following us.

773
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,799
I can take a few detours.

774
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,359
It's no use. They have been following us for a while.

775
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,880
Let's draw them to a secluded place

776
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,880
and get rid of them.

777
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,560
It sucks being followed all the time.

778
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,960
I am a jinx now.

779
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,359
I should have stayed out of the whole Jiashen Calamity thing.

780
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,759
Where are we?

781
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,000
West Buzhimen Bridge.

782
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,440
Take the exit.

783
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,400
Okay.

784
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,359
WEST BUZHIMEN BRIDGE

785
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,920
You drive very well.

786
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,240
I wonder if they can find their way out before dawn.

787
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,319
Of course.

788
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,279
My driving skill

789
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:00,279
is NDT's last line of defense.

790
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,200
-The tire exploded. -I know!

791
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,120
Chaos Golden Space Rip!

792
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,120
I told you.

793
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,080
My driving skill

794
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,160
is NDT's last line of defense.

795
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,400
Who are they?

796
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:09,720
Great.

797
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,759
The enemies have appeared.
