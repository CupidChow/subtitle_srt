1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,680
MOUNT LONGHU

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,000
Attention!

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,279
Now, let's give a big round of applause

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,800
to the main organizer of this contest.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,240
Coming from Celestial Taoist Mansion of Mount Longhu,

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,680
the 99th Chief Celestial Taoist,

7
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:31,560
Zhang Zhiwei!

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,239
Everyone,

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,480
sorry for the long wait.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,040
Besides being an annual worship event,

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,760
the Outsider Martial Arts Contest has always been a chance

12
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:48,080
for qi practitioners to interact with each other.

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,280
Of course,

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,199
I know

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,360
you don't come here to act like old souls like us

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,559
who only sit down

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,760
and philosophizes.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,559
Since you guys are raring to go,

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,000
I won't take up your time.

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,919
This time,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,480
there are 128 contestants in total

22
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:06,640
for the current Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
However,

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,240
there will only be one champion.

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,840
The contest proceeds with elimination rounds.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,440
The grouping is decided by drawing lots

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,880
to ensure it's fair and square.

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,880
In the first round,

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,479
four contestants will compete head-on.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,280
The last person standing up

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,800
will advance

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,160
to subsequent elimination rounds

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,800
until the final winner emerges.

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,679
A four-person match is hard for me.

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,600
The rule is that the winner is the one who knocks down their opponent.

36
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:39,920
Knocking down your opponent

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,039
is the only way

38
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,160
to win.

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,640
Apart from that, there are no rules.

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,520
Contestants are allowed to resort to any skill.

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,839
In case of a significant gap in strength,

42
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,839
contestants can admit defeat or forfeit the match.

43
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,080
Now, you may draw the lots.

44
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:56,960
Why are you dawdling?

45
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,320
Scan the code and download it.

46
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,839
This is Mount Longhu's official application

47
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,080
for drawing lots.

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,799
The Heavenly Stems

49
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,760
represent your sequence in the match.

50
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,960
Under the Heavenly Stems codes, there are four of each creature.

51
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,480
Contestants who get the same creature

52
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,920
will compete in the same match.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,079
TENG SNAKE, GROUP FOUR

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,040
BLACK TORTOISE, GROUP TWO

55
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,239
WHITE TIGER, GROUP TWO CHITAL DEER, GROUP ONE

56
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,000
What a rotten luck.

57
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,120
White Tiger?

58
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,560
It sounds intimidating.

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,840
No, I must get another one.

60
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,959
Stop it.

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,079
You're turning your phone into a brick.

62
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,200
Mine is Chital Deer in Group One. I can swap with you.

63
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,280
Ms. Bao.

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,079
You're always so kind to me.

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,600
You can't swap it.

66
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,640
It's verified by your identity.

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,840
Huaiyi had a pair of big ears.

68
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
But his grandson

69
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,880
looks pretty decent.

70
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,400
Had I managed

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,600
to get Huaiyi back,

72
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:03,560
he wouldn't have ended up pathetically.

73
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,000
Enough said.

74
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:05,920
Jinzhong.

75
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,040
I truly regretted my decision.

76
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,399
I shouldn't have let you search for him alone.

77
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,720
Otherwise,

78
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,320
your strength wouldn't have been emptied out.

79
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,399
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

80
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,040
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

81
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:50,440
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

82
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

83
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:58,320
this contest is brought to you

84
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,959
by Chi Forest Sugarless Sparkling Water

85
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,160
which helps amp up your qi.

86
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,280
All right.

87
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:06,880
The first round of this contest will soon begin.

88
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,000
Here they are.

89
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:14,320
Okay. The three contestants in the arena now are

90
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,079
Liu Fang, Guan Ling Er, and Zhang Cai.

91
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:17,560
The three contestants

92
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,719
are widely known

93
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,039
as Jinwei Peach Garden Trio.

94
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,479
According to the information,

95
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,479
the three of them are childhood friends.

96
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,400
Too bad for Ms. Bao.

97
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,960
This is tricky.

98
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,000
What do you mean? Are they powerful?

99
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,880
Hey, answer me.

100
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,280
I'm waiting.

101
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,320
You'll see.

102
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
After the trio

103
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,280
joined the same sect,

104
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,840
they were expelled together.

105
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,800
In Jinwei,

106
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,360
they're known to be nasty

107
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,159
and have been arrested and warned by NDT Express multiple times.

108
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,919
Once the trio join hands,

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,320
they can be tough nuts to crack.

110
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,560
Why are they in the same group?

111
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,960
Obviously,

112
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:55,200
they rigged it!

113
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,719
Scratch that!

114
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,039
It's fate!

115
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,640
-It's rigged! -It's rigged!

116
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,640
We have no connections.

117
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:05,200
We didn't rig this.

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,039
-We've always been together since infancy. -This is fate.

119
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,680
We shall see who's the unlucky person

120
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,880
who has to fight us.

121
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,760
Okay. We can see

122
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,880
that the last contestant is walking in.

123
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:22,599
It's a woman.

124
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,000
A three-on-one battle

125
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,560
is happening in the first match.

126
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,919
All of the contestants are here.

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,240
Contestants who lose consciousness or admit defeat will be eliminated.

128
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,680
Contestants who mortally wound another contestant

129
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,479
will be eliminated and punished.

130
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,840
Does everyone understand?

131
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,120
You may start now.

132
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,120
Oh, my.

133
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,680
Don't be afraid.

134
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,680
We'll be gentle to you.

135
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,800
When we become champions,

136
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,440
we'll give you our autograph with Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

137
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,520
What's going on now?

138
00:05:58,599 --> 00:05:59,640
Ms. Bao?

139
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,640
Why are you here?

140
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,240
I'm here to smack you.

141
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,800
They know each other.

142
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,919
Ms. Bao?

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,440
By the way, who are you?

144
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:12,560
Last year, it seemed that we went over the top.

145
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,000
Your considerate company

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,120
helped us to grow upright

147
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,840
and get on the right path.

148
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,440
You generously smacked…

149
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,000
educated us

150
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,240
compassionately.

151
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,520
-Did you punch me? -Did you punch me?

152
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,479
What are you doing here?

153
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:39,719
-Ms. Bao. -Ms. Bao.

154
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,200
We've profoundly learned from our mistakes.

155
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,039
Could you please spare us?

156
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,359
The rule that you violated is…

157
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,560
"Do not use superpowers

158
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,000
to gain any form of benefits

159
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,120
from ordinary people and society."

160
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,760
-Ms. Bao. -We've learned from our mistakes.

161
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,719
We won't do it again.

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,320
Blow them up.

163
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,239
Do you like it?

164
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,239
It has a sea view

165
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,280
and hotpot supplies.

166
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,840
Isn't this paradise?

167
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,000
-Do you need me to invite you in? -No.

168
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,440
-We'll go in ourselves. -Yes.

169
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,840
The company is facing a tight budget and you insist on going to the sea.

170
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:40,400
So we're sending you with this.

171
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,599
I fear confined space.

172
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,760
I'm allergic to metal.

173
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,120
I have seasickness.

174
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,479
Ms. Bao.

175
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,000
Could you provide us

176
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,560
with some other transportation?

177
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,880
This is

178
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,239
my compassion for you.

179
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,080
Where are we going?

180
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,520
The Pacific Ocean.

181
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,239
-No, please! -No!

182
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,440
My parents are at home, and I can't go on a long trip.

183
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,520
I remember that now.

184
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,560
I locked you up in a container

185
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,880
and threw it into the sea.

186
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,880
Xu Si said you would drift to the Pacific Ocean

187
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,200
according to the currents.

188
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,440
Rightfully so. Hence, we came out halfway

189
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,880
and swam back.

190
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,239
We couldn't leave our motherland.

191
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,000
Also, we couldn't leave you.

192
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,480
Are you going to fight or not?

193
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,240
Are you here to make a fool of yourselves?

194
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:35,159
-Fight. -Fight.

195
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,360
Little trio.

196
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:38,120
Are you going to fight her?

197
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:39,120
Are we going to?

198
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,919
We will…

199
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,799
-admit defeat. -That's right.

200
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,120
Chital Deer, Group One.

201
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:46,959
The winner is Feng Baobao.

202
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,160
Congratulations, Ms. Bao.

203
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,079
Congratulations, Ms. Bao.

204
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:56,720
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST, TOP 32 ELIMINATION ROUND

205
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,959
FENG BAOBAO, QUALIFIED FOR THE TOP 32

206
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:04,319
Mom. I didn't join the contest

207
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,319
to avoid dating the village head's daughter.

208
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
I know

209
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,199
you always want a daughter-in-law.

210
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,520
After I win the contest,

211
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,480
you can choose any of the pretty girls in the city.

212
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:18,800
Ms. Bao. I've seen him before.

213
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,480
He threatened you before.

214
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,400
He could manipulate six daggers simultaneously.

215
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,240
He's even better than his elder brother, Jia Zhengyu.

216
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,439
I'm not him.

217
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,680
I'm not an attention seeker.

218
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,640
Nine?

219
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Twelve?

220
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,280
This is truly shocking.

221
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,319
Oh, my.

222
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,480
Another prodigy

223
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,520
in object manipulation

224
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,560
from Jia Village.

225
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,480
Many people are watching me.

226
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:00,280
I'm shy.

227
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,920
Who's manipulating the daggers,

228
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,680
he or his mom?

229
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:06,319
Okay.

230
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,520
I love you.

231
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,560
Is that okay?

232
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:13,880
Got it.

233
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,199
We tap out.

234
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,600
We admit defeat.

235
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,720
Vermilion Bird, Group Two.

236
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,839
The winner is

237
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,120
Jia Zhengliang.

238
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,439
All right. I'll hang up now.

239
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,959
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST, TOP 32 ELIMINATION ROUND

240
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,680
JIA ZHENGLIANG, QUALIFIED FOR THE TOP 32

241
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,920
The skill Xiao Xiao uses is Sniff.

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,400
He guides the qi with a special method,

243
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,760
using "heng" and "ha" as cues to release qi.

244
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,120
He can expel a person's primordial spirit out of their body

245
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:55,880
and even temporarily disperse it.

246
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,319
The daunting part of Sniff

247
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,480
is that when one is directly attacked by it,

248
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,839
they can't resist at all.

249
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Is there any way to defend against it?

250
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,240
Sniff doesn't come out of a sudden.

251
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,160
When you notice him accumulating his power,

252
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,280
keep your distance from him.

253
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,480
You ought to keep track of when he's going to exert qi.

254
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,680
TOP 32 ELIMINATION ROUND AZURE DRAGON, GROUP TWO.

255
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,839
The winner is

256
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,839
Xiao Xiao.

257
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,439
DEVOURMENT OF QI, BAI SHIXUE

258
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,199
Be careful of Bai Shixue.

259
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,959
She devours qi,

260
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,240
which restrains your Gold Brilliance Spell.

261
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,760
If you confront her later,

262
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:30,640
use Lightning Technique against her and end it quickly.

263
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:31,719
Chital Deer, Group Three.

264
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,959
The winner is

265
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,199
Bai Shixue.

266
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,160
BAI SHIXUE, TOP 32

267
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,640
WANG YE, ZHUGE BAI, JIN MENG, ZHANG GUANG

268
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:47,000
JIN MENG, SUPERPOWER: GANG VIGOR

269
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,160
Wang Ye

270
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,480
is always slouching,

271
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,880
yet he turns up in this contest.

272
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,480
No age limit in this contest?

273
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,480
What's this little kid doing here?

274
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,439
Anyone under 30 years old is allowed, right?

275
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,560
He doesn't violate the rule.

276
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,800
You two

277
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,760
stand still over there.

278
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,280
After dealing with him,

279
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,199
I'll come to you.

280
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,439
Jin Meng is going to start

281
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,000
with Zhuge Bai.

282
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,920
Jin Meng's superpower is his great strength

283
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,680
and his impregnable body.

284
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,040
Looking at Jing Meng's sturdy physique,

285
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,079
I can't imagine how helpless Zhuge Bai would feel

286
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,280
But Zhuge Bai uses Qimen techniques, doesn't he?

287
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,199
-Don't you run! -Don't come near me!

288
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,520
We were impressed by the Qimen techniques of his elder brother, Zhuge Qing, before.

289
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:50,760
-Perhaps Zhuge Bai is too young -Don't come near me!

290
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,160
-and inexperienced. -Help!

291
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,280
Zhuge Bai. Don't just keep running.

292
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,599
Show us what you learned before.

293
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,560
All right!

294
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:00,040
Stop right there!

295
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:02,680
You forced me!

296
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:16,760
Bagua Array?

297
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
Do you want to trap me in a tiny array like this?

298
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,959
I'm going all out!

299
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,079
Young fellow.

300
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,120
Now, it's your turn.

301
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,160
As expected from Wudang.

302
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,880
The palm launched by Wang Ye is intense enough to fracture bones.

303
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,199
He has great potential.

304
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,400
Jin Meng collapses.

305
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,839
Wang Ye fought effortlessly.

306
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,520
Still, we got a sneak peek of his real strength.

307
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:20,880
The winner is Wang Ye.

308
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,280
I'm so tired.

309
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,079
Why are they so serious?

310
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,640
Wang Ye is a tough cookie.

311
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:29,680
Tigers and leopards hide in deep mountains,

312
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,280
and qilin buries itself in the meadow.

313
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,599
Wang Ye.

314
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,520
He's intriguing.

315
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:34,760
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST, TOP 32 ELIMINATION ROUND

316
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,680
WANG YE, QUALIFIED FOR THE TOP 32

317
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,000
ZHUGE QING, THE WHIPPER, SONG LIEFENG, LITTLE FIRE GOD

318
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,479
Boar to Earth.

319
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:21,839
Rooster to Lake.

320
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,599
Rabbit to Thunder.

321
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:26,199
SHOCK

322
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:30,959
How come I'm still here?

323
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,719
Is this Marquis's Qimen?

324
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,680
MARQUIS'S QIMEN

325
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,199
How could he predict his opponents' attack?

326
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,560
It's feasible.

327
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,280
Everything in this world follows a pattern,

328
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,479
that is the Way of Heaven.

329
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,680
Qimen Skills make use of space and time

330
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,880
to unravel the mystery of the Way of Heaven

331
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,280
and find its loopholes

332
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,280
to obtain information ordinary people can't see.

333
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,400
So

334
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,479
this is how

335
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,560
Zhuge Qing predicts his opponent's attacks?

336
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:57,719
Guys, let's get him!

337
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,359
Well,

338
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:32,520
do you want to continue?

339
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,240
I admit defeat.

340
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:43,400
Vermilion Bird, Group Three.

341
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,400
The winner is

342
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:45,640
Zhuge Qing.

343
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,160
I looked around the contestant seats.

344
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,479
I can't win against any of them.

345
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,520
Ms. Bao. What are you doing?

346
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,839
I'm working.

347
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,199
MOUNT LONGHU TOUR GUIDE MAP

348
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST, TOP 32 ELIMINATION ROUND

349
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,240
ZHUGE QING, QUALIFIED FOR THE TOP 32

350
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,560
ZHANG LINGYU, MA XIN, WEI YANG, DUAN ZIYI

351
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,760
He's indeed the perfect role model,

352
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,879
Zhang Lingyu.

353
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,760
He brought down all of them in one mere strike.

354
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,200
How mighty!

355
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,680
How robust!

356
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,359
How clamorous!

357
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
-Thank you. -Black Tortoise, Group Two.

358
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,440
The winner is Zhang Lingyu.

359
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,879
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST, TOP 32 ELIMINATION ROUND

360
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,440
ZHANG LINGYU, QUALIFIED FOR THE TOP 32

361
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,320
How lame.

362
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:44,480
None of those three

363
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,159
warranted his Lightning Technique.

364
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,040
I believe you've seen something.

365
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,320
Popular contestants always end up becoming the common target

366
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:53,480
of the other three.

367
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,120
If I'm not mistaken,

368
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,399
you're next.

369
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:00,760
At this rate, I should try my luck.

370
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,560
I'll go all out if I have to.

371
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,399
This is too much.

372
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,320
Cut your crap. Just go when you're asked to go.

373
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:13,600
Hurry up.

374
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,560
Fine.

375
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:23,960
Please have a taste.

376
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,960
Please have a taste.

377
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,760
Please have a taste.

378
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,800
Where's Zhang Chulan?

379
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:49,040
Did he flee in fear?

380
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,520
He's the inheritor of Qi Apotheosis.

381
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,440
Out of the three of us, who can scare him?

382
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,440
What exactly

383
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,080
is Qi Apotheosis about?

384
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,600
Everyone's talking about it.

385
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,399
Tell me about it. But let me confirm one thing with you.

386
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,520
We're on the same page, right?

387
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,040
We'll join hands

388
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,960
to defeat Zhang Chulan first.

389
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,600
Here he is.

390
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,520
Finally,

391
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,200
the wheel turns.

392
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,040
Grandpa.

393
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,480
Back then, all Outsiders turned against you.

394
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,879
Today, I'm going to avenge you.

395
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:38,320
What's he talking about?

396
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:40,120
Don't ask me!

397
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,960
I don't know his grandfather.

398
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,280
Zhang Chulan.

399
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,440
Impress us

400
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,840
with your Qi Apotheosis.

401
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,480
Don't blame us for picking on you, okay?

402
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,879
Are you picking on me?

403
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:54,560
It's not funny at all.

404
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:56,520
Are small fish like you entitled

405
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,520
to witness Qi Apotheosis?

406
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,320
How brazen of you, loudmouths.

407
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,080
You can barely survive this world

408
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,480
by relying on your weak forces.

409
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,639
I didn't expect to battle against despicable men

410
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,280
in my very first battle.

411
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,240
Despicable men?

412
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,560
Yes, you are.

413
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:13,240
The ones I want to bring down

414
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,399
are Mr. Feng of All-Encompassing Guild,

415
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,800
the Ten Elders,

416
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:18,919
and all strong men in this world.

417
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,720
I want the turn over

418
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,520
the heavens!

419
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:40,480
The sky trembles

420
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,960
even before he makes a move.

421
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:44,120
Zhang Chulan's strength

422
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,960
seems terrifying.

423
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,280
By any chance,

424
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,000
is this the legendary

425
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,040
Qi Apotheosis?

426
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:01,200
Gosh, even Chief Celestial Taoist's banana is blown away.

427
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,960
Should we stop the contest now?

428
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,280
Retreat.

429
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,240
I can't sense the qi circulation in him, though.

430
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,919
Does he

431
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,320
only need a mere thought

432
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,000
to summon nature

433
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,040
and change the weather?

434
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,159
I'm afraid

435
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,120
that not even Chief Celestial Taoist

436
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,840
has achieved this level.

437
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,760
A tough guy in disguise.

438
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,879
What's there to fear?

439
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,639
Yes, he's robust.
But he's all alone.

440
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:39,480
We have three people on our side.

441
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,320
Guys, come on, let's get him together.

442
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:42,639
You are determined to charge forward

443
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,679
despite the slim chance of winning.

444
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,879
And that's how you grow stronger.

445
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,080
But look at you.

446
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,679
You've already given up on yourselves.

447
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,720
Since you've demeaned yourselves to despicable men,

448
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,720
come crawl over.

449
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,439
I'll give you a pathetic defeat

450
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,080
that's compatible with your low status.

451
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:57,520
What now? Should we go?

452
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,120
You go first.

453
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,879
Zhang Chulan.

454
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,560
Thank you so much.

455
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,159
Your reprimand wakes me up.

456
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:06,960
I'm sorry.

457
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:09,240
I'd like to challenge Zhang Chulan head-on.

458
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,760
I don't come here for victory.

459
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,040
I want to prove the gap between me and the invincible.

460
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,040
So

461
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,919
I must maintain my dignity as a challenger.

462
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,679
Challenger?

463
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,520
What a glorious identity.

464
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,439
But are you entitled to that without any effort?

465
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,760
You're insulting me

466
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,120
and Qi Apotheosis.

467
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,639
He sits down?

468
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,600
Does he not care about us at all?

469
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:39,919
Come on.

470
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Show me who among the three of you

471
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,760
is the strongest

472
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,080
and most worthy of dueling with me

473
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,439
and being purified by Qi Apotheosis.

474
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,760
It must be me!

475
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,840
It works well.

476
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,120
We've underestimated him.

477
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,080
He's really something else.

478
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,159
Baobao.

479
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,840
Your burden is lighter.

480
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Exactly.

481
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,720
This brat is quite sly.

482
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,480
I guess he'll only act when all of them are exhausted.

483
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,120
That Taoist at the back.

484
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,159
Please move.

485
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,159
Why?

486
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
My followers asked me for my selfie.

487
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,280
I need to take one now.

488
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,080
The lighting is just nice. So please move.

489
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,360
Just blur out my face.

490
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,399
It's tiring to budge here and there.

491
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,639
Zhang Chulan.

492
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,679
I'm qualified to challenge you now.

493
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,720
Come on.

494
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,520
This is my greatest respect for the invincible.

495
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,720
Please enlighten me with your Qi Apotheosis.

496
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,040
Sit down

497
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,399
and adjust your breathing.

498
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,560
Adjust your qi to its best state.

499
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:19,159
I'm not going to fight when you're in this state.

500
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
Thank you.

501
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,040
Victory doesn't matter to me anymore.

502
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,960
It's my honor

503
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,560
to battle with an opponent like you.

504
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,439
Thank you. But I'm not cold.

505
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,480
Wait…

506
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,399
-Shameless! -What's he doing now?

507
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,439
Hey.

508
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,240
I didn't violate any rules by beating him this way, did I?

509
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,000
No, you didn't.

510
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,720
But I'm holding back my punches on you.

511
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,639
White Tiger, Group Two.

512
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,280
The winner is

513
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Zhang Chulan.

514
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:54,000
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST, TOP 32 ELIMINATION ROUND

515
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,240
ZHANG CHULAN, QUALIFIED FOR THE TOP 32

516
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,840
Zhang Chulan, you're shameless!

517
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,879
Didn't you promise to start

518
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,280
when I'm ready?

519
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,560
You promised me!

520
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:21,399
Where's your dignity as the invincible?

521
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,840
Dignity of the invincible?

522
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:26,720
How much is it worth?

523
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,639
I can't believe he won the match with this method.

524
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
The organizing committee stipulates

525
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,760
that the commentators

526
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,040
-shouldn't insult contestants. -Yes.

527
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:36,879
However,

528
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,480
I must say this.

529
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:40,360
Throughout my life,

530
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:42,320
I've never seen someone

531
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:44,080
with such audacity!

532
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,080
-Yes. -Shame--

533
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:59,159
-Shameless! -Shameless!

534
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,720
There you go.

535
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,560
Dude, you could really attract lightning here.

536
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:15,760
My Lightning Technique is nothing compared to yours.

537
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,760
Dude, you're skilled.

538
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,000
Why are you only helping the organizing committee

539
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,320
to attract lightning

540
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:20,960
and not joining the contest?

541
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,280
Because I can only attract lightning to strike myself.

542
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,720
I can't strike others.

543
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,960
Strike yourself?

544
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,320
My, my.

545
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,720
You're a living lightning rod.

546
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,960
Brat.

547
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,679
I watched your match.

548
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
What do you think?

549
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,520
I hate my incompetence.

550
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,919
Otherwise,

551
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,000
I would've struck you!

552
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,919
Shame on you.

553
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,639
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST

554
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
Gosh.

555
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,960
Shan Shitong is my next opponent.

556
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,199
Shan Shitong?

557
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,240
Which one is he?

558
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,000
He's that one.

559
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,399
Feng Xingtong told me

560
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,879
that his three opponents couldn't last more than two minutes

561
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:32,800
when they battled Shan Shitong.

562
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,080
He's known as the Green Talisman God.

563
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,480
He's greatly skilled in using Vermillion Book

564
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,480
to seal people's pulse.
I'm no match for him.

565
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,600
He's watching us.

566
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,600
Point taken.

567
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,040
I'll take care of this person.

568
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,399
What do you mean, Ms. Bao?

569
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,959
I've been quite relaxed

570
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,959
since arriving here.

571
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,199
It's time to get to work.

572
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:51,840
Jiyun, Yexing.
Good job.

573
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:54,000
It's cool, Lingyu.

574
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,040
Lingyu.

575
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:56,800
I watched your match.

576
00:28:56,879 --> 00:28:58,800
You're as sharp as always.

577
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:00,520
I watched yours too.

578
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,040
You're as shameless as always.

579
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,639
Please get hold of yourself.

580
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,399
Stop calling me Lingyu.

581
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,679
Why is he so mean?

582
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,520
At first, I thought he was mean to everyone.

583
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,800
But then I realized that he's kind to everyone, except for me.

584
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,000
What's his problem with me?

585
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,720
Tell me about it.

586
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,480
Normally, Linyu is amiable.

587
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,760
Is it because Chief Celestial Taoist particularly favors you,

588
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,080
and that gets under his skin?

589
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,919
Seriously?

590
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,879
It's understandable that Chulan doesn't know the reason.

591
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,199
How could you not know?

592
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,120
Lingyu isn't a petty person.

593
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,720
If so,

594
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,320
Jiyun,

595
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,760
you know the reason, don't you?

596
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,560
Zhang Chulan.

597
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:49,679
Well, quit guessing.

598
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,600
Go back to your room and rest. I know nothing.

599
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,199
Jiyun.

600
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,439
I hate being on tenterhooks.

601
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,840
Since Chulan has brought this up, you better tell us

602
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,360
or you won't get away with it.

603
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,760
Dear Taoists, how about this?

604
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,879
After registration, let's gather at Xu's Restaurant.

605
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,080
See you there.

606
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,240
Let's get some beers.

607
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,280
It's on me.

608
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,560
Thank you.
Let's go.

609
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,399
What do you want? I'll buy you anything.

610
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,520
There's an amazing restaurant serving crayfish with garlic sauce.

611
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
I'll take you there.

612
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:22,199
It's marinated meat in baked flatbread.

613
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:23,679
What's the hurry?

614
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,959
The pineapple isn't cut yet.

615
00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:32,800
-Don't drag me. -Let's go.

616
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,080
Awesome.

617
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,760
Your hand must be well-cooked after roasting for so long.

618
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,080
Young lady.

619
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,159
My hand is not for sale.

620
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,360
You can eat everything here.

621
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:09,800
But my hands are precious.

622
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:10,800
Look.
The chicken heart is good for your heart,

623
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,879
chicken kidneys plenish your kidneys,

624
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,080
and chicken meat nourishes your body.

625
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,000
You're too slim.

626
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,560
You must eat more meat.

627
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:18,959
How about two skewers?

628
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,959
Two? Three or four?

629
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,439
-One free skewer if you buy four. -Can you hurry up?

630
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,679
I need to start working soon.

631
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,840
Don't rush.

632
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:26,320
The meat tastes better

633
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,480
with slow and small heat.

634
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,399
-Look, the juice oozes out. -I'm running late.

635
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,520
She didn't pay me.

636
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,199
Dear Taoists.

637
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,439
I'm so sorry.

638
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,760
Xu's Restaurant is packed.

639
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,679
Well, let's chat a little over some beers.

640
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,439
First, I'll make myself clear.

641
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,280
You two should never tell anyone I told you this.

642
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,240
Of course, I won't.

643
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,560
Don't worry.

644
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,120
Sit.

645
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:57,240
I, Zhang Chulan,

646
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,639
am very tight-lipped.

647
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,080
Zhang Chulan.

648
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,679
You are wrong about one thing.

649
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,679
What am I wrong about?
The reason

650
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:06,280
why Lingyu ices you out

651
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,040
isn't because he loathes you.

652
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,240
Instead, he's jealous of you.

653
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,240
Jealous of me?

654
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:14,360
Look, I told you so.

655
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:16,399
Chief Celestial Taoist shows favor to you, who's not a disciple.

656
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,679
That's why Lingyu gets jealous.

657
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,919
Jeez, you're wrong.

658
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,639
It's not about that.

659
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:23,240
What's it, then?

660
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,959
It's because of your Lightning Techniques.

661
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,120
Our Lightning Techniques?

662
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:33,719
I thought both of us knew that.

663
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:37,000
Have you realized the difference

664
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,199
between your Lightning Techniques?

665
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,520
YIN LIGHTNING, YANG LIGHTNING

666
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:43,760
His lightning is black.

667
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:46,879
That's right. That's called Five Elements Yin Lightning.

668
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,760
Per the rules of Mount Longhu,

669
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,240
Chief Celestial Taoist can impart Lightning Technique

670
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,560
to his desired disciple.

671
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,480
However, it can only be half of it.

672
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,879
For the complete version of Five Elements Lightning Technique,

673
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:58,280
only the successor of Chief Celestial Taoist

674
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,480
is eligible to have it.

675
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Only certain people

676
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:01,480
can acquire the other half of Lightning Technique.
No doubt,

677
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,959
their strength must be top-notch.

678
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,800
However, there's another demanding term.

679
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,760
The cultivator must be

680
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,240
a virgin.
Do you understand?

681
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,360
I do.

682
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:15,480
He doesn't.

683
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,080
Well, you can't…
You can't do this

684
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,240
and that.

685
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:21,480
Afterward, the seniors discovered

686
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,080
that many started their cultivation

687
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:24,760
at an older age,

688
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,360
and only very few of them

689
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,320
met this requirement.

690
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,520
Hence, they modified the said half.

691
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,840
For those non-virgins,

692
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,240
they can practice

693
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,919
Five Elements Yin Lightning.

694
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,040
While the half you cultivated

695
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,439
is the original Lightning Technique,

696
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,639
Five Elements Yang Technique.

697
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,879
This is the reason

698
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:45,560
why Lingyu gets jealous of you.

699
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:49,120
Even he

700
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,280
has a love life.

701
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Grandpa.

702
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,439
You know what?

703
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,679
Even Zhang Lingyu has a love life.

704
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,719
I don't want to cry.

705
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:16,279
But even that fellow

706
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,080
has a love life.

707
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,839
Why are you crying?

708
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:27,520
Don't ask.

709
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,279
Come with me. I'll make you happy.

710
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,200
Ms. Bao. Where are you taking me to?

711
00:34:57,279 --> 00:34:58,240
We haven't arrived yet.

712
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,200
Maybe we can go back to the hotel room?

713
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,720
Shan Shitong?

714
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:16,360
Are you happy now?

715
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,759
Did you tie him up and bring him here?

716
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,880
Yes. I'm going to start working now.

717
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,839
Later, I'll dig a hole over there and bury him inside.

718
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,880
Are you insane, Ms. Bao? He will die.

719
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,040
I'll leave his head outside. He won't die.

720
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,920
I've inspected this place.

721
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,160
No one comes here.

722
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,759
Besides, I bought him some chicken drumsticks and milk tea.

723
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,160
He won't go hungry.

724
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,080
I got it now.

725
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,360
So, this is your reason here.

726
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,279
To remove any obstacles on my way to the championship.

727
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,640
Have you just figured this out now?

728
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,160
But this is too despicable.

729
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,440
If anyone were to find out about this, my good reputation would be ruined.

730
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,279
Do you even have a good reputation?

731
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:50,200
None of your business.

732
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:51,240
You can't do this.

733
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:54,880
They always say I'm silly. But I'm not silly at all.

734
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,040
Most of the time,

735
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,360
I know I'm witty.

736
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,920
Witty, my foot.

737
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,960
If I can fight you,

738
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,600
I would like to find out what is wrong with your brain!

739
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,040
Also, where did you get that shovel from?

740
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,600
Do you like burying people that much?

741
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,040
We'll get kicked out of here

742
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,240
if he tells on us when he gets out!

743
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:10,640
It's not right to bury people.

744
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,160
I've told you many times.

745
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,480
It's fine. If he tells on us,

746
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,480
we can deny it.

747
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,920
Wash him clean before he goes and he won't have any proof.

748
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,880
Shan. Calm down, please.

749
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,279
Don't mind her.

750
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,480
Shan.

751
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,920
Why do you untie him?

752
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:31,720
Get off me, Zhang Chulan!

753
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:32,680
Madwoman.

754
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:34,160
I won't let you off today!

755
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,880
How dare you jump me.

756
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,200
Bring it on, madwoman.

757
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:40,920
Let's fight head-on.

758
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,920
I'm going to show you

759
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,200
the strength of the Green Talisman God.

760
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:45,880
SHAN SHITONG, VERMILLION BOOK

761
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
Shan.

762
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,200
How about this? Please hear me out.

763
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:50,960
I can offer you some solutions.

764
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,839
Out of the way, Zhang Chulan.

765
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,880
Shut your mouth

766
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,640
or I'm going to finish you as well.

767
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,400
Well, Shan.

768
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,799
Please hear me out.

769
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,000
Let's not use violence. It's crude.

770
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,560
What are you getting at?

771
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:23,960
Couldn't you wait until I say my piece?
