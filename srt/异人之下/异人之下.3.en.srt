1
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,720
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,360
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,760
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,839
You're now in the world's top scientific institution.

5
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:44,760
Everyone you see here

6
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:47,360
is an outstanding researcher.

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,160
When I was a novice here,

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,320
I remember that we had to secretly import

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,640
advanced machines from overseas.

10
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:55,559
After years of research and development,

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,879
we're capable of producing our own facilities now.

12
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,120
Back then, we had to learn from other countries.

13
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,119
But after years of endeavor,

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,320
many countries have started to learn from us.

15
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:11,200
We stand on the shoulders of giants, that is our culture.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,200
We're now at the cutting edge of innovation.

17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,160
I thought NDT was just a courier service company.

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,800
Yes, we are,

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,600
but it's a side hustle.

20
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:25,080
Everything before you now

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,320
is the real form of NDT.

22
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,000
Let me introduce myself.

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,039
I'm the General Manager of the Lubei Region of NDT,

24
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,360
Xu Xiang.

25
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:43,119
LUBEI REGION

26
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:44,880
Sinister Pleasure is rampaging

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
in the world of ordinary people.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,240
We, NDT,

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,720
must stop them.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,479
We have issued an arrest warrant

31
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,240
for those who are at large.

32
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,720
So what is your research all about?

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,880
There are many topics

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,280
such as the universe,

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,440
time-space,

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,120
energy, and life.

37
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,400
However, there's only one core research.

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,960
That is, the origin of Outsiders.

39
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:16,640
The origin of Outsiders?

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,239
Chulan.

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,440
You're an Outsider too.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't be ridiculous.

43
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,840
I'm not like you all.

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,680
Not only you,

45
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,400
but your grandfather was an Outsider too.

46
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,840
Outsiders are humans too.

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,400
We don't have misshapen body features.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,680
You have come across many more Outsiders than you thought

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,239
because you can't identify them.

50
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,880
The standard we use to identify an Outsider

51
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,600
is to see whether the person

52
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,560
can employ a kind of energy that ordinary people can't.

53
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,480
This energy,

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,440
according to the ancient people, it's called

55
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,440
qi.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,120
This unique energy

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,799
can transform into abilities beyond what ordinary people can do,

58
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,079
which is known as "superpower".

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,560
We're researching the origin of qi.

60
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,640
Have you found the answer yet?

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,440
Have you heard of dark matter?

62
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,160
The Universe consists of the Observable Universe

63
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,560
and the Dark Universe.

64
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,120
We live in the Observable Universe,

65
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,840
which only occupies 15%

66
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,160
of the whole universe,

67
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,040
while the remaining 85% percent is the Dark Universe.

68
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,040
It's formed by dark matter.

69
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,160
Dark matter is universal energy

70
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,920
that is still unexplained by human science.

71
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,560
However, our research has led us to realize

72
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,880
that between the Observable Universe and the Dark Universe,

73
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,880
there is an interaction of matters

74
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:36,799
in the form of energy.

75
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,799
And this energy

76
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,440
is the dark energy.

77
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,799
In fact, this energy

78
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,040
can be traced far back in our ancient culture,

79
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:45,359
and that's qi.

80
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,280
You don't know me

81
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:49,560
and I don't know you as well,

82
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,560
yet you're sharing so many secrets with me.

83
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,320
Aren't you afraid that I'll blab?

84
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,880
Are you thinking of locking me in here forever?

85
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,200
Zhang Chulan.

86
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,440
On behalf of NDT,

87
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,320
I officially invite you to join our company.

88
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,560
WE, NDT, WELCOME YOU

89
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,079
You must be kidding.

90
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,320
I'm just a normal college kid.

91
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,000
I have a lecture to attend this afternoon. I should get going now.

92
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,599
You can rest assured.

93
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,080
I know the rules well.

94
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,479
I won't tell a soul

95
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,320
about whatever I have looked and heard here.

96
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,320
Zhang Chulan.

97
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
I know your grandfather.

98
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,320
TWELVE YEARS AGO

99
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,159
Sir.

100
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,440
It's time to renew

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
your identity card.

102
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,680
Village Director.

103
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:03,080
Why should I renew it?

104
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:04,240
Aren't they the same?

105
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
Besides, I already have one foot in the grave.

106
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:08,039
I might go to the grave

107
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,919
before my new ID card arrives.

108
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,560
Today,

109
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,360
I came for another matter.

110
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,320
Chulan is very young now.

111
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,240
He has lost both of his parents,

112
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,200
and you are old now.

113
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
We have a boarding school in the county.

114
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,479
Why don't you send Chulan over there?

115
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,919
The teachers will take care of him.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,479
Bed and board are provided too.

117
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,240
Not only will he get some educations,

118
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,240
but he will also have friends to play with.

119
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,440
What do you say?

120
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,880
He's my only precious grandson.

121
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,400
As long as I'm alive,

122
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,039
I'm not sending him anywhere.

123
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,080
Thank you for the offer.

124
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,280
Sir, I checked your ID card just now.

125
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,560
You're about to turn ninety.

126
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,800
What if

127
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,560
something bad happens to you,

128
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,120
leaving Chulan alone?

129
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,440
I'm strong and sturdy.

130
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,640
Look at my muscles.

131
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,159
Village Director,

132
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,280
I know you're younger.

133
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,479
Let's have a fight.

134
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,479
You might not be able to beat me.

135
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,080
Of course, I can't.

136
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Grandpa, I'll take it.

137
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,760
Chulan.

138
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,039
I taught you how to make a fire and cook just now.

139
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,200
Have you got the hang of it?

140
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,719
-Yes. -Good boy.

141
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,680
Well,
I have to head out

142
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:25,599
for something.

143
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,200
So I have prepared you three pork knuckles in advance.

144
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,840
Every day, you can take one out

145
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,000
and heat it before you eat.

146
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,280
Besides, I have told you

147
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,080
two important things.

148
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,440
Do you remember that?

149
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,880
First, I shouldn't use martial arts carelessly.

150
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,520
Second, I should only use them when I'm in danger.

151
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,919
Good.

152
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,840
Keep this in mind.

153
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,799
Eat up.

154
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,159
Grandpa,

155
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,240
when will you be back?

156
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,000
After you finish the three pork knuckles,

157
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,440
I'll be back.

158
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,599
THE FIRST DAY

159
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,560
THE SECOND DAY

160
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,520
THE THIRD DAY

161
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,120
I've already finished the last pork knuckle.

162
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,440
What time will Grandpa be back today?

163
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,320
Grandpa.

164
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,280
You're home.

165
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,080
Grandpa.

166
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:11,640
Grandpa.

167
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,080
What's wrong?

168
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,159
Grandpa.

169
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,200
What has happened to you?

170
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Grandpa!

171
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,599
Wake up!

172
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:23,880
Grandpa!

173
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,520
Wake up!

174
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,760
Grandpa!

175
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,320
Let's go home.

176
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,080
Grandpa!

177
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:34,360
Grandpa!

178
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:35,919
Grandpa!

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Please.

180
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:39,400
Please wake up.

181
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,840
Grandpa.

182
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,319
Please wake up, Grandpa.

183
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,000
Grandpa.

184
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
You said you knew my grandfather.

185
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,400
Can you tell me

186
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,840
how did he die?

187
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,319
Well,

188
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,480
I can't answer that.

189
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,079
But I can tell you

190
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,000
where he

191
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:16,079
acquired his skills.

192
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,319
MOUNT LONGHU

193
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
CELESTIAL TAOIST MANSION

194
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,640
ONE OF THE SECTS OF OUTSIDERS WITH A LONG HISTORY

195
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,079
AND IS HIGHLY REVERED.

196
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,040
THEIR LIGHTNING TECHNIQUE SETS THEM APART FROM OTHERS,

197
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
REPRESENTING AN ORTHODOX AND PRESTIGIOUS SECT.

198
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,439
THEY'VE BEEN TAKING THE LEAD AND UPHOLDING JUSTICE.

199
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,199
ZHANG LINGYU

200
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,600
THE MOST SKILLED TAOIST DISCIPLE OF CELESTIAL TAOIST MANSION

201
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,120
Lingyu!

202
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,760
Grandmaster wants to see you.

203
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
All right.

204
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,400
Gardening folks,

205
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,079
it's pruning time.

206
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,319
Are you ready

207
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,920
with your pruning shears?

208
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,640
Use the pruning shears

209
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:08,000
to trim the branches

210
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,719
carefully.

211
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,680
Trimming branches

212
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,480
is like trimming hair.

213
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,319
If you accidentally

214
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,839
shake your hand slightly,

215
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,600
they will be gone.

216
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,240
I, Lingyu, offer my greetings, Master.

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,560
Have you looked through the name list?

218
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,760
Yes.

219
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,640
This is the 2,000th anniversary of Mount Longhu,

220
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:34,240
and the guests are our old acquaintances.

221
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,120
We must invite all of them.

222
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:37,360
The name list

223
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:39,000
is from eighty years ago.

224
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,000
Many seniors

225
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,160
have already passed away,

226
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,439
while their kins have no interest in attending.

227
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,400
However,

228
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,000
two seniors who still exist

229
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,000
have promised

230
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,120
to come for the ceremony

231
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:49,079
no matter what.

232
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,760
Master.

233
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:56,240
On the name list,

234
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:57,719
a name is crossed off.

235
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,040
I couldn't find any record of him.

236
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,640
Perhaps he's one of the seniors in Mount Longhu.

237
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,280
Zhang Huaiyi.

238
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:12,319
Master.

239
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,760
Do you know him?

240
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,880
Just leave it

241
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,319
since the name is crossed off.

242
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,480
By the way,

243
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,480
I have a morning session.

244
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,480
I need to go now.

245
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,280
MOUNT WUDANG

246
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,480
It's dark here. Why don't they light up candles?

247
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,439
Lamp.
Light up.

248
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,599
Master Lu.

249
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Master Fang.

250
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,680
Time to eat. Master Hong.

251
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:04,800
You're here.

252
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,560
Yes.

253
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,560
Wang Ye.

254
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,240
What do you want to ask from me?

255
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,240
Master Hong.

256
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:14,560
Have you ever

257
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,400
been drawn into phantasmagoria

258
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,920
before your meditation starts?

259
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,959
You were pulled into it?

260
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,000
What did you see?

261
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,079
I saw a train from the Year of Jiashen.

262
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,480
An unfamiliar young man with his face bleeding

263
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,520
was sitting on the train.

264
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,079
Year of Jiashen?

265
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,000
It's the Jiashen Calamity!

266
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,120
The Jiashen Calamity is looming over again!

267
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:49,439
-What's wrong with you? -Scram!

268
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,319
Master Hong.

269
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,199
That was so fast.

270
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,560
NDT

271
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,199
You're Liu Yanyan, right?

272
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:20,839
The only successor of the Liu family in Xiangxi.

273
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,199
Your Thrall Sorcery is widely known.

274
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
A few months ago, your dad came to us

275
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,520
and told us you ran from home.

276
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:28,959
He wanted us to find you.

277
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:32,719
But he could never believe

278
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:35,280
that you've joined Sinister Pleasure.

279
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,920
This is none of your business.

280
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,560
I don't know much about them.

281
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,319
But I do know a lot about you.

282
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,719
Under the guise of a delivery company,

283
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,640
you only paint Outsiders as your target.

284
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,640
I simply can't put up

285
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,319
with your cocky behavior.

286
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,599
You're Xu Si, right?

287
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,880
I'll tell on you once I go out.

288
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,520
Get this straight.

289
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,880
I'm interrogating you.

290
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,560
Tell me what was Sinister Pleasure after in this act

291
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,599
and I'll release you.

292
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,719
I won't say a word.

293
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,000
You can't do anything to me.

294
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,760
Who let you in?

295
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:09,760
Get out.

296
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,240
Continue with the interrogation. He'll sit here.

297
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,240
You're the descendant of the Liu family in Xiangxi.

298
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,000
What's so good about Sinister Pleasure to make you defend them?

299
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,640
Nothing is good about the Liu family.

300
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,800
Thrall Sorcery should have disappeared long ago.

301
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,400
They forced me

302
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:31,199
for the darned inheritance.

303
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,199
Since I was little, my only friends

304
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,599
are only thralls.

305
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,839
Except for my family,

306
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,199
I've never befriended any living humans.

307
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,280
They forbade me

308
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
from interacting with ordinary people

309
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,160
before I acquired the sorcery.

310
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I did what they wanted.

311
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,199
Before I turned 15,

312
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,479
I'd never once stepped out of my house.

313
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,079
But when I fully mastered Thrall Sorcery,

314
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:08,520
they wanted me to live

315
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,280
like an ordinary person

316
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:14,040
and restricted me from using the sorcery and manipulating thralls.

317
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,800
So what was the 15 years of cultivation for?

318
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,520
I questioned them.

319
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,680
They told me it was for my own good.

320
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:32,599
I have to do whatever they say.

321
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,880
Am I different

322
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,359
from thralls?

323
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,120
What's wrong with Outsiders using their superpower?

324
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,280
You asked me what's good about Sinister Pleasure.

325
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,359
Nothing is good about them.

326
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:53,240
But I had freedom there.

327
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,959
Girl.

328
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,040
You want freedom, don't you?

329
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,920
But are you ready to take the responsibility

330
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,880
for your unrestrained acts?

331
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,879
To shoulder the duty and power your superpower brings to you

332
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,800
is the very rule for Outsiders.

333
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:09,399
Be it rules or principles,

334
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,359
you're the dictator of the game, aren't you?

335
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,319
You condemn Sinister Pleasure as if they're despised by everyone.

336
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:16,960
But I think you're the real thugs.

337
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,720
We arrested you because we want to help you.

338
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,760
Sinister Pleasure doesn't care about rules or principles.

339
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,280
Naturally, other Outsiders can do outrageous things to them.

340
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,080
Their enemies are too many to count.

341
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,040
Once their leader

342
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,320
is caught by someone,

343
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:35,560
no one would stand up for them

344
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,280
no matter what inhumane treatment they would get.

345
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,200
What gives, young fellow?

346
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,960
Liu Yanyan.

347
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,879
You're sick of being constrained by your family

348
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,480
because you think you're like a thrall,

349
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,840
and that's why you ran from home.

350
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,399
I became an orphan when I was ten.

351
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,840
I've been living and eating alone.

352
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,120
I talk to the walls for the whole day.

353
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,159
But I've never thought that myself is pathetic.

354
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,919
Who are you to say that?

355
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,480
I just want to idle my life away

356
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,520
quietly.

357
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,159
But you ruined

358
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,879
my little wish.

359
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:21,960
If you didn't steal my grandfather's body,

360
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,000
I could have led an ordinary life.

361
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,080
Now tell me.

362
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,800
Why does Sinister Pleasure need my grandfather's body?

363
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,919
His memory.

364
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,800
They want Zhang Xilin's memory.

365
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,720
Over ten years ago,

366
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,879
a big group of elite Outsiders

367
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,520
confronted an Outsider in Mount Siguniang.

368
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,720
Eventually, the big group was eliminated,

369
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,040
while their lone enemy was only severely injured.

370
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,240
Some of the elites

371
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,600
came from prestigious sects like Tang Clan

372
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,120
and some were from Sinister Pleasure.

373
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,320
Since then,

374
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:04,480
they have been searching

375
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,360
for that person.

376
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,480
They didn't mean to take revenge on him.

377
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,639
Instead,

378
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,600
they're interested in his power.

379
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,040
Back then, before an expert from Sinister Pleasure breathed his last,

380
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,919
he said the name of the energy.

381
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,000
Qi Apotheosis.

382
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,320
And the Outsider who killed that expert from Sinister Pleasure

383
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,560
was your grandfather,

384
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,720
Zhang Xilin.

385
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,399
Mr. Xu.

386
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,480
We've found the coffin of Zhang Xilin.

387
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:54,720
Open it.

388
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,240
Fruit skins are household food waste,

389
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,840
and wet wipes are residual waste.

390
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,399
Everything we've used is waste,

391
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,800
including the body of Zhang Xilin.

392
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:26,480
Something keeps me puzzled, though.

393
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Zhang Chulan,

394
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:29,320
is your grandfather a residual waste

395
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:30,800
or household food waste?

396
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,800
Found it.

397
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:44,120
NDT EXPRESS

398
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,280
Chulan.

399
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,760
No matter what difficulties you face, you must hang in there.

400
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,399
Don't despair.

401
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,840
Be patient.

402
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,320
You have to be patient.

403
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,600

00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:30,639
Doesn't it hurt when you hit yourself like that?

405
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,040
Tell me then.

406
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,320
What should I do?

407
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,639
You shouldn't hurt yourself.

408
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,639
You should find those who hurt you

409
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,919
and hit them instead.

Mr. Xu.

412
00:21:57,879 --> 00:21:59,120
I'll join NDT.

413

ZHANG CHULAN

00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:06,080
PATIENCE

415
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,280
Do you have a sniper rifle? I need it.

416
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,600
Okay.

Lingyu.

420
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,360
I need you to leave now.

421
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:30,840
I want to rest for a bit.

422
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,800
-With NDT Express, life is easier! -With NDT Express, life is easier!

424

NDT EXPRESS

425
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,399
This is the inbound area,

426
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:24,840
where we receive orders

427
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:25,879
and examine goods

428
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,280
before the storage procedure.

429
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,679
Your job is simple.

430
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,240
Control the panel.

431
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,439
You went to lengths to take me here just for this?

432
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,760
What do you expect?

433
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,399
Zero effort with abundant wages in return is my ultimate dream.

434
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,879
Doggy said, "Slacking off is inadvisable, and pipe dreaming is impossible."

435

"Working hard is the right way to do it."

436
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:49,760
Ms. Bao.

437
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,000
Why do Outsider agents like us

438
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,320
have to work here?

439
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,040
We don't have orders every day.

440
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,600
And the company won't feed you when there are no orders.

441
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,240
I have a question.

442
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,679
Outsiders look similar to ordinary people.

443
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
So how can we tell the difference?

444
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,800
We have a gesture.

445
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:06,480
-All Outsiders know about it. -What's it?

446
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,679
This is too easy.

447
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,800
You just learned that?

448
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:16,879
Baobao, something came up.

449
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,800
You two come with me.

450
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,560
Outsiders hide amidst ordinary people.

451
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,320
As a governing agency,

452
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:29,280
NDT manages all registered Outsiders

453
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,879
to make sure that their behaviors won't affect ordinary people.

454
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,399
Every Outsider has their own serial number.

455
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,919
Do I have one too?

456
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,200
Of course.

457
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,399
Xu Si. Log in to your account.

458
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,639
XU SI

459
00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:56,320
Xu Si,

460
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:57,840
you have a pretty long friend list.

461
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,040
Don't get distracted.

462
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,200
A few days ago,

463
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,960
Sinister Pleasure returned the body of your grandfather, Zhang Xilin.

464
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,200
Just moments ago,

465
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,840
they published your information online.

466
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:08,360
All Outsiders can see it.

467
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,040
Why did they expose me?

468
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,639
Read this carefully.

469
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,879
Read the last line.

470
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,720
ZHANG CHULAN, SENIOR STUDENT IN CIVIL ENGINEERING PROGRAM

471
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,600
CURRENTLY WORKS AT NDT EXPRESS THE GRANDSON OF ZHANG XILIN

472
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,199
THE INHERITOR OF QI APOTHEOSIS

473
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,240
About that Qi Apotheosis,

474
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,399
I've heard it from Liu Yanyan.

475
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But what is it for?

476
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,480
There are eight mysterious and robust power

477
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,960
known in the world of Outsiders

478
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,240
as the Eight Supremes.

479
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,600
The Eight Supremes was the cause of the Jiashen Calamity.

480
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,399
Qi Apotheosis is one of them.

481
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,439
Apparently, the wielder of this power was your grandfather, Zhang Xilin.

482
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,199
Now that your details are known to everyone,

483
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,520
aside from Sinister Pleasure, the entire world of Outsiders

484
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,720
will have their eyes on you.

485
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,360
Chief Celestial Taoist.

486
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,960
Why are you still awake?

487
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,480
Chief Celestial Taoist.

488
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,080
It's late.

489
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,679
TIAN JINZHONG, CELESTIAL TAOIST MANSION

490
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,679
You shouldn't stay up late.

491
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,399
Qing, Yu. You may go now.

492
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,639
Yes.

493
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,919
Jinzhong.

494
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,199
I can't sleep either.

495
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:19,240
So I think we can wet our whistle here.

496
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,679
Zhiwei.

497
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,679
What's that for?

498
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,720
For Huaiyi.

499
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,520
He's left.

500
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,520
But there's always a spot in Mount Longhu

501
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,639
for him.

502
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,159
Certainly.

503
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,320
Our master had taken in so many disciples.

504
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,679
The three of us are tight with each other.

505
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,720
Hadn't he caused that trouble

506
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,720
and put me through this,

507
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,840
it would've been so wonderful

508
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,720
for the three of us to stay here together

509
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,560
till now.

510
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,280
I'll drink this to you.

511
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,360
You're in delicate health,

512
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:05,720
but you never forgot what Master had taught us.

513
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,720
You didn't take your life.

514
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,199
Both of us have turned a hundred in the blink of an eye.

515
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,480
This is our blessing.

516
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,960
Huaiyi.

517
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,879
I'll drink to you.

518
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:39,800
Congratulations.

519
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,120
I only found out today

520
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,639
that you had a grandson.

521
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,679
I really wish he was here with us.

522
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,199
Over the years,

523
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,439
Huaiyi had been in hiding

524
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,879
under the alias Zhang Xilin.

525
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:19,360
In the end, he only had one grandson left.

526
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,080
His name is Zhang Chulan.

527
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,399
What has happened?

528
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,399
Lingyu. There you are.

529
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,600
Master Zhang and Master Tian

530
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,520
have been drinking for the past two hours.

531
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,480
No one comes out.

532
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:40,760
They didn't respond to us.

533
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,120
I'm very worried about them.

534
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:43,480
Master Zhang favors you the most.

535
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,000
Go in and check on them.

536
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:46,959
Yexing.

537
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,120
You called me here

538
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:52,159
because you're afraid of being scolded?

539
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,399
Jeez, how can you say that?

540
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,159
How can I do that to you?

541
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,320
We're all direct disciples of Master,

542
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:01,240
we're equal. Go in now!

543
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,399
Come on. Chop-chop.

544
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:11,080
Lingyu. Come.

545
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:12,240
Join us.

546
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,000
Master Zhang. Master Tian.

547
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,679
Maybe you should put down your glass.

548
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,040
I want you to have it. Don't be afraid.

549
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,560
Let's not drink anymore, Master.

550
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,199
Your disciple

551
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,919
lacks nothing,

552
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,959
but he's too serious.

553
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:31,000
Too much seriousness.

554
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,320
Master Zhang.

555
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:34,320
Master Tian.

556
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,560
I don't understand

557
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:37,560
what you're talking about.

558
00:29:37,639 --> 00:29:38,959
It's getting late.

559
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
You should rest up early.

560
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,480
It's fine if you don't understand. In the future, you will.

561
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,360
INVITATION

562
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,919
Descend the mountain tomorrow,

563
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,040
and leave for Xinpu City.

564
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,280
Find someone for me.

565
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,639
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST OF MOUNT LONGHU

566
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Test him

567
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,040
and see if he's qualified.

568
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,639
Qualified for what?

569
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,520
Qualified to inherit the Tianshidu.

570
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,600
Why should I be here

571
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,280
when there are so many intelligent machines working?

572
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:27,240
Zhang Chulan.

573
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Who are you?

574
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,959
Zhang Xilin is your grandfather, right?

575
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,679
I'll get straight to the point.

576
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,120
Do you master Qi Apotheosis?

577
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,080
I'll go straight to the point too.

578
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:40,120
No.

579
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,840
Didn't he teach you this?

580
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,679
All of you exalted this thing.

581
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,760
I wouldn't be seized by Sinister Pleasure if I knew it.

582
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,760
Besides, I'm sure that my grandfather couldn't do

583
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,800
that ruddy Qi Apotheosis or whatever.

584
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:53,720
If he did,

585
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,040
we wouldn't have been in hiding

586
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,080
all these years.

587
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,120
Zhang Chulan.

588
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:58,600
Your grandfather was a great person.

589
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,399
More than a decade ago, a serious murder case

590
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,199
happened in Mount Siguniang.

591
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,320
More than ten dead bodies of elite Outsiders

592
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,800
were found there.

593
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:07,720
-And the murderer-- -Stop.

594
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,840
I've heard this before.

595
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:10,840
You mean to tell me

596
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,879
that my grandfather was the murderer, right?

597
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,720
I've been investigating this case for the past ten years,

598
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,159
and I was only told yesterday that he did it.

599
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,320
Zhang Xilin.

600
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,679
Every one of you claims

601
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,560
that my grandfather is the murderer.

602
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
Where's your evidence?

603
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,679
The murder case occurred in Bailu.

604
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,720
Your grandfather

605
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:32,439
died the next night,

606
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,399
right?

607
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,639
As you said,

608
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,040
it happened in Mount Siguniang in Lunan.

609
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,120
But my grandfather passed away at home in Lubei.

610
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:44,240
Thousands of li between these two places, you know?

611
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,520
So my grandfather had nothing

612
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,159
to do with the murder case.

613
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,679
Take a look at this.

614
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,560
These are the copies of my investigation over these years.

615
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:57,399
The last two pages are about your grandfather.

616
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,360
To you,

617
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:00,399
he was a loving and caring grandfather.

618
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:02,280
But to the world of Outsiders

619
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,159
and civil peace,

620
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,080
he was a thug who had over ten deaths on him.

621
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,480
You were always on the run

622
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,439
because he was avoiding his enemies

623
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,639
and NDT.

624
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,480
Besides, you're curious about me, right?

625
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,040
Same as Xu Xiang,

626
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,240
I'm the person in charge of the Lunan Region.

627
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,520
My name is Liao Zhong.

628
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,520
LIAO ZHONG

629
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,240
You see,

630
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,360
Zhang Xilin killed more than ten experts on his own

631
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:52,959
before he died.

632
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,480
However, we didn't see any traces of Qi Apotheosis

633
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,959
in his memory.

634
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:00,360
It's going to take some time.

635
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,959
How long will it take?

636
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,879
We're talking about lifelong memories.

637
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:07,480
God knows when Zhang Xilin used it throughout his whole life?

638
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,480
-I'll find it as soon as possible. -I'm approaching the three-year period.

639
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,679
It's going to succeed soon.

640
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,560
Qi Apotheosis is the key to the secret of the Jiashen Calamity.

641
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:17,800
If you can't trace the thing by that time,

642
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:20,480
those old geezers of Sinister Pleasure won't go easy on me.

643
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,760
That's your own business, Interim Leader.

644
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,360
INTERIM LEADER OF SINISTER PLEASURE

645
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,800
If I'm in trouble,

646
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,199
you're not going to escape alive either.

647
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,480
To you,

648
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,560
he was a loving and caring grandfather.

649
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:46,959
But to the world of Outsiders

650
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,879
and civil peace,

651
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:52,719
he was a thug who had over ten deaths on him.

652
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,760
Who was that?

653
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:06,320
WHITE TURTLE

654
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,880
Here they are.

655
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,120
Well done, my little turtle.

656
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,319
Stop!

657
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,880
Let me see

658
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,600
what does the legendary Zhang Chulan

659
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,600
look like.

660
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,159
Watch out.

661
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,239
Sinister Pleasure, again?

662
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:54,880
Give me a break, will you?

663
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,759
We're not from Sinister Pleasure!

664
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:58,160
We mean no harm.

665
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,080
Our president just wants to meet with you.

666
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,960
He's not going with you.

667
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:06,600
On my master's command,

668
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,640
we'll take Zhang Chulan with us.

669
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,839
Are you getting in our way?

670
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,799
First come, first serve, you know?

671
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:18,759
What?
Am I wrong?

672
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:21,520
They're not some ordinary Outsiders.

673
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,720
It's getting trickier.

674
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,279
Three Taoists?

675
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,240
This late at night?

676
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:31,000
Are you doing some cosplay thing?

677
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,560
Let me tell you.

678
00:35:33,279 --> 00:35:35,799
I'm just an ordinary college student.

679
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,120
I have lectures tomorrow.

680
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,160
Bye, then.

681
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,279
Lingyu.

682
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,799
Don't waste your effort

683
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,080
on this fellow.

684
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,360
Yexing and I will test him

685
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,520
to see what he got.

686
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,440
No, I give up.

687
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,319
Seriously?

688
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,279
You master Qi Apotheosis, don't you?

689
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,640
Fight back, come on.

690
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,799
I--

691
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,279
Lingyu.

692
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,600
Should we…

693
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,360
Go on.

694
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,400
Lingyu.

695
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,520
Give him a break.

696
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,440
Look at this guy.

697
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,640
He's really weak.

698
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,240
You're one to talk, huh?

699
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,480
What does that make you then,

700
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,400
hitting a weakling?

701
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:03,359
Jiyun, Yexing.

702
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,120
Step back.

703
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,160
Lingyu.

704
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:08,640
-This fellow simply can't-- -I said, step back.

705
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,799
What are you up to?

706
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,640
I can't see why my master chose you.

707
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,799
You should've told me so.

708
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,440
Did your master have an interest in me?

709
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,440
How old is he? What's his name?

710
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,400
I'll visit him some other day.

711
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,759
Zhang Chulan.

712
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:37,920
Shut your mouth.

713
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,040
GOLD BRILLIANCE SPELL

714
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,279
What is our dad trying to do?

715
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,200
He cares so much about Zhang Chulan, but why?

716
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:59,000
He's never interested in recruitment.

717
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,120
But now, he's taking care of Zhang Chulan himself.

718
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:03,920
Is he after Qi Apotheosis too?

719
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
That is one part of it.

720
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,279
But I think he values the connection behind Zhang Chulan more.

721
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,120
Hear this.

722
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,480
I've looked into Zhang Xilin thoroughly.

723
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,799
Zhang Xilin is a fake identity.

724
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,640
He had been trying to hide his past.

725
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,680
Also, Zhang Chulan isn't as innocent as he looks.

726
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:23,000
He wouldn't tell anyone

727
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,120
about the martial skills his grandfather taught him.

728
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,359
But I found something on the thralls

729
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,400
that he took down.

730
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,400
The martial skills Zhang Xilin taught him

731
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,359
is the secretive art

732
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,279
of the Celestial Taoist Mansion in Mount Longhu,

733
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:35,560
The Gold Brilliance Spell.

734
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,200
By any chance, was Zhang Xilin…

735
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:42,920
He must have something to do with Mount Longhu.

736
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,120
You know them well.

737
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,600
Riff-raff from Sinister Pleasure spread words

738
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,240
that Zhang Chulan is the inheritor of Qi Apotheosis.

739
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:51,960
As a result, many greedy eyes are on Zhang Chulan.

740
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,240
Obviously, many Outsiders

741
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:55,279
seek to ensnare him.

742
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,759
As far as I'm concerned, someone has already made their move.

743
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:58,799
Celestial Taoist Mansion

744
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,440
and All-Encompassing Guild.

745
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,680
Both of us can do this.

746
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:09,240
Let's not get into the fight, dude.

747
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:10,799
Forget about that.

748
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,799
My grandfather taught me this when I was little.

749
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,240
We must be connected in some way.

750
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,319
Look at this.

751
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,640
Who on earth are you?

752
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:29,160
How do you know the Gold Brilliance Spell of Mount Longhu?

753
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,799
So it's called the Gold Brilliance Spell.

754
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,799
Also, who is your grandfather?

755
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,200
Both of you

756
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:40,200
should go to Mount Longhu and beg for forgiveness.

757
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,040
We are family.

758
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,080
Beg for forgiveness? That sounds harsh.

759
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,680
The Gold Brilliance Spell is off-limits to the public.

760
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,080
No matter who your grandfather is,

761
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,520
he's a traitor to Mount Longhu.

762
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,400
That explains

763
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,040
why you're such a buffoon.

764
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,759
He must be one as well.

765
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,920
Vileness does run in your blood.

766
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,720
My grandfather isn't a traitor.

767
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,040
Take your nonsense elsewhere.

768
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,080
Lingyu.

769
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,720
That's too hard on him.

770
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:22,560
Didn't Master Zhang tell us to--
