1
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,279
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,720
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

3
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:34,000
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,760
You are every bit like your grandfather!

5
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:52,120
You're both maddening!

6
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:53,160
Grandmaster,

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,640
I didn't do anything to upset you.

8
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,640
Very well, Zhang Chulan.

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,599
You turned the contest that shook the Outsiders' world

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,760
into a ridiculous joke!

11
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:02,000
Grandmaster,

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,760
at this point, it's not entirely my fault.

13
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:05,000
Now is definitely not the time

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,119
to accept the inheritance.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,920
Chief Celestial Taoist, Sinister Pleasure is attacking Mount Longhu.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,440
Everyone is getting on my nerves.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,479
He's over a century old,

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,160
but his prowess is still so formidable.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,759
Where is Ms. Bao?

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,960
Jiyun and Yexing said she was lured away by a sound.

21
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's look for her.

22
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:27,160
GREAT JADE EMPEROR HALL

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,200
Is this the so-called Gold Brilliance Spell,

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,479
the signature of Celestial Taoist Mansion?

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,360
The millennia-old secret art didn't fail you.

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,880
You were a bunch of living failures in the first place.

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,360
You rely on a girl to save your necks.

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,839
The Four Crazies and the Four Senses

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,199
are all feared.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,520
If you limit yourselves,

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,759
you'll amount to nothing.

32
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:48,920
What do you want?

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,080
What do we want?

34
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,320
I don't know about the others,

35
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:52,720
but for me,

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,119
I am obsessed

37
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,160
with destroying those you cherish.

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,960
That includes this millennia-old temple!

39
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,360
It will be reduced to nothing eventually.

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,119
Might as well let me get working.

41
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:03,199
I will never allow that!

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,080
Let me break it to you.

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,720
To reach the ultimate limits,

44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,440
you must face your true nature.

45
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:09,840
Do something if you want to do it.

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,480
Only then will you improve.

47
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,400
That is called "no sacrifice".

48
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:21,840
I can't move!

49
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,160
Young man, you're quite the troublemaker.

50
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,160
Who are you?

51
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,400
"Not even the smallest sacrifice for the greater good."

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,400
That is indeed

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,239
the code of Yang Zhu, your founding master.

54
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,799
But there is a second part.

55
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,840
"Not even the smallest gain to bring any suffering."

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,040
Do you not remember that?

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,320
No sacrifice, no taking.

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,840
Disregarding the countless temptations in the world

59
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,359
is already an achievement.

60
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,400
Your founding master, Yang Zhu's goal

61
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,480
was to let go of the whole world.

62
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,040
Such an idea was shocking to the world.

63
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,480
Now, you and your people

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,799
only remember the selfishness

65
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,359
and not the selflessness.

66
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,880
You're a disgrace to your title.

67
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,480
You are only following your desires.

68
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,560
You're mischief-makers stirring up chaos everywhere!

69
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,679
Chief Celestial Taoist,

70
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,200
this analogy

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,600
doesn't sound right.

72
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,920
If they make mischief,

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,600
what does that make us?

74
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,440
Cursed!

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,440
How dare you speak ill of us!

76
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,959
Chief Celestial Taoist, I didn't say anything!

77
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,399
Young lady,

78
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
thank you.

79
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:30,120
You defended Celestial Taoist Mansion

80
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,320
from these arrogant scoundrels.

81
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,679
No, Chief Celestial Taoist. I didn't do anything.

82
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,239
But you were brave.

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,880
That matters the most.

84
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,880
Grandmaster, Sinister Pleasure's main force

85
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:40,959
is at the hall!

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,959
We can't hold them off much longer!

87
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,200
Who would've thought?

88
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm already over 100 years old,

89
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,320
but my fight is still not over.

90
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,440
Never mind.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,560
I'll consider this some exercise.

92
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,600
All of you, stop!

93
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,640
Cursed intruders!

94
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,119
How dare you disturb Mount Longhu!

95
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,399
Grandmaster.

96
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,160
Weaklings.

97
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:15,119
Now you're paying for your slackness in training.

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,920
Grandmaster, watch out! He has an iron head!

99
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,360
Ironhead Liao's head crumbled!

100
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,840
Is this the Gold Brilliance Spell?

101
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,680
It's simply unbreakable.

102
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,159
If we can't break it down now,

103
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,599
we'll try until it's done!

104
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,760
Chief Celestial Taoist,

105
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,520
I don't have much to write home about,

106
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:34,719
but I am fast!

107
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,960
Kids love wandering around.

108
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:41,320
Mind the slippery floor!

109
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,200
I shall die with no regrets

110
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,520
if I can fight Zhang Zhiwei,

111
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:48,159
the 99th Chief Celestial Taoist.

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,719
None of us can take him on alone.

113
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,680
If we must fight,

114
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,320
we must fight together!

115
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,680
Have these people lost their minds?

116
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,039
We are here to stir up trouble,

117
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,039
not to meet our end.

118
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,479
This old man is standing

119
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,680
at the top of the Outsiders' world.

120
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,919
I'm leaving. What about you?

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,960
Certainly.

122
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,880
Your Taoist robe is pretty neat.

123
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:26,520
Sadly,

124
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:29,240
this outfit makes you look old.

125
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,560
You carry a nice scent.

126
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,719
I smell Maojian tea and jasmine.

127
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,400
Chief Celestial Taoist,

128
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,320
I remember the brands of these tea leaves.

129
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,440
I'll send you a regular supply.

130
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,719
Put it back

131
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,919
to where you took it.

132
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,800
Remember to clean the room up.

133
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,680
I am Kun of Sinister Pleasure!

134
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,479
Do you take me for room service?

135
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,240
Do you think I won't draw my sword?

136
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Or are you drunk?

137
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,000
Shut up!

138
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,200
Go clean the room!

139
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,320
Come on.

140
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,680
Of all people, you impersonated Zhang Lingyu.

141
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,719
Even I feel like punching you!

142
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,799
Sorry, gentlemen!

143
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,400
A girl with pink hair asked me to dress like this.

144
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,159
That's all I know!

145
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,960
I only joined Sinister Pleasure recently.

146
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,599
Please spare me!

147
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,880
We can spare you,

148
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,840
but you must give us some answers.

149
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,840
I'll tell you all I know!

150
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,760
I didn't know there would be so many people!

151
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
I saw around 100 members.

152
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,159
And the Four Crazies are here too.

153
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,440
The elders are here too!

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,640
I don't know anything else!

155
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,240
Xu San.

156
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,960
We must find Ms. Bao as soon as possible.

157
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,719
How long until reinforcements arrive?

158
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,840
Xu Si informed the office. They will be here soon.

159
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,479
In that case, let's split up and search

160
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,479
to cover more ground.

161
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,640
No, it's too risky.

162
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:58,400
Come with me. It's my responsibility.

163
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
Xu San!

164
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,359
I am not Ms. Bao.

165
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,120
I will run if I can't win.

166
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,560
Watch out for the tough ones.

167
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:11,880
By the way,

168
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,200
you were right about everything

169
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,680
except for one thing.

170
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,159
This isn't your responsibility.

171
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,560
This is our responsibility.

172
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,680
Xia He, stand aside. I must aid Mr. Lu.

173
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,680
Forget it.

174
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,440
You will only get in his way.

175
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,479
You gained some weight.

176
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,359
Xia He,

177
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,799
let's not talk about us.

178
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:16,039
Let go of me.

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,679
If you want to save Mr. Lu,

180
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,719
you must go through me.

181
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:24,400
Am I not a big challenge for you?

182
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,280
Do not force my hand.

183
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,520
This firm and muscular chest.

184
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,520
I've missed it so much.

185
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,720
Stop before you regret it.

186
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,199
Are you going to hit me?

187
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
I can't wait to do it!

188
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:52,160
Capricorn!

189
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,480
You actually hit me!

190
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:56,079
Give it a rest!

191
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,439
Not a chance.

192
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,600
You broke my heart.

193
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Xia He.

194
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,120
Please.

195
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:11,079
Just leave.

196
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,000
Why you…

197
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,439
You still taste the same.

198
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,439
You asked for this!

199
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,360
That day,

200
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,040
I accepted who I was.

201
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,360
It was also the day

202
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,680
you thought you had made a mistake.

203
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,560
I really enjoyed watching

204
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,040
your battle with Zhang Chulan.

205
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
I thought you had finally found closure

206
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:48,720
and accepted yourself.

207
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,800
But look at you now.

208
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,439
How foolish of me.

209
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,600
Zhang Lingyu,

210
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,280
what's wrong with being with me?

211
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,640
Why must you torment yourself so much?

212
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,800
Because you changed.

213
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,680
You became a sorcerer of Sinister Pleasure.

214
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,640
You became…

215
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,199
Cheap?

216
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,600
Or indecent?

217
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
I expected nothing less

218
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
from the righteous heir of Celestial Taoist Mansion.

219
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,959
You're too virtuous

220
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,680
to utter such words.

221
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,800
Master?

222
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Lingyu.

223
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,480
Is this the girl?

224
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,680
Xia He,

225
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,800
you evil sorcerer.

226
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,720
You see.

227
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,520
My master is here.

228
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,319
Leave Mount Longhu now

229
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,480
before I make you.

230
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,439
Drop the act already.

231
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,560
If you wanted to hit her,

232
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,480
you would have done so just now.

233
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,000
Xia He, what are you doing?

234
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,959
I see.

235
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,400
You're Bone Scraper.

236
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,640
Lass,

237
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,319
do you find this old man

238
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,880
worthy of your time?

239
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,719
I am Xia He of Sinister Pleasure.

240
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,160
Greetings, Chief Celestial Taoist.

241
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,439
Lingyu, go to the other side.

242
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,680
Clear those troublemakers.

243
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,439
But Mr. Lu is…

244
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,760
I'll take care of that.

245
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,680
I came here following Lu Jin's qi.

246
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,760
Master,

247
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,199
Xia He is not a bad person.

248
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,120
Go.

249
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:49,760
I know what must be done.

250
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,880
Yes.

251
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,800
Little lass,

252
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,319
I applaud your audacity.

253
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,959
A sorcerer of Sinister Pleasure

254
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,360
should run away

255
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:04,839
upon seeing me.

256
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,280
If you don't allow me to leave,

257
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,480
can I even hope to flee?

258
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,280
Your legs are yours to command.

259
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,439
You can decide whether or not

260
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,480
you want to flee

261
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,880
and which path to take.

262
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,280
The same goes for what kind of a person you want to be

263
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,880
or whether you want to be a human.

264
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,680
You have lived for over 100 years.

265
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,319
Why are you uttering this nonsense?

266
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,920
Most of the time,

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,560
we don't get to decide

268
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,800
how the world sees us.

269
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,160
Indeed.

270
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,199
The path we choose is perilous.

271
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,959
It's tough to be a good guy.

272
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,439
If you're trying to say you didn't have a choice,

273
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,120
that's a waste of breath.

274
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,480
If you don't follow your heart,

275
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,240
how can you make a difference?

276
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,280
Take care,

277
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,160
lying lass.

278
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,319
I told you

279
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,199
it was a bad time to get under his skin.

280
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,599
My toxins are completely useless against him.

281
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,800
Is this the power of Triple Rebirth?

282
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,599
This is the ideology of Trinity Sect.

283
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,839
When a person is born,

284
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,520
one's qi forms the limbs and the bones.

285
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:42,439
That is neutrality.

286
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,959
Neutrality is the law of nature

287
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,400
but it isn't spared from demise.

288
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Neutrality is humanity.

289
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,520
Reversal is ascendance.

290
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:48,680
Lu Jin is planning

291
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,120
to go against the law of heaven

292
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:52,680
to return his body to the state of qi of his birth.

293
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,480
If he can reach the third state,

294
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,280
he won't be far from ascending.

295
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,480
In that case, we must wait until his qi is depleted.

296
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,439
The anguish and hatred are planted

297
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,560
deep in his heart.

298
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,599
Not even I am capable

299
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,160
of transmuting his emotions instantly.

300
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,959
So we wait.

301
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,360
We are only losing some time.

302
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:11,480
But time is of the essence.

303
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Don't forget that we are on Mount Longhu.

304
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,920
Anything could happen.

305
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,880
Thunder Smoke Cannon?

306
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,680
Folks,

307
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,680
show yourselves.

308
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,319
Gao Ning!

309
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,240
I could feel someone prickling my meridians when I got here.

310
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,479
Dealing with Lu Jin might have taken some of your strength

311
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,640
If you're smart and want to leave,

312
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,000
I won't keep you.

313
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,479
But if you stay for the fun,

314
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,400
you're doomed.

315
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Let's leave!

316
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,160
Yuan Tao, you almost got all of us killed!

317
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,640
He had every intention to take our lives.

318
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,640
Had we left any later,

319
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:57,680
none would've survived.

320
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,920
You are exaggerating.

321
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,280
I'm serious.

322
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,839
Inside my Bewitchments Array,

323
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,560
I can torture a person's heart

324
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,280
as easily as pulling a string.

325
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:10,439
But when I did the same to him,

326
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,000
I actually felt as if I was

327
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,560
holding a sturdy and refined pillar of steel!

328
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
Don't look back.

329
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,319
Forget about Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

330
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,479
Let's leave.

331
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,760
Go on ahead!

332
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,560
I've exhausted too much qi.

333
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,160
I must replenish it!

334
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,000
The Vermilion Book which is prized by all sects

335
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,280
is being wasted like junk.

336
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:38,400
Thankfully, you weren't from Vermilion Book Sect.

337
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,760
You are utterly wasting it.

338
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,079
You struck me with Five Thunder Vermilion Book.

339
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,000
Lu Jin,

340
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,240
that was uncalled for.

341
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:19,480
I see.

342
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,000
You lost control of your Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyin

343
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,560
and Heart Meridian of Hand-Shaoyin.

344
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:26,960
That left your heart undefended against the evil within you.

345
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,159
You are now deranged.

346
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Lu Jin,

347
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,200
you're giving me a tough challenge.

348
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,159
Thankfully, the Founding Master left me a useful item.

349
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,960
Ward off evils and bind the malice.

350
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,320
Protect the soul and body.

351
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,440
Clarity and serenity.

352
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,080
Calmness and stillness in mind.

353
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,159
Eternity for the three souls.

354
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,600
The spirits be free, the sorrows let flow.

355
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,680
Lu Jin,

356
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,879
if my Calming Spell can't wake you,

357
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,760
you are destined for your demise.

358
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,560
Bring it on, Lu Jin!

359
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,040
Kill me if you can!

360
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,200
I'm right here.

361
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,680
Take my life if you can.

362
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,240
Lu Jin!

363
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,840
Kill me if you can!

364
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,120
Wu Gensheng, I must kill you!

365
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,679
Ms. Bao, don't do anything reckless.

366
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,200
Zang Long, run!

367
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,159
It's all right. Grandmaster will come.

368
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,200
I can hang in there.

369
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,360
What are you? A turtle?

370
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,159
You still hung on for so long

371
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,480
after reaching your limits.

372
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,879
Enough talking!

373
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,440
Zang Long!

374
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,360
I'm all right.

375
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,560
It's all right, Linglong.

376
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:24,480
Source of Malice,

377
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,399
Shen Chong.

378
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,720
What a loyal one.

379
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:34,840
Too bad.

380
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,280
However, I'm really fond

381
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,080
of people with obsessions.

382
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:44,520
Obsessions bring desires.

383
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,960
And I

384
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,399
can grant any wish.

385
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:52,200
I'll offer you an opportunity.

386
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:57,679
CONTRACT

387
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,800
Press your thumb here

388
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:00,320
and sign this contract.

389
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,879
I'll loan you some qi.

390
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,600
I guarantee you can blast them to bits.

391
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,159
How does that sound?

392
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Source of Malice, what is the meaning of this?

393
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,280
Are you stealing our quarry?

394
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,600
I've exhausted a bit too much qi.

395
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,320
I need to replenish some qi.

396
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,120
What?

397
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,800
Are you scared now?

398
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,200
How about I loan you some qi?

399
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,080
We are from Sinister Pleasure.

400
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,280
Every single person does things for themselves!

401
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,840
That's the ideology of Sinister Pleasure.

402
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,360
Step aside if you're not taking a loan.

403
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
Don't get in the way of my business.

404
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,000
Well?

405
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,800
Sign this.

406
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:42,000
No.

407
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,280
Don't do it, Zang Long.

408
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,280
If you sign it you will become his puppet.

409
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,120
You would suffer the same fate as Hu Jie.

410
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,120
Linglong.

411
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,240
I must get you out safely.

412
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,919
So

413
00:20:58,679 --> 00:20:59,639
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,080
No.

415
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,080
This time,

416
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,919
I must go against your will.

417
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,040
SHEN CHONG, ZANG LONG

418
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,000
I'll sign it.

419
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,120
The mighty Source of Malice

420
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,080
has stooped so low.

421
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:20,480
Even a bunch of grunts

422
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,240
can order you around.

423
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,560
Zhang Chulan,

424
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:28,600
the new champion of the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

425
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:29,919
wants to make a deal with me.

426
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,480
That won't be a problem.

427
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,240
CONTRACT

428
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,200
An absolute VIP deal.

429
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:46,679
SHEN CHONG, ZHANG CHULAN

430
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,800
Why does my contract have so many clauses?

431
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:50,280
You're the champion.

432
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,720
The limitations and punishments

433
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,200
for breach of contract

434
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,960
are naturally more severe than others.

435
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:57,600
That makes sense.

436
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:59,280
Come on.

437
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:03,080
Shen Chong, we are all businessmen.

438
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:04,600
We need contracts and businesses.

439
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:05,720
However,

440
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:07,600
there are two matters at hand.

441
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,760
Shouldn't you make them pay

442
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,159
for what they did to my friend?

443
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,200
No need to provoke me.

444
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,200
I meant to finish them off.

445
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,360
Shen Chong, that's a nice punch!

446
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,840
Well done, Shen Chong!

447
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,320
Shen Chong, they are getting away!

448
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,879
No one slips through my hands!

449
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,600
Let's go!

450
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:55,720
Shen Chong,

451
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,679
those three got away.

452
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,360
We can't close the deal.

453
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,200
But there is honor between us.

454
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
See you.

455
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,760
You three!

456
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,520
You made me famished!

457
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:13,320
I'll stall him.

458
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:14,520
Leave now.

459
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,879
I told you!

460
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,439
All three of you shall be my food!

461
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,800
Lian.

462
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,360
Stop dilly-dallying.

463
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,000
Leave now.

464
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Zhang Chulan, aren't you usually the shameless one?

465
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,200
Why are you trying to be the hero now?

466
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,960
I didn't ask for this.

467
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,960
I don't think I can defeat you.

468
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,879
I'm human.

469
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,840
I can be shameless in my daily life.

470
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:50,919
But I can't

471
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:53,760
discard my humanity.

472
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,480
Humanity! Well said!

473
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,320
I love seeing the despair on people's faces

474
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,840
when their humanity is lost!

475
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,439
Zhang Chulan,

476
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,800
I look forward to seeing you fight!

477
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,360
Zhang Chulan,

478
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:22,960
die now!

479
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,560
Your qi shall be mine!

480
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:27,200
Mine!

481
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,840
The contest was nothing like this.

482
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,800
I didn't even get to react.

483
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,800
I'm too weak.

484
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,800
Am I going to die here?

485
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,280
Sign the contract if you want to live.

486
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,320
Otherwise,

487
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:15,040
my obsessions

488
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,120
will consume every bit of you!

489
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,199
Is there no hope for me?

490
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,639
I'm totally no match for him.

491
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,240
Is this the end of the line?

492
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,240
Outsiders.

493
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,480
Champion.

494
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,520
Qi Apotheosis.

495
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:12,720
What is the point of all these?

496
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,520
Can I still go back?

497
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,679
Back to being a nobody?

498
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,520
To having no friends

499
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,919
or family

500
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,720
and dying a lonely, silent death?

501
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,679
But Grandpa,

502
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,199
Grandmaster,

503
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,080
Mr. Xu,

504
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,879
and Ms. Bao.

505
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,439
Can I leave them behind?

506
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,960
So what if I can't?

507
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,800
Everything is over anyway.

508
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,280
What a cruel world.

509
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,879
My power means nothing in this world.

510
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,560
Chulan?

511
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,439
Chulan?

512
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,159
Chulan?

513
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,439
Grandpa.

514
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,480
There are many powers

515
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,679
that normal people can't utilize.

516
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,960
Turn those powers into yours.

517
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,320
That is our special ability.

518
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,439
When you were little,

519
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,399
you loved watching this qi light.

520
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:28,439
When you threw a fit,

521
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,800
I showed you this light.

522
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,560
When you saw it,

523
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,360
you couldn't stop chuckling.

524
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,159
Contain the energy in this world

525
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,360
inside your body.

526
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,879
Then generously return it

527
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,120
to the world in your own way.

528
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,360
A cycle of in and out.

529
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,919
It goes on without pausing.

530
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,760
That is the true meaning of your power.

531
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:01,560
Chulan.

532
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,280
Do not be afraid.

533
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,439
Do not run away.

534
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:09,080
If we run away upon the slightest challenges in life,

535
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,800
we may be alive,

536
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,679
but we won't be much different from a corpse.

537
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,840
A cycle of in and out.

538
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:22,840
It goes on without pausing.

539
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,199
Zhang Chulan,

540
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,320
just go.

541
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,600
Why should I?

542
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,520
Everyone is risking their lives.

543
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,439
When I first stepped into the world of Outsiders,

544
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,879
I really hated it.

545
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:13,080
But deep down, I was happy.

546
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,800
After all, I entered a whole new world.

547
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,320
How can I not cherish it?

548
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,600
Besides,

549
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,600
I'm on a mission to find Ms. Bao.

550
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,399
I want to be with everyone.

551
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:31,600
This

552
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,760
is my reason to keep fighting.

553
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,919
You are standing up for two strangers.

554
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,560
Is this your reason for fighting?

555
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,840
What a cheap excuse to fight!

556
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,480
These people

557
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,800
are my friends.

558
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,760
They've given me so much.

559
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,679
They brought colors to my dull life.

560
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
I would love

561
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,480
to give the world some colors!

562
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:09,040
What a nuisance!

563
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:11,800
Zhang Chulan,

564
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,399
the rich will get richer

565
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,919
and the poor will get poorer.

566
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,800
There is no such thing as fairness.

567
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:22,560
Everything will go to the winning side.

568
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:25,840
It's time to pay your bill!

569
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,000
Friends?

570
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,959
How much qi are they worth?

571
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:44,360
What's wrong with becoming strong like me?

572
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,959
You worthless fool!

573
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,240
If you want death, so be it!

574
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,879
-A cycle of in and out. -A cycle of in and out.

575
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:54,159
-It goes on without pausing. -It goes on without pausing.

576
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,199
Little

577
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,600
White

578
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,600
Worm.

579
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,280
My qi!

580
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,639
My qi!

581
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,439
In all my life,

582
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,240
I've never heard of anyone

583
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,280
who only takes and never gives.

584
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,199
My qi

585
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:44,560
is mine to command.

586
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:59,439
Lian. how did you do it?

587
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,120
My grandpa taught me that.

588
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,159
Do you believe me?

589
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,280
I now recognize

590
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,679
the champion that you are.

591
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,719
Stay safe on your way back.

592
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,959
I must go and find Ms. Bao.

593
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Remember, delete the video for me.

594
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,760
Old man, you're impressive.

595
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,959
You're only one man,

596
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,439
but I feel as though I've fought a dozen.

597
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,280
Miss,

598
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,520
you're extraordinary yourself.

599
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,520
I've never seen anyone

600
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,320
who could start healing during a fight

601
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,040
after losing so much blood.

602
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,959
Too bad.

603
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,639
No cosmetics in this world

604
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:01,760
can remove this scar

605
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,760
from my face.

606
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,399
This face has never changed over the decades.

607
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,439
That left quite an impression on Zhang Huaiyi.

608
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,000
Young lady,

609
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,679
when I first met you,

610
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,439
you piqued my interest.

611
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,040
You reminded me of an old friend.

612
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
Many old men

613
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:21,040
have said the same thing to me.

614
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,360
Who is that friend?

615
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,560
Yes.

616
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,919
You are very much alike.

617
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,879
I can't bring myself to hurt you.

618
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,480
-With NDT Express, -With NDT Express,

619
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,240
-life is easier! -life is easier!

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,760
-Charge! -Charge!

625
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,520
XIAOLANZI

626
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,080
-Hello? Ms. Bao?  -Hello?

627
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,360
Hello? Ms. Bao? Where are you?

628
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,639
-Hello? -Hello?

629
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,560
Ms. Bao!

630
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,199
See you in the hall on the other side!

631
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,279
Okay!

632
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:47,719
I…

633
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:54,080
I killed Chief Celestial Taoist!

634
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:58,120
Get over yourself.

635
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,120
Lu Jin.

636
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,279
Killed me, you said?

637
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,040
A deranged man like you?

638
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,360
You could've told me you were alive!

639
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,799
You scared the wits out of me!

640
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,440
You certainly scared me.

641
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,640
You're over 100 years old.

642
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,560
Yet, you still sob.

643
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,480
You didn't pull any punches.

644
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,960
I was calling for you

645
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
while maintaining Gold Aura Armor.

646
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,880
That took a lot of effort.

647
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,600
So I sealed off my Gold Aura

648
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,720
to protect my vital organs.

649
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:29,200
You were deranged anyway.

650
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:30,759
It was easy to see through your moves.

651
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:31,880
However,

652
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,600
you did break a few of my bones.

653
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,560
You can brag about that for some time.

654
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,600
SINISTER PLEASURE WREAKED HAVOC ON MOUNT LONGHU,

655
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,640
CAUSING MANY CASUALTIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE.

656
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,640
NDT HAS ISSUED ARREST WARRANTS FOR ALL ASSAILANTS.

657
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,040
Something is off.

658
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,000
What's wrong?

659
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,680
I didn't get any positive ID from scanning Sinister Pleasure's men.

660
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:09,120
Half of the people we arrested

661
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,240
never had any records in our company.

662
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,759
Impossible.

663
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,720
All Outsiders, including Sinister Pleasure,

664
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:16,480
are registered without exception.

665
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,279
I'll ask my grandpa to save you.

666
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:22,839
Grandpa, take a look at his wounds!

667
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,319
Patience. Let me have a look.

668
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,960
Well?

669
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,080
He is not in critical condition.

670
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,400
But he has lost his arm for good.

671
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:42,279
Not even I can heal that.

672
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,200
It was already a miracle

673
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:48,560
to survive Sinister Pleasure's attack.

674
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,839
Linglong,

675
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,120
you've grown stronger.

676
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,359
It wasn't me.

677
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,480
It was…

678
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,680
It was him.

679
00:36:57,759 --> 00:36:59,319
Zhang Chulan saved us.

680
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,600
Ms. Bao, are you hurt?

681
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,200
What happened to you?

682
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:07,160
It's nothing.

683
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,520
I got into some minor trouble just now.

684
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,799
I settled it.

685
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,240
Zhang Chulan!

686
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:15,120
Well done.

687
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Impressive.

688
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,040
You have my gratitude.

689
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,759
I promised to do something for you.

690
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,240
However, you saved my family

691
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:25,040
even before I could fulfill my promise.

692
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,520
Mr. Lu, I was doing my job.

693
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,759
No, I don't owe any favors.

694
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,560
You saved Linglong.

695
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,600
Let me

696
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,560
heal your wounds.

697
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:00,759
See?

698
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,920
Is that all?

699
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,080
Yes.

700
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,480
Don't thank me. We're even now.

701
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,880
Mr. Lu!

702
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,240
I was hoping to use the wounds to get some credit!

703
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:14,960
At least leave some for it!

704
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,440
As the heir of Tianshidu,

705
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
do you still dare to ask for rewards after a beating?

706
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,040
What a mess.

707
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,200
Clean yourself up.

708
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,799
Zhang Chulan.

709
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,040
Did you accept Tianshidu?
