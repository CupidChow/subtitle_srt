1
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,840
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,360
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,879
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,960
The Gold Brilliance Spell is off-limits to the public.

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,839
No matter who your grandfather is,

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,320
he's a traitor to Mount Longhu.

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,400
That explains

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,040
why you're such a buffoon.

9
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,760
He must be one as well.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,720
Vileness does run in your blood.

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,599
My grandfather isn't a traitor.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,839
Take your nonsense elsewhere.

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,880
Lingyu.

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,360
That's too hard on him.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,320
Didn't Master Zhang tell us to--

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,039
Chulan,

17
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:24,960
do not ever

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,679
show your powers in front of others

19
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,839
no matter what.

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,759
But Grandpa,

21
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,399
if you're imparting martial arts to me

22
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:32,960
you have to tell me when I can use it.

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,720
I can't tell you

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,960
when you can use it.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,800
However, you need to remember

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,679
when you can't use it.

27
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:44,039
Chulan,

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,320
do not ever

29
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,559
show your powers in front of others

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,880
no matter what.

31
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:56,800
But Grandpa,

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,720
you force me to practice martial arts every day.

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,160
Now, you don't want me to use it in front of others.

34
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't feel like practicing martial arts now.

35
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,759
It's tiring, and I can't use it anyway.

36
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:06,720
Chulan,

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,960
actually,

38
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,440
I understand what you're thinking.

39
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,040
However, this is a sin I've committed.

40
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,560
You have no choice but to learn this.

41
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:18,480
Grandpa,

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,200
what sin have you committed?

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,440
Listen to me.

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,320
The Zhang family

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,880
is a family of martial artists.

46
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,760
The residents of the martial arts world

47
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,200
fear nothing,

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,799
except for

49
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,880
people who are too different from them.

50
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,280
If you're too wicked,

51
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,799
they'll eradicate you.

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
If you're too timid,

53
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,640
they'll walk all over you.

54
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,600
If you're too kind or too strong,

55
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:45,880
they'll be wary of you.

56
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,600
They can only accept you

57
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:51,160
when you're almost at the same level as them.

58
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,359
Do you know why the martial arts techniques of the Zhang family

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,560
cannot be imparted to strangers?

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,799
It's because once you reveal them to other people,

61
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,000
people will treat you like an Outsider.

62
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:07,359
By then,

63
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,399
they will hunt you down.

64
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,959
Outstanding individuals

65
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,840
are often targeted.

66
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,640
We have no choice.

67
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,519
Zhang Chulan, don't get up.

68
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,720
Grandpa.

69
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,000
Get up! You have to continue!

70
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,480
Utilize the Gold Aura in you.

71
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,760
Heaven and Earth.

72
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,959
Qi as the primordial root.

73
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,160
Through myriads of ordeals.

74
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,760
I shall prove my dominance!

75
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,880
Come on! Let's fight! Cut the crap!

76
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,480
Do you wish to fight me? Who do you think you are?

77
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,440
I'll wipe that smugness off your face!

78
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,920
Qi's Form.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,880
QI'S FORM

80
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,479
No matter who your grandfather is,

81
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,640
he's a traitor to Mount Longhu.

82
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,760
And the Outsider who killed that expert from Sinister Pleasure

83
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,599
was your grandfather,

84
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,919
Zhang Xilin.

85
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,400
To you,

86
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,680
he was a loving and caring grandfather.

87
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,400
But to the world of Outsiders,

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,159
he was a thug who had over ten deaths on him.

89
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,240
This is all you're capable of

90
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,599
after giving it your all.

91
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,440
I don't know how your grandfather

92
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,560
managed to learn the Gold Brilliance Spell.

93
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,680
However, I will never allow

94
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,440
an unknown person with no powers

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
like you

96
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:16,479
to taint Celestial Taoist Mansion's name.

97
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,159
Let's go.

98
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,440
We'll return to Mount Longhu.

99
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,799
Lingyu, didn't Master Zhang tell us to invite Zhang Chulan back?

100
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,840
Forget about that.

101
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:38,039
I've already tested him.

102
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,719
Zhang Chulan doesn't deserve it.

103
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,120
Stop right there.

104
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,039
Who said you could go?

105
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,039
Zhang Chulan,

106
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,919
don't get up.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,120
Lingyu won't engage you in another fight.

108
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,400
I'm done

109
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:06,039
with hiding.

110
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,880
All these years,

111
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,320
my grandfather told me to hide my powers

112
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,440
and keep a low profile.

113
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,560
It's because I'm a freak to normal people.

114
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,120
I've had a rough time hiding.

115
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,520
To be honest,

116
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,960
I was very happy when I heard about the Outsiders.

117
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,280
I thought

118
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,359
I no longer need to live in a dark corner all by myself.

119
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,080
I thought I found a world where I could live freely.

120
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,120
I thought I could find other people like me.

121
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,640
In the end,

122
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,359
even you Outsiders treat me

123
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,320
like a freak because of that darned Qi Apotheosis.

124
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,280
I no longer know what to do now.

125
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,640
Nothing good happened to me ever since I met you guys.

126
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:24,239
Now, I just want to cause a huge mess!

127
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,239
Come on! Let's continue!

128
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,120
If we keep this up,

129
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,960
I might turn you into a cripple.

130
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,199
Try me then.

131
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,559
Fine.

132
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll satisfy your request.

133
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,199
Zhang Chulan, you don't need to fear him.

134
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,800
He's just a senior member of Celestial Taoist Mansion.

135
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,040
You no longer need to hide or escape once you become my slave.

136
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,280
If you don't want to live like a loser, you should stand up.

137
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,760
From now on, live like a decent human being.

138
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,000
Crush all those

139
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,199
who trouble you.

140
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
Feng Baobao,

141
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,280
you're here too?

142
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,120
What did you call me?

143
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,480
Ms. Bao.

144
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm sorry, Master. I know my fault now.

145
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,319
You can pretend to be smug in front of them.

146
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,040
Do it in front of me, and I'll kill you.

147
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:41,199
Go.

148
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,480
Show them what you got.

149
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,480
Yes,

150
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
Master.

151
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,319
PATIENCE

152
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,560
Grandpa, look.

153
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,839
I have plenty of Gold Aura now.

154
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,040
You don't need to force me to practice every day, right?

155
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,480
You still have a long way to go.

156
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,360
Why did you think I told you to practice this spell?

157
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:10,280
It's just the basics.

158
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,520
If your Gold Aura doesn't reach a certain level.

159
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,360
you won't be able to learn the things I will teach you.

160
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:17,199
This is the real deal. Got it?

161
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:26,360
What is that?

162
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:27,600
My Gold Aura

163
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,600
was ripped to shreds.

164
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,160
Can a human possess such power?

165
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,000
If you master this,

166
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,000
it'll become your strongest spell.

167
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,280
Next,

168
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
I'll show him

169
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
my strongest spell.

170
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,880
Yes. This is the spell.

171
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,160
You used this against the thralls in the cemetery.

172
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,920
A power that surpasses Gold Aura's.

173
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,079
This sensation,

174
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
could it be…

175
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,360
I understand now.

176
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,360
Zhang Xilin was likely

177
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:07,160
a member of Celestial Taoist Mansion.

178
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,520
But at the same time,

179
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,839
Celestial Taoist Mansion never had a member like him.

180
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,800
So it's likely that Celestial Taoist Mansion

181
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,240
was hiding his identity on purpose.

182
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,120
He's someone they want to get rid of.

183
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,400
INVITATION

184
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,560
OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST OF MOUNT LONGHU

185
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,760
Celestial Taoist Mansion is inviting Zhang Chulan

186
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,640
and elite members of all sects to attend the Celestial Taoist Selection?

187
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:25,800
Is the current Chief Celestial Taoist out of his mind?

188
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,959
If this is true,

189
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,120
not only will Zhang Chulan and our company be affected,

190
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,240
but the entire Outsiders' world will also undergo a huge change.

191
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,439
It has been so many years.

192
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,560
But this is my first time using it against a human.

193
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,800
That's impossible.

194
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,640
Do you think your Gold Aura Armor is amazing?

195
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:42,000
Try this for size!

196
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,319
It's really Lightning Technique.

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,280
I'm already shocked that Zhang Chulan knows the Gold Brilliance Spell.

198
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,319
But he actually knows Lightning Technique too.

199
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,199
However, his Lightning Technique is different from Lingyu's.

200
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,560
It's white. It resembles Chief Celestial Taoist's technique.

201
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,160
That's impossible.

202
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,280
Lingyu is Chief Celestial Taoist's last disciple.

203
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Of course, he would impart the technique to Lingyu.

204
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,640
Besides, Lightning Technique cannot be learned in secret.

205
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,959
Lingyu, how are you feeling?

206
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,199
I suppose your Gold Aura is fading.

207
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,480
Admit your defeat!

208
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,760
Among all the disciples, only a few

209
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,160
are known as senior members.

210
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,120
And among these senior members,

211
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,640
only a few of them can learn Lightning Technique.

212
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,480
And no matter how good they are at them,

213
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,199
they have no right to impart them to someone else.

214
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,360
In the past millennium,

215
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:30,920
the only person who could impart Lightning Technique to other people

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,800
was Chief Celestial Taoist.

217
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
Also, Lightning Technique will only be imparted

218
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,439
to the senior disciple who's most likely

219
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,319
to be the successor of Chief Celestial Taoist.

220
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,599
That doesn't make sense at all.

221
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,640
If his grandfather

222
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,920
was the senior disciple who was most likely to be the successor

223
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,959
of Chief Celestial Taoist,

224
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,480
how could we have not heard of the name Zhang Xilin?

225
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,120
Let go…

226
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,959
of me!

227
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,959
Next, I will crush your Gold Aura entirely.

228
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,640
Lingyu,

229
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,319
you'll be utterly embarrassed.

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,880
Is that Lightning Palm?

231
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:36,800
He can use that too?

232
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:40,120
I never expected that brat to be so adept with Lightning Technique.

233
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,680
It's the same spell.

234
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,520
Wait.

235
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:55,800
It's exuding black qi.

236
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:58,800
Ms. Bao,

237
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,480
why is his lightning tainted?

238
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,520
Don't panic. I've got your back.

239
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:26,680
Hey, you.

240
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,880
You better watch out before you bully my lackey.

241
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,479
If you keep this up,

242
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,479
I will be your opponent.

243
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,599
Who is that girl?

244
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,360
She dispelled Lingyu's Lightning Palm so easily.

245
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:39,360
Shut up.

246
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:40,959
I know.

247
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,680
Zhang Chulan,

248
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,719
as the representative of Mount Longhu's Celestial Taoist Mansion,

249
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,120
I hereby invite you

250
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,400
to attend Mount Longhu's Outsider Martial Arts Contest

251
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,400
in two months.

252
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,680
This contest

253
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,439
is the open selection for the next successor

254
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,640
of Chief Celestial Taoist.

255
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,079
Zhang Chulan,

256
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:07,240
I have acknowledged you.

257
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,439
Are you sick in the head?

258
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,000
Why do I need your recognition in the first place?

259
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,719
Aren't you curious

260
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:15,280
about why your grandfather

261
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,719
could utilize the techniques of Celestial Taoist Mansion?

262
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,800
60 DAYS UNTIL OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST

263
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,520
Are you still pretending?

264
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
I'm sorry about that.

265
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:42,800
It has been so many years.

266
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,319
I'm already used to pretending.

267
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Ms. Bao,

268
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:47,719
since I already used my superpower,

269
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,360
does that make me an Outsider now?

270
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:51,120
If so, should I return to being a normal person tomorrow?

271
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,839
Or should I act like an Outsider?

272
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,560
Of course, you should act like an Outsider.

273
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,959
I don't think that's appropriate.

274
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,719
The Outsiders' world is a dangerous place.

275
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,760
I don't think I'm capable enough to survive there.

276
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,040
I was only able to act tough

277
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
because you were here today.

278
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,479
Ms. Bao,

279
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,079
I have complete trust in you.

280
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,319
Trust?

281
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:10,280
What is trust?

282
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,120
Trust?

283
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,280
I think this is what it means.

284
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,160
Trust is a term.

285
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,359
Its pinyin is "xinren".

286
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:32,839
One, it means believing in someone.

287
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,000
Two, it means entrusting your heart to someone else.

288
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,079
Third, it means…

289
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,400
Actually, I think its meaning is not important.

290
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:39,599
To me, trust

291
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,439
is being your slave unconditionally.

292
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,439
What technique did you use just now?

293
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,959
You were glittering with gold.

294
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,560
According to that guy, it was the Gold Brilliance Spell.

295
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,000
Come on. Light up the path ahead for your master.

296
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,599
I don't think that's necessary.

297
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,199
It's not like I'm a flashlight.

298
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,040
MOUNT WUDANG

299
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:45,120
What are you guys doing?

300
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,480
Wang Ye, don't you know?

301
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,360
Mount Longhu's Outsider Martial Arts Contest

302
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,720
is open to the public this time.

303
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,560
Mount Wudang received an invitation too.

304
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:58,200
We were sparring to see who has the right to attend it.

305
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,879
I heard that Zhang Chulan,

306
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,399
the successor of Qi Apotheosis,

307
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,720
one of the Eight Supremes, will be attending it too.

308
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,240
Zhang Chulan?

309
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,200
Who's that?

310
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,240
Wang Ye.

311
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,440
Do you know me?

312
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,399
You're finally here.

313
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,000
That's him. Look.

314
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,120
Grandmaster.

315
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,960
Wang Ye.

316
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,879
Grandmaster.

317
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,960
I want to join the Outsider Martial Arts Contest too.

318
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,399
May I have the slot?

319
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,000
You don't even have enough sleep. You shouldn't go.

320
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,560
Just rest here.

321
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:39,240
Don't worry.

322
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,399
I won't disgrace you

323
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,600
if I do head to Mount Longhu.

324
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,040
You're pretty adept at martial arts.

325
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,159
However, do you think the other participants

326
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,200
are meek and weak?

327
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,120
I'll just use Qimen Manipulation.

328
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,000
How did you know about that?

329
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,720
I thought Qimen Manipulation

330
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,600
was one of Wudang Sect's techniques.

331
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,600
That's right.

332
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,639
However, do you know

333
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,080
how many people in the Outsiders' world desire this technique?

334
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,200
In the Year of Jiashen,

335
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,720
Mount Wudang was attacked.

336
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,280
My brother, Zhou Sheng,

337
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,879
Hong, Fang, and the rest

338
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,320
sacrificed themselves to protect this place.

339
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:11,320
After that,

340
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:14,320
everyone thought that the technique was lost.

341
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:16,879
If Qimen Manipulation appears again,

342
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
Wudang Sect will be annihilated.

343
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,879
Master Zhang,

344
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,120
stealing from other people is no longer the norm now.

345
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,080
Humans

346
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,320
will never change.

347
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:27,679
You should go back.

348
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,000
Mount Longhu is a renowned Taoist mountain.

349
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,960
It's one of the 72 Blessed Grounds.

350
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,840
It is known as the Taoist capital.

351
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:37,960
Chief Celestial Taoist

352
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,919
once concocted the Nine Heaven Divine Pill on this mountain.

353
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,760
A dragon appeared when the pill was created.

354
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,520
That's why it's known as Mount Longhu.

355
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,679
No matter how many fancy adjectives they use,

356
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,080
in the end, it's just a mountain.

357
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:49,760
I don't want to be a Taoist. Why should I go there?

358
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
What you saw just now was meant for ordinary people.

359
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,399
There's a sparring contest for Outsiders on Mount Longhu.

360
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,159
It's called Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

361
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,360
In the past, it was an internal contest between members of Mount Longhu.

362
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,760
This time, it's an open contest.

363
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,080
The winner can inherit the title of Chief Celestial Taoist and his legacy.

364
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:04,639
What's Chief Celestial Taoist?

365
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,200
We'll arrive soon.

366
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,440
I'll tell you when we arrive.

367
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,399
Ms. Bao, where are we going?

368
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Many years ago, our company spent a huge sum on a villa.

369
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,240
Mr. Xu lived there before.

370
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,560
I already submitted a request.

371
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,120
We'll be living there for a few days.

372
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,000
A villa?

373
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,679
And Mr. Xu lived there before?

374
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,200
Ms. Bao, are we going on a vacation?

375
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,879
You could say so.

376
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,480
What are we waiting for then?

377
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,960
Ms. Bao, hurry up!

378
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,720
48 DAYS UNTIL OUTSIDER MARTIAL ARTS CONTEST

379
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,639
Ms. Bao,

380
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,480
how huge is the private cinema?

381
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,679
Is the pool right beside a lake?

382
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,960
It should at least

383
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,520
have a private gym, right?

384
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,080
We're here.

385
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,639
Ms. Bao,

386
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
you must be mistaken.

387
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,159
This is the place.

388
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,679
You still have a long way to go before you can win

389
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,480
the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

390
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,120
This place is remote and quiet.

391
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,679
From today, we'll be living here.

392
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,120
I will train you.

393
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Train me?

394
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,560
I thought we were on vacation.

395
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,080
Ms. Bao,

396
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,480
you must be kidding me.

397
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,679
Get off the vehicle.

398
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:17,960
NDT HOLIDAY RESORT

399
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,480
NDT DERELICT SITE

400
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,879
You might not understand what I've said.

401
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,560
You belong to me until next month.

402
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,800
Ms. Bao,

403
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:28,480
it's not that I don't want to train.

404
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,679
But you saw it yourself.

405
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,600
No matter how strong that martial artist was,

406
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,760
we were well-matched when I gave it my all.

407
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,080
It was a narrow defeat.

408
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,639
Did you think you were well-matched?

409
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,879
That Taoist only used 30% of his strength.

410
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,360
He was testing you.

411
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,240
Are you serious?

412
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,120
If so, there's no reason to train.

413
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,240
I can't defeat him no matter how hard I train anyway.

414
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Let's go.

415
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:53,000
Didn't you say you wish to know the truth about your grandfather?

416
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,000
Even if you're uninterested in the title of Chief Celestial Taoist,

417
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,280
you can use this opportunity to rise through the ranks.

418
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,720
Only then will you have the chance

419
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,840
to be in contact with the person who knows the truth,

420
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:02,760
Zhang Zhiwei, the 99th Chief Celestial Taoist.

421
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,639
Stop wasting time.

422
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:13,720
Here's your first training.

423
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,840
Clean this place up.

424
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,159
Although Zhang Chulan

425
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,760
knows the Gold Brilliance Spell and Lightning Technique,

426
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,159
he is no match for Lingyu.

427
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,159
Lingyu,

428
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,560
how was your spar against Zhang Chulan?

429
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,760
Descend the mountain tomorrow

430
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,280
and find someone for me.

431
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,320
Test him

432
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,480
and see if he's qualified.

433
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,760
Qualified for what?

434
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,879
Qualified to inherit Tianshidu.

435
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,360
You won against him.

436
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,040
Why are you pulling a long face?

437
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:03,560
Lingyu.

438
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,800
You've been back for a few days.

439
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,320
Why didn't you come and see me?

440
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,120
Master,

441
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,600
the Outsider Martial Arts Contest will begin soon.

442
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,919
I have to train hard

443
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
so that I won't bring disgrace to Mount Longhu.

444
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,080
If so, I'll cut to the chase.

445
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,600
What do you think about Zhang Chulan?

446
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:26,879
His martial arts were nothing special.

447
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,280
However,

448
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,600
the Gold Brilliance Spell and Lightning Technique he used

449
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,840
did originate from Mount Longhu.

450
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:35,560
In that case, what do you think about his character?

451
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:36,800
Well,

452
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:38,439
I'm not so sure about that.

453
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,480
However, I feel

454
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,840
that he's somewhat slick.

455
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:42,120
I don't like him.

456
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:48,120
The purpose of life is not necessarily to please others.

457
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,040
The same goes for you.

458
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,520
Why did you hit me?

459
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,360
Accumulate air in your dantian. Make sure the qi circulates upward.

460
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:14,800
You got it wrong. Once more.

461
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,000
I'll get angry if you keep hitting me!

462
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,320
Utilizing qi is a basic skill.

463
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:23,280
You don't even know how to utilize qi.

464
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,520
How can you compete with the other Outsiders?

465
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,520
Once more.

466
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:34,520
You're hitting me before I have even started.

467
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,879
You were wrong before starting.

468
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,120
Your posture was wrong.

469
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:39,520
It has been a long time since I saw a useless fool like you.

470
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,439
Ms. Bao.

471
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,639
Don't move.

472
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,520
Don't speak.

473
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,919
Feng Baobao, what did you do to me?

474
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,120
The next time you can't endure it,

475
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,439
flick yourself several times.

476
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,080
When it doesn't hurt anymore…

477
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,080
Be patient.

478
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:28,879
You have to be patient.

479
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,600
Chulan,

480
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,159
I'm getting old.

481
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I don't know how many more years I can still stay by your side.

482
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,280
In the future, you'll be all alone.

483
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,040
Get up and train.

484
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,760
Feng Baobao,

485
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
are you even human?

486
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:54,840
I fainted, you know?

487
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,560
Do you still want me to train?

488
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:57,800
You didn't faint.

489
00:26:57,879 --> 00:26:59,480
I imparted a technique to you.

490
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,080
The formula is inside your brain now.

491
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:03,399
Next, you just need to train according to the formula.

492
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,240
Yes. I suddenly feel like I know different ways of utilizing qi now.

493
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,639
Although your Gold Brilliance Spell

494
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,159
and Lightning Technique are decent,

495
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,480
one month isn't enough

496
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,120
to improve your strength tremendously.

497
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:18,520
Try mine.

498
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,960
What do you call this technique?

499
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,520
I call it Old Farmer Technique.

500
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,879
Old Farmer Technique?

501
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,159
What a strange name.

502
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,720
Feng Baobao, what are you doing?

503
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,480
What am I doing? I'm going to take a bath.

504
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,399
I'm here, you know?

505
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,240
Do you know the meaning of being shy?

506
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,960
Shy?

507
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,960
Indeed.

508
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,159
I think other people said the same thing as you before.

509
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,879
Rather than worrying about this, you should train now. Hurry up.

510
00:27:58,679 --> 00:27:59,800
Hurry and train.

511
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,800
What are you looking at? Hurry and train.

512
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,560
Your qi is flowing in the wrong direction.

513
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:47,679
How did you know?

514
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,399
Why does your qi keep flowing in the wrong direction?

515
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,760
You already did it several times.

516
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,959
It seems like it's flowing downward for no reason.

517
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
How can my qi flow in the right direction

518
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,280
when you're wearing that?

519
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,959
You have a point. I'll get changed then.

520
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:18,720
Ms. Bao, do you know how to feed pigs too?

521
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,520
Yes. Harvest potatoes,

522
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,199
split yellow peas, remove moles,

523
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,800
I know how to do all of them.

524
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:25,159
Ms. Bao,

525
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,159
you're so capable.

526
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,000
What kind of childhood did you have?

527
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,360
Why don't you tell me about it?

528
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,240
I've never been through anything.

529
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,840
I forgot about my past completely.

530
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,320
Don't be so petty.

531
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,040
What about this? I'll tell you

532
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,639
about my childhood.

533
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:41,879
Let me tell you a random story.

534
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:43,040
When I was young,

535
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,320
a boy who was a few years older than me wanted to bully me.

536
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,320
Back then, I wasn't allowed to use my superpowers.

537
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,080
What did I do then? I radiated a strong aura

538
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,399
and scared them so much that they peed their pants.

539
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,080
And let me tell you this.

540
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,199
When I did so,

541
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,320
even the cicadas in the courtyard stopped chirping.

542
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,159
I think they were stunned by my aura too.

543
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,159
Did anything else happen after that?

544
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,399
Of course.

545
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,679
After that, something more interesting happened.

546
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,120
It's in the wrong direction.

547
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,879
It's still flowing in the wrong direction.

548
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,159
I'm already dressed decently.

549
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,199
Even so, you were affected.

550
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,480
Ms. Bao,

551
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,480
I just can't do this.

552
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,439
Your heart must be calm when you utilize your qi.

553
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,639
You have too many thoughts.

554
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,120
You always got distracted

555
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,679
when you almost succeeded.

556
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,360
You couldn't complete the final and the most vital step.

557
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:36,439
The seal existed

558
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,080
in order to help you retain your focus.

559
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,320
But now, it's becoming an obstacle for you.

560
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,280
Adolescent males are troublesome indeed.

561
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:45,320
I don't wish for this to happen either. How is this my fault?

562
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,000
It's not your fault that you have a seal on you.

563
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,080
However, it's your fault that you're affected by it.

564
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:50,679
We have to resolve this issue.

565
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,879
Do you want to do it yourself?

566
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:54,439
Or do you want me to do it?

567
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,679
Ms. Bao!

568
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,439
I can do it! Please trust me one more time!

569
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,919
Wait here for me.

570
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,040
Ms. Bao, what's going on?

571
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,760
Is today your birthday?

572
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,879
Hi, Bao.

573
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:28,280
Bao! You're so pretty.

574
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,120
Hi, Bao.

575
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:39,199
Isn't he cute?

576
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,360
This is Meng,

577
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,959
Tian, Jing,

578
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,520
Han, and Lisa.

579
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,679
-Hello. -They are all friends of Xu Si

580
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,439
and came especially to our party.

581
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,320
You guys get to know each other.

582
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,719
He's pretty handsome.

583
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,199
This is Zhang Chulan, whom I've mentioned to you guys before.

584
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:58,480
His biggest weakness is that

585
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,120
he has been single since he was born.

586
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,600
He's clueless about relationships.

587
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,080
You guys can be more proactive.

588
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:04,879
He's a loyal hunk you can't get elsewhere.

589
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,040
First come, first served!

590
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,280
Since this is a party, I think I should stick with the usual.

591
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,760
Why don't I introduce myself first?

592
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,560
-My name is-- -That's unnecessary.

593
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:15,240
We know everything about you.

594
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,199
Let's go.

595
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,399
-Come on. -Sit.

596
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,560
I heard that you studied overseas.

597
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:27,320
Did you study in an elite school?

598
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:29,240
Elite school?

599
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,719
Drink up. He's so good at this.

600
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,360
I heard that you're good at golf.

601
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:35,959
Can you bring me to your personal golf club?

602
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,280
Golf?

603
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,520
What have you told them?

604
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,919
Cherish your chance.

605
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,360
This is all I can do for you.

606
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:44,080
Come on. Drink up.

607
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,360
Bottoms up.

608
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:47,600
Come on.

609
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,719
He can hold his liquor well.

610
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,679
He's so cute.

611
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,719
Look at his pecs!

612
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,679
He has pecs!

613
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,120
I want to touch it,

614
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,199
He's like my ex.

615
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,000
I want to touch it too.

616
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,639
He has pecs!

617
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,120
Enough.

618
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:13,199
Come on, I'll help you get undressed.

619
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,439
I'm not hot.

620
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,399
No!

621
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,120
-I'll stop. -Don't be shy.

622
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:19,639
We'll help you get undressed later.

623
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,439
Feng Baobao,

624
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,439
who do you take me for?

625
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,280
Are you an idiot?

626
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,480
Look at your own face.

627
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,480
How stupid can you be to believe that some girl

628
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,360
would throw herself at someone like you?

629
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,199
It has been a long time since I saw a useless fool like you.

630
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,679
Get out!

631
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:01,919
He has a terrible temper.

632
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,240
Who do you think you are?

633
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,360
Precisely. We wouldn't even be here

634
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:06,679
if Bao didn't beg us to come.

635
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,400
Look at your house. Stop pretending to be a rich man's son.

636
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,480
-What's wrong with him? -I know, right?

637
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,400
-Pretending to be a rich man's son. -Let's go.

638
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:18,239
A coward.

639
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,360
A useless fool.

640
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,400
I see,

641
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,000
that's how you guys see me.

642
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,319
You tried to use all those fancy words to describe me.

643
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,920
But to you,

644
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,920
I'm still a useless fool that nobody loves,

645
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,520
right?

646
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,000
I thought you always wanted

647
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,960
to remove the seal?

648
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,319
Feng Baobao,

649
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,000
this master-servant game is over.

650
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,720
What did you say?

651
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,520
Before this, my grandfather told me to keep a low profile

652
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,440
because he didn't want me

653
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,400
to join the Outsiders' circle.

654
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,160
That's why I listened to him

655
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,960
and kept a low profile for many years.

656
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,279
Now that my identity has been exposed,

657
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,440
there's no point

658
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,120
in hiding anymore.

659
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,680
And I realize

660
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,319
that the more I try to pretend to be a coward,

661
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,160
the more you guys take it for real.

662
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:46,240
Come back.

663
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:47,799
Do you know the consequences

664
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,360
of walking out of here?

665
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:51,480
I do.

666
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,000
Feng Baobao,

667
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,799
I can't defeat you.

668
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,960
And I know that I might die here

669
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,600
if I keep this up.

670
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:06,799
However, if I don't keep this up,

671
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,440
I'll lose all of my dignity here.

672
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,440
For me,

673
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,319
that's scarier than losing my life.

674
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,440
Come back!

675
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:40,960
Come back!

676
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,720
Come back.

677
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,720
I said, come back!

678
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,440
Master Hong.

679
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,400
I brought some noodles for you today.

680
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Lights on.

681
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:33,720
Master Hong?

682
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,960
What happened?

683
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,440
Master…

684
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,720
Master Hong?

685
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:49,920
Master…

686
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,040
There's no need to avoid them.

687
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,920
Those are just shadows that haven't dissipated.

688
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,880
They can't hurt you.

689
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,359
Who are those?

690
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,640
These are members of the Wudang Sect

691
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,759
and people who tried to steal Qimen Manipulation.

692
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,440
What you're seeing now is a part of the Jiashen Calamity.

693
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,799
After that terrible bloodbath,

694
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,680
Wudang suffered heavy casualties.

695
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:18,480
The person who survived it became the sect leader instead.

696
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,759
Some members went into hiding

697
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,200
because they were afraid.

698
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:23,359
However, some brought juniors like us with them

699
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,560
to fight the enemy off.

700
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,120
We survived the Jiashen Calamity

701
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,799
and protected Wudang.

702
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:32,440
Wang Ye,

703
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,080
your phantasmagoria is extraordinary.

704
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,200
It contains a far greater meaning

705
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:39,640
than you can imagine.

706
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,000
You achieved something

707
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,640
in several months,

708
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,720
something we couldn't achieve for several decades.

709
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:49,560
You're the chosen one.

710
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,520
You shouldn't be trapped by your phantasmagoria.

711
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,359
You need to learn how to control your phantasmagoria.

712
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,319
This is your destiny

713
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,960
as well as your duty.

714
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,000
Big Ape is here as well.

715
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,720
Don't you wish to check out his abilities?

716
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,120
But I don't see it anywhere.

717
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,040
This is your phantasmagoria.

718
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,640
Don't look with your eyes.

719
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,600
Look with your heart.

720
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,960
It has been several decades.

721
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,759
Everyone misunderstood you.

722
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:36,720
ZHOU SHENG, ONE OF THE CREATORS OF THE EIGHT SUPREMES

723
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:40,839
Only a few people really know you.

724
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,520
Don't just look.

725
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,839
Learn with all your heart.

726
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,640
QIMEN MANIPULATION

727
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,560
Qimen Manipulation?

728
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,799
Big Ape,

729
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,080
did you see that?

730
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,839
You have a successor now!

731
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,560
There's finally a successor

732
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,359
to Qimen Manipulation!

733
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
Dry noodles, huh?

734
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,480
-Master Hong. -It has been decades since I last had it.

735
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,960
It smells more delicious than meat

736
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,920
when you mix it.

737
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
Master Hong,

738
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,680
let me mix it for you.

739
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,640
I trapped myself in this cave for several decades

740
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,400
just so I could preserve a vain hope.

741
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,480
How pathetic.

742
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,759
What a pathetic story.

743
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
Back then,

744
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:51,400
Big Ape taught the three of us

745
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,319
Qimen Manipulation.

746
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
He did it out of good intentions.

747
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,080
However, he didn't know

748
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,440
that the standards that were natural to him

749
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,040
were impossible for us to achieve

750
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,080
even if we were to try our best.

751
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:10,440
I only figured out what it meant

752
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,120
when I saw you.

753
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,839
It's all because

754
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,440
our obsessions were too deep.

755
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,520
Wang Ye,

756
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,240
you aren't attached to gains and losses.

757
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,759
You could leave the phantasmagoria anytime you like.

758
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,040
You will definitely

759
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,640
put Qimen Manipulation to good use.

760
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,040
I've been guarding this secret on Big Ape's behalf for so many years.

761
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,279
I only understood what it meant

762
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,880
when I couldn't grab hold of anything.

763
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:40,440
Moving on from it

764
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,359
is the way to obtain it.

765
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,520
I messed up.

766
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,920
I messed up.
