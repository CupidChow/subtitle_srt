1
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,279
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:31,520
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

3
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,839
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,080
LYU'S FAMILY MANSION

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,000
He's just a wretched animal that must be killed.

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,400
This wretched animal killed his younger sister,

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,680
my sister!

8
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,120
Will you speak or not?

9
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,080
Great-grandpa.

10
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:09,560
How did it go?

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,479
This kid erased all of his memories that are related to Gong Qing

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
and Sinister Pleasure.

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,240
You may go upstairs first.

14
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,240
Lyu Liang, you're pretty stubborn, aren't you?

15
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:38,240
Hurry up and hand over Zhang Xilin's and Tian Jinzhong's memories.

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,280
What exactly are the Eight Supremes about?

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,600
Back then, you escaped from the Lyu family

18
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:47,640
and sought Sinister Pleasure's protection.

19
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,920
You betrayed your clan.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,720
Your crime is worthy of death.

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,759
However,

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,920
as long as you tell me the clues

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,399
related to the Eight Supremes,

24
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,240
I'll spare you.

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,360
Great-grandpa,

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,000
I escaped from the family in the first place

27
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:03,559
because someone

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
framed me for killing Lyu Huan.

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,240
All these years,

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,759
I've been through plenty of things

31
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,120
and told a lot of lies.

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,079
However, I never lied when it came to my little sister's death!

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,239
Lyu Huan's death

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,320
has nothing to do with me!

35
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,160
I watched over you as you grew up.

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,280
I know your character well enough.

37
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:27,519
Even if you did kill Lyu Huan,

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,959
I'm sure you didn't do it on purpose.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,200
I didn't kill her!

40
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,239
To be honest,

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,000
I wish that you weren't the culprit.

42
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,079
Every drop of blood from our bloodline,

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,280
even if it's from a ridiculous guy like you,

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,880
I do cherish them with all my heart.

45
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,519
I hope

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,760
you can hand over your memories of the Eight Supremes to me.

47
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,519
I will make you a member of the Lyu family again.

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Great-grandpa.

49
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,959
Are you willing to tell me

50
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:07,440
everything you know?

51
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,399
I am.

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
However, Great-grandpa,

53
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,799
can you

54
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,600
answer me a question?

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,000
Go ahead.

56
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,200
I saw Double Quan Palm

57
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,079
from Tian Jinzhong's memories.

58
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,399
Great-grandpa,

59
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,200
why does Soul Whisperer

60
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,720
resemble Double Quan Palm so much?

61
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,519
What have you seen?

62
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,799
That's the deepest secret of the Lyu family.

63
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Now, you're all grown up.

64
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,760
It's time for you to know.

65
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,880
Thank you, Great-grandpa.

66
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:11,679
Lyu Liang.

67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,680
I thought you wanted to know the relationship

68
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,920
between Double Quan Palm and Soul Whisperer?

69
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,240
Great-grandpa?

70
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:31,320
I'll tell you about it right now.

71
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,360
This is the deepest secret of the Lyu family.

72
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,560
You have to keep it.

73
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,640
Lyu Huan,

74
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,560
where exactly are you?

75
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,280
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,440
I have no way to seek the truth now.

77
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:15,520
NDT

78
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,159
NDT Express has experienced massive delivery mishaps lately.

79
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,880
Their customers are dissatisfied with their service.

80
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,719
As an established delivery company,

81
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,640
do they actually have their customers' interests at heart?

82
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:27,840
Miss, NDT customers are waiting for responses to the recent delivery mishaps.

83
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,800
Do you have any comments?

84
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:36,080
This incident has impacted the company's reputation negatively.

85
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,760
The company has decided to halt its operation for three days.

86
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,359
Chulan?

87
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,400
Chulan?

88
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,479
Yes, Xu San?

89
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,320
We're in a meeting. Can you be serious?

90
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,520
Where were we just now?

91
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,240
The company's operation will be halted for three days.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,080
This is great.

93
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,359
Xu San,

94
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,280
I've been insulted and reprimanded by our customers for the past few days.

95
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:05,000
And now, I can finally take a break.

96
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,039
Alright. Meeting dismissed.

97
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,520
Chulan, Baobao, stay here.

98
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,599
Xu San, what will we be having for lunch?

99
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,760
Seafood? Or BBQ?

100
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,960
It's my treat.

101
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,400
The company told me to investigate the cause.

102
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,479
I've decided to let you and Baobao proceed with the investigation.

103
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,719
Xu San,

104
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,320
I'm the champion of the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

105
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,280
But here I am, delivering parcels for you.

106
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,599
Besides,

107
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,280
it's an issue with the company's system.

108
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,919
We aren't programmers.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
How can we investigate this case?

110
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,599
The system is fine.

111
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,640
Someone hacked into our system from outside

112
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:43,280
and stole vital intel.

113
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,960
Anyway, I've said it before.

114
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,359
This has negatively impacted our reputation.

115
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,960
The higher-ups are paying close attention to this.

116
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,560
You two better not drop the ball.

117
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,039
But how can we investigate the case?

118
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,200
I found you two a helper.

119
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
She'll contact you guys.

120
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:11,359
Can I take a look?

121
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:24,080
Ms. Bao,

122
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,359
that's not edible.

123
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,440
It's so hard.

124
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,520
TEMP OF NDT NORTHEAST CHINA, GAO ERZHUANG,
HAS SENT YOU A FRIEND REQUEST

125
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,320
Is this the helper Xu San mentioned?

126
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,760
ACCEPT

127
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,880
Temporary employee

128
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,359
Gao Erzhuang?

129
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,919
Is it a girl?

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,880
I'VE ALREADY TRACKED DOWN
THE IP ADDRESS AND LOCATION OF THE HACKER.

131
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:47,919
She has a cute profile picture.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,320
I'LL SEND THE INFO AND ADDRESS TO YOU TWO.

133
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,880
Are you free right now?

134
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,120
Let's discuss it on the phone.

135
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,840
CHANGFENG STREET NO. 63, RRES CYBERCAFE

136
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,320
She is being so mysterious.

137
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,560
Ms. Bao,

138
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,760
let's go.

139
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,719
Gao Erzhuang wants to meet us here.

140
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,919
I feel like something's off.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,440
Your seats are over there.

142
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,919
San recommended her.

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,560
And she's a temp like me.

144
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,960
I'm sure she's reliable.

145
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,319
No. 17.

146
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,360
Over here.

147
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,640
And then?

148
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,679
MS. BAO, TURN ON THE PC.

149
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,360
Turn on the PC.

150
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,319
MS. BAO, TURN ON THE CAMERA.

151
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,640
Turn on the camera.

152
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:48,199
Erzhuang says she wants to find someone.

153
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,680
"Qin Peng, 23 years old,

154
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,000
programmer and an Outsider.

155
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,920
He's the one who stole the company's intel.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,079
I've already sent his details to you guys.

157
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,400
Take him to the company and interrogate him after this.

158
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,199
See who's the mastermind behind him."

159
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:14,360
So we just came here to turn on the PC for you?

160
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:15,480
Is that all?

161
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,680
That's right.

162
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,319
Are you too poor to surf the Internet?

163
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,959
Or are you still a kid?

164
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,000
Why must we come all the way here for a trivial matter like this?

165
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,079
I'M SO ANGRY!

166
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,640
Ms. Bao,

167
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,000
she's pretty capable.

168
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:36,199
But she has a terrible temper.

169
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,319
Zhang Chulan,

170
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,920
do not badmouth me behind my back!

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Ms. Bao,

172
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,520
she is right beside us.

173
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,400
She can hear us.

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,120
Zhang Chulan, stop looking for me.

175
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,920
I'm right beside you.

176
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:03,760
What a pervert! Who is this guy?

177
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,360
-Who is that? -Who's this?

178
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,480
Here you go!

179
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:11,800
My dear lady,

180
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,640
it's all my fault, okay?

181
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,120
I don't know how old I am either.

182
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:26,400
Let me count.

183
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:28,360
Ms. Bao,

184
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:30,480
don't reveal everything to an outsider.

185
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,720
We don't know her.

186
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,079
Return the phone to Ms. Bao!

187
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,880
You think you're capable, huh?

188
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,640
Come out if you dare!

189
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,680
Show yourself!

190
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,640
Come out, Invisible Girl!

191
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,839
Come out!

192
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,079
Why are you shouting?

193
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:03,640
It's nothing.

194
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,520
I've already interrogated him.

195
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,360
That programmer named Qin Peng,

196
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,360
he only joined Sinister Pleasure last month.

197
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:13,199
This was the first mission he received from his superiors.

198
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,199
He didn't even know

199
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,800
that he was hacking into our company's system.

200
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,839
So who gave him the order?

201
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,000
He said he forgot.

202
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,240
He forgot?

203
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:21,719
He truly forgot everything.

204
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,959
I used all kinds of ways

205
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,160
to make him tell me the mastermind's name, gender, and appearance.

206
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,520
But he couldn't remember anything.

207
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,640
Could it be that it's related to Lyu Liang?

208
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:34,360
The other hackers I caught

209
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:35,560
were just like Qin Peng.

210
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
They forgot everything about the person who gave them the task.

211
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,719
Did someone tamper with his memory?

212
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:46,319
It should be the effect of a certain superpower.

213
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,760
I'll report this to our higher-ups.

214
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,240
You guys can stay out of this now.

215
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:50,680
-But-- -No more buts.

216
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,160
We already caught the suspect.

217
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,760
You and Baobao can take a break now.

218
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,120
You may go.

219
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,079
You should leave too.

220
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,640
Continue to investigate how Qin Peng's memories were wiped away.

221
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,400
Are you sure he's asleep?

222
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,520
Don't worry.

223
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,160
I spiked him. He'll be unconscious until tomorrow afternoon.

224
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,480
Ms. Bao.

225
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,640
It's fine as long as I don't take the pork belly.

226
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,760
Why do you need his glasses?

227
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:46,160
Do you have nearsightedness too?

228
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,120
Whenever we interacted with Erzhuang,

229
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,520
it felt like she was by our side.

230
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,000
She knew everything about us.

231
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,439
It was like she could see us.

232
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,120
However, we couldn't see her.

233
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:59,560
Xu San was the only one who could interact with her in person.

234
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,319
So according to my deduction,

235
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,319
I'm sure Xu San has a method

236
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
to communicate with her.

237
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,800
I've observed him for some time

238
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,280
and I finally found it.

239
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,520
This is the secret to communicating with Erzhuang.

240
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,719
Let me see

241
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,000
what Gao Erzhuang looks like.

242
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,599
Zhang Chulan,

243
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,160
you look so ugly with glasses.

244
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,400
You look so ugly with glasses.

245
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,120
I knew you weren't human!

246
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:31,800
Speak for yourself.

247
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,240
Are you talking to me?

248
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:34,959
Nope.

249
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,280
So,

250
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,719
are you an AR or AI?

251
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,640
Or are you a Pokemon?

252
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:45,319
Erzhuang,

253
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,560
since when you were here?

254
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,599
Are you hungry or not?

255
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,959
Nope.

256
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,280
Why does he look so silly?

257
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,640
He's pretty silly.

258
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,800
He's not as intelligent as me.

259
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,240
Erzhuang, you're actually

260
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:09,520
the central system of NDT,

261
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,640
right?

262
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:12,839
-Erzhuang? -So you knew everything

263
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,000
from the system being hacked to our info being stolen,

264
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:16,880
including the delivery mishap, right?

265
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,000
Handling the delivery information

266
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,920
is just a small part of my task.

267
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:24,520
So why did Sinister Pleasure

268
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,760
steal all those intel?

269
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,880
What's their motive?

270
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,280
Why should I tell you?

271
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,520
Erzhuang?

272
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:32,439
What's in it for me if I tell you?

273
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:35,760
What do you want?

274
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,319
That's tough.

275
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,880
What about this?

276
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,719
Choose your favorite dish

277
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
and describe its taste to me.

278
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,160
The more specific it is, the better.

279
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,439
You…

280
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,839
You're not kidding, right?

281
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,839
Erzhuang?

282
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,040
Look at me.

283
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,479
I can't even take food.

284
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,680
Are you not willing to do so?

285
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,240
I'll leave then.

286
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:58,400
Don't leave.

287
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
What does it taste like?

288
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,040
It's a little salty.

289
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,079
Is that all?

290
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,520
It's tender,
crispy,

291
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,880
and has a satisfying meaty taste.

292
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,360
It melts in your mouth.

293
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,880
It's so smooth and sweet.

294
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,040
What a pleasant aftertaste.

295
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,439
This isn't just an ordinary skewer.

296
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:47,959
It's the taste of life.

297
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,719
As I continue to chew on it,

298
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,360
I tasted its rich flavor.

299
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:57,439
It's as if I'm on the plains right now.

300
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,079
I see the shepherds herding their sheep

301
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,040
as wild horses run across the plains.

302
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,160
The grass bends low, the cattle and sheep, to show.

303
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,400
Wait.

304
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:11,439
I also taste the distant mountains and forests.

305
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,839
You described the taste of my lamb skewer.

306
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:17,479
That's enough.

307
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,439
I finally know how it feels to taste something.

308
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,479
I'll tell you about it then.

309
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,719
The intel that Sinister Pleasure has stolen

310
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,400
is related to the creators of the Eight Supremes.

311
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,319
CREATORS OF THE EIGHT SUPREMES

312
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,359
It contains their personal details,

313
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,880
date of birth, address, and so on.

314
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,520
Everything related to them is in it.

315
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,560
Why do they need it?

316
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,359
I have no idea why.

317
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:39,640
I got hold of another piece of news.

318
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,560
Sinister Pleasure has a new sect leader.

319
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,760
A new sect leader?

320
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,240
I thought they only had interim leaders before this?

321
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:47,359
It's a new sect leader,

322
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,319
not an interim leader.

323
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,079
Interim leader? New sect leader?

324
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,240
Make yourself clear.

325
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,199
That's all the info I can provide to you

326
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,719
for the food description you gave me.

327
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,520
-Goodbye. -Don't--

328
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,199
She just left.

329
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,760
Why did the sect leader of Sinister Pleasure

330
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,319
steal intel related to the Eight Supremes?

331
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:08,919
What secret is hidden behind the Eight Supremes?

332
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,359
I could've asked Grandmaster about this if he wasn't on a retreat.

333
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
But he is on a retreat now.

334
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,680
Who else can I ask about this?

335
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,119
-Hello? -Linglong, it's me.

336
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,639
I've missed you. It has been months since we last met.

337
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,200
Me too.

338
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,840
Who's calling you?

339
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:37,840
Who is it?

340
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,159
Chulan.

341
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,360
What? Chulan?

342
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:47,520
Why are you being so close to him?

343
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,800
Stay away from him!

344
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,760
No one in Mount Longhu

345
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,560
is a decent being!

346
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,840
All of them are dishonest.

347
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,080
All of them are liars!

348
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,320
Linglong,

349
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:00,639
tell Mr. Lu

350
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,840
that I met Grandmaster a few days ago.

351
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:04,800
He felt sorry.

352
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:05,760
What about this?

353
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,560
I'll visit Mr. Lu tomorrow

354
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:08,879
and apologize to him on my Grandmaster's behalf.

355
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,040
Are you saying your grandmaster wants to apologize to me?

356
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,200
Sure. Come then.

357
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,639
I'll see how your grandmaster apologizes.

358
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,360
Chulan.

359
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:27,919
Here's my advice.

360
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,720
You better not spout nonsense when you see my Grandmaster.

361
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,840
He's in a bad mood lately.

362
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:32,040
I know.

363
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,440
He had a misunderstanding with my Grandmaster, right?

364
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,399
It's not just that.

365
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:39,040
I don't know what's wrong

366
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,000
with these elderly folks lately.

367
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,840
He visited Taoist Fang Dongtian some days ago.

368
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,280
Taoist Fang passed away just a few days afterward.

369
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,280
I also heard

370
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,879
that Taoist Lu from Mount Wudang

371
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,760
had just passed away too.

372
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,320
The survivors of the Year of Jiashen are getting fewer and fewer.

373
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,840
But don't worry.

374
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,879
I'll definitely make your grandmaster happy.

375
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,800
I'll drink with him later.

376
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,159
Ms. Bao, I'll leave that to you.

377
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,679
No problem.

378
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,120
Good.

379
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,840
Great-grandpa, Zhang Chulan is here!

380
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,000
Come.

381
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,440
Great-grandpa, Zhang Chulan is here.

382
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,560
They're here?

383
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:19,840
Feng Baobao is here too.

384
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:21,520
Linglong,

385
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,360
entertain that lass for me.

386
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
I need to speak with Zhang Chulan in private.

387
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,879
Ms. Bao, let's go and play with my cat in my room.

388
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,879
Come on.

389
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,040
You do look like a member of Zhang Zhiwei's gang.

390
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,679
You look detestable no matter how I look at you!

391
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
Mr. Lu.

392
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:59,080
Mr. Lu,

393
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:00,800
Xu San and Xu Si told me

394
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:02,840
that the Ten Elders dared not speak

395
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,040
when they saw Grandmaster in the Ganbei Grassland.

396
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,679
Mr. Lu, you are the mightiest man there.

397
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,879
Only you were a match for my grandmaster.

398
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,200
You two were equal in prowess.

399
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,040
You two didn't even blink after fighting for five days and nights.

400
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,240
You two fought until the blue skies--

401
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,600
Enough!

402
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:15,560
Stop flattering me!

403
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:17,840
Your grandmaster could kill me in one blow!

404
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,560
I've already straightened out my thoughts.

405
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,560
I'm not angry at the fact that he hit me.

406
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,240
I'm angry that he sealed himself away on Mount Longhu

407
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,000
without caring for his old buddies.

408
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,600
Tell me.

409
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,399
I'm already at this age.

410
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,360
I…

411
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,639
Look at

412
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,679
the number of friends I have left.

413
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,800
Look.

414
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,800
These are my only friends now.

415
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,120
Mr. Lu,

416
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,080
if you're angry about that,

417
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,919
I can be your friend

418
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,760
if my Grandmaster cannot leave the mountain.

419
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,000
Do you want to be my friend?

420
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,200
Forget about it.

421
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,840
Your cunning nature would have landed me in trouble

422
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,080
if I were several decades younger.

423
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,760
Enough. Just tell me.

424
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,760
What do you need?

425
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,320
I truly came here just to visit you.

426
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,360
I brought you some supplements too.

427
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,159
May you live for 100 years.

428
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,600
Shut up!

429
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:17,679
I'm already 110 years old!

430
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,440
Do you still wish for me to live for 100 years?

431
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,040
Then, may you live for 200 years.

432
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,520
Good.

433
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,600
Good.

434
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,399
Tell me.

435
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,440
What do you want to ask?

436
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:39,600
You're so straightforward

437
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,360
that I became too embarrassed to ask.

438
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,159
Initially, I wanted to ask you

439
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,520
about the Jiashen Calamity.

440
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,679
But I know you won't tell me about it.

441
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,840
That's why I wish to know

442
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,040
if you can tell me about the Eight Supremes instead.

443
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,399
Speaking of the Eight Supremes,

444
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,800
it all started with the 36 Thieves.

445
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,120
Ms. Bao,

446
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,040
you don't play with cats like that.

447
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:17,000
Come.

448
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:26,760
Is it that simple?

449
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,520
Ms. Bao, why were you guys looking for great-grandpa?

450
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,080
Did something happen to the company?

451
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,439
Let me try.

452
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,120
This is the name list of the 36 Thieves.

453
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,800
You're very close with the Feng family.

454
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,879
I'm sure you know Feng Tianyang, who is Feng Zhenghao's grandfather.

455
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,840
I've also witnessed their family technique,

456
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,159
Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

457
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,960
Feng Tianyang offered this name list to Wang Ai's family

458
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,679
when they captured him.

459
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,560
Infinite Heavenly Talisman

460
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:06,520
was imparted to me

461
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,200
by my buddy, Zheng Zibu, before he died.

462
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,679
But back then,

463
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
the so-called Eight Supremes,

464
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,159
it was just a name.

465
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,840
We had no idea

466
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:16,320
what the abilities were like.

467
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:18,240
Chulan,

468
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,520
in the Outsiders' world,

469
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,159
an ability can only be referred to as a supreme

470
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,600
after at least 100 years of polishing

471
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:28,520
and passing down.

472
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,360
However, these eight people

473
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:33,200
actually produced the Eight Supremes overnight.

474
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,280
I'm sure there's a catch to it.

475
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,040
In order to extract the truth about the Eight Supremes

476
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,320
from Feng Tianyang,

477
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:42,560
many well-established figures

478
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:44,240
gathered at that place.

479
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,280
Initially, they thought

480
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,919
they could easily extract the truth

481
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,080
just by interrogating Feng Tianyang.

482
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,919
However, no one expected

483
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:56,720
that all the elders

484
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,639
PHYSICIAN MIAO JIANG

485
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,320
would fail the interrogation.

486
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,159
The previous Chief Celestial Taoist,

487
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,480
your grandmaster's master,

488
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,760
was there as well.

489
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,480
He tried to persuade the rest

490
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,879
to stop the interrogation.

491
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,159
However, they wouldn't hear him out.

492
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,000
I shall not conspire with shallow beings like you all.

493
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,080
Farewell.

494
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,000
You!

495
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
They spent half a month interrogating him,

496
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:24,760
yet they couldn't find out

497
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,720
where the Eight Supremes came from

498
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,080
and what the truth was.

499
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,760
In the end,

500
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,560
they only got the name list of the 36 Thieves.

501
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,520
Back then,

502
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,760
only nine out of the 36 Thieves

503
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,560
managed to survive.

504
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:40,040
I wrote their names on the last page of the name list.

505
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,360
Those nine people

506
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,040
mastered the Eight Supremes.

507
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:45,840
Nine people?

508
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,399
But weren't there only eight supremes?

509
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,800
Initially, there were nine of them.

510
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:52,560
Eight of them mastered their supremes.

511
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:55,760
And they also gave a name to their supremes.

512
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,399
The last one was trying his best to invent a supreme.

513
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,040
So did he manage to invent his own supreme?

514
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,200
It was Wu Gensheng.

515
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,560
Wu Gensheng's skills

516
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,600
were already incomprehensible.

517
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:12,199
His technique was on par with the Eight Supremes.

518
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,080
It's because

519
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,760
he was the number one martial artist in the world back then.

520
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,360
Doesn't that make him as powerful as my Grandmaster?

521
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:26,159
Wu Gensheng?

522
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,960
Is Wu even a valid surname?

523
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,600
Wu Gensheng is a nickname he gave himself.

524
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:34,919
No one knew what his real name was.

525
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,280
He was a madman.

526
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,520
He said he was born from the celestial root.

527
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,320
He had no worries, doubts,

528
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:43,480
temperaments, roots,

529
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,919
past, or future.

530
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,919
Even his skills are things of their own without any recognized source.

531
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:53,120
Some people

532
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,679
said that he was born from a corpse.

533
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,919
Some people said

534
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,240
he was an illegitimate son who was abandoned by a noble family.

535
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,520
What made people notice him

536
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,120
was his position as the sect leader of Sinister Pleasure

537
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:07,199
after the seat

538
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,439
had been vacant for centuries.

539
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,000
Since then,

540
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,199
those madmen

541
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,960
had a leader.

542
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,720
The sect leader of Sinister Pleasure?

543
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,199
What?

544
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,439
It's nothing.

545
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,240
You see, our company's system was hacked a few days ago.

546
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,760
After our investigation, we found out that the mastermind

547
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,080
was the new sect leader of Sinister Pleasure.

548
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,280
He even stole intel

549
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,159
related to the Eight Supremes from our company.

550
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,520
Something's wrong.

551
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,560
Wu Gensheng vanished

552
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:37,879
after the Jiashen Calamity.

553
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,879
His whereabouts were nowhere to be found.

554
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:41,480
After that,

555
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,879
every leader

556
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,520
of Sinister Pleasure

557
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,199
only dared refer to themselves as interim leaders.

558
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,879
No one ever dared refer to themselves as the sect leader.

559
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
Could it be that he has made a return?

560
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:53,679
What?

561
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,840
I was just saying.

562
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,600
How old is he then?

563
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,439
He's several decades older than me.

564
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,280
I think he should be dead by now.

565
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,240
I do wish that he's still alive.

566
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:14,720
Wu Gensheng!

567
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,080
I have to kill you myself!

568
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,040
You're welcome to try it anytime.

569
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,199
Ms. Bao,

570
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,399
Linglong, let's have a hotpot.

571
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,159
Zhang Chulan.

572
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,159
Didn't you say you were going to drink with Grandpa?

573
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,600
I have to drive later.

574
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:47,399
Cheers.

575
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
Come.

576
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
Let's drink.

577
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,159
Mr. Lu.

578
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,600
The Eight Supremes have now resurfaced.

579
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,679
Zhou Sheng imparted Qimen Manipulation to Wang Ye.

580
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
Zheng Zibu imparted Infinite Heavenly Talisman to you.

581
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,879
INFINITE HEAVENLY TALISMAN

582
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,040
And you've imparted it to Zhang Lingyu.

583
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,840
Feng Tianyang's Dispatch of Detained Spirits

584
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,040
were used by both the Feng and Wang family.

585
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,040
These three supremes

586
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,520
have been made known to the world.

587
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,760
However, there are five other supremes that haven't been made known.

588
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,080
Duanmu Ying's Double Quan Palm.

589
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,600
Ma Benzai's Divine Forge,

590
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,120
Gu Jiting's Daluo Dongguan,

591
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:27,120
Ruan Feng's Six Vault Immortal Thievery,

592
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:29,560
and my grandfather's Qi Apotheosis.

593
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:32,720
What are these five supremes about?

594
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:36,080
After those eight people mastered the Eight Supremes,

595
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,159
they only revealed the names of their supremes

596
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,600
to one other.

597
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,639
As for their abilities,

598
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,439
even they didn't know.

599
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,080
Mr. Lu,

600
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,120
back then, capable martial artists like you

601
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:49,080
could be found everywhere in the Outsiders' world.

602
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:51,919
Why are the eight of them the only ones who mastered the Eight Supremes?

603
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,080
I did hear this from Feng Tianyang before.

604
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:57,879
They mastered the Eight Supremes

605
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:00,919
in a place called the Valley of 24 Terms.

606
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,560
He said

607
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:05,000
that there were once deities who made their ascensions there.

608
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,600
And they left behind a mysterious qi formation.

609
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,639
A qi formation?

610
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,040
That's right. Through man's manipulation,

611
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,560
the flow of qi is altered

612
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:14,560
and superpowers can be accessed.

613
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,840
He said the Valley of 24 Terms

614
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:17,879
could defy fate,

615
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,120
revive the dead,

616
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:20,679
even help one to ascend to deityhood.

617
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,840
Revive the dead?

618
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,720
Mr. Lu,

619
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,040
does such a magical place truly exist?

620
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,280
Why don't you bring me there?

621
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,439
I don't know where it is.

622
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:40,360
Elderly folks like us

623
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:42,000
searched the entire world for it.

624
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,240
But we couldn't find the Valley of 24 Terms.

625
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,720
Forget about us.

626
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,320
Even a resourceful and powerful company

627
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,439
like NDT

628
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,679
couldn't find the place

629
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,760
after decades of research.

630
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,600
I think

631
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,760
Feng Tianyang made up that lie

632
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,600
so that he could survive.

633
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,480
If that was a lie he made up,

634
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,800
how could there be eight people

635
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:06,240
mastering the Eight Supremes at the same time?

636
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,120
Mr. Lu, let's drink.

637
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,959
Come.

638
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,760
By the way, Mr. Lu,

639
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,199
didn't you say

640
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,760
they used everything they could to interrogate Feng Tianyang?

641
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,800
So why didn't they use the Lyu family's Soul Whisperer on him?

642
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,280
Forget about it.

643
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,959
The Lyu family hadn't invented the Soul Whisperer

644
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,480
before the Jiashen Calamity.

645
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,280
They didn't have Soul Whisperer back then?

646
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
So when did they invent Soul Whisperer?

647
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,879
Boy, here's my advice.

648
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:51,240
You better stop meddling with the Lyu family's affairs

649
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,159
if you wish to live.

650
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,679
This wretched animal killed his younger sister,

651
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,720
my sister!

652
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,439
PROGRESS TO REVEALING THE TRUTH AT 70%

653
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,840
LYU'S FAMILY MANSION

654
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,360
Something is off with the Lyu family.

655
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,280
They're suspected

656
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,600
of breaking the Outsiders' regulations many times.

657
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:27,159
However, NDT couldn't find any direct evidence related to them.

658
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,600
You guys have to practice caution.

659
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,480
This yard is so grand.

660
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,600
It's much larger than Doggy's village.

661
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,919
Of course.

662
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,800
This is the Ten Elders' territory after all.

663
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,360
It's so late.

664
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,840
Why aren't they sleeping?

665
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,159
Mr. Lyu?

666
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,919
Mr. Lyu?

667
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,600
What happened?

668
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,040
Where's Lyu Liang?

669
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,719
Great-grandpa!

670
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,760
I'm scared!

671
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,439
Great-grandpa!

672
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,639
I'm scared!

673
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:39,080
Useless fool!

674
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,520
You couldn't master the Soul Whisperer!

675
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,240
How dare you scream in agony!

676
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
I'm scared!

677
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,560
-Great-grandpa! -What kind of place is this?

678
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:50,560
I'm scared!

679
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,760
Come. Let's check it out.

680
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,400
I think I've seen this somewhere before.

681
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,560
This belongs to Lyu Liang.

682
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,480
Where is he then?

683
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,480
I saw him

684
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,440
being captured by the Lyu family myself.

685
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:46,839
This is an important memory that belongs to your grandfather and me.

686
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,759
It holds the truth behind the Jiashen Calamity.

687
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,600
But I'm the only one who can open it.

688
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:56,880
PROGRESS TO REVEALING THE TRUTH AT 80%

689
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:03,799
The sect leader is here.

690
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,640
Everyone stands in line

691
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,279
to welcome our new sect leader.

692
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,319
Everyone,

693
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,720
I've retrieved the core intel related to the Eight Supremes.

694
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,240
Would you like to join me

695
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:34,720
in recreating

696
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,799
the true Sinister Pleasure?

697
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,200
SECT LEADER OF SINISTER PLEASURE
