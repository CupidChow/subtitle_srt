1
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,279
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

3
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:33,920
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,280
Nan.

5
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:50,760
What?

6
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:55,279
FENG SHAYAN, JIA ZHENGLIANG

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,279
The first match,

8
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,640
Feng Shayan versus Jia Zhengliang.

9
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:01,640
Contestants, please enter the arena.

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,000
Hello, son?

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,000
Mom, you sure have great timing.

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,800
Why did you choose to call me now?

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,880
Have you eaten? Don't just eat meat, okay?

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,360
I eat fruit and vegetables every day.

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,600
-I don't just eat meat. -Hey.

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,360
You have to eat a balanced diet.

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,679
-A balanced diet, okay?  -What?

18
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,560
-Okay. -Don't just eat meat.

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,039
-I don't. -And remember.

20
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,039
Never use the hotel's toothbrushes. They're unhygienic.

21
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,960
I didn't use them.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,679
Mom, it feels like you think

23
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,560
I can't survive without you.

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,280
-I'm just worried.  -Hey.
What? What did you say?

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,240
Can we start now?

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,960
Let's end this quickly.

27
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,320
I'll show Dad my true capability.

28
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,759
You've never been so far away in your life.

29
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:44,679
-I'm worried.  -I can survive.

30
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,199
What about your meals?

31
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,880
You're wasting my time.

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,360
Can we start now?

33
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,880
Do you want to kill me?

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,800
You can punch me, but don't break my phone.

35
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,679
Do you know that my mother will overthink things

36
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:01,679
if I hang up on her?

37
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,600
She'll think I'm hurt or hiding things from her.

38
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:05,280
She thinks the worst

39
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
whenever I'm not by her side.

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,600
This…

41
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,280
Give me your phone.

42
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:11,200
Come on.

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,840
Are you insane?

44
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,200
Who brings a phone into a fight?

45
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,120
I do!

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,840
My mom will think I'm hurt if I don't answer her call.

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,640
Well, forget it.

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,120
Can anyone lend me their phone?

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,640
Can anyone lend me their phone?

50
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:31,680
Kid,

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,160
here.
Thank you.

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,480
Catch.

53
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,320
Thank you, sir.

54
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,680
Don't mention it.

55
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,560
Mom.

56
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,000
My son, why did you hang up?

57
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,120
-Why is he on the phone again? -Why is he on the phone again?

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,320
-Are you in a match?  -Yes.

59
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,959
Don't get yourself hurt, okay?

60
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,200
You must be careful.

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,959
Stop nagging. My opponent is waiting for me.

62
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,120
Will the match begin soon?

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,120
Yes.
Is the opponent strong?

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,880
It's a girl. She's hard to deal with.

65
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,160
Is she pretty?

66
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,720
Pass the phone to her.

67
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,679
Maybe I can get you a wife.

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,959
No way.

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,239
I'm not a kid. Don't do that.

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,200
Son, be a good boy.

71
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,120
I'm not two years old. I'm over 20 now.

72
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
-It's a chance. -Fine.

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,239
Hurry. Pass it to her.

74
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:14,239
Hurry up!

75
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,120
Hey, my mother needs to speak with you.

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,200
Are they dating now?

77
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,320
Hello, girl.

78
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,640
I'm Liangliang's mother.

79
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,679
Hello, ma'am.

80
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,840
Do you have a boyfriend?

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,320
What do you think about my son?

82
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,760
I know he's not obedient.

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,359
Yes. Boys mature much later than girls.

84
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,000
He might still be in his rebellious phase.

85
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,079
That's right.

86
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,480
But my son is excellent in other aspects.

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,040
Consider him, okay?

88
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:49,119
Visit the Jia Village

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,519
when the match is over, okay?

90
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,799
Okay, ma'am.

91
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,959
Your mother told me to all-out destroy you

92
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,519
so you can head home earlier.

93
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,839
Am I even your biological son?

94
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,480
I'm finally out of the village for once.

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,399
My son, be a good boy.

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,679
Let the lady win.

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,600
Show her your gentlemanly demeanor.

98
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:10,079
Win her heart and bring her home.

99
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,119
All right, I got it.

100
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,239
-I know. Bye. -Remember, don't use your full strength!

101
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,479
Can we begin now?

102
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:54,000
It's time for you to admit defeat after wasting so much time.

103
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,200
Your matchmaking partner is still waiting for you.

104
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,560
I can't just return home like this.

105
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,200
My next match

106
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,000
will be against Feng Baobao.

107
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,240
I have to avenge my brother.

108
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,919
If you truly wish to seek revenge against Feng Baobao,

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,080
you should try your best instead.

110
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,719
These two are quite hard to deal with.

111
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
But it's not like I don't stand a chance.

112
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,919
Ms. Bao.

113
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,440
Can you truly do that in secret

114
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
without leaving any trace?

115
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:46,880
I've done this plenty of times.

116
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,359
You don't need to worry.

117
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,640
I'm sorry for the trouble, then.

118
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,000
Although it's a little unkind,

119
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,200
we should let Taoist Wang stay in the pit for some time.

120
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,719
Leave it to me.

121
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:00,440
Let's go.

122
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,240
Aren't you watching the match?

123
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,960
The winner will be up against you.

124
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:05,440
I'm fine with either of them.

125
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,800
Neither can defeat me anyway.

126
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,240
I'm going to find Wang Ye.

127
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:15,400
Indeed.

128
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,320
You're no longer young, but your parents dictate everything.

129
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,440
You don't look cool enough.

130
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,799
Having a capable parent

131
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,240
is an easy way to live.

132
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,719
After all, they're more capable than you and I.

133
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:30,280
Is there something wrong with taking the path they laid for you?

134
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:31,799
You should listen to your mother.

135
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,200
As for Feng Baobao,

136
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,760
I'll deal with her for you.

137
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,479
Ms. Feng,

138
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,719
I truly don't wish to injure a girl like you.

139
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,039
For a girl,

140
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,200
you're already amazing

141
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,479
for being able to injure me to this extent.

142
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Feng Baobao awaits in the next match.

143
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,919
I have to confront her myself.

144
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,320
I've already told you before.

145
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,719
Feng Baobao is my prey. Don't steal her from me!

146
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,479
This lady is awesome.

147
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,840
It seems like my sister is serious about fighting Jia Zhengliang.

148
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:14,719
I've never seen her being this serious before.

149
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,880
Ms. Feng, you're truly amazing.

150
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,479
It's my first time using all 12 flying knives

151
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,880
in a one-on-one match.

152
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:31,719
It seems like you don't intend to listen to your mother

153
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:32,919
and head home, do you?

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,239
I was talking about useless stuff just now.

155
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,560
I was sloppy.

156
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,599
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,320
I was sloppy too.

158
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,719
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,960
Do you wish to hurt me

160
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,159
with my own knife?

161
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,840
Shayan,

162
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,320
that's enough.

163
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,239
Your dad has already spoken.

164
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,719
Hurry and admit defeat.

165
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,120
Admit defeat?

166
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,039
It's too early for that.

167
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,120
Dad, this time, I won't listen to you.

168
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,280
I will never admit defeat.

169
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,559
This match alone

170
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,959
is worth the ticket price!

171
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,720
It's full offense versus full defense.

172
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,120
They're using their full strength.

173
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:41,720
What a satisfying match!

174
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,120
It feels like both of them

175
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:44,640
are betting on everything they have

176
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,640
to avoid defeat.

177
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,959
It seems

178
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,760
that the match won't end

179
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,240
unless one of them falls.

180
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,199
Shayan!

181
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,560
Look at how worried your dad is.

182
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,199
Just admit defeat.

183
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,439
This is my match.

184
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,360
I make the call here.

185
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,520
Shall we continue?

186
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,280
Bring it on.

187
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,800
She's expanding her qi aura to such a wide area.

188
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,199
This should allow her

189
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,880
to detect my knives' trajectories better

190
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,439
within the range.

191
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,839
If so, let's give it a try.

192
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,079
Like a patina,

193
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,160
I'm coating all my flying knives with a special qi.

194
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,439
At this moment,

195
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,319
my Deity-Slaying Knives

196
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,680
have close to zero friction.

197
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,839
My next technique

198
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,079
might not be suitable for sparring.

199
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,560
Cut the crap.

200
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,040
UNIVERSE ENIGMA

201
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:09,959
Shayan!

202
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,439
And the Jia boy! Listen to me!

203
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,680
Stop right now!

204
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,400
What happened just now?

205
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,400
Shayan!

206
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,319
They…

207
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,120
They fell at the same time.

208
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
One.

209
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,520
Two.

210
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,400
Three.

211
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:43,400
Four.

212
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,240
Five.

213
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:47,240
Six.

214
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,680
Seven.

215
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,480
Eight.

216
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,880
Nine.

217
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,520
You should've listened to your mother

218
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,439
and gone home.

219
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,959
You didn't listen to your dad either.

220
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,160
Say, who will win the match

221
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,959
if we keep this up?

222
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,520
Why are you doing this?

223
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,880
Even if you defeat me,

224
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,439
you won't be fit to fight in the next match.

225
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,760
Even so, I'm still the winner.

226
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The winner is

227
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,560
Feng Shayan.

228
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,120
I see.

229
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,280
So that's the case.

230
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,880
I thought you dispersed your qi

231
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,520
to detect my knives' trajectories.

232
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,600
So I was wrong.

233
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,640
Actually, you can bridge space, right?

234
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:18,319
My flying knives were extremely fast in the end.

235
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,400
But you didn't dodge them.

236
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,839
Some of the knives

237
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,319
went through the space you bridged

238
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,680
and attacked me instead.

239
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,160
The space where your palm was touching

240
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,719
was the entrance of such space.

241
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,199
You can form a space at will

242
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,079
within the qi aura you dispersed.

243
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,319
After that, you appeared together with the knives

244
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,560
and injured me.

245
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,880
Am I right?

246
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,120
It seems like you didn't get beaten up for nothing.

247
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,520
That's the power of my Universe Enigma.

248
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,599
However, I was just lucky.

249
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,439
Your flying knives were extremely fast.

250
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,920
I didn't expect you to go easy on me.

251
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,520
I don't understand it at all.

252
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,560
I just feel

253
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,240
like I can't bear to hurt you.

254
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,199
Do you wish to hurt me

255
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,160
with my own knife?

256
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,000
Stop right there!

257
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,800
Stop right there!

258
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,640
God, please help me!

259
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:21,560
Cut the crap!

260
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,199
You've wasted all of Zhuge Qing's efforts!

261
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,160
-What trickery have you used? -Stop right there!

262
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:29,040
RECORDING

263
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,680
Zhang Chulan, the situation has changed.

264
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,360
Wang Ye is being pursued by other people.

265
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:33,880
Should I bury all of them?

266
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,079
RECORDING

267
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,839
Stop running!

268
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Where did he go?

269
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,680
Where's that fool?

270
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,839
He's such a fast runner!

271
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,560
Over there!

272
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,520
Stop running!

273
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,760
Gosh!

274
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,040
What kind of martial arts do they practice?

275
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,079
They have such great stamina.

276
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,760
They pursued me for half a day.

277
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,520
It's finally quiet now.

278
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:22,640
Shayan, I'm here to visit you.

279
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,000
Xingtong?

280
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,719
What are you doing here?

281
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,040
Is Mount Longhu this tight on resources?

282
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,319
Are you two sharing a room?

283
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,680
Ms. Feng, are you okay?

284
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,959
Mr. Feng, don't just stand around.

285
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,199
Go and wash the fruits I brought for her.

286
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,599
How about this? I'll wash them.

287
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,880
What fruit do you want?

288
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:50,959
Ask him.

289
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,479
Mom, listen.

290
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,120
When I used all 12 of my Deity-Slaying Knives,

291
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,000
the Feng girl was flustered.

292
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,880
But of course, you know

293
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,479
that your son does cherish fine ladies.

294
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,880
How could I injure her?

295
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
You know me.

296
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:08,760
So…

297
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,719
Of course, I admitted defeat

298
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,760
in the end.

299
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,959
She's a girl after all.

300
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,719
Everyone is busy now.

301
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,880
I'll hang up first.

302
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,199
Forget it. Just ignore him.

303
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,839
No, don't. I was just bragging to her.

304
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,479
If not, my mom will be worried.

305
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,479
Let me do it.

306
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,359
Are you feeling better now, Shayan?

307
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:44,640
Dad, I'm much better.

308
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,839
Both Xingtong and Chulan are here.

309
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,599
I've almost recovered fully.

310
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,760
I'm fine.

311
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,199
Chairman Feng,

312
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:57,839
Mr. Feng won the match beautifully today.

313
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,040
I was just lucky.

314
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,920
Zang Long's prediction of Xingtong's success odds

315
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,399
is higher than Zhang Lingyu's now.

316
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,399
His odds of winning the contest are high now.

317
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,680
Everyone thought that I was a master when I used Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

318
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,599
But in reality,

319
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,800
I didn't collect that many powerful Q spirits.

320
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,879
I have to return Mr. Liu's spirit

321
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,440
in a few days.

322
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,359
Chairman Feng, are you sure this is okay?

323
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,159
The world is at peace now.

324
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,000
No one would attempt such lawless behaviors

325
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,440
besides Sinister Pleasure.

326
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:28,720
I permitted Xingtong to use Dispatch of Detained Spirits.

327
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,360
Mr. Lu also used his Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

328
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,680
In this era,

329
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,399
there's no need to hide the Eight Supremes.

330
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,399
Anyway,

331
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,000
Xingtong, you did a great job today.

332
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,000
Thank you, Dad.

333
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,440
Chulan,

334
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,639
are you confident about tomorrow's match?

335
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,520
Wang Ye

336
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,360
defeated Zhuge Qing flawlessly.

337
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,520
Chairman Feng, I suddenly remember that I have something to do.

338
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,720
Let me make a phone call.

339
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,240
The Huangyang shoulder pole Is soft and flexible

340
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,440
Sisters and brothers

341
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Carrying the rice grains to Liuzhou

342
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,680
Ms. Bao, how is your progress?

343
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,879
Are you done?

344
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,200
Look at the time.

345
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,320
Don't worry.

346
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:26,159
I promise that you won't see him tomorrow.

347
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,639
Did you dig that pit for me?

348
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,440
You shouldn't bury people alive.

349
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,919
Let's talk this over, okay?

350
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,360
Why are you pouring water into the pit?

351
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,000
Once the ratio of water to mud reaches a certain number,

352
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,760
the mud will stick to the body completely.

353
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,760
It'll be very comfortable.

354
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,000
Besides, watery mud like this

355
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,480
will produce a suction force

356
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,440
that can strip you of your weird power.

357
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,000
It's called Tai Chi, right?

358
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,600
Anyway, you won't be able to escape.

359
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,240
You're something else.

360
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,120
Not really. I'm just used to doing this.

361
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,360
I'll adjust the height

362
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,560
and make sure your head is visible.

363
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:22,960
What a drag.

364
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,840
It seems like I'll need to escape by using my skills.

365
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:26,879
Gather my qi.

366
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Chaos Golden--

367
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
I'm sorry about that.

368
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,120
I ate too much radish.

369
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,040
Chaos Golden Space Rip.

370
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,440
What's going on?

371
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,879
It felt weird for a second.

372
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,280
Come on, sisters

373
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,600
Let's go to Liuzhou

374
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,440
Gen, burrow like the earth dragon.

375
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,639
This is bad. He ran away.

376
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,360
Boulder Toss!

377
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,040
Thanks, miss.

378
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
I learned a lot from you.

379
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,200
18 Formidable Ways.

380
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:34,080
What?

381
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,159
What kind of martial art is that?

382
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,879
Chaos Golden Space Rip doesn't work on her.

383
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,560
Boulder Toss can't trap her either.

384
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,200
Who exactly is this jinx?

385
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,960
This girl is so hard to shake off!

386
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,360
Qian, diversion.
Dazzling Flowers!

387
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,240
That doesn't work either!

388
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,399
This wouldn't have happened if I had stayed on the mountain!

389
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,800
What a shame that I only have one of these lifesavers left!

390
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Incense of Diversion!

391
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,120
This will surely work, right?

392
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,080
Chief Celestial Taoist is here to spectate the match

393
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,600
because Zhang Chulan is his grand-disciple.

394
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:34,360
Of all the matches to spectate,

395
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,560
you two

396
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:36,960
chose to spectate this one.

397
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,360
Is it because someone is jealous of Qimen Manipulation

398
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,240
used by that young Taoist from Mount Wudang?

399
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,439
This is nothing to be embarrassed about.

400
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,080
Forget about the people here.

401
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,560
Everyone who is here at the Outsider Martial Arts Contest

402
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:53,480
is jealous of him.

403
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
If Zhang Chulan

404
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,120
did inherit his grandfather's Qi Apotheosis,

405
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,399
that means this will be a match

406
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,840
between two of the Eight Supremes.

407
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,080
Wang Ye of Mount Wudang,

408
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:04,560
please enter the arena immediately.

409
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:07,560
Wang Ye, enter the arena immediately if you hear this.

410
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:11,919
Zhuge Qing, that Taoist spent so much effort to defeat you.

411
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,879
But now, he's forfeiting to Zhang Chulan.

412
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,879
He won because he is better than me.

413
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,360
Now, he is free to decide whether he wants to win or lose here.

414
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,919
Where's Baobao?

415
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,080
Xu San,

416
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:28,120
do you still not get it?

417
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,320
Look at that shady look on Zhang Chulan's face.

418
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:32,240
I'm sure Ms. Bao is doing her work now.

419
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,320
Ms. Bao is amazing indeed.

420
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,679
Wang Ye is absent from the match.

421
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
The winner is…

422
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,280
Incense of Diversion, dispel!

423
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,040
Are you still at it?

424
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,159
Ma'am,

425
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,720
don't you have anything else on your mind besides burying me alive?

426
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,520
Look at where you are!

427
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:11,080
The contestant is here.

428
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,399
Miss,

429
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,439
please leave the arena.

430
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,439
Zhang Chulan, I messed it up.

431
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,320
Ms. Bao, that's fine.

432
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:21,960
Leave the rest to me.

433
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,960
At first, I thought

434
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,879
she was another one of Zhuge Qing's fangirls.

435
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,639
But something felt off about her.

436
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,080
Later on, I realized

437
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,399
that she was wearing NDT's uniform, just like you.

438
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,960
So she's your hired thug.

439
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,120
Zhang Chulan, good for you.

440
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,840
Coward,

441
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,679
you're pretty good at this.

442
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,800
Wang Ye,

443
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:00,879
we can delay this match.

444
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,639
Just tell us what you have encountered.

445
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,399
Celestial Taoist Mansion will uphold justice for you.

446
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,080
I'm fine.

447
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,639
Let's resume the match.

448
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,639
All right.

449
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,360
Begin the match.

450
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,919
Get me some food.

451
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:22,000
I've been running all night.

452
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,560
I'm starving.

453
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:25,520
I haven't had any steamed buns in days.

454
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,639
Did you get knocked in the head?

455
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,639
Look at where you are.

456
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,520
If you don't wish to pursue the matter,

457
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,840
begin the match.

458
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:32,760
You can talk later.

459
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,520
We're competing.

460
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,439
The contest doesn't state that we have to compete by fighting.

461
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,320
We're Taoists, not warriors.

462
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:41,879
Can't I just engage him

463
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,840
in an eating contest?

464
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,560
Fine, Chief Celestial Taoist.

465
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:49,560
I'll head back and tell Grandmaster

466
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:52,199
that Mount Wudang's disciples can't get any food at Mount Longhu.

467
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,159
Rongshan.

468
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:56,080
Stop arguing with that mushroom head.

469
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,600
Are there any buns? Feed him to death.

470
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,560
Don't let him complain to his grandmaster about me.

471
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:01,159
-Yes, Chief Celestial Taoist. -Okay.

472
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,480
I'm sorry for the trouble.

473
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,520
Prepare the same

474
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,280
for Zhang Chulan as well.

475
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,120
Don't just stand there.

476
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,320
Eat.

477
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:28,199
If not, I'll kill you in one blow.

478
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,159
All right.

479
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:39,600
Baobao, this is rare.

480
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,399
I never expected you to fail.

481
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,040
Even Baobao can't deal with him.

482
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,560
Zhang Chulan is in trouble this time.

483
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,399
Baobao,

484
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,879
what's on your mind?

485
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,199
I need to improve my workflow.

486
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,280
I have to prevent my victims from utilizing their qi

487
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,360
after knocking them out.

488
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,720
Then I'll bury them.

489
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,480
Enough.

490
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,240
Stop thinking about burying people.

491
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,159
Go and get changed.

492
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:13,320
Taoist Wang, you haven't told me

493
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:14,840
why you came to Mount Longhu.

494
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:17,879
Enhance Hearing.

495
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:23,639
Good question.

496
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,159
As for the reason I came here,

497
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,600
I cannot explain it to you in just a few sentences.

498
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,760
Zhang Chulan,

499
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,320
do you know what divination is?

500
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't.

501
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,120
Let me tell you the basic concept for now.

502
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,199
The past cannot be changed.

503
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,000
However, the future can be changed.

504
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,879
In reality,

505
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,360
even the best sorcerer

506
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:46,159
cannot see the past.

507
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,520
They can only predict a few future possibilities.

508
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,199
Even so, it's intolerable by the course of nature.

509
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,720
So divination alone

510
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,520
is not beneficial to sorcerers themselves.

511
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,240
And the damage it will cause

512
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,159
depends on how much the world will be changed

513
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,159
by the information obtained through divination.

514
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,879
For example, if I predict the number of the next jackpot prize,

515
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,840
the damage will be minuscule

516
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,600
because it only changes the candidate

517
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,320
of another potential upstart.

518
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,120
However, before this,

519
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,159
I made a divination

520
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,120
about this contest and you

521
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,280
when I was on Mount Wudang.

522
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,320
I almost died from getting a vague picture

523
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,600
regarding your future.

524
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:41,159
Actually, whatever happens to you all has nothing to do with me.

525
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,879
No matter how terrible the world ends up,

526
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:45,840
I can keep myself and my family safe.

527
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,399
That's why I shouldn't be here.

528
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,439
But why did I come here?

529
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
There are two main reasons.

530
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,800
First, my absence would severely affect

531
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:57,320
Chief Celestial Taoist's and his sect's reputation.

532
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:58,919
I respect Chief Celestial Taoist.

533
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't want that.

534
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,280
Second,

535
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,639
I came here

536
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,560
to provide you with an extra choice.

537
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,879
A choice for you to give up.

538
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,199
Give up?

539
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,639
Do you want me to give up on inheriting Tianshidu?

540
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,439
That's not it.

541
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,320
It doesn't matter

542
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,639
what happens in the contest.

543
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,879
The choice I'm providing you with

544
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,199
is the choice to give up on seeking the truth.

545
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,159
That way, you will get what you most desire.

546
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,919
Taoist Wang, stop joking.

547
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,399
What's bad about seeking the truth?

548
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,199
That's exactly what I most desire.

549
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,240
You do desire the truth.

550
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,679
But you also desire to have a car, a house, and a wife.

551
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,919
It's justifiable that you desire all of these.

552
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,760
However, once you fulfill one of your desires,

553
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,600
you will proceed to pursue the next.

554
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:44,679
So it's not a case of unfulfilled desires.

555
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,320
It's a case of having too many desires to pursue.

556
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,600
That's the reason

557
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,240
people forget what they most desire.

558
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,800
The thing that I'm talking about

559
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:54,560
is something you desire but cannot attain.

560
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:55,800
But once you attain it,

561
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,040
you're willing to give up everything else for its sake.

562
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,919
That is what is worth being called your greatest desire.

563
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:05,080
You're just pretentious.

564
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:06,560
We're strangers.
I don't need you

565
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,720
to tell me my greatest desire!

566
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,439
Face it with genuineness,

567
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,720
and you shall obtain enlightenment.

568
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,240
Approach it with genuineness,

569
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,040
and inner peace shall be achieved.

570
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,560
Taoist Wang,

571
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:43,639
what is that?

572
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,959
The Peace Mantra.

573
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
"Inner peace shall be achieved"?

574
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:50,439
That's great.

575
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:53,919
It sounds simple enough.

576
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:57,320
But it cannot be achieved that easily.

577
00:30:57,879 --> 00:30:59,600
So you have to give up something else

578
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,320
in order to attain it.

579
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,320
I think I get the gist of what you're saying.

580
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,320
You're saying

581
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,360
that if I continue my investigation,

582
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,360
the world might develop

583
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,360
in a bad direction.

584
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:17,879
Taoist Wang,

585
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,800
I'm sure I'm not the only factor in this chaotic future, right?

586
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,480
We're not related by any means.

587
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,199
You wouldn't get involved

588
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,959
in this mess for my sake.

589
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,679
Wang Ye.

590
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
Do you know me?

591
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:35,159
This is related to another concept.

592
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,959
I call it the weight of fate.

593
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,320
This world is moving every second.

594
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,720
The sum of all individual changes

595
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,480
represents the change of the world.

596
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,439
A fossilized stone changed the world.

597
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,919
By consuming these preserved vegetables,

598
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,439
I'm also a part of the changes that occur in the world.

599
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,840
However, individual changes

600
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,719
affect the change of the world differently.

601
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,600
Some people rack their brains their whole lives

602
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,000
but can't achieve anything.

603
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,560
Some people turn the world upside down

604
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:02,719
from a single thought.

605
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:08,040
That's the ratio of the weight of fate.

606
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,000
And you, Zhang Chulan,

607
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,840
hold a high ratio of that weight.

608
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,560
Your choice

609
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:15,719
will change the fates of many people.

610
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,959
Let's assume what you said was true.

611
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,919
Taoist Wang, I have a question for you.

612
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,800
You could've stayed out of this entirely.

613
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:27,399
However, you chose to persuade me.

614
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,520
Does that mean you also didn't choose the fate that is best for you?

615
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,240
Don't touch it!

616
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,600
Remember to stop the man I was.

617
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:37,959
Do not let him find out the truth.

618
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,760
That's right.

619
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,719
I don't need to divine anything to know.

620
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,040
This doesn't benefit me in any way.

621
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,360
Wang Ye, beat him up!

622
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,439
We're not here to see you chat!

623
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,919
-Beat him up! -Beat him up!

624
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,600
They came all the way here just to have a meal and chat.

625
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,520
Zhuge Qing, you actually lost to this freak.

626
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,360
It's more than just me.

627
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:06,600
What do you mean?

628
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:08,679
Marquis's Qimen lost.

629
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,639
-Beat him up! -Beat him up!

630
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:14,520
I can't eat anymore.

631
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,879
What do you think?

632
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,000
Zhang Chulan,

633
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,360
can you make your decision now?

634
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Ms. Bao,

635
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,480
you gave me

636
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,240
the warmth of a family that I never had.

637
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,639
Grandpa!

638
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,360
GRANDFATHER ZHANG XILIN

639
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,919
Ms. Bao, it will be fine.

640
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,320
You will have what I have too.

641
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:10,520
Chulan,

642
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,759
by participating in the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

643
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,319
you can help Wu

644
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,960
to find her past.

645
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,199
I'll entrust Wu

646
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:20,839
to you now.

647
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,239
You should stop eating

648
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,159
when you're full.

649
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,880
Out of all the choices,

650
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,759
why did you choose the worst one?

651
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,719
It is what I want to do.

652
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:52,639
Whatever the outcome is,

653
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,239
I will bear the responsibility alone.

654
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:56,279
Do you know what responsibility it is?

655
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,120
Do you think you can bear it?

656
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,680
I'm not just doing this

657
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,440
for my own sake.

658
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,080
I'm sorry.

659
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,480
I'm sorry for letting you down,

660
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,400
Taoist Wang.

661
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:26,720
You're too courteous.

662
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,680
I'm here to provide you with a choice,

663
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:31,319
not to make the choice for you.

664
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,560
Wang Ye,

665
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,759
where are you going?

666
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,920
Don't you see his empty plate?

667
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,040
He has already won.
