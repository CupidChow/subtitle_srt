1
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,279
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

2
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,680
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

3
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,960
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

4
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,879
Many people have left all of a sudden.

5
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:44,760
Baobao,

6
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:46,440
you look like you're in a good mood.

7
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:48,199
Zhang Chulan won the contest

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,400
and got Tianshidu.

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,239
Meanwhile, I can find my past.

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,440
Yes, all the effort you put into looking after him wasn't in vain.

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,320
Let's welcome the champion, Zhang Chulan,

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,879
who will come to receive his award.

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,759
Congratulations, Zhang Chulan.

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,000
Like what we promised before the contest,

15
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,640
Infinite Heavenly Talisman

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,280
is now yours.

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,640
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,839
But I don't want it anymore.

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,839
You don't want it?

20
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,320
Mr. Lu,

21
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,800
despite having never seen Qi Apotheosis before,

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
it has gotten me into a lot of trouble.

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,320
Infinite Heavenly Talisman is the same as Qi Apotheosis.

24
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,360
They may be treasures to others,

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,080
but to me,

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,960
they will only cause me a lot of trouble.

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,280
Moreover,

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,600
being able to return to Mount Longhu

29
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,240
is already the greatest award for me.

30
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,479
This kid…

31
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:00,399
What's going on?

32
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,440
I brought Infinite Heavenly Talisman here.

33
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:03,960
Am I supposed to bring it home now?

34
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:05,160
Lu Jin,

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,239
since you've brought it here, don't bring it home again.

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,199
If the champion doesn't want it,

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,480
give it to the runner-up.

38
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:14,400
I suppose

39
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,799
there's no objection, right?

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,440
Chief Celestial Taoist, you're cunning.

41
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,760
It will either go to your disciple or your grand-disciple.

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,280
Anyway, I won't be able to keep Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

43
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,359
Lingyu.

44
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,760
Zhang Chulan doesn't want Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

45
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,200
Mr. Lu wishes to pass Infinite Heavenly Talisman to you.

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,920
Do you want to give it to me?

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,120
But I'm the loser. I don't deserve it.

48
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:45,720
What did you say?

49
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:46,840
Do you not want it either?

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,840
My goodness!

51
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,799
Now my Infinite Heavenly Talisman

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,959
has become a junk that nobody wants!

53
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,880
Tomorrow is the last day

54
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,720
of the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,959
If you are asked to make a decision,

56
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,880
you have to make a decision

57
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,519
that you don't usually make.

58
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,120
Thank you, Mr. Lu,

59
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,720
even though I don't deserve this.

60
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,799
That's the right choice.

61
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:39,959
You can keep it.

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,079
Hey, Dad.

63
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,480
Shayan, have you heard that Zhang Chulan won the contest?

64
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,359
Zhang Chulan actually did it, didn't he?

65
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes, Chief Celestial Taoist will give him Tianshidu soon.

66
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,000
It doesn't matter.

67
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,399
I don't care about Tianshidu.

68
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,679
Why haven't I seen you in the past two days?

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,399
I've been hanging out at the foot of the mountain.

70
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,880
The contest was too tiring.

71
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,119
I wanted to rest at a hotel for a few days.

72
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,480
Who are you with?

73
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,760
No one. I'm alone.

74
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,399
We are leaving the mountain soon.

75
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,800
Come and meet us now.

76
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,240
Are you leaving the mountain now?

77
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,560
All right.

78
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,120
I'll meet up with you right away.

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,520
Are you leaving?

80
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,599
Who was speaking?

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,080
You must have misheard.

82
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:29,200
There's no one beside me.

83
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,400
I'm hanging up now.

84
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,840
Okay, bye.

85
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,200
Are you crazy?

86
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,120
What if my dad hears you?

87
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,680
Just let him, then.

88
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,479
Shayan.

89
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,360
So…

90
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,200
When are you coming

91
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,360
to Jia Village with me?

92
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,880
If I go,

93
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,880
then what about your blind date partner?

94
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,840
Why do you care about her?

95
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,200
Just come with me.

96
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,080
You haven't met my mom yet.

97
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,640
I don't mean anything by it.

98
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:11,159
I'm just inviting you over.

99
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,320
We live in a new era now.

100
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,680
I thought it was already rare

101
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,479
to have met an innocent guy like Lian.

102
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,280
Had I known you were like this,

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,159
I wouldn't have approached you.

104
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,719
What's wrong with an innocent guy?

105
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,080
Nothing.

106
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:30,080
You did well in the past few days.

107
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,599
After all, it was your first time.

108
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,120
But we were drunk, so don't take it seriously.

109
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,039
Don't take it seriously?

110
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,840
Then you need to explain what we are now.

111
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,479
Are you asking me to explain?

112
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,440
Wait.

113
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,560
What is this?

114
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,200
By the way, this one is for you too.

115
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
We live in a new era now.

116
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:31,359
Holding your phone between your shoulder and ear

117
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,479
isn't good for your neck and spine.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,919
I've got to go.

119
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,159
Shayan.

120
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,000
You didn't give me the charging case.

121
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,560
Get a new one.

122
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,039
It's still connected to your phone.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Keep listening.

124
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:18,760
GREAT JADE EMPEROR HALL

125
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,080
Chulan, come with me.

126
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:30,200
Tonight, I'll pass it on to you.

127
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,080
Young lady, don't follow us.

128
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,599
You two, stand guard.

129
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,039
Don't worry, Ms. Bao.

130
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
Wait for me here.

131
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,039
Take off your clothes.

132
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,400
Take off your clothes. Take a bath.

133
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:30,799
Aren't you going to pass Tianshidu to me?

134
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,799
Grandmaster, what are you doing?

135
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,480
Before I start,

136
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,880
we have to pay our respects

137
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:37,600
to Mount Longhu's ancestors together.

138
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,840
And before that, you must bathe and get changed

139
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,280
as a show of respect.

140
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,000
Grandmaster,

141
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:45,959
should I bathe first or should you go first?

142
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,319
Or should we do it together?

143
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,280
You should go first.

144
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,319
Grandmaster, I remember it now.

145
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,199
I took a bath before I came here.

146
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,720
Moreover, Mount Longhu's ancestors

147
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,680
were all wise men.

148
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,439
They won't care about such trivial things.

149
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:11,480
Come, then.

150
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:41,720
Grandmaster,

151
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,880
now can you tell me

152
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,640
the truth about the Jiashen Calamity?

153
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:46,600
Chulan,

154
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,439
what kind of person

155
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,240
do you think deserves Tianshidu?

156
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:54,120
The best fighter,

157
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:56,199
the best strategist,

158
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,079
or the most popular person on Mount Longhu?

159
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
It's none of those.

160
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:02,959
The power of Tianshidu

161
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,120
is extraordinary.

162
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,280
The greater the power,

163
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,920
the greater the responsibility.

164
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,079
Only those with pure hearts

165
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,120
who wish to protect all Outsiders

166
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:16,280
will be truly acknowledged by everyone.

167
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,199
I'm not talking about some verbal recognition

168
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,120
or any extravagant rituals.

169
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,760
It has to be someone capable enough

170
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,480
to accept the secret technique passed down

171
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,160
by the previous Chief Celestial Taoist.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,280
Tianshidu.

173
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
Zhang Chulan,

174
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,680
I am passing Tianshidu on to you today.

175
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,760
From now on,

176
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,199
you will officially become my heir.

177
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,920
What's the matter?

178
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,520
Are you sure Sinister Pleasure is heading this way?

179
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:05,800
I'll handle it.

180
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,439
We've got trouble. Come with me.

181
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,439
What's the matter?

182
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Baobao, you come too.

183
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Baobao?

184
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,520
SEVEN DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK AT MOUNT LONGHU

185
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,800
I did it!

186
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,240
If Hu Jie can't obtain Infinite Heavenly Talisman,

187
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,040
how will we explain it to the interim leader?

188
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,680
Do you really think he can win the championship?

189
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,599
We could never count on Hu Jie to acquire Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

190
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,839
Everyone, please get ready.

191
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,920
We're counting on you Four Crazies to get Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,880
LIUQING OPERA HOUSE

193
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,280
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK AT MOUNT LONGHU

194
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,199
Do you want me

195
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,360
to kneel and beg you to do this?

196
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:17,120
It's a memory from more than a decade ago.

197
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:18,319
Even today,

198
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
the girl in the memory

199
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:20,920
has not changed at all.

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,199
But more importantly,

201
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,719
the girl killed the owner of the memory.

202
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,520
The owner of the memory is Zhang Huaiyi,

203
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,920
who played an important role

204
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,079
in the Jiashen Calamity.

205
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,040
Wait a minute.

206
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,680
-Is this Zhang Huaiyi’s memory? -Yes.

207
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,360
Many years have passed.

208
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:41,360
He had no family, no peers,

209
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:43,520
and no one from 36 Thieves was close to him.

210
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:45,680
His corpse only had a little primordial spirit left,

211
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,079
and the only thing he remembered

212
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,280
was this girl.

213
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,719
Can you imagine

214
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,680
how important

215
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,439
this girl was to him?

216
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,319
The interim leader designated her as your target.

217
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,120
The Ten Elders and most of the Outsiders have left the mountain.

218
00:13:58,199 --> 00:13:59,920
Chief Celestial Taoist is in isolation.

219
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,240
Only the youngsters are around.

220
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:02,480
The entrance isn't closed yet.

221
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,199
We are going to turn Mount Longhu upside down.

222
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,719
This is a great opportunity to do it.

223
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Let me make it clear.

224
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:12,400
I will go and take a look.

225
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,240
But I can't guarantee

226
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:16,079
that I will succeed.

227
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,920
She managed to kill a powerful man like Zhang Huaiyi.

228
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,040
I might not be able to get what you want.

229
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,360
The interim leader said

230
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:27,000
that we have to bring her back

231
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,040
at all costs.

232
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,800
Hello.

233
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
The video has been uploaded.

234
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:42,959
Go and take a look.
Sure.

235
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,640
MESSAGE FROM THE INTERIM LEADER

236
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,839
URGENT, CALLING FOR ALL MEMBERS OF SINISTER PLEASURE

237
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,599
-It's rigged! -It's rigged!

238
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,880
Look.

239
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,959
They call themselves a respectable organization.

240
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,880
But at the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

241
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,160
they are despicable, shameless,

242
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,160
and arrogant.

243
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,280
They monopolize the Outsiders' world in the name of justice.

244
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,560
What makes them so much better?

245
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,040
Why does Sinister Pleasure have to live such a lowly life?

246
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,280
Let us wreck Mount Longhu

247
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,680
and seize everything that belongs to us!

248
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,560
Yes, Interim Leader.

249
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,599
-We'll set out at once. -Let's show our true power.

250
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,400
-All hail Sinister Pleasure. -Let's attack!

251
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,719
We will trample Mount Longhu.

252
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:25,839
THE DAY OF THE ATTACK AT MOUNT LONGHU

253
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,680
Rong Shan, what's going on?

254
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
Mr. Lu. Lingyu.

255
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,520
People from Sinister Pleasure have come to wreak havoc.

256
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:05,760
Protect Master Tian.

257
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,000
He's more important.

258
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,040
Leave the rest to me.

259
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,280
Okay. Be careful.

260
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,920
Be careful.

261
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Lingyu, I'm coming with you.

262
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,359
You are our guest.

263
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,560
Leave this to us.

264
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,760
You should return to your room and rest.

265
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,800
I'll be right back.

266
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,040
Baobao!

267
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,599
Where's my Baobao?

268
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,880
How could you leave me alone?

269
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,319
My Baobao!

270
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,479
Who is it?

271
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,800
Are you looking for me?

272
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,359
My Baobao!

273
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:42,800
How could you leave me alone?

274
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,599
-Baobao. -Don't go.

275
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,160
My Baobao!

276
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,760
Baobao.

277
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,319
My Baobao.

278
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,240
How could you leave me alone?

279
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Baobao.

280
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,319
Is it you?

281
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,639
Are you looking for me?

282
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:33,480
My Baobao.

283
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,040
My dearest daughter.

284
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,879
CRYING MAN, SINISTER PLEASURE

285
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,520
I've finally found you.

286
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,040
-My dearest daughter. -My dearest daughter.

287
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,159
-I've finally found you. -I've finally found you.

288
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,720
Are you manipulating them?

289
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,440
Who are you?

290
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,919
Have you been looking for me?

291
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
My goodness.

292
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,720
Baobao, why aren't you crying?

293
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,840
So this isn't working for you.

294
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,639
Then I'll get going first.

295
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,280
You've lived a rough life.

296
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:12,320
Spiritual Master Lingyu.

297
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,320
It's late at night.

298
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,840
Why are you wandering alone?

299
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,480
Are you secretly practicing

300
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,000
your newly acquired precious technique?

301
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,560
You have been tailing me for a long time.

302
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:24,320
Are you finally going to show yourselves?

303
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,280
Show yourselves.

304
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:29,760
Spiritual Master Lingyu,

305
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,360
how polite of you.

306
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,360
Then we shall not make things difficult for you.

307
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,560
Who are you?

308
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,080
I'm Yuan Tao from Sinister Pleasure.

309
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:40,960
As for this boy,

310
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,080
you can just call him Fool.

311
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:44,280
The rest of them

312
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,040
are the backbone of Sinister Pleasure.

313
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,520
We only want to borrow Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

314
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,879
We will return it in a few days.

315
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,560
Sure enough, it's Sinister Pleasure.

316
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,280
You invaded Mount Longhu.

317
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,600
I'm afraid that you won't be able

318
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,960
to get out of here alive.

319
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,120
Spiritual Master Lingyu,

320
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,360
you're a really capable man

321
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,560
and a very good fighter.

322
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:13,280
But you rarely leave the mountain,

323
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,080
so you haven't seen much of the world.

324
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:16,960
You haven't seen this before, right?

325
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,760
Then let me show you a thing or two.

326
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,560
Yuan Tao.

327
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,560
So you've been coveting Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

328
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:32,200
Then you should come to me.

329
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,200
Why are you attacking a young man?

330
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,760
Aren't you ashamed?

331
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,879
Mr. Lu, you're here too.

332
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,480
It seems like

333
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
I won't get what I want today.

334
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:45,440
Mr. Lu, you're a very knowledgeable man.

335
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,760
What technique are they using?

336
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,879
There is a group of Outsiders

337
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,040
that specializes

338
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,480
in cultivating their own qi

339
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,320
to create an independent superpower

340
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,720
out of an object.

341
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,120
It's called weapon forging.

342
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,120
It requires a lot of talent to forge a weapon.

343
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,360
Only a small handful of people are capable of doing so,

344
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,360
and Yuan Tao is one of the most skillful ones.

345
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,320
The fat boy beside him

346
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:06,520
is probably an Armorer too, right?

347
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,120
It's nothing worth mentioning.

348
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,000
I am flattered.

349
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,560
But you aren't completely right.

350
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:15,040
Fool

351
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,480
is my greatest achievement by far.

352
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,879
So it seems

353
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,200
we have fallen into your trap.

354
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,639
Forget it. Mr. Lu is here.

355
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,040
Fool, let's retreat first.

356
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,120
Running Hare!

357
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,040
That's really quick.

358
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,159
Lingyu, stay with me.

359
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,480
Kids, don't forget what I told you.

360
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,399
-Yes! -Yes!

361
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,879
Charge!

362
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,159
Why did you stop running?

363
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:14,480
Mr. Lu, you've really let your guard down.

364
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,360
You chased after me for such a long distance.

365
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,320
Aren't you worried

366
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:19,639
that something might happen to your kids?

367
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,639
Those kids know a few tricks.

368
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,600
Your people are the ones who should be worried.

369
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,240
Why are you so sure

370
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,280
that we are the only ones here?

371
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,240
Mr. Lu, that…

372
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,520
Don't worry, Lingyu.

373
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,159
Let's deal with him first.

374
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,639
Your master can take care of Celestial Taoist Mansion.

375
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
It's good if we can acquire Infinite Heavenly Talisman.

376
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,720
But even if we fail,

377
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,360
it's all right.

378
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,399
Notify our ambushers on the mountain

379
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,800
and those standing by downhill

380
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:49,360
to all wreak havoc together.

381
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,639
The greater the havoc, the better.

382
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,600
That way,

383
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,480
they will overlook our biggest target.

384
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,280
Xia, where are you?

385
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,879
I've brought her here!

386
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,240
Xia, I've finally found you!

387
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,720
I've brought her here!

388
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,080
A petite body with very light qi.

389
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:52,679
You resemble an immortal.

390
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:57,000
Old man, are you talking to me?

391
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,320
Xia, this girl is really powerful.

392
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:01,399
You have to be careful.

393
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,240
My goodness!

394
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,480
Let me find out

395
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,840
what you are capable of.

396
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,879
Old man, how did you do that?

397
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Can you teach me?

398
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,600
I am a man,

399
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:20,480
and I don't kill women.

400
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,480
Beg for mercy now.

401
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,760
Then I will

402
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:33,280
spare you.

403
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,320
I don't beg for mercy. I only fight.

404
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:40,360
If that's the case,

405
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,399
I will kill you!

406
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,520
That's impressive.

407
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,000
It seems like I won't be able to defeat you.

408
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,720
Mu Guiying

409
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:24,760
As brave

410
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:33,320
As ever

411
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,240
Little girl, you are pretty good at this.

412
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,679
It's a pity that you are too naive.

413
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,360
Will you admit your defeat now?

414
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:53,360
Again.

415
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,560
You didn't allow Sinister Pleasure's members

416
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:57,240
to participate in the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

417
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,560
This time, we are here

418
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:00,159
to redeem ourselves.

419
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,280
We want to humiliate Mount Longhu,

420
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,080
and you will become the laughingstock in the Outsiders' world.

421
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,120
Mr. Lu, they're up to no good.

422
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,960
Perhaps we should help others first.

423
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,240
Move aside!

424
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,760
What do you know, brat?

425
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,919
Lu Jin,

426
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,679
now is not the time to pull seniority.

427
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,879
How dare you call me by my name?

428
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,159
Rascal, are you trying to dig your own grave?

429
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,639
What are you doing, Lu Jin?

430
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:28,720
Lingyu.

431
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,879
Lingyu!

432
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,360
Seal your Hand-Shaoyin Meridian

433
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,800
and Foot-Jueyin Meridian.

434
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,720
I think

435
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,439
I was rude to you, Mr. Lu.

436
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,199
Am I going mad?

437
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,399
No, you're not.

438
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,520
We were hypnotized.

439
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,000
Gao Ning, the Thunder Smoke Cannon.

440
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,879
Dou Mei, the Intoxicator.

441
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,280
So it was your doing.

442
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,600
Lingyu, are you carrying Infinite Heavenly Talisman

443
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,760
that I gave to you?

444
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,120
It looks like we're going to have a big fight tonight.

445
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,000
But Mr. Lu, I have the brush.

446
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,000
What will you do?

447
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,199
Don't worry.

448
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,760
I can make do.

449
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,560
I have plenty of brushes.

450
00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:34,320
That one is huge.

451
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:36,040
The bigger, the stronger.

452
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:38,120
Infinite Heavenly Talisman!

453
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,600
The book-combining technique.

454
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,199
The meridian-sealing Vermilion Book!

455
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:50,240
Infinite Heavenly Talisman

456
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,840
is indeed extraordinary.

457
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,040
Twelve Bewitchments Array.

458
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,399
TWELVE BEWITCHMENTS ARRAY

459
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,000
Fatty, you're so annoying!

460
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,159
I'll kill you first!

461
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,120
Quadruple Thunder Talisman!

462
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:29,879
Mire in the North!

463
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,679
Mr. Lu, have you realized how strong they are?

464
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,040
The Four Crazies are good

465
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,240
at messing with people's minds.

466
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,240
In front of them,

467
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,639
your Infinite Heavenly Talisman

468
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,320
will be much weaker.

469
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:02,760
Lingyu,

470
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,320
don't bother using more techniques.

471
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,879
Protect your mind and leave now.

472
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,360
How can I leave you alone?

473
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:09,960
I told you to leave now.

474
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,840
The Four Crazies are really powerful

475
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,120
and extremely vicious.

476
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:16,120
I have to teach these devils a lesson today

477
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:18,520
even if it costs my life!

478
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,360
Aren't you the Four Crazies?

479
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,720
Where are there only three?

480
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,960
Are you talking about me?

481
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,840
I am not doing anything

482
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,560
because you still look very good

483
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,439
at your age, Mr. Lu.

484
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
I don't want to hurt you.

485
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,879
Xia He.

486
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,080
Why are you staring at me?

487
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,080
You look like you want to eat me alive.

488
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,280
Mr. Lu, what's the matter?

489
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,120
Grandpa, join us!

490
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,879
You look very tired.

491
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,399
-We've all been waiting for you. -Yes.

492
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:22,439
-Hurry up. -Grandpa!

493
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,199
Hurry up.

494
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,520
It's just a hallucination.

495
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,600
It must be my hallucination.

496
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:54,840
Mr. Lu,

497
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,399
why must you be so dead set against Sinister Pleasure?

498
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,320
You're getting old.

499
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,679
There's nothing for you to dwell on.

500
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:04,439
When we defeat you today,

501
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,879
whether alive or dead,

502
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:07,639
at least you won't feel any more pain.

503
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,000
I don't have any other options.

504
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,720
I'm always this stubborn.

505
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:14,720
I won't rest until I get rid of you.

506
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,199
I told you

507
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,199
that Lu Jin is very strong.

508
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,679
Disable him first.

509
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,959
Then we will bring him back and deal with him.

510
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,480
I told you not to step in.

511
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,800
You don't understand.

512
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,480
Twelve Bewitchments Array

513
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,600
affects the 12 meridians in the human body.

514
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,720
Every meridian affects

515
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,480
a human's positive and negative emotions.

516
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,560
It keeps switching between the two emotions

517
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:44,320
to weaken its opponent,

518
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,959
like twisting a steel wire over and over again.

519
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,520
You will eventually break down

520
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,679
and drown under one of the emotions,

521
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,120
unable to regain your composure.

522
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,480
And Dou Mei is here.

523
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,480
She is able to make you weak.

524
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,600
Together, one is tough, while the other is gentle.

525
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:02,080
They are the perfect match.

526
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,280
Lingyu,

527
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,879
they are using all their power

528
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,679
to keep me immobilized.

529
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,360
I'm going to say this one last time.

530
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:12,080
Do everything you can to escape now!

531
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,280
Are you trying to leave?

532
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,600
Mr. Lu,

533
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:20,360
do you think I'm here as a spectator?

534
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,360
Leave the pretty boy to me.

535
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:28,040
You three can have the old man.

536
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,720
This crazy girl gets distracted

537
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,360
whenever she sees a young man.

538
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Now, I'm finally feeling at ease.

539
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,159
But I'm also reaching my limit.

540
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:43,800
Gao Ning,

541
00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:45,280
you won!

542
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,399
Since you want me to lose my mind so badly,

543
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,959
I'll show you what I've got!

544
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,360
But this time,

545
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:00,840
I will decide

546
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:02,639
what I'm going to do!

547
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,360
TRIPLE REBIRTH

548
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,919
Retreat.

549
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,320
Keep a safe distance from Lu Jin.

550
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:20,480
Why should we retreat?

551
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,320
We should attack him now.

552
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,199
He may never lose his mind again.

553
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,159
Lu Jin has exhausted all his qi.

554
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,639
He is relying only on his self-control to guide his emotions.

555
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,320
He barely managed to cast Triple Rebirth,

556
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,399
stopped guarding his Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyin,

557
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,360
and is pushing himself

558
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:35,199
to feel extreme anger and hatred.

559
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,159
Triple Rebirth is very destructive.

560
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,560
We must not take it lightly.

561
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,199
This is his final counterattack.

562
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,000
Where is Feng Baobao?

563
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,080
I think she was lured away by some weird noise.

564
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,439
Sinister Pleasure is attacking.

565
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,679
I need to inform the chief.

566
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Mr. Xu San,

567
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,280
I'm sure you see the golden rays up there.

568
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,719
Rays of this brightness

569
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,879
are the result of Grandmaster's inheritance process.

570
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,240
It's so chaotic out there.

571
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,879
With Grandmaster's level of cultivation,

572
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:09,040
he has definitely sensed it.

573
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,840
He could pass Tianshidu on any time

574
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,040
But if he doesn't show up now, Mount Longhu will fall.

575
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,199
Since Grandmaster has decided to stay put,

576
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,520
it means that his current task is very important.

577
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,760
We won't allow you to disturb him.

578
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,280
Sorry, Mr. Xu San.

579
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,679
We can only wait here.

580
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,439
I'm warning you on behalf of NDT Express.

581
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,360
Let me in

582
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,360
or your chief will have to bear the consequences.

583
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,959
Is it working, Grandmaster?

584
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,320
It's not.

585
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:41,959
This is already the third time.

586
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,240
There's nothing wrong on my side

587
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,800
during the inheritance process.

588
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,719
You are the problem.

589
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:51,520
Chulan,

590
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:53,879
I reminded you before.

591
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:56,520
If the recipient hesitates or resists,

592
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,760
he won't be able to receive Tianshidu successfully.

593
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,800
Do you not want to become Chief Celestial Taoist?

594
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,760
If you're worried about your life as a mortal

595
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,240
after being Chief Celestial Taoist,

596
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,399
you can rest assured.

597
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,120
The precepts of Celestial Taoist Mansion aren't that strict.

598
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,799
You can still smoke, drink, and eat meat.

599
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,440
As long as you stay upright,

600
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,120
those useless rules and regulations

601
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,719
don't apply here

602
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:17,960
at Zhengyi Sect.

603
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,679
If you don't want to manage Celestial Taoist Mansion,

604
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,400
you can leave it to Lingyu and other senior disciples.

605
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,679
Most importantly,

606
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,319
once you become Chief Celestial Taoist,

607
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,639
Sinister Pleasure won't be able to lay their hands on you.

608
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,279
Grandmaster,

609
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:35,440
if you want me to accept Tianshidu willingly,

610
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,839
please answer my question.

611
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,239
Is it about the Jiashen Calamity again?

612
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:41,040
It's not about the Jiashen Calamity.

613
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,520
Then what is it?

614
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,480
Grandmaster,

615
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,639
after you pass Tianshidu to me,

616
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,839
what will happen to you?

617
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,080
Grandmaster,

618
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,360
I don't want

619
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,799
Tianshidu.

620
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,080
What did you say?

621
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,720
You're too smart to not have figured it out.

622
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:15,640
I set up the contest for you!

623
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,360
Thank you, Grandmaster.

624
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:23,520
But I really don't want Tianshidu.
