1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,639
Good morning, guys!

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,560
-Good morning. -Good morning.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,759
Last night…

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,839
Nothing happened

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,519
last night, right?

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,519
We drank a bit,

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,239
and we all went to sleep.

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,519
Yes, we just had a bit of fun.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,640
You even fancied yourself

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,559
to be Nezha 2.0.

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,879
Do you know

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,640
how many trees you destroyed last night?

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,120
-Enough! -Those trees…

14
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:55,599
Enough! Shut up!

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,879
Calm down, dude.

16
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,480
We were all young once.

17
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,879
But to pull those antics in Celestial Taoist Mansion?

18
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,320
You're the first one to ever do that.

19
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,960
Ms. Bao.

20
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,640
You don't lie.

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,160
Tell me what happened last night.

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,679
Everyone had so much fun.

23
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,640
Zhang Chulan, I liked the bonfire party.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,960
Can we have another one tonight?

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,560
Zhang Chulan,

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,039
you are going to be a legend among Outsiders.

27
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,200
I have faith in you.

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,000
Me too.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,479
You guys

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,960
didn't take any photos, right?

31
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,000
Hell no.

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,600
I'm not that mean.

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,240
I just recorded a video.

34
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,080
You little piece of shit.

35
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,880
I'll kill you!

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,119
Ms. Hua,

37
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,720
I cannot view Zhang Chulan the same way again.

38
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,559
Ms. Hua?

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,839
Let her be.

40
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:04,280
She is deeply engrossed in the seal.

41
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,000
She is captivated by it.

42
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,600
Zang Long, you scoundrel! Come down!

43
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:08,880
I'll kill you!

44
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,440
Come here and get me.

45
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:11,960
Aren't you Nezha 2.0?

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,120
You rascal!

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,160
Come down now!

48
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,120
I'll make you suffer!

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,280
The tournament bracket is out.

50
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,840
ADAPTED FROM THE WEBCOMIC YI REN ZHI XIA

51
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:48,239
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

52
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,519
ALL ACTIONS AND ABILITIES PERFORMED SHOULD NOT BE IMITATED

53
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,880
The Top Eight Elimination Round

54
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,400
for the Outsiders Martial Arts Contest

55
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,600
will begin shortly.

56
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,000
Please be seated as soon as possible.

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,480
Do you think

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,920
no one can recognize you like this?

59
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,079
Chief Celestial Taoist!

60
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,799
Good morning, Mr. Tian and Mr. Lu.

61
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,519
Hello, Chairman Feng.

62
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,239
Chief Celestial Taoist,

63
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,040
what happened to your face?

64
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
I have been trying

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,320
to develop my own martial arts.

66
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,959
There was a mishap yesterday

67
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,079
when I cultivated my qi.

68
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,320
My Yangming Meridian

69
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,840
was blocked,

70
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,600
and it manifested as a swollen face.

71
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,560
Pay no mind to it.

72
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,880
Rest well.

73
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
I shall take my leave.

74
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,480
Okay.

75
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,359
FENG BAOBAO, XIAO XIAO

76
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,000
Feng Baobao versus Xiao Xiao.

77
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,359
Why are all the bigwigs here?

78
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,200
They weren't here during my match.

79
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,920
But they are here for Ms. Bao's match.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,640
Have they begun to notice Baobao?

81
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:05,959
I know you often clean up Zhang Chulan's mess.

82
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,480
But in this match,

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,079
I'll relieve you of that duty.

84
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,880
Excuse me?

85
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,079
In other words,

86
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,640
you'll fall here.

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,360
SNIFF

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,960
Is this the legendary Sniff?

89
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,800
No wonder it's called Sniff.

90
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,960
It's like blowing your nose.

91
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,800
That's disgusting.

92
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,599
The Sniff attack

93
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,159
can hamper one's primordial spirit,

94
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,440
rendering one defenseless and vulnerable

95
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,760
for a short period.

96
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,240
Don't mind if I do!

97
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,599
Jinzhong,

98
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,240
let me test you.

99
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,880
Which sect do you think

100
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,000
this lady here falls under?

101
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,120
Who do you think is her master?

102
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,760
I truly cannot tell.

103
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,360
Her technique

104
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,919
and movement

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
are illogical.

106
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,520
She should have been defeated by now,

107
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,039
given all her flaws.

108
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,080
Yet, she always manages

109
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:31,960
to dodge the most fatal attack.

110
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,039
When you first met her yesterday,

111
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,760
didn't you notice her eyes?

112
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,320
Look at my eyes.

113
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,919
Zhiwei, how am I supposed to see your eyes

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,479
when you're wearing sunglasses?

115
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,880
Talk back again,

116
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,560
and I'll throw you off the stage.

117
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,919
Well, I get it.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,760
After nearly a century of training,

119
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,760
lights have long departed from your eyes.

120
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,120
At a glimpse,

121
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,680
your eyes are no different from others.

122
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,039
But someone with enough training

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,359
can detect

124
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,320
that there is a certain clarity

125
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,159
in your eyes.

126
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,280
It's called the Eyes of Omniscience.

127
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,000
Are you saying that the lady over there

128
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,159
possesses such eyes?

129
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
At such a young age?

130
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,960
That's why I believe

131
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,400
she was bestowed with immense potential.

132
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,039
Her movement indicates

133
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,080
that she was not properly tutored.

134
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,039
She merely dodges with her instinct.

135
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,680
And who says someone young

136
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,919
cannot attain those eyes?

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,240
Back then…

138
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,960
Are you talking about that villain?

139
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,240
Lingyu is my last disciple.

140
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,680
But I want

141
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,200
to take this lass in too.

142
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,560
Hold your horses now.

143
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,919
I noticed

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,640
her peculiarity yesterday,

145
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,039
so I had my men do some research.

146
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,239
She might be NDT's temp.

147
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,840
A temp?

148
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,440
For NDT Express, a temp

149
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,080
is quite special, isn't it?

150
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:24,640
Temps work directly

151
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:27,359
under the regional manager.

152
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,840
They exist outside of the system

153
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,200
and are unpredictable.

154
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,880
Each of them possesses powerful abilities

155
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,840
and hides a dark secret.

156
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,479
So do I just have to keep my distance?

157
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,919
Qi Bullets!

158
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,440
Ms. Bao knows a lot of tricks.

159
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:21,760
Baobao, it's time for me to teach you my secret technique.

160
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,199
Eat this!

161
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,240
As I said, it won't be that easy.

162
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:42,120
Every ability and technique

163
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:45,600
has to be adapted to how your qi works.

164
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,959
It's like programming.

165
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,720
Qi is the source code.

166
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,360
If you don't know how to use it,

167
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:52,720
you cannot make the program you want.

168
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:54,720
If you want to learn ranged attacks,

169
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,319
I can find you a more suitable tutor.

170
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,959
No need.

171
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,360
I get it now.

172
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,760
I just didn't let out enough qi.

173
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:10,199
18 Formidable Ways.

174
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,640
18 FORMIDABLE WAYS

175
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,199
I'm fine.

176
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,880
I didn't feel a thing.

177
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,480
It's only strong enough to topple aluminum cans.

178
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
Aluminum cans?

179
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,079
Chief Celestial Taoist,

180
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
explain this.

181
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,400
Think of qi

182
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,560
as a nation's gold reserve.

183
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,800
When it goes to war,

184
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,520
it should use its gold efficiently.

185
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,120
But this lass just threw gold ingots

186
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,480
at her enemy.

187
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,480
Anyone else

188
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,439
would have fainted from overexertion.

189
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,640
Eat this, then!

190
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,439
How can this be?

191
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,319
Has she found out my Sniff attack's weakness?

192
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,280
The closer she is to me the stronger the attack,

193
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,400
but the range gets smaller

194
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,040
so it's easier to dodge.

195
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,400
How does Feng Baobao

196
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,280
predict Xiao Xiao's movements?

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,199
She didn't predict.

198
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
She knows how Xiao Xiao breathes.

199
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,800
So Xiao Xiao cannot fool her

200
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,959
by feigning a breath.

201
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,959
To unleash his Sniff,

202
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,240
he has to use his dantian.

203
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:47,720
His throat, abdomen,

204
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,720
and back

205
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,160
will contract slightly.

206
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,040
Zhuge Qing,

207
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,680
surely you can defeat Xiao Xiao

208
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,280
effortlessly, right?

209
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:58,319
Defeating him with spells isn't that difficult.

210
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,680
However, maintaining focus

211
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,240
during a match

212
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
is challenging for me.

213
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,520
Bring it on!

214
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,160
Done.

215
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,439
Xiao Xiao's primordial spirit

216
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,400
is dissipating!

217
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,839
Feng Baobao shoved his Sniff attack

218
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,319
back into his body.

219
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,240
Those reckless fools!

220
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:42,760
Fortunately, I'm here.

221
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,120
Easy.

222
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,079
We can intervene

223
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,520
at the last moment.

224
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,079
Chief Celestial Taoist,

225
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,319
are you going to wait until someone dies?

226
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,160
Is she trying to suck the qi back?

227
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,600
She's naively cute.

228
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,800
Let me see

229
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,600
how long she can hold her breath for.

230
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,600
No.

231
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
I have to intervene now.

232
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:28,280
Relax.

233
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,360
Four-Pillar Barrier.

234
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:37,000
The barrier from the Marquis's family!

235
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,439
It can contain

236
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,680
the ambient energy one diffuses in an attack.

237
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,959
However,

238
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,480
how are they going to collect all the qi in the area?

239
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,480
You're a woman with many tricks.

240
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Feng Baobao,

241
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,760
release all the qi!

242
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:24,040
Go.

243
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:34,800
We saved him.

244
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,319
The winner is

245
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,680
Feng Baobao.

246
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,079
TOP 16 CONTESTANTS

247
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,240
FENG BAOBAO ADVANCED TO THE TOP EIGHT XIAOXIAO, ELIMINATED

248
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,760
Promising youths!

249
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,280
Wang Ye.

250
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,319
Feng Baobao.

251
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,719
Zhang Lingyu, you didn't lie.

252
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,319
It seems like my family has laid low far for too long.

253
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,599
We are out of the loop.

254
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,439
Hold up.

255
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,000
Since you two are in the arena, you might as well stay.

256
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,360
The next match is

257
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:10,199
Zhuge Qing versus Wang Ye.

258
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,160
-Zhuge Qing, my love! -Zhuge Qing, my love!

259
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,280
-I gave you my heart! -I gave you my heart!

260
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:21,680
It's our match now.

261
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,160
What do you say, Taoist Wang?

262
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,079
Bring it on.

263
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,120
Sure.

264
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,800
While your prowess is admirable,

265
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,400
your attitude is a bit lacking.

266
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,240
It's true.

267
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:35,199
However,

268
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,880
it depends on who my enemy is.

269
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,839
Taoist Wang,

270
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,439
you're a bit impatient.

271
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
This strength.

272
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,560
It's Bajiquan.

273
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,120
I never underestimate my opponent.

274
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,680
So I ask you

275
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,160
to do the same.

276
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
It's true

277
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,920
that you're better in close combat.

278
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,520
But don't think for a second

279
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:25,400
that your expertise in Tai Chi

280
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,920
is enough to defeat me.

281
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,040
You know a lot of tricks.

282
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,839
Gen, still as the mountain.

283
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:45,599
I knew it would be difficult.

284
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,079
You didn't even budge.

285
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,599
That's awkward.

286
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,280
Kan.

287
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
How is the match?

288
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,359
Taoist Wang is having a rough time.

289
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:35,839
He attacked right away

290
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,040
unlike what he did in his previous match.

291
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,599
Why is he that impatient?

292
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,520
He almost hit Chief Celestial Taoist!

293
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,599
It's okay.

294
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:10,359
I'm sure he doesn't mind.

295
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,760
What a thrilling match.

296
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,079
That's a speedy water cannonball.

297
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,440
The Zhuge family's Marquis's Qimen

298
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,159
is indeed powerful.

299
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,040
They have complete mastery

300
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,680
of the art of Bagua.

301
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,319
Kan of the Bagua diagram denotes water.

302
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:28,079
So when he uttered Kan,

303
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:29,639
there was bound to be a deluge.

304
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,600
It seems

305
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,120
like Wang Ye will lose soon.

306
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,080
It's still too early to tell.

307
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:55,320
So he could block it.

308
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:57,080
Why didn't he do that earlier?

309
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,040
Tai Chi Yang Palm.

310
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,680
Kun, Boulder Toss.

311
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,440
Rock Meteor.

312
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,320
Zhuge Qing is so impressive.

313
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,480
Thank you, Zhuge Qing.

314
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,919
If you hadn't shown mercy,

315
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,800
I would have been crushed to death.

316
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:47,879
You're welcome.

317
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,960
We don't fight to the death here.

318
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,320
However, Taoist Wang,

319
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:54,879
stop underestimating me.

320
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,360
You are a sorcerer too,

321
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,919
aren't you?

322
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,960
Everyone thinks that a sorcerer

323
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,440
dabbles in the arts of chaos.

324
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,120
Little do they know

325
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,919
that a sorcerer

326
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,639
favors order above all else.

327
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,080
The order we follow

328
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,280
is the order of arcanum.

329
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
It's the hidden law of the universe

330
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
that ordinary people do not understand.

331
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,320
With the right position,

332
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,560
the right time,

333
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,679
and the right force,

334
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,240
you can pursue the good and avoid the danger.

335
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,399
Taoist Wang,

336
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,800
I observed from your previous matches

337
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,720
that your every step

338
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,159
was precisely where it should be.

339
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,320
You positioned yourself

340
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:44,879
in the most auspicious spot.

341
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,480
That's why you could dodge

342
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,040
all the attacks they hurled at you.

343
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,360
Because you manipulated luck

344
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,960
to be on your side.

345
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,240
Did I get it right, Taoist Wang?

346
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,360
What a nuisance.

347
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,560
It's hard to befriend someone like you

348
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:03,800
because I can't have secrets.

349
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,360
I was just trying my luck.

350
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,480
I wanted to defeat you

351
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,240
before you used your Qimen skills.

352
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,639
I guess I made a mistake,

353
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
Zhuge Qing.

354
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,399
Have you ever lost?

355
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,480
Outside of my training with my elders,

356
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,800
no.

357
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,000
Then do you think you can accept defeat?

358
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,000
The kind of defeat

359
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,360
that invalidates all your previous achievements.

360
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,720
Since we're both sorcerers,

361
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,919
there's no need

362
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,600
to get physical like the others.

363
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,080
I'll give you time.

364
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:44,760
Go ahead and find "the most auspicious spot."

365
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,000
Why are they just standing there?

366
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,560
What a twist.

367
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,080
A sorcerer goes with the flow.

368
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,720
Zhuge Qing,

369
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,320
I do not want to humiliate you

370
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,600
and I only say this once.

371
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,520
Go back, Zhuge Qing.

372
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
That is the best option for you.

373
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,080
Have you found your sweet spot?

374
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,600
Taoist Wang,

375
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,960
I performed a divination for myself.

376
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:30,200
And I was given only three words.

377
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,960
"A meaningless struggle."

378
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,120
Kun, Boulder Toss.

379
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,639
Kun, Boulder Toss.

380
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,480
He stood in the spot of Xun, yet he exerted the spell of Kun.

381
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,720
And he overpowered me with that?

382
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,200
I can't find any openings.

383
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,320
Li, Fireball!

384
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:22,600
Xun,

385
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,040
Sandalwood Succor.

386
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,480
Did you see that?

387
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,480
He attacked a tree with a fireball.

388
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,720
-No, you're wrong. -The tree is growing thicker!

389
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,399
No, he used the tree to defend against the fireball.

390
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,520
How can this be?

391
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,679
Impossible. This isn't Qimen Skills at all.

392
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,399
It cannot be.

393
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,240
No sorcerer

394
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,200
can defy the law of elements.

395
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,000
Zhuge Qing,

396
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,480
what do we do now?

397
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,679
Should we stop here?

398
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,600
You've divined for yourself already.

399
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,360
Taoist Wang,

400
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,159
maybe I am destined to be defeated.

401
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,840
Maybe this defeat will bruise my ego.

402
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,679
But for a sorcerer,

403
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,960
one thing is more important than ego.

404
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,840
It's the truth.

405
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,000
If I'm defeated here,

406
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:11,760
I need to know

407
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,040
what kind of power I lose to.

408
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,120
QIMEN'S IMMACULATE SCRUTINY

409
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,879
It's Qimen's Immaculate Scrutiny!

410
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,320
The user's perception

411
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:30,439
will be greatly enhanced,

412
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,399
and he can see all that is not visible,

413
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,800
including the nature of a matter.

414
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:35,439
This spell-slinging match

415
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,919
is such a nail-biter!

416
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,320
A nail-biter?

417
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,480
Isn't the match lopsided enough?

418
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,280
Zhuge Qing was in the spot of Kun,

419
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,639
but his Boulder Toss was outmatched.

420
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,760
He threw a fireball in the spot of Li,

421
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,760
but it was countered by a wood-based spell of all things!

422
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,639
Qimen's Immaculate Scrutiny!

423
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,439
Zhuge Qing, I'm begging you.

424
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,159
Stop it.

425
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,600
He is way beyond your league!

426
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,280
I don't want to see you defeated.

427
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,960
Come, Taoist Wang.

428
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,879
Show me what you have got.

429
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,480
Dui, Black Mamba!

430
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,320
What have you done?

431
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,840
Teleportation?

432
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:29,760
That's my sister's technique.

433
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,040
Can Zhuge Qing teleport too?

434
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,879
No, Taoist Wang teleported Zhuge Qing.

435
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,439
He is now restrained by Taoist Wang.

436
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,639
I paralyzed your Danzhong pressure point.

437
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,040
It's over.

438
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:00,439
I

439
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:02,199
lost.

440
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,639
But I saw nothing happen.

441
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,919
Why did he give up?

442
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,159
Wang Ye managed

443
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,520
to outclass Zhuge Qing.

444
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,280
But in terms of sorcery,

445
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,159
none should be able

446
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,879
to surpass the Zhuge family.

447
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,800
The divine dragon granted us the divine chart.

448
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:24,919
From ruler to ruler, it was passed down.

449
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,879
The astrologian Feng Hou deciphered it into text.

450
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,639
Thus, the art of Qimen was born.

451
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,879
Lu Jin, though no one has seen it before,

452
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,399
one of the Eight Supremes

453
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,960
is Qimen Manipulation.

454
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,399
Thank goodness

455
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,760
we stayed to see this.

456
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,120
While Qi Apotheosis remains elusive,

457
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,679
Qimen Manipulation makes an appearance.

458
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,360
See?

459
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,360
Zhuge Qing!

460
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,439
Stop now!

461
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,399
Stop!

462
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,800
I said, stop!

463
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,080
Zhuge Qing!

464
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,879
I told you to stop!

465
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,600
Didn't you hear me?

466
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,919
I wanted to perform another divination for myself.

467
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,520
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

468
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,960
I can accept defeat.

469
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,760
But I cannot accept it

470
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,639
without knowing how I was defeated!

471
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:52,080
Forgive me.

472
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,399
My masters and grandmasters, forgive my insolence.

473
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,720
Forgive me.

474
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,040
You forced me to say those vile things!

475
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,159
You…

476
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,199
Whatever.

477
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,199
I shouldn't have come here.

478
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,000
I guess this is the end of my peaceful days.

479
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,480
Zhuge Qing,

480
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,320
look carefully now.

481
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,080
I knew it.

482
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,760
You're a Qimen sorcerer too.

483
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,919
Zhuge Qing,

484
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,439
you did lose your composure.

485
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,320
You know I am a sorcerer.

486
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:43,879
So why did you have tunnel vision on me?

487
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,480
Look at the chart.

488
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,800
What's wrong with the chart?

489
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:49,000
Isn't it a normal…

490
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,480
chart.

491
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:57,679
Can you see it now?

492
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,639
Unlike sorcerers who seek to find the most advantageous spot,

493
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,360
in this chart,

494
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,679
I embody all positions.

495
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,159
I am both fortune and misfortune.

496
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,520
Time, space,

497
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,120
and the law of elements,

498
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,720
I decide them all.

499
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,360
During our match,

500
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:17,199
I didn't touch you at all.

501
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,959
But since this space is under my command,

502
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,760
so is your position.

503
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,399
I can attack you from anywhere

504
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,080
and strike your weak spot.

505
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,480
You manipulate the chart with your will.

506
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,800
But the chart

507
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:36,199
is dictated by time.

508
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,480
You can't possibly manipulate time.

509
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,919
Why not?

510
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,120
Time is but a measurement of evolution.

511
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:47,280
For someone who remains eternal,

512
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,959
time becomes meaningless.

513
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,360
Manipulating the evolution of all matters

514
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:53,520
is equivalent to manipulating time.

515
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
I can manipulate anything

516
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,040
in this Qimen chart.

517
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,040
From now on,

518
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,480
this space's gravity will be different from the outside world.

519
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,840
It will take this pebble a minute

520
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:10,399
to fall to the ground.

521
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,159
Is it warm now?

522
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,600
Is the wind blowing another way?

523
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,280
It's almost spring now,

524
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,879
but I can change the temperature and humidity of this place

525
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,639
to resemble summer.

526
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,959
You say a sorcerer selects the most auspicious spot

527
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,480
and is bound by the law of the universe.

528
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,679
I agree.

529
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,879
But it's not entirely true.

530
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
Why is your ancestor

531
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:33,520
considered to be the greatest Outsider to have ever existed?

532
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,199
As a sorcerer of immense power,

533
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,840
did he not foresee the decline of the imperial family?

534
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,760
Did he not know that division brings unity

535
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,959
and unity brings division?

536
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,080
If he wanted to stay at the most auspicious spot,

537
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:47,000
he should have stayed in his hometown.

538
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,280
With that kind of power,

539
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,760
he could have easily

540
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,360
achieved greater heights.

541
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:55,040
But he gave up his enlightenment.

542
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,040
Despite the ominous tidings,

543
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,399
he threw himself into mortal affairs

544
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,879
because he wanted

545
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,199
to save the world that was beyond redemption.

546
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,080
He fought the universe and destiny

547
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,760
for the world he believed in.

548
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,080
To attempt the unimaginable.

549
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,159
That's what a sorcerer of his caliber did.

550
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,879
If staying at the most auspicious spot

551
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,399
and following the law of the universe

552
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,240
are what a sorcerer should do,

553
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,919
why should we seek the truth?

554
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,280
Whether we follow the order or not,

555
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,120
whether we are Outsiders or ordinary people,

556
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,439
we are all bound by something,

557
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
are we not?

558
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,879
Most Outsiders

559
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:41,600
hit a wall because of their inner demons.

560
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,399
Your ancestor, Zhuge Liang,

561
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,959
turned away from enlightenment

562
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,560
for the people he cared about.

563
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,280
That is what makes him great.

564
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,800
In my eyes,

565
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:52,120
Zhuge Liang, Lyu Dongbin,

566
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:53,280
and Zhang Sanfeng,

567
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,600
these past legendary figures,

568
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,240
are the ones I revere the most.

569
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,399
I lost.

570
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,000
I lost completely.

571
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:14,199
Taoist Wang,

572
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,800
I surrender.

573
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,000
Wang Ye versus Zhuge Qing.

574
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,120
The winner is

575
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:22,320
Wang Ye.

576
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,080
Congratulations, Wang Ye.

577
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,439
Don't despair, Qingqing!

578
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,280
It's okay, Qingqing!

579
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,520
Don't worry, Qingqing!

580
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,959
We will always support you!

581
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,360
Taoist Wang.

582
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:44,679
If I may ask one last question,

583
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,280
what is the name

584
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,919
of your technique?

585
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,800
I have told you enough things.

586
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:52,040
Don't be greedy now.

587
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,919
You can divine the answer yourself.

588
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,480
But I won't stop you if you court death again.

589
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:05,199
I didn't expect to see someone like him from Mount Wudang.

590
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,679
How did he escape my notice?

591
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:08,760
Can I trust you

592
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,040
to recruit Wang Ye

593
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,439
to All-Encompassing Guild?

594
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,760
Chulan,

595
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,240
your next opponent will be Wang Ye.

596
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,600
Goodness me!

597
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:18,840
There's no way I can defeat him.

598
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:21,199
Dad, he's so strong.

599
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,879
I can't defeat him.

600
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,199
We can't kidnap him, can we?

601
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:27,320
Did I teach you nothing at all?

602
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:29,000
Everyone covets something.

603
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,800
You just need to identify what he is after.

604
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,439
But…

605
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,000
But I don't know him that well.

606
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:37,280
Use your brain.

607
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,520
What does a Taoist need?

608
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,800
Money, of course.

609
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:41,199
Only poor people turn to religion.

610
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,679
What's wrong, Baobao?
