1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,000
Hongyo and Akari-san,

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,560
did something happen on their date?

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,440
I'm curious...

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,440
But not really!

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,320
Well,

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,560
by doing it just once or twice with Hongyo,

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,960
I felt like I had more advantage than Akari-san,

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,280
but, in reality,

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,520
that thing has no meaning at all.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,520
What are you doing Terada-san?

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,360
Cleaning up the sink...

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,480
You're working hard...

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,820
No...

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,020
I'm free anyway...

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,440
I...

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,040
...have always waited.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,860
I've never done anything.

18
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,480
I never did something myself.

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,080
Hongyo!

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,780
What?

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,300
Well...

22
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,020
I mean...

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,100
Think of something! Think of something!

24
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,840
Just say anything that I can do right now.

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,280
Terada-san?

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,520
Sleeping together,

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,080
do you want to do it?

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,160
Well, I mean, only if you really need it...

29
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,000
Really?

30
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,600
When?

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,880
Tonight?

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,880
Tonight is a bit...

33
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,620
Then, how about tomorrow?

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,660
All right.

35
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,380
Thank you, Terada-san.

36
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,820
You just saved me.

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,820
Good night, then.

38
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,820
Good night.

39
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,480
I saved him, huh?

40
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,100
Huh?

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,840
Is this okay, though?

42
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,220
I like it like that babe, give me last first kiss ♫

55
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,280
It's not okay after all...

56
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,140
I've thought about it all night long,

57
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,940
and I felt that this isn't right after all.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,900
Let's cancel it...

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,840
He's not there?

60
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,260
Ah? Terada-san?

61
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,160
- Good work today.
- You too.

62
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,000
Would you like a cup of coffee?

63
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,880
Yes, thank you.

64
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,800
Those kind of feelings...

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,900
...are what I have for Tomoya.

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,640
- Here.
- Thank you.

67
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,400
By the way,

68
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,880
um...

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,860
Did something happen?

70
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,840
I wonder how you felt after going on a date with Hongyo...

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,980
I'm a bit curious...

72
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,840
Ah, right...

73
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,940
I've tried asking him a favor, though.

74
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
A favor?

75
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,980
There's still one more proposal.

76
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,420
I have a favor to ask you...

77
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,340
I-I-I want you to give me a hug and a kiss...

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,640
If we're going to marry,

79
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,920
I think those things are important.

80
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,780
I don't think that's possible.

81
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,300
WHY?!

82
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,520
Doing those kind of things with you,

83
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,520
I think,

84
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,460
it would feel like I'm peeing on a stone statue of Jizo (guardian deity of children). Or something like that.

85
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,520
- Peeing...?
- Well, to be honest, I felt a bit glad.

86
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,920
That means, Tomoya thinks of me as a sacred thing that shouldn't be stained,

87
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,280
or, a holy ground that he shouldn't invade, right?

88
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,780
Why? Is there any problem?

89
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,160
Our feelings are mutual, in a way.

90
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,400
But, still...

91
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,420
I feel like it made me want to try all those things with him even more.

92
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,080
Is that so...

93
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,400
I see.

94
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,560
Akari-san feels those were some nice words.

95
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,840
That means...

96
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,540
Nothing happened on that date, huh?

97
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,380
I feel relieved.

98
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,300
Huh? Terada-san?

99
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,820
You're heading home?

100
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,200
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

102
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,860
What are you gonna cook today?

103
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,160
No. Akari-san won't be home tonight, so, I think I'll eat at a convenience store.

104
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,260
Then. How about eating out somewhere?

105
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,520
- But...
- Why?

106
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,340
Are you nervous after I seriously proposed to you?

107
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,000
Well....

108
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,280
You really are.

109
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,540
I feel glad that you're aware of my feelings.

110
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,280
I really want to eat yakiniku right now.

111
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,280
Please come with me.

112
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,720
Yakiniku...

113
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,840
This is...

114
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,200
...different from the yakiniku I know!!

115
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,700
Really? This is the kind of yakiniku I always eat.

116
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,560
I'll go for the tongue! Tongue!

117
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,280
But, before eating the meat,

118
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,020
you want some salad first?

119
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,080
No, I'm fine. I'll scoop it myself.

120
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,480
Then. I'll dig in first.

121
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
That's the way it is, huh?

122
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,060
"Adequate for my needs."

123
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,660
Never mind.

124
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,840
Let's grill the tongue.

125
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,420
So good!

126
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,080
So good!

127
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,140
Today was truly a feast.

128
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,580
Thank you so much!

129
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,420
Don't mention it.

130
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,940
It was really good!

131
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,440
It was my first time eating that kind of meat.

132
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,960
Glad to hear that.

133
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,960
What should we do next? Go for a second round?

134
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,240
Ah, no...

135
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,980
I already have plans for today...

136
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,980
Plans? After this?

137
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,780
Yes.

138
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,820
What is it? Sleep with Tomo again?

139
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,480
How do you know?

140
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,960
So, that's true...

141
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,160
You're still gonna do that for real?

142
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,560
You were so worried about being pregnant that you couldn't tell Tomo anything.

143
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,080
Now that you're not pregnant, you decided to do it again so easily?

144
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,820
I mean, Tomo also already thought about doing that again, huh?

145
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,020
Are you a fool, Terada-san?

146
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,800
Yes.

147
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,940
I'm a fool.

148
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,420
You know,

149
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,120
I'm already so full right now.

150
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,160
So, good night.

151
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,600
Hase-san's heartbeat,

152
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,160
I could feel it clearly.

153
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,320
Come to think of it,

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,480
being hugged normally like this,

155
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,520
this is the first time after a long time.

156
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,140
What should I do?

157
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,700
I might enjoy this...

158
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,100
The relationships I've had so far were,

159
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,960
when I was in junior high, with this carefree little ordinary boy,

160
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,740
Hongyo Tomoya.

161
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,940
Our relationship didn't last long.

162
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,700
The second guy was when I was in high school.

163
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,620
Let's just break up.

164
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,480
I didn't even know why I dated him.

165
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
We broke up so easily.

166
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,800
Then...

167
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,140
The 3rd boyfriend that I had dated since we were university students,

168
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,920
he cheated on me,

169
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,920
or had a change of heart.

170
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,920
In other words,

171
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,200
In my whole life,

172
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,720
I've never had any memories of being passionately needed by someone.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,060
This isn't right.

174
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,280
This isn't right!

175
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,780
I feel like,

176
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,220
I am, indeed,

177
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,960
enjoying this.

178
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,560
Ah, sorry!

179
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,840
I have to go back to the office.

180
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,840
Can you go home by yourself?

181
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,180
Yes.

182
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,380
I'm sorry. You can use this for the taxi fare...

183
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,960
No need to! I'm fine. Really.

184
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,140
Is that so?

185
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,760
Then, take care.

186
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,320
Thank you for today.

187
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,860
I'm the one who is thankful. Thank you for the meal.

188
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,060
Darn it!

189
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,880
I wanted to slowly close the gap between us, but why was I impulsively doing that?

190
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,700
But...

191
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,980
Tomo also already thought about doing that again, huh?

192
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,980
Are you a fool, Terada-san?

193
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,700
Yes.

194
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,300
I'm a fool.

195
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,300
I think you should stop sleeping together with him.

196
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,860
I'm afraid that you may experience something bad later.

197
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,800
Welcome home.

198
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,080
I'm home!

199
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,160
You went out?

200
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,160
Yes. To have dinner.

201
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,880
By the way...

202
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,340
Hongyo.

203
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,340
It's about our sleeping-together plan.

204
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,840
Sorry!

205
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,480
Is it okay if we don't do it tonight?

206
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,160
Forgive me for saying such a selfish thing!

207
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,620
But, you know, after I thought about it once more,

208
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,620
I felt this isn't quite right...

209
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,160
But you were the one who suggested it.

210
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,720
Why cancel it now?

211
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,960
I was trying to tell you this morning, but, you weren't home.

212
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,700
I really...

213
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,320
...feel guilty towards you,

214
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,740
but, today...

215
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,100
Well...

216
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,560
But...

217
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,120
Hongyo?

218
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,700
I get it. Let's not do it today.

219
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,020
I'm really sorry! Hongyo...

220
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,140
He looked a bit scary...

221
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,140
Hongyo...

222
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,860
Was he mad?

223
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,000
It's nice to know that someone needs me.

224
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,940
While thinking about Hase-san's heartbeat,

225
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,300
I can't help but imagining the warmth of Hongyo's body on my back right now.

226
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,260
Somehow...

227
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,580
I feel suffocated.

228
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,860
It's killing me.

229
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,780
Is this because I feel guilty towards Hongyo?

230
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,500
Or...

231
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,600
Basically, Terada-san has no confidence in herself.

232
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,880
That's why, she tends to get influenced easily.

233
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,420
I impulsively hugged her last night and she hugged me back because she couldn't help it.

234
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,500
If that's the case,

235
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,800
then, I should make a good use of it.

236
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,300
Hase-san...

237
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,300
Good morning!

238
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,920
You got up early even though it's your day off.

239
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,160
I'm thinking of finishing my work at home today.

240
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,400
Is that so?

241
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,860
Request : Mapo Tofu - Sichuan-Style.

242
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,380
"Sichuan-style..."

243
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,700
Can I make it?

244
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,500
Terada-san, can you help me for a moment?

245
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,720
Of course I will pay you.

246
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,340
I want to stick some materials into a scrapbook.

247
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,840
- Yes. I can help you with that.
- Really?

248
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,500
Then, let's do it.

249
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,500
I'll be in my room, okay?

250
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,960
Okay.

251
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,500
He's great as usual...

252
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,820
By the way,

253
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,640
you didn't sleep together last night, did you?

254
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,480
No...

255
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,480
Glad to hear that.

256
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,680
Also, I'm sorry for doing such a weird thing yesterday.

257
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,220
No.

258
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,660
Don't worry about that.

259
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,860
I also sent you that message in the end.

260
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,480
You know, it was also my first time doing something impulsive like that.

261
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,860
I don't know why I did that.

262
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,520
Terada-san gets influenced easily,

263
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,060
so, she just needs something to trigger her.

264
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,060
Hase-san?

265
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,120
Ah, but, this kind of excuse might sound too far-fetched.

266
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,600
Wait...

267
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,600
Hase-san?

268
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,360
What?

269
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,360
I'm so tired!

270
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,640
Let's take a break.

271
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,320
Sorry, we've got a lot of materials here.

272
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,000
Well...

273
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,500
You know, um, I just...

274
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,780
...remembered...

275
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,740
I got some work to do...

276
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,180
Is that so?

277
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,520
Then, that's it...

278
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,360
...for today.

279
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,540
Goodbye...

280
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,420
What was that?

281
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,140
It was only for a brief moment, but he kissed me?

282
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,840
But...

283
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,320
maybe,

284
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,100
I was...

285
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,700
...slightly aware of that.

286
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,500
I knew Hase-san is serious about me.

287
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,640
It would be embarrassing if I misunderstood him, so I denied it desperately, to cover it up.

288
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,240
I stepped into that room without having any expectations.

289
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,340
I got carried away...

290
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,860
...for a while.

291
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,740
I think...

292
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,360
...I must have turned her off, right?

293
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,120
Yes. I'm sure of it.

294
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,980
I mean,

295
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,520
I'm so incompetent!

296
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,500
I was too hasty, no matter how I look at it...

297
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,540
By using such a lame excuse,

298
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,540
I invited her to my room.

299
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,680
What was I doing, really?

300
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,240
I think I got carried away somehow...

301
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,880
But...

302
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,880
I didn't feel anything at all.

303
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,880
It was just...

304
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,420
...a simple kiss.

305
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,520
If it was Hongyo,

306
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,520
I would have exploded!

307
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,720
Somehow...

308
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,160
Being touched by him already made me happy,

309
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,160
embarrassed...

310
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,400
and feel weird...

311
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,240
From the back side of my stomach,

312
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,780
I'd have felt the explosion.

313
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,740
I see...

314
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,180
So, that's how it is...

315
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,060
I realized it once again...

316
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,360
Hase, you were home?

317
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,660
Yes. I'm working at home today.

318
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,720
- You're making coffee?
- Yes.

319
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,260
You want some too?

320
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,360
Yes.

321
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,780
What are you doing?

322
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,280
Nothing.

323
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,420
Are you waiting for Terada-san?

324
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,440
No.

325
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,820
I see.

326
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,420
Come to think of it, Tomo...

327
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,440
...did it with Terada-san, right?

328
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,260
I wonder...

329
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,340
...how he feels about her.

330
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,800
Such a good smell.

331
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,340
You startled me!

332
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,140
It's because I just bought it.

333
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,260
What are you doing, Tomo?

334
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,080
It's indeed this smell.

335
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,220
Your perfume.

336
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,980
What about that?

337
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,260
When Terada-san came home last night,

338
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,860
I smelled this perfume.

339
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,300
That smell wouldn't have lingered on her if you just went out together, right?

340
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,240
I was marking my scent on her.

341
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,620
I'm going back to my room.

342
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,960
The coffee will be ready in a minute. Please enjoy it!

343
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,920
After that kiss with Hase-san,

344
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,300
I'm even more convinced about my feelings for Hongyo.

345
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,920
What should I do?
