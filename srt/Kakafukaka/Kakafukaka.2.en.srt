1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,080
Sharehouse?

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,420
Terada-san?

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,780
This Hongyo Tomoya was my classmate...

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,080
He was also my first boyfriend...

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,920
And...

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,780
He was also the first person I did "that thing" with.

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,280
Actually,

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,740
I had failed to get an erection for the last two years.

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,740
I want you to help me.

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,680
I will never do anything weird to you.

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,440
I'm home~!

12
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,760
Tomo?

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,700
Sorry! I will come back in an hour.

14
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,960
Hey, wait!

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,960
Feel free to continue...

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,640
I..

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,160
...live here.

18
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,380
She's Terada Aki-san.

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,180
You're the girl Nori-chan mentioned before?

20
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,500
Hello. Nice to meet you.

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,640
I'm Terada.

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,640
Hello. I'm Hase.

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,340
I'm an editor.

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,980
You can also say I'm the owner of this house.

25
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,740
I hope we can get along well.

26
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,620
Me too.

27
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,240
Sorry, I can only greet you now.

28
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,000
That's okay.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,480
He probably didn't explain anything to you, did he?

30
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,080
- I did.
- I know you didn't.

31
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,340
I'll tell you just the important things for now.

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,200
Okay.

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,400
The rent is 50,000 yen a month, including electricity, gas and water supplies.

34
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,020
You may pay by cash or bank wire. Either way is OK.

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,680
Okay. Noted.

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,300
Also, if anything happens, write it here...

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,860
Thank you for everything.
I'll live happily.
Nori.

38
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,760
Nori-chan,
congratulations.
Aki.

39
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,480
You already wrote something.

40
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,480
I'm sorry...

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,260
By the way, what were you guys doing earlier?

42
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,700
- Well, that's...
- About that,

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,280
listen to me, Hase.

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,860
You'll tell him?

45
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,680
Actually,

46
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,420
if I get closer to her, my body will react.

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,500
I asked for her help so I can be cured.

48
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,980
Isn't that good?

49
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,980
There's still a hope, right, Tomo?

50
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,920
Yeah.

51
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,540
I was a bit excited.

52
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,380
They're so open to each other...

53
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,100
Then, Terada-san!

54
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,640
Can you do it with Tomo for just a moment?

55
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,240
No way!

56
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,480
Why?

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,560
Well, she'll help me as long as I don't do anything weird to her.

58
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,560
Is that so?

59
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,640
But, isn't it amazing?

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,060
I heard you guys were classmates in junior high.

61
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,060
Ah, it's just...

62
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,760
...a coincidence.

63
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,040
Has Tomo always been like this, even in the past?

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,900
Indeed,

65
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,780
I think I couldn't figure out what was on his mind back then...

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,400
I knew it.

67
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,920
In our junior high days, Hongyo...

68
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,760
was plain, quiet, and invisible.

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,760
But...

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,840
I felt he was a bit different from the other boys.

71
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,640
Hongyo is a bit cute, isn't he?

72
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,400
Are you crazy?!

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,860
But, rather than love or any romantic emotion,

74
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,400
it was probably my superiority complex that caused me to have a different point of view from the other girls.

75
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,200
When we were in junior high, Terada-san really stood out.

76
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,460
She was like the center of the class.

77
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,700
Well, Hongyo.

78
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,460
You don't look like it.

79
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,140
Well, I guess I was a little stupid at that time.

80
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,520
It's just a dark past for me now...

81
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,600
Sorry, I have to go back to the office.

82
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Let's talk again later.

83
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,060
Okay.

84
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,060
Tomo.

85
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,560
Come here.

86
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,560
Then, Terada-san, see you later!

87
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,160
I'm off.

88
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,780
Take care.

89
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,780
Terada-san,

90
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,780
can we sleep together tonight?

91
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,660
Did he just indoctrinate you?

92
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,400
He said, if I sleep with you,

93
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,220
maybe I can get my healthy morning back.

94
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,440
That means, in other words,

95
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,880
I want to give it a try.

96
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,360
Maybe I can feel it.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,380
I want to feel it again after such a long time...

98
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,320
My healthy morning...

99
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,160
- Healthy morning?
- Please, Terada-san.

100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,160
Please help me.

101
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,320
Of course I won't do anything weird to you.

102

Well...

106
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,920
What should I do...?

107
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,360
Then...

108
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,500
Try to sleep on that side of the bed.

109
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,020
Excuse me...

110
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,920
Of course we will get this close when we're sleeping, right?

111
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,920
By the way,

112
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,920
can I directly touch your body?

113
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,920
Touch where?

114
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,920
Anywhere...

115
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,780
Anywhere...?

116
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Then, your belly?

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,880
Why so sudden?

118
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,700
Well, it's just,

119
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,400
I want to touch it...

120
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,400
But...

121
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,300
I'll just place my hand there...

122
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,380
I won't make any movement.

123
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,960
Please?

124
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,700
If you only place your hand, then...

125
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,680
Thank you, Terada-san...

126
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,800
Sorry, is my hand cold?

127
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,980
It will warm up right away...

128
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,420
Just as I thought...

129
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,960
It feels really good...

130
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,160
What?

131
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,560
What is this?

132
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,320
What the heck am I doing?

133
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,000
At first I didn't want to do this...

134
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,440
I didn't think I wanted to do something like this with Hongyo...

135
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,520
But...

136
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,400
now that his hand feels so warm,

137
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,340
I wonder if I actually want it to move around...

138
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,260
He's sleeping?

139
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,980
He can sleep in this kind of situation?

140
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,900
I feel like...

141
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,020
I'm so embarrassed.

142
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,880
I can't sleep like this!

143
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,900
I'm surprised that I could sleep so well!

144
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,500
Somehow I feel so mad...

145
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,720
But, this is bad...

146
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,360
At this rate, I will become a woman who cannot say "no" to his requests.

147
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
I can't be like this!

148
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,320
I gotta get my shit together!

149
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,060
Good morning...

150
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,060
Good morning!

151
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,860
Terada-san, when did you get up?

152
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,920
I thought I shouldn't wake you up...

153
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,260
You want coffee?

154
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, please.

155
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,540
Anyway,

156
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,500
I thought I was actually on the right track...

157
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,680
I mean it was really close...

158
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,980
It's like, I'm a half game behind the leading team in Baseball.

159
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,180
Is it about the "healthy morning"?

160
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,260
Just as I thought, it didn't work...

161
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,360
Well, you know, about that...

162
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,920
Ah, but...

163
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,480
If you're by my side when I wake up,

164
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,480
I think I can do it.

165
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,480
So, next time,

166
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,640
I want us to wake up together.

167
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,800
"Next time"?

168
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,060
Even though I couldn't achieve my goal, somehow,

169
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,220
I felt like I could sleep well after a long time.

170
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you, Terada-san.

171
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,580
Do you have sugar?

172
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,500
Oooucch!!

173
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,960
What is this?!

174
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,720
Ah, that's mine!

175
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,940
Sorry!

176
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,940
"Hongyo Tomoya"...

177
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,420
Your name is written here.

178
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,420
Yes. Because that's mine.

179
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,980
These are the copies of my new book.

180
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,000
Hongyo, you're a novelist?

181
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,320
Yeah. Pretty much.

182
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,400
Let's go!

183
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,880
That Hongyo is a novelist...

184
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,300
But, I feel like I can understand that...

185
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,300
Terada-san?

186
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,420
Ah! Hello.

187
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,840
Just back from shopping?

188
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,900
Yes. I resigned from my part-time job today. I just came back from there.

189
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,040
Part-time job?

190
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,240
I worked at a convenience store, but I quit because it was too far from here.

191
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,260
Have you decided on your next job yet?

192
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,960
Not yet...

193
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,800
Then, it might be a good timing.

194
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,140
My friend's design company is currently looking for a part-time worker, what do you think?

195
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,300
Well, I can't do designs...

196
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,040
Don't worry! You'll only do miscellaneous duties.

197
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,960
- Then, if it's only for that...
- Okay, I'll try to contact them.

198
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,320
Well...

199
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,960
Hase-san, you're an editor, right?

200
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,960
Did you know Hongyo...

201
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,620
...through work?

202
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,120
Yes.

203
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,340
When I was in the previous department, I was in charge of Tomo.

204
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,880
He looks like he's been living in danger,

205
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,220
I thought he was going to die.

206
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,780
I mean, he's like a fragile living creature who lives in this society...

207
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,100
I think I can understand you.

208
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,400
I thought it would be a big trouble if he died,

209
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,500
so, I decided to live with him while taking care of him as well.

210
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,960
He's still not one of those notable writers out there,

211
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,600
but, he has some loyal fans who will always buy his works.

212
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,720
Hongyo is really amazing...

213
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,160
Sorry for all the sudden things...

214
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,140
By the way, Terada-san,

215
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,140
how was your sleep?

216
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,580
Ah! What is this?

217
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,180
You guys looked like you had a really good sleep.

218
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,000
But...

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,280
Why does Tomo only "react" when he's with you?

220
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,920
Did something happen in junior high?

221
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,880
NO! Nothing was big enough to be considered "something"...

222
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,380
Okay, everybody!

223
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,360
Today, we have a new staff member who will work with us for a while. Here's Terada-san!

224
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,760
I'm Terada Aki.

225
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,540
Nice to meet you all.

226
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,300
Kuri-chan, Kuri-chan, Kuri-chan.

227
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,860
Please tell her about all the basic stuff.

228
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,600
- Me?
- Yeah. I'll leave her to you.

229
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,320
Okay.

230
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,580
Hello. I'm Kuritani Akari.

231
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,660
I'm Terada Aki.

232
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,180
Nice to meet you.

233
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,180
Terada-san,

234
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,580
have we met somewhere before?

235
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,400
No...

236
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,040
I don't think so...

237
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,220
Really?

238
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,960
Well, whatever.

239
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,680
You will do miscellaneous tasks here.

240
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,760
Like an errand girl or something.

241
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,000
I will ask you to do this right away,

242
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,400
do you know a place called "Koeisha" in Jinbocho?

243
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,720
Deliver this to the Baiser editorial department there.

244
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,760
Okay...

245
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,780
Will you be all right?

246
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
Ah, well, maybe...

247
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,880
Don't give me such ambiguous answers like "ah" or "well".

248
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,080
Ah, I'm sorry!

249
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,060
You don't need to say "ah" before answering.

250
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,520
Okay.

251
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,400
Will you really be all right?

252
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,240
You were recommended by Hase-kun, right?

253
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,680
What's your relationship with him?

254
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,380
I know him because...

255
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,240
...we've been living in the same sharehouse...

256
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,360
Aaah!

257
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,340
I see!

258
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,840
I thought I heard your name before.

259
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,360
You're the girl who replaces Nori-chan to live with us!

260
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,760
- Eh, that means...
- Ah, sorry...

261
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,200
I didn't have the time to greet you before this.

262
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,040
I also live in that sharehouse.

263
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,440
Ah, is that so?

264
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,060
I heard you were Tomoya's classmate?

265
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,460
Well, yeah...

266
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,700
Then, you must have it, right? The school yearbook?

267
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,520
The school yearbook! The school yearbook!

268
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,460
Well, it's somewhere in my house...

269
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,760
When will you go home?

270
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,700
Akari!

271
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,840
Kuri-chan, you're at work now...

272
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,840
You're right. I'm sorry.

273
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,940
I will...

274
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,640
...deliver this for now.

275
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,900
Thanks.

276
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,900
Let's talk again later.

277
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,760
The 3rd housemate that I finally met,

278
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,760
Kuritani Akari-san,

279
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,860
is apparently a hardcore fan of novelist Hongyo Tomoya!

280
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,880
Tomoya is a genius.

281
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,040
A genius...?

282
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,680
When I read his book for the first time,

283
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,300
the impact was so powerful that I felt like all the cells in my body were regenerated.

284
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,340
Then, I just knew it for sure,

285
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,940
that I was born to meet him.

286
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,680
Also, please remember this only.

287
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,500
I know you used to date him and just happened to meet him again.

288
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,780
But, don't think you're special, or this is some kind of fate, okay?!

289
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,260
I'm the only one who can understand Tomoya's inner soul.

290
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,800
Because I'm his soulmate.

291
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,300
Ah, all right.

292
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,540
Well, I will never think like that.

293
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,040
For now, just don't act all too friendly with him.

294
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,120
Because Tomoya is so pure and delicate.

295
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,120
I'm home~

296
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,220
Ah, I'm so tired.

297
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,220
Welcome home.

298
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,420
I'm home.

299
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,840
You've worked hard!
How was your first day?

300
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,840
Hase-san.

301
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,620
Why didn't you tell me about Akari-san?!

302
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,280
Everything about her...

303
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,280
Huh? I didn't tell you?

304
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,640
Ah, sorry!

305
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,480
I mean, Akari-san has feelings for Hongyo...

306
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,480
Yeah.

307
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,200
It's like she's his believer or something.

308
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,900
If Akari-san sees that pict of us sleeping together,

309
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,940
Right?

310
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,780
I'm already scared just by thinking about it.

311
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,660
But, I just cooperated with Hongyo because he asked me to help him.

312
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,260
I don't have to feel guilty about it,
and if I explain to her properly...

313
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,180
Well, the condition is already weird from the beginning.

314
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
He can't do it with other women,

315
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,840
but, if it's with you, he will "react".
The hell is that?

316
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,900
It's almost like you're feeling guilty.

317
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,400
Besides,

318
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,240
I think it's because you're somewhat special, right, Terada-san?

319
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,000
No way...

320
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,900
Huh? You're still awake?

321
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,320
Welcome home.

322
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,620
By the way, Terada-san...

323
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,980
- Can we sleep together tonight?
- NO!

324
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,540
Why?

325
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,540
Because....

326
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,080
- ...Akari-san is...
- Akari?

327
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,080
What's with her?

328
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,760
Well...

329
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,340
If Akari-san knows about it....

330
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,340
I don't know why but,

331
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,320
Akari texted me saying she won't come home today.

332
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,320
But...

333
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,140
Terada-san...

334
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,140
For tonight,

335
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,060
please sleep with me!

336
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,400
Even though I thought "what the hell?"

337
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,020
It was impossible...

338
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,280
Even though I thought it was stupid.

339
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,780
I think Terada-san...

340
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,360
...is my only hope for now.

341
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,500
But still,

342
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,920
I was a little bit happy.

343
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,480
When he told me that it must be me...

344
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,940
Ah, I feel so calm...

345
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,100
I think it's because you're somewhat special, right, Terada-san?

346
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,780
No.

347
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,140
Even if I'm special, it's just about his body that somehow reacts to mine.

348
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,660
Hongyo himself probably...

349
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,580
...doesn't even want to be with me.

350
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,160
Hey...

351
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,160
Hongyo...

352
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,800
Hm?

353
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,800
I want to ask a simple question...

354
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,800
Hm?

355
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,920
I don't mean it in a weird way,

356
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,260
But,

357
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,800
now that your body has become like this...

358
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,540
You don't have any urge...

359
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,580
...to do "that"?

360
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,780
Even if it's just a little bit?

361
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,780
Of course I really want to do it.

362
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,800
- Is that so?!
- You startled me!

363
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,320
Let go of me.

364
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,420
- Why are you running away?
- Well, it's because, because...

365
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,160
Don't worry!

366
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,680
I won't do anything weird because that's what I promised you.

367
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,820
I want to ask about that too.

368
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,900
When you said "anything weird",

369
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,900
what is that?

370
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,880
What's considered...

371
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,520
..."weird"?

372
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,360
Everything you don't want to do is the "weird" thing.

373
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,720
If you're okay with that, then, it's not considered "weird".

374
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,260
So, I'm the judge here?!

375
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,260
What should I do??
