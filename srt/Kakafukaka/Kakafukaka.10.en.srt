1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,900
Huh? Disbandment?

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,260
I think it's about time for us to do it.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,480
But, I'm not saying you should get out right away.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,560
No! There's no way I'll get out of here.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,280
But, Tomo, in the first place, this house is...

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,900
Right. I can't go along with this plan either.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,660
This is surprising. I didn't think you would reject this idea.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,580
Really? Can you please think it over, Hase-kun?

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,980
If we're disbanding right now, what about my meal time then?

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,960
Imagine what will happen to my digestive system that has become completely healthy because of Terada-san's cooking?

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,140
- Well, even if you say that...
- If you really want to disband,

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,940
then, I, Tomoya, and Terada-san will live together in another sharehouse.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,720
You'll do that, right, Terada-san?

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,200
Terada-san will go towards the ones who need her the most.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,640
So to speak,

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,820
you'll grant whatever is asked for!

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:10,520
Then, as a person who needs Terada-san because food is the most important thing in her life, I'm the strongest candidate here!

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,700
Calm down, Akari.

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,560
Like I said before, we're not doing it right away.

20
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,780
Let's talk slowly about that.

21
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,480
Right.

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,460
It's an important thing, so, let's discuss this matter carefully.

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Hase.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,120
My novel is about to be finished soon.

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,360
Terada-san?

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,940
You were there all along?

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,440
Do you want me to leave this house?

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,820
To be honest,

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,660
being around you,

30
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,220
it's been a bit exhausting lately.

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,660
I see.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,980
Sorry...

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,480
But...

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,940
I don't want to leave you.

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,720
Hongyo...

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,720
What?

37
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,740
You don't...

38
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,940
...really like me, do you?

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,700
I don't know if it's considered "like" or not.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,280
Then, you could just tell me you don't like me!

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,520
You should have said that.

42
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,120
Because Hongyo, when I told you I liked you, you barely gave me any reaction!

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,620
Even when I asked you to date me, you looked so annoyed, right?

44
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,100
I don't really understand about dating and stuff...

45
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,260
When you told me you liked me,

46
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,520
it didn't feel quite right.

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,220
What do you mean?

48
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,880
I mean, why would you like someone like me?

49
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,280
What do you like about me?

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,800
What do I like...?

51
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,900
Well, you said it yourself that you'd stop liking me...

52
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,160
But, still,

53
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,660
you didn't even answer my question!

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,620
To be honest,

55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,120
I think I became quite obsessed with you, Terada-san.

56
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,420
I've also become possessive.

57
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,000
But, those feelings...

58
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,640
...grew mainly because I can only react to you right now.

59
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,200
So, when I think about it,

60
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,220
isn't it just a sexual desire?

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,080
Speaking of which,

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,080
that sexual desire,

63
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,440
you don't even have it right now, do you?

64
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,020
I mean,

65
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,200
you're about to finish your new novel, right?

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,900
- Well, that...
- So, actually,

67
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,980
you don't need to sleep with me anymore...

68
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,500
I do...

69
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
...need to sleep with you.

70
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,260
I need it.

71
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,860
Every time I talk to Hongyo, I will feel so confused and mad!

72
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,040
I don't understand him at all!

73
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,140
I don't understand...

74
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,500
I like it like that babe, give me last first kiss ♫

Screw-Up Adults'
Sharehouse

87
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,980
Terada-san, you don't have to move out.

88
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,100
But, this happened because of me, so I feel so guilty.

89
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,220
Also, I want to properly end it.

90
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,400
My relationship with Hongyo...

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,040
I see.

92
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,620
I understand.

93
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,620
It's a bit embarrassing to ask, but,

94
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,580
Hase-san, what do you like about me?

95
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,020
I don't know if it will answer your question, but,

96
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,440
when I was sick that night,

97
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,920
you were taking care of me without hesitation,

98
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,660
and being by my side while patting my back.

99
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,100
That hand felt extremely warm...

100
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,900
It comforted me so much...

101
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,980
So, I thought...

102
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
...you were really amazing.

103
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,580
Um, Hase-san,

104
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,620
Don't you want to do it?

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,060
The thing after kissing...

106
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,640
I don't really mind if you want to do it.

107
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,140
Or rather,

108
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,240
I want to do it soon...

109
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,840
Terada-san, do you really want to do it with me?

110
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,200
You don't have to feel obligated...

111
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,540
At least, even if I don't do it with you,

112
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,740
I will still cherish you so much.

113
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,740
I really love you.

114
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,700
I'm so embarrassed!

115
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,800
I look like someone who always wants to get physical in every relationship.

116
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,300
What's wrong?

117
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,700
Kuri-chan.

118
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,280
Kuri-chan!

119
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,640
Kuri-chan!

120
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,620
Is that Hongyo Tomoya's new book?

121
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes. But it's still on progress.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,340
Is it interesting?

123
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,340
It's as amazing as his other works!

124
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,800
The idea was very creative and bold.

125
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,340
But also still so pure!

126
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,640
It's stronger than ever!

127
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,500
The design should also be the best.

128
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,940
You get too excited. Good luck!

129
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,460
So expensive...

130
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,040
Terada-san.

131
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,300
Do you have a few minutes?

132
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,600
You're really leaving...

133
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,600
Yes.

134
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,640
If you're moving out like this, don't you think you'll be leaving something half done?

135
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,080
I think this is the best choice I have...

136
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,940
Looking at you like this really gets me on my nerves!

137
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,520
I wonder where your true self is.

138
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,520
I...

139
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,120
...always think about myself.

140
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,260
But, I also started to hate myself without I realized it.

141
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,060
So,

142
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,100
I want others to see my worth.

143
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,160
When people say they don't need me,

144
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,560
I got so scared.

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,560
That's why I turned to Hase-san.

146
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,560
Hase-san...

147
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,620
...put the most expensive price tag...

148
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,280
...on me.

149
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,780
Huh?

150
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,180
Aren't you just being self-conscious?

151
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,240
It's useless, huh.

152
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,180
At this rate, no matter what I do, I'll end up doing the same thing all over again.

153
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,460
I don't know about that...

154
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,420
But since you chose it yourself, you've got no choice but to keep going.

155
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,540
Whoa~ I'm so happy you asked me out. Isn't it the first time?

156
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,000
What shall we eat?

157
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,540
How about assorted sashimi?

158
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,920
Terada-san, what's wrong?

159
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,980
I think...

160
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,780
...it would be impossible for me to continue this relationship, Hase-san.

161
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,120
I'm sorry...

162
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,920
Is there something you don't like about me? I will fix it!

163
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,540
That's not it!

164
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,600
It's just me...

165
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,600
Is it about Tomo?

166
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,060
Didn't you already learn your lesson?

167
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,400
He could only make you feel insecure!

168
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,520
Yes.

169
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,640
I know that.

170
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,860
But...

171
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,580
I just can't.

172
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,580
I've tried my best to like you...

173
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,640
but I just...

174
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,800
...can't choose the one I like.

175
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,060
I have...

177
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,820
...done something terrible.

178
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,240
Tomo.

179
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,080
You have to finish your new novel as soon as possible.

180
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,260
If you still want to live here comfortably, you should at least do the minimum work.

181
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,840
Before you finish your novel, you should not sleep with Terada-san, or make any unnecessary contact with her.

182
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,080
If you want to do those things, you need to fulfill the conditions first.

183
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,720
Tomo.

184
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,920
After I finish my new novel, I can do that, right?

185
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,180
Yes.

186
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,160
All right. I'll finish it.

187
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,600
Good luck!

188
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,680
Terada-san, you had always been insecure about yourself,

189
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,540
so, I made Tomo to cause you to feel even more insecure than ever.

190
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,940
- Why did you...
- Tomo could only make you feel exhausted!

191
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,720
I just wanted you to stop.

192
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,720
After you stopped,

193
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,360
I hoped you would turn to me...

194
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,220
I'm so disgusting, right?

195
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,060
I know this may sound selfish,

196
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,720
but, I want to be by your side.

197
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,140
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,780
As I thought,

199
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,340
to continue this relationship with you,

200
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,340
I just can't.

201
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,340
I knew it.

202
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,580
- You can't forgive me, right?
- That's not it.

203
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,580
It's because I'm too weak.

204
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,300
Everything has become like this...

205
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,440
You will go back to Tomo?

206
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,440
I think I will end up doing the same thing all over again,

207
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,280
so,

208
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,440
I decided to leave the sharehouse.

209
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,600
Thank you...

210
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,080
...for everything you've done.

211
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,740
Hongyo...

212
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,360
...has been staying in his room since then.

213
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,160
In the end,

214
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,620
I couldn't say goodbye to him.

215
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,180
Terada-san!

216
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,860
Hongyo.

217
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,380
It's done.

218
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,380
I've finished it.

219
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,920
My new novel.

220
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,320
I want you to read it.

221
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,580
I want you to see it first.

222
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,040
Hongyo!

223
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,920
"This is the story of the protagonist 'I', and the immortal 'she'."

224
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,380
"Even if there's only one cell left,

225
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,820
"she can still resurrect completely."

226
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:10,120
"In front of her, who felt the pain of destruction and the joy of being reborn, I couldn't do anything,"

227
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,940
"so, I bit her neck."

228
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,540
This story...

229
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,600
Terada-san?

230
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,100
"I don't know if it was just me being possessive..."

231
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,300
"But, I got scared of myself."

232
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,060
"And I started to worry."

233
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,980
"Then..."

234
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,200
"She chose to leave me."

235
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,200
"After she's gone, I realized it for the first time."

236
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,440
"That by hurting her,"

237
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,180
"I wanted to be connected with her."

238
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,620
"However,"

239
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,760
"I will never see her again."

240
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,160
"For the rest of my life."

241
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,220
Welcome back, Hongyo.

242
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,220
Terada-san?

243
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,680
Why are you crying?

244
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,300
Because...

245
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,320
...that immortal girl...

246
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,280
...really wanted to be together with "I".

247
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,200
But she chose to disappear forever,

248
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,160
I just thought she must have felt so sad...

249
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,100
I see.

250
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,760
That's right.

251
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,440
That girl must have also felt sad.

252
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,120
I didn't think about her feelings at all.

253
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,500
Right.

254
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,640
It was so hard for her!

255
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,140
She was really sad!

256
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,920
I'm sorry, Terada-san...

257
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,580
Welcome home.

258
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,140
I'm home!

259
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,780
I broke up with Hase-san.

260
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,300
Why?

261
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,860
Because I just can't keep running away like that...

262
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,780
Also, I like you, Hongyo.

263
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,380
I want to be honest with my feelings.

264
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,380
And with you, too.

265
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,120
Terada-san, you have changed.

266
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,120
Is that so?

267
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,120
Hey, Hongyo,

268
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,280
the weather is really nice today.

269
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,680
Yes, it is.

270
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,980
The food is really good, right?

271
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,660
Yes, it is.

272
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,100
Do you like me?

273
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,200
I don't know.

274
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,600
Anyway,

275
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,500
when I was reading your novel,

276
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,820
I was thinking you must like me.

277
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,100
Really?

278
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,600
Yes.

279
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,160
I'm sure...

280
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,520
...that you like me, Hongyo.

281
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,740
Hongyo?

282
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,740
I think I like you, Terada-san.

283
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,920
See?

284
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Terada-san, good morning!

285
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,920
Good morning!

286
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,300
Um..

287
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,380
I'll be in your care once again.

288
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,040
I'm the one who needs your care.

289
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,400
Terada-san...

290
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,200
Welcome back.

291
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,360
You too.

292
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,480
Welcome back.

293
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,640
I'm home...

294
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,160
Don't steal the food!

295
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,580
I'm going to eat, too.

296
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,260
So good!

297
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,640
Let's have breakfast together.

298
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,860
Hurry up!

299
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,680
Wait a minute.

300
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,940
They look good.

301
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,780
Here.

302
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,300
That's huge.

303
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,320
Hongyo is not my boyfriend.

304
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,680
And we may continue our sleeping arrangement,

305
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,040
I'm sure...

306
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,240
...I'll become insecure again.

307
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,480
Thanks for waiting.

308
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,980
Thank you.

309
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,420
- Itadakimasu!
- Itadakimasu!

310
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,760
It's a strange relationship.

311
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:10,400
But, when being asked whether it's okay or not, I will answer "Okay", with confidence.

312
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,620
Akari, that portion is even too much for dinner.

313
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,840
Really? You should also eat this much.

314
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,500
No, I can't eat too much breakfast.

315
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,700
Terada-san?

316
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,400
And also,

317
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,360
So good!

318
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,560
I want that.

319
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,240
the way I am right now,

320
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,480
I like it a bit!

321
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,180
Thank you.
