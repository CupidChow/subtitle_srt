1
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,094
He already have been thinking to do it again.
Are you an idiot, Terada-san?

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,680
Your perfume. When Terada-san went home last night,

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,280
- I smelled this perfume.
- I'm leaving my perfume scent as my mark, you know.

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,039
After Hase-san kissed me,

5
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,320
I'm even more convinced about my feelings towards Hongyo.

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,111
If..

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,082
I confessed to Hongyo,

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,383
Hongyo will be like..

9
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:38,222
But I like you, Hongyo!

10
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:41,525
Oh. Then?

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,494
Or maybe..

12
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:47,564
Ah, so it's okay for sleep together, isn't?

13
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:48,966
Or maybe..

14
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,050
Eh? Then, let's do it?
You didn't hate it, right?

15
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,960
All of those might be happened!

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,260
Plus, all of those are no good!

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,760
Did something happened, Terada-san?

18
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,581
Ah! No! It's kinda..

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,900
But it seems like you're being so serious thinking of it.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,940
Ah! There are many things..

21
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,670
What? What's bugging you? Let me hear of it.

22
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,526
Ah~

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,628
Ah. That's right.

24
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:20,764
Before I can confessing my feelings towards Hongyo,

25
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,500
The person that I have to confess is..

26
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:25,969
The person who's standing in front of my eyes.

27
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:42,200
The subtitle is brought by naonyaan@livejournal.com

28
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:53,063
Do not remove the watermark, claimed as yours etc.

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,960
Here.. Listen..

30
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,840
Then, I'll taking your offer.

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,840
I'll tell you something that I want you to know, Akari-san.

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,510
What? What's happened?

33
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,510
You know..

34
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,020
Hm? Wait!

35
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,868
How much I have to tell her?

36
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,520
About we're going out before?
Or about our first time doing "it"?

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,530
Or about we're sleeping together right now?

38
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,830
But it won't be good if I'm exposing this all of sudden.

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,900
Hmm, how I can put in words..

40
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,910
Something that I can tell her right now is..

41
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,910
Listen, actually, I..

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,980
Seems like I have been falling in love with Hongyo!

43
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,075
Is that the same feeling like you asked me before?

44
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,830
That kind of feelings?

45
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,860
Yeah.

46
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,785
I want to kiss.. Hugging him..

47
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,489
That kind of things..

48
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,110
That's how I feel.

49
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,010
Is that so?

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,932
Are you going to confess?

51
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,305
When I convinced about my feelings right now,
I'm thinking to doing so.

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,230
I see.
You know, you don't have to be that scared to tell me about that.

53
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,260
It's not like I'm angry with you or something.

54
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,100
Well, yeah. I'm sorry.

55
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,419
There's no reason for me to get angry of it.

56
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:01,692
Those kind of things are like the natural phenomena.
It's not like you can control of it, right?

57
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,650
Okay.

58
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,780
But well, it's gonna be something painful later.

59
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,150
That's also a part of life too.

60
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,190
But there is nobody's fault for that.

61
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,190
It's just a destiny of our life.

62
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,990
Oh.

63
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:23,660
Please don't let it bother you.

64
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,482
Isn't she just confirmed that I'm gonna be rejected by herself?

65
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,853
- Oh!
- Then, I'm going back to my room.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,023
Oh. Good night.

67
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,010
To tell the truth,

68
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,850
When I heard about your confession,

69
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,850
I felt something in my heart.

70
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,950
But I feel happy that you told me first about it.

71
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,990
Thanks, Terada-san.

72
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:01,470
Hmm.. I wonder if it's the right thing to tell her?

73
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,470
But at the end,

74
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,470
Maybe I still can't get myself to tell her about the most important thing.

75
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,150
I'm home.

76
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,750
Welcome home, Terada-san.
Eh? Where's Akari?

77
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:19,490
- You aren't back home together with her?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,320
It seems like she have to correct her work so she'll back home later.

79
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,320
- Oh.
- Hm?

80
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,730
Hmm? What?

81
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,770
No, there's nothing.

82
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,170
- Terada-san. How about today?
- Eh?

83
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,210
Sleep together. You cancelled before, right?

84
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,850
Ah! Hmm.

85
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,180
Is it okay with you?

86
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,850
Or no?

87
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,971
I can't bring myself to say no.

88
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,577
So we're just literally sleeping together tonight.

89
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,281
It's okay for me though.

90
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,800
Ah! Why don't we try to confess right now?

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,140
But, well..

92
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,740
It's kinda feeling off when we're not facing each other.

93
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,020
Hm? What's wrong?

94
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,120
Your shampoo and soap's scent.

95
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,830
That's.. well.. I just done my bath.

96
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,510
Listen, Terada-san.

97
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,850
- Do you know?
- Hm?

98
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:59,190
Male cats have spines on their genitals.

99
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,320
Excuse me?

100
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,320
They resemble the barbs of a harpoon.

101
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,330
There are a lot of them, upside-down like an arrow.

102
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,147
Eh? What are you talking about?

103
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,800
It's still okay when those spines go in,

104
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,470
But when those spines go out, they will cut the wall of female cats genitals.

105
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,470
They said it's really hurt.

106
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:29,532
But the female cats seem to ovulate in response to the pain.

107
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,920
So, that means those spines and pain are needed.

108
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:44,160
I feel like those things are somehow awesome.

109
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,170
What kind of 'knowledge corner' is this?

110
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,500
No.

111
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,170
Recently, I just read a lot of things about animals.

112
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:57,670
Is that so?

113
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,460
Eh? He gonna do it?

114
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,460
In this kind of mood?

115
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,080
Ouch!

116
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,520
Ouch! Hongyo?

117
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Sorry.

118
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,160
Eh? What's with this all of sudden?

119
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,060
It's just I feel like I want to do it.

120
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,060
Huh? What's with that?

121
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,070
It's damn hurt, you know!

122
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,070
Hmm, sorry.

123
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,780
Ah. I feel so sleepy right now.

124
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,780
- Huh?
- Good night, Terada-san.

125
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:12,302
Gosh!

126
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,790
I don't get you at all.

127
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,460
The subtitle is brought by naonyaan@livejournal.com

128
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,947
Of course, this isn't a problem to me.

129
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,000
But when we aren't doing anything, I feel lonely and miserable.

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,522
And feel so embarrassed for thinking so.

131
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:40,230
But when we're doing it, I gonna feel empty again.

132
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,033
Ah, this.

133
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,080
What's with this kind of complicated feelings?!

134
00:09:54,277 --> 00:09:56,913
This is no good. I can't sleep.

135
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,617
I want to go drink a glass of water.

136
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,790
- Terada-san?
- Akari-san!

137
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,830
- What did you do in Tomoya's room?
- No, it's not as you think!

138
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,130
Terada-san. What's wrong? You left me alone again.

139
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,130
- Hongyo!
- Ah, it's you, Akari.

140
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,270
Are you okay, Tomoya?
Did Terada-san do something weird to you?

141
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:24,174
- Eh?
- I'm sorry. I let my guard down about Terada-san.

142
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,480
But I didn't even thought she's the type who's attack people in their sleep.

143
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
- That's wrong, Akari.
- Eh?

144
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,480
I'm the one who's invited Terada-san to sleep together.

145
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,150
- Huh? Sleeping together?
- Yeah.

146
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,150
At the night that I can't sleep.

147
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,490
Well, there were a lot of reasons why we're sleeping together.

148
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,530
If that so, why don't you just asking me for it?

149
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,830
That is..

150
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,630
I don't know why but it seems only Terada-san that can help me.

151
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,170
Huh? "It" won't reacted and you can't write your novel?

152
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,510
Yeah, well.

153
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,540
I don't know if those two matters are related to each other or not.

154
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,550
But when I know that I'm "reacting" towards Terada-san,

155
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,650
I asked her to sleep with me as a part of my treatment.

156
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,450
Ah! But I didn't do something weird, you know.

157
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,450
How to put it..

158
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:17,494
But for me, it already sounds so weird to
sleep together with that kind of reason, you know.

159
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,162
Eh? Is that so?

160
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,300
Ah, but even it's kinda weird to hear,

161
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,800
I did promised to Terada-san that I won't do something that she don't want to.

162
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,970
Terada-san, what's that?

163
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,342
- Eh?
- The back of your neck.

164
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,043
It looks reddish.

165
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,680
Ah. I bit it earlier.

166
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,684
Eh. It leaves a mark?

167
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,190
Ah. Yeah.

168
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,520
Somehow it looks pretty obvious.

169
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,690
It looks it gonna be redder over the time.

170
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,990
- Sorry.
- Eh? Geez.

171
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,500
Wait a minute. I can't clearly understand these.

172
00:11:55,732 --> 00:11:56,432
Hm?

173
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,235
- I'm going to sleep!
- Eh?

174
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,840
It seems like my brain can't comprehend this.

175
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,941
So, I'm going to sleep.

176
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,210
Okay. Good night, Akari.

177
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,210
Good night.

178
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,550
Then, let's go back to my room, Terada-san.

179
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,320
You can't! Terada-san, go back! To your own room!

180
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,320
- Yes! I got it!
- Eh?

181
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,160
Then, good night, Hongyo.

182
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,960
I can't organize my brain right now,

183
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,660
- So, tomorrow, on 8 o'clock, let's meet here!
- Noted!

184
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,670
Then, what's this?
Is it true that you're just only sleep together?

185
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,840
It's not.. that we're just sleep together only.

186
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,710
You means you did that kind of things?

187
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:46,983
Yes.

188
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,855
You asked me about that matter earlier, isn't, Terada-san?

189
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,520
About what kind of feelings I have towards Tomoya.

190
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,570
You want him to touch you,

191
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,570
Kiss him or something like that.

192
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,580
Did you already in that kind of relationship with Tomoya when you asked me that question?

193
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,950
What kind of relationship that you're talking right now?

194
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,680
Huh? I don't know!

195
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,320
Like kiss and hug while naked is enough..

196
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,220
We never kissed and hugged while naked!

197
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,860
- Eh? Then..
- But!

198
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,500
He put "it" in mine.
Does that means we did "it"?

199
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,069
- Wait a min! I can't quite understand this.
- Me too.

200
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,050
I know that you didn't have any bad intentions, Terada-san.

201
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,950
I also understand that Tomoya also have his own situation.

202
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:01,490
But, to tell you the truth, it sounds wrong.
It makes me uncomfortable.

203
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,460
Plus, when I proposed to Tomoya,

204
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,630
Also when I asked him to go date and when I said I thought I like him,

205
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,270
I did all of those things in front of you.

206
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,470
How do you feel during that time?

207
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,270
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,010
- You're apologized for it?
- Eh?

209
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:31,250
If you're apologized for it, please make it clear
on what kind of things that you want to apologize for.

210
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,460

211
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,460
Akarin.

212
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,240
You looks exhausted. Are you okay?

213
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Thanks for this morning.
You took Tomoya out together with you.

214
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,040
What's wrong?
Did you talked about some secrets with Terada-san?

215
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,013
You knew about it, Hase-kun?

216
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,450
Is that so? So, you found out about the sleep together's matter.

217
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,950
They didn't just sleep together, right?

218
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,590
Yeah. But we don't have to worry about that, you know.

219
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,360
That's of course we have! Please do!

220
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Eh? Why? They just did about one to two times only, you know.

221
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,070
There is no such of guarantee nor confirmation.

222
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:16,899
Eh?

223
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,540
It just only you who think they're in relationship
but they didn't even going out neither like each other.

224
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,540
That's not a problem at all.

225
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:38,250
What should I do now?

226
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,020
I came to this house, accidentally met with Hongyo again.

227
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,530
Being asked to sleep together, and I agreed with that.

228
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,330
It's not something that I hate.

229
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:48,865
After that,

230
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,635
I've become wanted to be touched by Hongyo more and more.

231
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,140
And then.. And then..!

232
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,240
Oh no! I made too much food!

233
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,210
- I'm home.
- Ah! Welcome home!

234
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:16,659
Listen!

235
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,930
Would you like to eat them if you don't mind?

236
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,530
I didn't realize that I made too much food while thinking about something.

237
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,130
Plus, all of those are your favorite food.

238
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,180
I have been thinking about it since then.

239
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,318
What? Did you already know about what you should apologize for?

240
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,586
You know..

241
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,259
I have been thinking one by one from the start.

242
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,895
Then,

243
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,700
I have nothing to apologize for!

244
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:00,203
Is that so?

245
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,840
- That's right! I don't remember blaming you for that!
- Eh?

246
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,540
Plus, what's with that? That non-apologetic apology?

247
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,315
In a race, did you apologize to the runners that you chase, you didn't, are you?

248
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,980
A quick and thoughtless apology is no better than an insult!

249
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,760
Ah! It's the usual Akari-san!

250
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,530
I thought I would somehow understand it,

251
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,160
But as I thought, I still can't understand it, no matter how much I tried.
It makes me uncomfortable.

252
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,760
So that's why, I think that kind of relationship isn't really important.

253
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,670
The relationship between us and Hongyo still same as ever, isn't?

254
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,940
Hm? That's right, maybe. That's right, for real.

255
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,480
Well, let's eat first before the food gets cold.

256
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Okay!

257
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,020
Let's eat! I'll bring the chopsticks.

258
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,900
- Please eat all of the food.
- I can?

259
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,330
What Akari-san said is right.

260
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,470
Even how much we're sleep together, our distance still didn't getting any closer.

261
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,210
In the end, Hongyo is getting farther and more farther.

262
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,580
Nope. That's exactly why,

263
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,650
I should confess to him as soon as possible!

264
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,420
Hongyo. Are you in?

265
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,830
What's wrong?

266
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,030
Ah. There's something I want to talk to you.

267
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,320
Then, what you want to talk about?

268
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,040
Well, you know..

269
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,940
Say it! Just say it!

270
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,950
Actually, I..

271
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,250
I like you, Hongyo.

272
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,890
I said it! I just said it!

273
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Oh.

274
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Woah! This reaction is exactly like what I imagined!

275
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,864
Then, those things I did, you didn't hate it, right?

276
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,480
Eh? I also imagined this reaction too.

277
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,350
Ah, that is..

278
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,100
It's because I like you so..

279
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,500
I'm kinda happy to be touched by you, that's what I thought.

280
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,200
- Eh? Then..
- But!

281
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,370
It's because I like you, so when you randomly touched me,

282
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,110
Without any feelings,

283
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,480
It's kinda..

284
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,280
Painful for me.

285
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
That's how I feel!

286
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,860
Welp! I used too much energy to say this!

287
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,260
- Well, that's all about!
- Hm?

288
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,670
Ah, then, I got a lot of things to do so..

289
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,070
In another time. Later.

290
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Terada-san?

291
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,550
The subtitle is brought by naonyaan@livejournal.com

292
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,920
I'm so tired!

293
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:54,550
If I clearly confessed about my feelings to him,

294
00:20:54,804 --> 00:20:57,590
There's might be something gonna change,

295
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,008
Is what I thought.

296
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:01,744
I'm home.

297
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,900
- Welcome home.
- Eh? You're picking up the trash in the middle of night?

298
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:07,616
Ah, well.

299
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:13,355
- Then, what's happened?
- Eh?

300
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:16,726
Well, usually you'll cleaning up when there's something bothers you.

301
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,463
Ah, no. There's nothing.. happened.

302
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,602
Terada-san. What's happened to your back of the neck?

303
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:28,537
It looks like someone bit you.

304
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:31,574
- Ah!
- It's Tomo?

305
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:36,946
Ah. He did it on the other day.

306
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:42,700
So, he also do the marking thing, huh.
That guy, seriously..

307
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,787
It must be from the time you slept together with him, right?

308
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,456
So, you still doing it.

309
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,593
Ah, never mind.

310
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:53,950
I don't care what kind of things that both of you did.

311
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,364
It doesn't matter after all.

312
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,620
You also understand that there's no meaning at all in doing that.

313
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,520
Yeah, there's no meaning at all.

314
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:17,686
- Hase-san, what's wrong? Are you feeling..
- Ah, no. Wait a minute. It's not like that.

315
00:22:21,157 --> 00:22:27,229
What kind of face that I usually show to you?

316
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:35,871
Yes, the person that I like is Hongyo.

317
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,741
And it still didn't change.

318
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm sorry!

319
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,810
I'm going back to my room.

320
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,960
Somehow..

321
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:49,111
There are a lot of things in my head.

322
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,030
To going out means..

323
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:57,040
First of all, the answer that you want is..

324
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:59,440
Is that true that you're going out with Hase?

325
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
I'm really like you, Terada-san.

326
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,040
It just like my usual days.
There's something wrong with this!
