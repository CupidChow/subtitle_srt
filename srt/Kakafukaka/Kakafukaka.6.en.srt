1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,580
If I really am pregnant,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,400
what should I do?

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,300
Hase-san.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,920
Are you okay?

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,500
Terada-san, have you taken the pregnancy test yet?

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,560
Whether you're pregnant or not,

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,520
Will you marry me?

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,060
Wait a second!

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,920
How long has he been there?

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,360
How much did he hear?

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,440
Terada-san.

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,980
Hase-san!

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,460
Are you all right?

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,040
You need my help?

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,160
Yes, please.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,160
- Can you get up?
- Hase.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,020
It looks like he's asleep, for now.

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,100
He seems better now after throwing up.

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,200
I'm going to the convenience store, okay?

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,440
You know what,

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,880
it was my first time seeing Hase like that.

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,180
I also feel it was indeed unusual for him to be sick like that!

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,980
Because he always takes care of his health so much!

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,500
That too, but,

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,360
it's about how he was clinging on to you and begging you to marry him,

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,000
that's what I meant.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,080
Well, about that, I think he was just blurting out some nonsense unconsciously due to a high fever.

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,320
When you're in a weak condition,

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,600
you tend to feel clingy somehow.

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,260
Is that how it is?

31
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,200
Yeah. I'm sure that's what happened.

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,280
I'm relieved! I think that's all he heard.

33
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,440
Then, I'm going to the convenience store, okay?

34
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,560
How about the child and the pregnancy test?

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,080
Were those also nonsense?

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,480
I mean,

37
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,140
are you pregnant, Terada-san?

38
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,700
I still need to confirm it...

39
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,620
That's what the pregnancy test is all about?

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,680
Then?

41
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,220
Is that Hase's child?

42
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,140
Well...

43
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,820
What do you mean?

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,820
What makes you think so?

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
What do you mean why?

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,840
I'm just wondering...

47
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,160
- That's not Hase's?
- Of course not!

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,620
Then, my child?

49
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,020
Well,

50
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,020
you're the only one I have in mind.

51
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,020
I see.

52
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,020
Isn't it amazing?

53
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,140
All right, then, Terada-san,

54
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,140
I'm sorry, Hongyo.

55
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,780
I suddenly want to go to the toilet.

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,780
Sorry!

57
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,480
I'm not...

58
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,260
...pregnant!

59
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,120

I'm so sorry!

73
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,240
It appeared!

74
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,600
That "monthly thing"...

75
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,000
Um, I mean...

76
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,120
You mean you're not pregnant?

77
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,300
Yes.

78
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,120
Right...

79
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,720
I really made so much fuss about that!

80
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
But,

81
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,860
I feel so relieved now.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,060
Huh?

83
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,180
Anyway, that's a relief, right?

84
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,520
Yeah.

85
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,920
But,

86
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,040
if you think about it, it's kind of amazing, isn't it?

87
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,780
Even though we stopped midway,

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,520
there was still a possibility that we could end up like that,

89
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,520
it made me a bit excited.

90
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,200
Huh? Terada-san?

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,300
Sorry, Hongyo.

92
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,200
You're creeping me out a little.

93
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,200
Really?

94
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,360
Anyway,

95
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,040
we can still do it one more time, right?

96
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,240
Sleeping together.

97
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,420
But, today is impossible!

98
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Why?

99
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,320
Be...cause... If I sleep in someone else's bed in this situation, my body will feel uncomfortable.

100
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,920
Ah, I see!

101
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,800
- Then, let's do it once your period is over.
- Hey! You're too straightforward!

102
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,060
It's okay to do it after that, right?

103
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,060
All right.

104
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
Thank you.

105
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,720
I will prepare everything properly.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,720
It's about sleeping together, right?

107
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,220
It's okay to only sleep together, right?

108
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,480
Yes. It is.

109
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,900
But, I can do that too, right?

110
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,640
Ah, it's no good!

111
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,320
The moment I realized that I liked him,

112
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,140
I think I...

113
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,060
...already lost.

114
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,400
Thank you, Terada-san.

115
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,720
Darn it!!

116
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,420
Also,

117
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,740
there's something I want to ask you.

118
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,380
Do you think kissing is considered weird?

119
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
Terada-san?

120
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,820
Well...

121
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,100
I'll let you decide that, Hongyo.

122
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,180
Really?

123
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,840
Then...

124
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,700
Never mind.

125
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,020
W-why...?

126
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,680
Because,

127
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,940
I tend to go straight to the point.

128
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,660
Straight to the point?

129
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,260
Good night then.

130
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,800
Tell me when it's over.

131
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,080
Good morning, Terada-san.

132
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,640
Good morning!

133
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,580
Have you felt better? I was going to check on you.

134
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,900
I'm sorry for troubling you yesterday.

135
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,520
Don't worry about that!

136
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,520
I'm feeling better now.

137
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,700
Also, I think I said something strange yesterday...

138
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,800
Aaaah~! You were doing that unconsciously due to a high fever.

139
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,620
Don't worry.

140
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,940
I didn't take it seriously.

141
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,400
- Really?
- Yes.

142
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,420
I'm making rice porridge at the moment, would you like to try it?

143
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,840
Terada-san, you look like you're in a good mood.

144
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,960
Did something good happen?

145
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,800
Ah, no...

146
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,520
Nothing...

147
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,720
Do I look like I'm in a good mood?

148
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,020
Do you think kissing is considered weird?

149
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,620
Even though I said I wouldn't get my hopes up anymore...

150
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,600
Maybe it was already too late.

151
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,420
A package for you.

152
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,780
Thank you!

153
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,780
All right. Please wait a moment.

154
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,240
She's not here.

155
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,400
Can you move to the side?

156
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,680
Ah, sorry, sorry!

157
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
- Ah, hey!
- Akh!! It hurts!

158
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,800
- Welcome home.
- Ah! I'm home!

159
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,220
How is it? Still going?

160
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,500
One week has passed, you know.

161
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,800
Well...

162
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,700
I didn't feel like doing such a...self-report...

163
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,260
Just tell me.

164
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,720
Well...

165
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,380
I'm no longer......

166
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,120
Then, can we do it tonight?

167
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,920
You've finished your bath!

168
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,640
You too, Hongyo.

169
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,040
I'm so stupid!

170
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Yeah.

171
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,700
Even though I thought it was stupid,

172
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,240
the truth is,

173
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,160
when I feel...

174
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,920
...Hongyo's touch like this,

175
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,020
I'm so happy.

176
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,500
Facing each other while kissing like this,

177
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,060
it feels incredible.

178
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,840
Wait, Hongyo!

179
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,440
What?

180
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,440
Will it be all right?

181
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,580
Hm?

182
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,580
Shouldn't we take it easy...?

183
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,900
Like lying down first...

184
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,040
Didn't I tell you?

185
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,720
I tend to go straight to the point.

186
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,060
So, that's what you mean by "straight to the point".

187
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,940
Well... I'm glad to hear that you seem so healthy...

188
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,760
- I mean...
- What are you talking about, Terada-san?

189
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,040
Sorry...

190
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,600
But...

191
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,580
Now that we're facing each other like this,

192
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,920
and doing it in this position,

193
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,700
I feel really nervous.

194
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,920
Somehow.

195
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,720
But, anyway,

196
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,180
let's just proceed.

197
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,380
Right.

198
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,740
I'm also...

199
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,420
...nervous.

200
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,520
I'm embarrassed...

201
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,860
I'm really really embarrassed.

202
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,840
I think I'm more nervous now...

203
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,420
...compared to our first time.

204
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,200
Somehow it doesn't feel real at all.

205
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,040
This feels like a dream.

206
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm soaring up...

207
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,700
He's near my neck,

208
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,660
on my shoulder.

209
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,420
I can feel his heavy breath...

210
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,240
I wonder...

211
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,120
...if I should do something,

212
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,800
like touching his hair...

213
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,120
Amazing...

214
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,840
I really want to do it...

215
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,380
Just a little bit.

216
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,000
It feels good.

217
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,920
It really feels good.

218
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,920
Right now,

219
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,500
I may be...

220
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,620
...a bit happy.

221
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,000
It's incredible...

222
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,260
In front of me,

223
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,380
Hongyo is sleeping so peacefully.

224
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,380
This is insane.

225
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,300
This is amazing.

226
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,300
I feel overwhelmed.

227
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,300
Good morning, Terada-san.

228
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,280
Morning.

229
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,940
I was so careless! I forgot about the healthy morning.

230
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,220
I should have slept in my usual position.

231
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,900
That healthy morning is not coming back, huh?

232
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,900
Then...

233
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,300
That means you're not completely...

234
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,520
...cured yet.

235
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,820
But, at least I knew I was able do things properly last night.

236
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,840
There's still a hope.

237
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,000
Thanks to you, Terada-san.

238
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,200
No...

239
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,060
Anyway,

240
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,800
thank you for everything.

241
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,460
Sorry for all those "weird" things I did.

242
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,460
But, you saved me.

243
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,880
I'm really grateful to you.

244
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,000
Why is it?

245
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,660
Why do I feel like I've just been abandoned?

246
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,580
I felt a different connection last night.

247
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,020
At that moment, last night,

248
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,840
At that moment, I felt really happy.

249
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,980
Although I thought I could definitely get something,

250
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,980
in the end,

251
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,800
it was all just an empty hope...

252
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,800
...for me.

253
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,300
Moreover,

254
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,080
does that mean he's now able to do those things with other people too?

255
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,080
Good morning, Terada-san.

256
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,080
Good morning!

257
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,620
Please make me tamagoyaki for breakfast.

258
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,620
Yes. All right!

259
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,500
By the way, where is Tomoya? In his room?

260
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,360
Yes... Maybe!

261
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,100
You know, I've been thinking a lot about that.

262
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,160
About what you said the other day.

263
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,560
Ah, I mean...

264
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,480
Those things. About my desire to hug Tomoya,

265
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,220
or k-kiss him...?

266
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,060
Well, I know I've proposed to him spontaneously.

267
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,680
But, when it comes to marriage,

268
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,760
I should think about doing those kind of things too.

269
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,360
So, I want to confirm it once and for all.

270
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,720
Confirm it?

271
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,200
Good morning.

272
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,900
Tomoya!

273
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,860
Huh? I feel like I haven't seen you in ages.

274
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,340
Right!

275
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,840
I missed you.

276
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,380
So, Tomoya, do you have any plans for today?

277
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,000
No.

278
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,220
Really?

279
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,080
Then, let's go on a date, shall we?

280
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,320
A date?

281
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,860
You see, the weather is really nice today.

282
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,120
It could also brighten up our mood.

283
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,560
I don't mind.

284
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,620
- Really?
- Yeah.

285
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,200
I see.

286
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,320
He accepted it.

287
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,600
It's our first time, right?

288
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,900
Going out together like this.

289
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,860
You're right.

290
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,720
Have you started working on your new book?

291
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,720
No, I haven't.

292
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,640
Is that so?

293
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,480
Well, you don't need to rush.

294
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
But...

295
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,380
Somehow, I have the feeling that I can do it.

296
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,720
Really?

297
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,260
Is it fun?

298
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,100
I haven't thought that far yet.

299
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,880
You can do it, Tomoya!

300
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,200
By the way, Tomoya,

301
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,580
about my proposal the other day,

302
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,860
in order to make you consider it more appropriately,

303
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,820
there's still one more proposal.

304
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,380
I have a favor to ask you...

305
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,580
Huh? Why are you making such a weird face, Terada-san?

306
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,200
Ah, Hase-san!

307
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,820
Well...

308
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,600
I was thinking about doing some cleaning, then, without realizing, I was making that face...

309
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,940
Good job!

310
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,480
Where are Tomo and Akari?

311
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,420
They went out together.

312
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,420
It's unusual.

313
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,860
Ah, by the way...

314
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,620
I've been wanting to ask you this,

315
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,960
have you used that pregnancy test?

316
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,880
I'm sorry!

317
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,780
I forgot to tell you.

318
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,520
I'm not...

319
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,880
...pregnant!

320
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,840
Ah, I see. That's what happened.

321
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,580
It's a bit disappointing.

322
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,680
But, it's also a relief.

323
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,360
I'm sorry...

324
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,680
...for making you worried.

325
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,220
Ah, right!

326
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,200
I've been really wanting to tell you this.

327
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,200
So, um...

328
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,740
What I said the other day, I meant it.

329
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,240
I also found myself a bit creepy.

330
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,280
But, I really want to marry you.

331
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,860
So, let me ask you one more time.

332
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,020
Please marry me, Terada-san.

333
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,860
You know it so well, don't you?

334
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,860
Your relationship with Tomo will never go anywhere.

335
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,420
Maybe I can make you happier than he could.

336
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,020
So, please, try to consider what I said seriously.

337
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,560
Today...

338
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,120
...is such an awful day!

339
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,840
She looked so surprised...

340
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,300
Terada-san.

341
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,940
Wait, I sounded so desperate.

342
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,340
Yuck.

343
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,040
I'm home!

344
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,460
Welcome home.

345
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,640
We're back.

346
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,020
That was really fun.

347
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,020
I'm going back to my room.

348
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,480
Good luck on your writing, Tomoya!

349
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,640
Thank you for today!

350
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,620
I'm glad that I could be of any help to you.

351
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,620
Do your best!

352
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,620
What did she just say?

353
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,300
Did something happen between those two?

354
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,100
Terada-san!

355
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Yes?

356
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,100
I just realized it today.

357
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,940
I think...

358
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,700
...I have such feelings for Tomoya, indeed.

359
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,880
Such feelings?

360
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,820
Have you ever wanted Hongyo to touch you?

361
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,380
Or, don't you want to kiss him?

362
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,980
Those kind of feelings...

363
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,600
Those kind of feelings...

364
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,880
...are what I have for Tomoya.

365
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,080
Seriously?

366
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,000
Today is really...

367
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,780
...an awful day!
