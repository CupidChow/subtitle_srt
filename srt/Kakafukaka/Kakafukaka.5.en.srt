1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,540
When we're in this position, it makes you want to do it.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,480
Well, yeah.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,960
Then you can do it, if you want.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,560
I feel like...

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,000
I want you to touch me a little more, Hongyo.

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,760
I just realized it now.

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,100
What?

8
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,500
I'm not...

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,100
...using any protection, is it okay?

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,880
NO!!

Sharehouse

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,100
I'm so sorry.

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,280
I totally forgot.

16
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,680
Well, I was also careless.

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,040
I thought it was pretty much safe.

18
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,060
But, we already crossed the lines from the beginning!

19
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,740
However,

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,380
I think,

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,240
by looking at the date today, we should be good.

22
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,080
Let's go back to sleep, shall we?

23
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,660
Anyway, why does it feel like he takes me for granted?

24
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,700
I mean..

25
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,940
It's as if he did it just to achieve his goals?

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,880
We neither took off our clothes,

27
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,660
nor kissed.

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,880
We just...touched.

29
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,640
That's it.

30
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,640
However,

31
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,980
I thought for a moment,

32
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,160
that I was happy.

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,800
Aahh! This is bad! What to do?

34
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,380
No! I hate it!

35
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,380
I think...

36
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,060
...I like Hongyo.

37
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,580
Eh? Good morning, Terada-san!

38
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,340
Good morning!

39
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,640
Ah, breakfast! I haven't made it...

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,380
It's okay, I'm going to get dressed first.

41
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,240
I'm sorry! I'll make it right away!

42
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,060
You don't need to make Tomoya's share today.

43
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,280
I think he went out early this morning.

44
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,220
Ah! Did he?

45
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,460
Do you think he's all right?

46
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,060
There's no sign that he has started working on his new book.

47
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,500
Although this is a critical moment for him as a writer.

48
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,180
Akari-san, do you like Hongyo?

49
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,180
"Like"?? Can you please not say something silly like that?!

50
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,080
I and Tomoya are each other's only wings in this world.

51
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,900
In the name of fate, we...

52
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,560
I'm sorry! I'm sorry for saying that!

53
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,420
Anyway, why did you ask me all of a sudden?

54
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,840
Well...

55
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,060
Akari-san,

56
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,460
you commit yourself to Hongyo so much,

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,460
so, I wonder if you guys had ever dated...

58
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,180
I'm not interested in dating him or something like that.

59
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,060
I'm the only person who understands the real him. That's all.

60
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,420
Then, you don't have such feelings for Hongyo,

61
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,840
do you...?

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,260
Define "such feelings".

63
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,800
What feelings?

64
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,280
Well, I mean,

65
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,280
for example,

66
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,380
have you ever wanted him to touch you?

67
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,280
Or hug you?

68
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,220
Or don't you want to kiss him?

69
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,880
Those kind of feelings...

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,880
Doing those things with Tomoya?

71
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,060
Ah, I'm sorry!

72
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,560
That's a vulgar question! I'm sorry...

73
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,560
Please stop!

74
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,440
Such vulgar things...

75
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,500
I'm not...

76
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,920
Kiss...?

77
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,920
It's bad!

78
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,420
She takes it way too seriously!

79
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,680
A few days have passed since then.

80
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,840
Ever since I said those stupid things,

81
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,840
Akari-san has been...

82
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,060
Morning!

83
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,580
Morning, Tomoya!

84
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,360
...showing a strange behavior.

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,540
Hongyo!

86
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,460
How do you like your eggs today?

87
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,520
I want well-done sunny-side ups.

88
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,660
Hongyo's attitude hasn't changed at all since then.

89
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,840
He behaves as if nothing happened... I was surprised.

90
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,900
That was important to me.

91
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,020
But, that's not the case for Hongyo...

92
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,280
Thanks for the meal!

93
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,020
Akari-san, you've finished?

94
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,400
I can't eat too much today.

95
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,980
You've been acting strangely lately. What happened?

96
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,520
Well, nothing.

97
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,480
But...

98
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,220
I need to hurry today.

99
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,640
I feel somewhat lonely without you.

100
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,920
Tomoya...

101
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,280
Let's get married!

102
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,000
Me and you, Akari?

103
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,500
Right.

104
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,160
Then, let's live here forever!

105
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,680
Live here?

106
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,680
Hase-san!

107
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,780
- Good morning.
- Morning.

108
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,780
Let me think about it.

109
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,080
You're right.

110
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,500
I asked you so suddenly.

111
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,840
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,140
Huh, what's the matter, Terada-san?

113
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,460
You look pale. Is it a cold?

114
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,000
Ah, well, a bit..

115
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,480
Be careful not to spread it, okay?

116
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,420
Why don't you lie down in your room?

117
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,980
I'll take care of it.

118
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,400
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,440
I am going to have some rest.

120
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,580
Ah, right!

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Terada-san, don't forget!

122
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,820
I told you before, right?

123
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,740
To seriously think about it.

124
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,020
Marry me? Otherwise, get out of here.

125
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,460
I feel like...

126
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,760
...you're threatening me.

127
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,480
That's what I've been doing from the start.

128
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,480
You're right...

129
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,840
Well, I don't want to rush you, but, please make a decision.

130
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,020
Okay...

131
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,220
A lot of things are spinning around in my head.

132
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,480
I feel worn out.

133
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,740
My period is approaching...

134
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,160
Maybe that's why...

135
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,260
Huh?

136
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,860
I'm late...?

137
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,480
I think by looking at the date today,

138
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,160
we should be good.

139
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,820
Perhaps...

140
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,740
That day...?

141
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,580
I bought it for the first time.

142
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,420
It can be used one week after I miss my period.

143
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,360
So, I'm just in time.

144
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,500
No.

145
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,820
To get a more accurate result, maybe I should use it a little later...

146
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,520
But somehow,

147
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,520
I realized.

148
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,640
Don't avoid it, Terada-san.

149
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,640
When we do that kind of thing,

150
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,540
Stay still...

151
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,180
it can lead to something like this.

152
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,120
Whether something comes of it...

153
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,740
...or not.

154
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,520
Terada-san, are you inside?

155
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,540
Yes!

156
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,540
Are you okay?

157
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,300
I'm worried about your condition.

158
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,000
Ah, don't worry.

159
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm completely okay.

160
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Is that so? Then, that's fine.

161
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,120
I found this receipt in the corridor.

162
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,080
It's for a pregnancy test, right?

163
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,760
What? Did you buy it?

164
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,760
I think I bought this a long time ago.

165
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,660
But, it's today's date.

166
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,060
Well...

167
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,280
The other party is Tomo, right?

168
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,280
That means,

169
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,440
he's been cured. Isn't it amazing?

170
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,500
Ah, well, that's...

171
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,300
Ah, sorry!

172
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,300
This is a big deal for you, right?

173
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,840
But, seriously,

174
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,160
I was thinking to take the test, just in case.

175
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,120
Okay. Don't worry. I won't tell Tomo.

176
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,400
Okay.

177
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,860
But, even if the result is positive,

178
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,620
you can raise the baby as mine.

179
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,600
So, marry me.

180
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,700
I'm totally fine with it.

181
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,140
I'm not interested in having children myself, but if it's Tomo's, I think I won't mind.

182
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,480
Huh? What's the matter?

183
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,320
I'm sorry, Hase-san...

184
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,840
You're seriously creeping me out.

185
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,400
What are you saying all of a sudden?

186
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,280
Well, whatever the case,

187
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,800
please tell me the result once it comes out.

188
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,340
Bye, then.

189
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,080
In the end, I couldn't sleep at all.

190
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,760
Terada-san, good morning.

191
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,160
Good morning.

192
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,760
Why are you avoiding me?

193
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,760
I'm not.

194
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,900
You got up really early, Hongyo.

195
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,080
I just couldn't sleep.

196
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,600
- What would you like to drink?
- Ah, um...

197
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,340
Water, please.

198
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,240
- Here.
- Thank you.

199
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,960
Ah, by the way, Akari-san proposed to you, right?

200
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,780
Ah, right.

201
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,280
I wonder how it turned out...

202
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,280
Marriage...

203
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,720
What's that anyway?

204
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,540
Anyway, Terada-san,

205
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,540
You've been avoiding me, right?

206
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,180
Since that day.

207
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,900
You're angry at me indeed?

208
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,240
No, I'm not.

209
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,460
Well, I just feel...

210
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,660
...it's a bit hard for me to see you face-to-face.

211
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,660
I don't know what kind of expression I should make when we meet...

212
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,920
One more time left...

213
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,580
There's still one more time left, right? To sleep together.

214
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,980
Yes.

215
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,760
There is.

216
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,080
All right.

217
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,820
Then, I'll do my best.

218
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm counting on you, Terada-san.

219
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,420
Okay.

220
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,060
Then, I'm going back to sleep.

221
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,060
There's still more time left, huh?

222
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,640
Such insignificant words...

223
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,160
Why did I feel so happy after hearing it?

224
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,980
But...

225
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,140
That makes me wonder,

226
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,420
if I really am pregnant,

227
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,920
what should I do?

228
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,000
Terada-san?

229
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,000
Terada-san?

230
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,260
What are you doing? You creep me out.

231
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,660
Welcome back! You're home early.

232
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,780
Yeah.

233
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,320
Do you want a cup of tea?

234
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,440
Thank you.

235
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,060
Is Tomo out?

236
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,220
I think so.

237
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,160
He probably went out in the afternoon.

238
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,180
So, did you use it?

239
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,420
How was the result?

240
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,020
I haven't...

241
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,020
Huh? I thought you looked gloomy because the result had come out.

242
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,200
Well...

243
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,680
I was just...

244
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,240
...thinking why I was so careless at that time...

245
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,760
But, the same goes for Tomo too, right?

246
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,660
He should have been more careful, don't you think?

247
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,900
Well, about that...

248
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,160
Also, it's about what I said yesterday.

249
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,560
Even if you're pregnant, it won't get in the way of our wedding.

250
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,060
Huh? Where's your reaction?

251
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,200
Well...

252
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,340
If you're looking for a suitable partner, anyone will do, right?

253
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,460
Then, it's...

254
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,140
I didn't say, "anyone will do."

255
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,360
I said, "you're adequate for my needs."

256
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660
If I have to explain in details,

257
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:06,900
for example, every time you do someone a favor, you never brag about it. You don't complain either when people can't help you.

258
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,460
What you told me earlier,

259
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,420
you should have said , "I wish Tomo was more careful." instead.

260
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,100
What are you talking about?

261
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,460
Actually, I hate it when people do that, you know.

262
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,380
They help you without even being asked and expect you to do something in return. How awful.

263
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,360
But, women tend to do it a lot, right? Especially to people they're close with.

264
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,660
Also, you acknowledge others' existence by always greeting them.

265
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,500
Greet people? Did I?

266
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,180
"Good morning", "Good night", "I'm home", "Welcome home", "Itadakimasu", "Thank you for the meal."

267
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,900
You say those things a lot.

268
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
Is that so?

269
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,140
I didn't realize that...

270
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,620
I guess you didn't.

271
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,060
But...

272
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,920
It's a pretty big deal to me.

273
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,760
It might sound silly.

274
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,860
But, when I said, "you're adequate for my needs", it means you're the one who...

275
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,980
Excuse me for a sec.

276
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,420
I need to go back to the office.

277
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,260
Thanks for the tea.

278
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,840
Take care!

279
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,340
Well, whatever the result is, I think you should take the test as soon as possible.

280
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,860
Doing it later won't change the result anyway.

281
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,980
Okay...

282
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,120
Then...

283
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,700
See you later, Terada-san.

284
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,220
That definitely meant nothing at all.

285
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,300
It was a petty thing...

286
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,640
But, he praised me.

287
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,520
To be honest, I was glad.

288
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,980
Since I was a kid...

289
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,460
Good morning!

290
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,400
Quickly eat your breakfast!

291
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,840
Good morning, Mama.

292
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,000
Good morning!

293
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,220
Didn't I tell you to eat your breakfast quickly?

294
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,920
Why can't you do what I told you to?

295
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,920
Such a naughty kid.

296
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,360
She's never replied to my "good morning".

297
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,620
She wouldn't hear me.

298
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,120
Taichi-kun, you can take the entrance exam for that school, Papa has given you permission.

299
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,060
Aren't you glad?

300
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,260
It's such a nice school.

301
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,360
I've already told your friends.

302
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,120
I told them not to talk to you, since you guys can't play together anymore.

303
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,300
I'm so glad!

304
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,160
You need to study harder, okay?

305
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,580
Taichi-kun!

306
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,580
I'm on your side, you know!

307
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,640
I'm trying my best for you!

308
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,440
Why are you doing this?!!

309
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,240
Please open the door!

310
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,400
I was generous enough to buy it for you.

311
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,320
I made it for you.

312
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,160
I will do everything for you.

313
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,920
When I was a student,

314
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,060
I lived my life the way my mom wanted me to.

315
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,620
I finally got my freedom after finding a job.

316
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,760
She allowed me to live by myself.

317
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,880
Eh~? You live here all by yourself?

318
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,220
It's amazing!

319
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,000
If you give me your duplicate key,

320
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,200
I will take care of this house for you.

321
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,780
Excuse me~!

322
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,140
Welcome.

323
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,520
Didn't I say I would make you dinner?

324
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,640
Ah, sorry! Can you do it tomorrow morning?

325
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,240
You're awful.

326
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,460
How can you say that to me?

327
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,440
I'm trying my best for you, you know!

328
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Those little words and actions...

329
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,280
...suddenly reminded me of my mother.

330
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,640
Even though I'm doing this for you.

331
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,960
During those times, I met Tomo.

332
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,140
His lack of attachment was what made me curious.

333
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,740
Then, his ex-classmate appeared.

334
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,740
Nice to meet you.

335
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,940
I'm Terada.

336
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,920
Will you marry me or date me with marriage in mind?

337
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,900
It doesn't seem right after all...

338
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,400
If you think it's not right, you should just say no.

339
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,400
Or, you don't want to reject it, Terada-san?

340
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,540
She was the first person who made Tomo show his clingy side.

341
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,320
I wondered why...?

342
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,540
But anyway, I don't see my mother in her.

343
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,540
Mama... I feel sick...

344
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,160
You're a good boy, hold on until we reach the bathroom. I know you can do it.

345
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,900
I feel sick...

346
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,260
Oh, no! It stains your clothes too!

347
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,720
Wait, Papa!

348
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,700
It's bad! I feel sick!

349
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,800
What's the matter, Hase-san?

350
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,960
You look so pale!

351
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,280
Water...

352
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,520
Okay!

353
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,320
Hase-san!

354
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,600
Are you okay?

355
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,720
Sorry, I have to clean the...

356
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,580
I'll take care of it!

357
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,760
Are you all right?

358
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,100
If you still feel nauseous,

359
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,040
try throwing up again.

360
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,920
It's warm...

361
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,100
Terada-san...

362
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,240
Sorry for asking you this right now...

363
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,480
But, have you taken the pregnancy test yet?

364
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,440
No...

365
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,160
I haven't.

366
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,620
I wish you're expecting...

367
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,200
...a baby.

368
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,400
Because, if you are,

369
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,980
it'll increase the chances of us getting married.

370
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,080
Terada-san...

371
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,420
Will you marry me?

372
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,940
Whether you're pregnant,

373
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,940
or not,

374
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,940
let's do it.

375
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,740
Get married.
