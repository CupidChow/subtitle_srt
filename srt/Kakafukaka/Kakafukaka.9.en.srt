1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,654
- Huh?! You confessed to Tomoya?!

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,820
Yeah, and the words that comes out from his mouth are..

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,250
"I see."

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,100
- After that?
- Ah, after that..

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,190
"Then, those things I did, you didn't hate it, right?"

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,490
Is what he said. Hmm.

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,930
Then, I said "It's because I like you so I'm kinda happy to be touched by you".

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,900
"It's because I like you too, it can be painful".

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,640
- After that?
- Eh? After that..

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,890
It's become kinda painful to me,

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,420
so I ran away from his room. I eat first.

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,590
- Eh? Painful of what?
- Eh?

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,250
It's because you only told him that you like him,

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,430
You didn't ask for the answer, right?

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,440
Well, I mean I did my best gather all my courage to confess to him,

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,590
And then I got the "I see". What an uninterested answer.

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,980
Then, what kind of reaction that you're waiting for?

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,710
Well, of course it's..

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,320
Seriously?

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,420
I'm happy to know it.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,240
Actually, I also like you.

22
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,040
Oh! That's not Hongyo!

23
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,300
Didn't that "I see" means he pay his attention to you, isn't?

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,720
Maybe it's only you who think it's an uninterested answer.

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,790
Tomoya didn't said that, ain't he?

26
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,560
- Well, yeah.
- Terada-san.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,180
Don't you just think about the worst-case scenario because that's your habit as always?

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,180
- Seconds.
- Alright.

29
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,600
I'm not saying it is a bad thing,

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,240
But it's better to you to think the best-case scenario too.

31
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,760
If not, your words and actions will going to the negative direction as well.

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,080
Ah! I didn't realized that before!

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,250
I see. So, all of losing experiences that I had..!

34
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,050
It's getting ingrained in you, isn't?

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,050
In the first place, are you waiting for the answer, Terada-san?

36
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,720
- The answer?
- Eh? It's not?

37
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,750
If so, then..!

38
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,050
What kind of discussion is this!

39
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,510
At least, I understand,

40
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,530
That what's on Hongyo's mind,

41
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,630
I'll never know about it.

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,320
Okay!

43
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,770
So, if I want to know, I must ask him directly!

44
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:36,330
Ah!

45
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,240
Hongyo! There's..

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,070
something that I want to ask you.

47
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:53,890

Do not remove the watermark, claimed as yours etc.

49
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,130
Are you going to talk about our unfinished sleep together?

50
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,000
- Unfinished?
- Our last sleep together.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,600
We didn't sleep until morning as there's an interruption at that night.

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,100
So, there are about 40% left.

53
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
No! No! No! No!

54
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,930
Ah! How weak!

55
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,930
As I thought! I'm so weak!

56
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,780
As I thought, it's calming me enough.

57
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,130
Then? What did you want to ask me?

58
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,330
Eh? That's..

59
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,650
Listen, Hongyo.

60
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:12,540
What did you think about me during middle school, Hongyo?

61
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,050
Oh.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,611
Middle school's Terada was..

63
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,090
You were always laughing.

64
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,490
You always surrounded by a lot of people.
You looked having fun,

65
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,410
You could easily talk to anyone.

66
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:41,070
You even greeted me. That's awesome.

67
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,880
That's.. you didn't hate it?

68
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,980
Eh? I felt happy, you know.

69
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,950
I thought you were so kind, Terada-san.

70
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,730
Ah, then..

71
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,030
Then, that time when I said "let's date"?

72
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,460
That's.. I didn't clearly understand it but..

73
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,780
I felt lucky.

74
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,130
Hm? Eh?

75
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,440
That supposed-to-be cool and mysterious Hongyo was..!

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,290
Different as I thought!

77
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:20,790
But, when I kissed Terada-san, you looked so shocked.

78
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,830
It's because it's my first time saw you like that,

79
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,930
I felt so excited.

80
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,540
Then, I felt excited to look your expression more.

81
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:37,721
I can't hold back my excitement.

82
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,356
After that..

83
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,962
But after that day, you started to avoid me, Terada-san.

84
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,765
I thought to apologize to you.

85
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,305
But if I apologize, it seems that I'll denying various things at that time.

86
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,400
Somehow, I don't like that.

87
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,440
So, I couldn't apologize to you.

88
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,720
But, I'm really curious about it.

89
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,140
At that time, I should apologized to you. I'm sorry.

90
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,380
Ah, it's okay.

91
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,710
It's really different from what I thought.

92
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,270
I have to properly tell him.

93
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,280
Properly tell him.

94
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,890
Listen, Hongyo.

95
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:47,110
I did confessed that I like you, right?

96
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,220
Yeah.

97
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,830
At that time, you just responded "I see" only.

98
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,634
The truth is how did you feel?

99
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,750
Oh.

100
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,000
That's.. well.. shocked me enough.

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,040
So, you know..

102
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,010
To going out or something..

103
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,752
Ah.

104
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,330
If you ask about going out, I'll do, I guess.

105
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,191
Eh?

106
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,520
Ah! Yeah.

107
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,210
"I'll do, I guess.."

108
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,110
What with that "I guess"?

109
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,595
I eat first.

110
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,833
Well, I still kind of upset about it.

111
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,120
Anyway, I'm dating Hongyo at last!

112
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,200
As I thought! I'm so happy!

113
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,690
Boyfriend? Girlfriend?

114
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,450
- Tomo, do you have a minute?
- Okay.

115
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Woah!

116
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,280
- Excuse me. I want to buy this.
- Okay!

117
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,980
- Congrats!
- Thank you!

118
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,410
Thank you! Thank you!

119
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,340
Wah! Congrats! Good to you!

120
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,830
Thank you!

121
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,980
Aki-chan! Congrats!

122
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,700
- Cheers!
- You're awesome!

123
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,030
It just like my usual days.
But there's something different!

124
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,100
Ah!

125
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,390
- I'm~ home~! Hongyo!
- Welcome home.

126
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,340
Do you have anything that you want to eat?
I can make anything!

127
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,830
Curry or Hamburg? Jambalaya?

128
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,800
- Ja..?
- Hm?

129
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,320
Ah. It's okay. I don't feel hungry.

130
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,290
Ah, is that so?

131
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,290
Yeah.

132
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,960
I'm kind of saw this coming.

133
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,760
To compare before and after we're going out, Hongyo seems didn't changed.

134
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,070
I can say that he become more indifference than before.

135
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,070
Ah, Hon..

136
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,810
Always being together,

137
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,410
Or whispering some sweet words..

138
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,024
Are not something that I'm longing for.

139
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
But.

140
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,110
Hongyo!

141
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,690
- What?
- Ah, no..

142
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:57,290
Are we done with sleeping together?

143
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,900
Well, I mean, recently you seems did your best so..

144
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:09,380
If you're tired or what.. If that so, you can..

145
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,300
I'm going out right now.

146
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,570
Ah, sorry. I got it.

147
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,770
That's right. Sorry to say something weird.

148
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,900
Have a safe trip.

149
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,920
- Okay.
- Yeah.

150
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,060
The subtitle is brought by naonyaan@livejournal.com

151
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,200
He rejected my proposal to sleep together?
Why did he?

152
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,930
Is that any chance that sleeping together..

153
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,230
when we're going out didn't have any meaning at all?

154
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,990
In the first place, what "going out" means?!

155
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,550
Going out is.. Going out is..

156
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,520
Going out..

157
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,090
"To associate with others.."

158
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,690
Eh? Then, mutual love means..?

159
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,006
Mutual love means..

160
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,830
"To understand about each other's feelings.."

161
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,120
It seems that to going out,

162
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,020
And mutual love equal to nothing for us.

163
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:24,160
Two weeks passed, Hongyo still being indifferent.

164
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:27,310
We can't go forward neither go back as we used be.

165
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,398
It's tough!

166
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,569
Love is tough!

167
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,174
Are you okay?

168
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:42,011
These days, you look like a zombie, you know.

169
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,913
Zombie..?

170
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:50,420
To going out with Hongyo is exhausting, isn't?

171
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,354
Eh?

172
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,425
Well, all of girls that he dated also felt like this.

173
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,227
Tomo won't do anything.

174
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,696
They felt like Tomo didn't even like them.

175
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,768
I told you before, isn't?

176
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,471
The relationship with Tomo will lead to nothing.

177
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,978
Somehow,

178
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,114
I think it shouldn't be like this.

179
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,718
But, when I'm thinking what should be then,

180
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,686
As I thought..

181
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,591
I want him to like me.

182
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,828
Just like me.

183
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,264
That's one and only.

184
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,401
I just want him to start like me.

185
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,408
Yeah. That's normal to think like that.

186
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,470
But, that 'no one knows what he'd thinking of'..

187
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,514
Is one of Tomo's charms too.

188
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,483
There are also some of fun parts of him.

189
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,519
You're right.

190
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,859
By the way, I forgot to tell you this.

191
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,062
I like you, Terada-san.

192
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,199
If I can, I'm really want to get married with you.

193
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,935
Excuse me?!

194
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:15,872
That's.. sounds so cringe, isn't?

195
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,940
I can't.

196
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:21,280
If I being with you, I'll make you cringe.

197
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,354
I still..! Going out with Hongyo..!

198
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,525
"Still"? You said "still", ain't you?

199
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,261
Ah!

200
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,598
Let's stop here for today.

201
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,610
The subtitle is brought by naonyaan@livejournal.com

202
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:50,106
It's my first time to have someone face-to-face confessed me.

203
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,943
I think I want to like Hase-san.

204
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,412
I mean it.

205
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,318
Listen, Hongyo!

206
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,559
Since we're going out, you seems being more colder than ever.

207
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,896
We're also didn't kiss or sleep together.

208
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,998
Did something happened?

209
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,442
You know..

210
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,215
About our relationship..

211
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,552
As I thought, can we end it, right now?

212
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,123
I see.

213
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,992
Okay. I got it.

214
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,510
What are you making, Terada-san?

215
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,600
Ah, that's.. I'm still thinking about what I should make.

216
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,460
Make the green mame rice that you've make before.

217
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,260
Ah! Are you talking about Mame Rice, right?

218
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,400
If you help me then.

219
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Of course I will.

220
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,679
Terada-san, how's your relationship with Tomo?

221
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,284
- We break up.
- Eh? Really?

222
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,320
- Then, let's going out with me.
- Excuse me?

223
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,889
- You don't want to?
- Ah..

224
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,950
- If you don't want, just say so.
- That's not..

225
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,970
I mean, are you okay with this, Hase-san?

226
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,520
I made you listen to all my stories about Hongyo..

227
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,836
I'm kind of doing something thoughtless before.

228
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,705
I'll change that 'thoughtless' back.

229
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,590
Also, if you feel tired or tough being with me,

230
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,690
It's okay for you to run away from me.

231
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,860
In the end, I dated Hongyo..

232
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,920
For two weeks only.

233
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:24,193
It flew away.

234
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,320
- Ah! You just ate it.
- Nope.

235
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,420
- You did, ain't you?
- I didn't.

236
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,820
I mean you're chewing it earlier, don't you?

237
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,806
Oh~!

238
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,420
- Look delicious!
- What a nice smell, right?

239
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,740
- Then, I'll scoop it.
- Okay.

240
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,790
♬ Mame-mame-rice. Mame-rice~ ♬

241
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,290
By the way, Terada-san.

242
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,800
Have you kissed Tomo here?

243
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,588
Eh?

244
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,120
That wasn't direct contact, so it's safe, right?

245
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,790
Ah~ No.

246
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,790
I haven't.

247
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,340
Ah, sorry. I acted like a jealous child.

248
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,620
Somehow,

249
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,090
You look cute, Hase-san.

250
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,109
Terada-san.

251
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,090
I'm seriously like you, you know.

252
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,310
I'll treasure you.

253
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,860
Terada-san. Are you going to sleep?

254
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,920
- Yes. I am.
- Is that so?

255
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,890
Then, room.

256
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,950
Ah, okay.

257
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,270
- Go back to your room, okay?
- Eh?

258
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,290
Good night, Terada-san.

259
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:42,390
Ah, yeah. Good night.

260
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,760
Eh~? You won't.. invite me to yours?

261
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,220
You break up with Tomoya and date Hase-kun? Why?

262
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,510
Well, if it's fine with you, I don't mind to.

263
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,317
Yeah.

264
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,960
Ah, I did say this before.

265
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,020
Hase-kun is may not be a bad person,
but I wouldn't call him a good person.

266
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:11,127
Eh?

267
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,197
Yummy!

268
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,650
Hongyo.

269
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,930
What's wrong?

270
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,862
Is that true you're dating Hase right now?

271
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,369
Ah. Yeah.

272
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Sorry. I didn't tell you.

273
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,040
- I don't want it.
- Eh?

274
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,920
I don't want you to date Hase.

275
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,910
But..

276
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,240
Even if you said that..

277
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,080
You said you like me.

278
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,380
Yeah, I did.

279
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,567
But, I quit. I gonna stop loving you, Hongyo.

280
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:32,641
I mean, after we started dating,
I didn't have any clue about what you'd been thinking of.

281
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,090
Even I asked, you won't tell me.

282
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,190
- But that's because..
- It's okay!

283
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:39,982
It's okay to not tell me the reason.

284
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,386
Even if you had a reason,

285
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:47,490
I don't even want to know that too!

286
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:53,990
I was thinking about your every single action and word so hard,

287
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,960
You got my hopes up for nothing.

288
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,400
Then..

289
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:03,100
I become to hate myself for being like this!

290
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,380
That's why..

291
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,309
I got it.

292
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:18,360
The subtitle is brought by naonyaan@livejournal.com

293
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,000
Terada-san. Do you have a minute?

294
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,760
I heard that you're kind of arguing with Tomo.
Are you alright?

295
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,620
Ah. I am.

296
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,250
But, it's not an argument..

297
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,300
Tomo said what?

298
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,690
He want to make sure that is it true or not
about I'm dating Hase-san.. or something like that.

299
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,790
- That's only?
- Yes.

300
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,310
- I see.
- Eh?

301
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,140
Ah. It's nothing.

302
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,890
Terada-san.

303
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,306
As I thought, you still like Tomo?

304
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:17,646
Sorry. To be honest,
that kind of feeling won't quickly disappear..

305
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:20,720
That's right.

306
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,390
No, I'm sorry too.

307
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,410
Well, it's not normal, isn't?

308
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,670
To live with your ex-boyfriend and current boyfriend.

309
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,400
Ah. I'm sorry.

310
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,000
Ah, no. It's not like I'm blaming you or what.

311
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,936
But, well, it's a great opportunity.

312
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,450
Let's disband this share house.

313
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,250
Eh? Disband?!

314
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,048
It's impossible. I won't move out.

315
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,050
I was thinking about move out from this share house.

316
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,088
Didn't it will be meaningless if you move out
from this house in this kind of situation?

317
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,380
Won't.. it? Before kiss..

318
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,380
- I want to stay by Terada-san's side.
- I don't know.
