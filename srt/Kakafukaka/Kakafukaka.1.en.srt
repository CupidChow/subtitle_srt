1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,260
Terada-san, what is your hobby?

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,120
Hobby?

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,820
Yes.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,680
Ah, hobby!

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,540
I don't have any...

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,980
Then...

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,160
- Do you have any special skills?
- I don't...

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,160
What about dreams?

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,160
You must have a dream, right?

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,260
Dreams?

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,620
I...

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,940
- ...don't have any, either.
- Seriously?

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,180
You have nothing...

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,160
Yeah...

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,700
Terada Aki. 24 years old.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,740
No hobbies, no special skills, no dreams.

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,980
As a result of a heart-breaking job search process that felt like hell 2 years ago, I ended up as a part-time worker at a convenience store now.

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,240
Welcome~

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,180
I already don't have anything,
but, this morning...

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,600
Shall we make it today?

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,120
Daisuke...

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,940
I'm sorry, Aki...

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,600
I wanted to tell you earlier, though...

24
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,080
I lost my 4-year boyfriend, with whom I had been living together for 2 years.

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,920
30 yen less than the regular price.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,540
Half-price from the original price.

27
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,840
Hey...

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,760
Terada-san, there's something on your back.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,860
You became "half-price"...

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,980
What?!

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,520
Here you go.

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,980
Half-price from the original price.

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,880
Well~ I had this hunch since a long time ago,
I was wondering if he was cheating on me...

34
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,580
Daisuke was at fault. He violated the rules.

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,840
- You've left your place and been carrying your luggage around?
- Well, it's impossible for me to keep sleeping in that bed!

36
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,480
- So, you're currently searching for a place?
- But, I really don't have money at the moment.

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,140
Even if it's only for a security deposit!

38
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,020
- So...
- You can't stay in my place.

39
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,600
I can't sleep when there are people around.

40
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,900
You're so cruel~ I was rejected before even asking...

41
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,060
Hey! What about my place?

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,540
- Your sharehouse?
- Yes.

43
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,920
You can live without having to spend too much money.

44
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,420
Well, I would be grateful, but...

45
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,000
is there any vacant room?

46
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,420
Yes. I'm moving out!

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,980
I was going to tell you this later, but...

48
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,980
I'm getting married.

49
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,300
- Sorry?
- Sorry?

50
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,560
That's why it will help me a lot if Aki can move in to replace me.

51
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,160
No, no, no, no...

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,480
No way, this is the place?

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,140
It's the place.

54
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,740
It's a really elegant house!

55
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,240
Hase-kun said he was originally the caretaker of his grandpa house.

56
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,240
How many people are living here?

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
There are three people now.

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,760
Hase-kun, Tomo-kun,

59
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,220
and also this one woman, but after I called the house earlier, Tomo-kun seems to be the only one home right now.

60
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,140
Let's greet him for now.

61
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,160
Thanks.

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,260
"I'm home~" not anymore, it's, "excuse me~"

63
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,460
Excuse me~

64
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,680
Tomo-kun!

65
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,900
I brought along the new housemate!

66
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,280
Yeah.

67
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Well..

68
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,920
Starting today, I...

69
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,220
Terada-san?

70
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,160
Terada-san,

71
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,620
that's who you are, right?

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,780
Hongyo?!

73
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,940
I haven't forgotten, though I can't remember it clearly.

74
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,100
Even now, it's still a bitter and sour memory.

75

78
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,260
Thank you for everything.
I'll live happily.
Nori.

79
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,860
So cool! So, you guys know each other?

80
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,860
We first knew each other...

81
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,260
...when we were classmates in junior high.

82
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,940
Isn't that awesome?

83
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,420
Junior high...

84
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,660
Let me...

85
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,200
And also...

86
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,880
- ...my first...
- Whoaaaaaaaa~!!!

87
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,840
Your first....?

88
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,400
Well...

89
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,960
We haven't seen each other since graduation...

90
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,820
So, it's our first....reunion?

91
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,580
It's been a loooong time~~~

92
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,580
This Hongyo Tomoya was my classmate...

93
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,180
He was also my first boyfriend...

94
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,000
And...

95
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,640
He was also the first person I did "that thing" with.

96
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,300
Nori-chan, do you know Soseki-sensei?

97
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,780
Of course, I do.

98
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,880
He was cool, also cute...

99
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,460
Nori-chan!

100
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,360
I...

101
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,760
...don't think I can live here...

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,580
But, do you have another place to live?

103
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,160
How about money? For security deposit?

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,340
Well, how about you try to live here for a while?

105
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,980
You can search for another place in the meantime.

106
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,360
Besides, you guys meet each other again like this, isn't it fate?

107
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,020
Right, Tomo-kun?

108
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,380
Yeah.

109
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,200
Whichever is fine with me.

110
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,120
You can choose whatever you want, Terada-san.

111
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,540
Then, I'm done here.

112
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,900
Tomo-kun, please explain everything to her.

113
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,340
I give you my bed and my other stuff. Use them if you like!

114
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,140
Bye then!

115
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,700
I'll be thankful for that, but...

116
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,360
Do you want to put your stuff in your room for now?

117
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,380
Yes.

118
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
This is your room.

119
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,920
Thanks.

120
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
It's really been a long time, right?

121
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Ah, right~!

122
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,340
I was surprised.

123
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,500
I was also surprised that you came here.
What do you do now?

124
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,800
I'm a part-time worker at a convenience store...

125
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,680
I completely failed at finding a proper job.

126
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,460
I didn't pass all the tests that it was almost funny.

127
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,260
Well, I don't have any special skills or something like that...

128
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,740
I'm not a sociable person,
I'm not good at dealing with things either.

129
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,640
I think I just couldn't help it~

130
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,640
Hongyo, what do you do for work?

131
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,960
I'm in publishing...

132
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,540
You're amazing!

133
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,680
That's excellent.

134
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,720
- No. It's not really...
- That's amazing! I mean,

135
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,600
it sounds like a popular job~!

136
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,720
I feel like...

137
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,020
...you've changed, right, Terada-san?

138
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,920
During my junior high days,

139
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,180
I was somewhat invincible...

140
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,640
I had no foundations, no doubts...

141
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,560
I was the center of the world.

142
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,300
- It's awesome! Look at this
- That's really awesome!

143
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,140
Hongyo!

144
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,500
What are you doing?

145
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,600
Nothing...

146
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,600
Hey...

147
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,120
Hongyo, do you have a girlfriend?

148
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,120
No...

149
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,560
Then, I don't mind to be your girlfriend.

150
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,640
But, right now...

151
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,540
Terada-san?

152
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,880
Did I really change~?

153
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,380
You didn't really change much,

154
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,680
but somehow you look like you've become more popular now.

155
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,440
Am I being too persistent?

156
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,400
I'll explain about the kitchen, and other shared spaces.

157
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,220
Sorry...

158
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,520
About the food and everything here,

159
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,260
write your name on it if you don't want others to take it.

160
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,520
Okay.

161
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,920
If there's no name on it, you're free to use or eat it.

162
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,920
All right...

163
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,540
There are some heavy pots up there, be careful.

164
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,540
Thanks...

165
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,540
Well...

166
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,680
I feel like...

167
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,800
...something is poking my butt...

168
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,100
Yeah...

169
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,580
Well, stay away from me quickly!

170
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,080
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,820
Terada-san...

172
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,240
Yes.

173
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,340
I have something to discuss with you...

174
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,680
May I go to your room?

175
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,160
HUH? What are you thinking??!

176
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,780
The second you step into my room,

177
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,260
I'll tear it to pieces!

178
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,700
Nori-chan will be married, have children, and become a mother.

179
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,240
Iino is a full-time employee, she said her work is fun.

180
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,380
Meanwhile,

181
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,740
I was dumped by my boyfriend,

182
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,920
I don't have money nor a stable job.

183
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,620
My ex-boyfriend made fun of me by trying to make out with me right away.

184
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,920
I feel like you've changed, right, Terada-san?

185
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,440
It's not like I really changed...

186
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,280
It's just, I've been slowly realizing...

187
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,120
...that...

188
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,180
...I'm actually a way more pitiful person than I thought I was.

189
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,940
Terada-san!

190
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,640
What?!

191
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,700
I'm going out for a while. You don't have to properly lock the door.

192
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,380
Someone might come home, but I think Nori-chan has already told them about you.

193
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,260
Bye then.

194
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,340
Itadakimasu.

195
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,800
That night,

196
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,260
there was no sign that Hongyo had returned.

197
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,480
I mean...

198
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,100
No one in the sharehouse has come home.

199
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,680
Hongyo?

200
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,220
Hongyo?

201
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,220
Hongyo, You'll catch a... Eeww!

202
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,220
You reek of alcohol!

203
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,500
The perfume is too strong!

204
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,080
Hongyo...

205
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,700
Well, whatever then!

206
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,080
A few days after that...

207
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,180
Hey, Hongyo!

208
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,400
Gosh!

209
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,320
Hongyo! That's enough!

210
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,580
Terada-san.

211
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,260
- It's been a long time.
- I didn't say anything, but I keep seeing you doing this every single night!

212
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,540
- But, I...
- Listen...

213
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,140
I don't really care if you want to mess around, but,

214
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,880
you're so noisy at midnight!
I can smell alcohol and women's perfume on you!

215
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,700
Can you please sleep in your bed?
It bothers me to see you sleeping in the hall or the entrance!

216
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,780
- You indeed have changed...
- Also,

217
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,840
I haven't seen the other housemates at all, what's going on, really?

218
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,980
I think Akari told me she would go on a trip.

219
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,120
I don't know about Hase, but, he doesn't come home often.

220
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,840
Is that so?

221
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,280
Yeah.

222
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,360
Terada-san, sorry,  it's only for a sec.

223
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,300
Wait, wait, Hon...Let go of...

224
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,420
Hongyo...

225
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,420
Well...

226
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,020
I feel like something is touching my lower back...

227
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,660
Yeah.

228
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,280
Amazing! Just like I thought.

229
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,000
Are you going through puberty or something??

230
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,000
You know what, Terada-san,

231
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,000
please listen to me.

232
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,300
Actually,

233
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,880
I had failed to get an erection for the last two years.

234
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,280
I still don't know what started it all...

235
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,280
But somehow...

236
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,360
I also don't get hard in the morning.

237
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,580
I feel really depressed.

238
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,220
Well, then...

239
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,980
What about...

240
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,980
..."your son" right there?

241
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,620
Right.

242
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,920
Even I was surprised.

243
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,700
The last time this thing happened with you a few days ago,

244
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,540
I thought I was already cured,

245
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,520
but, when I tried it with other girls, I couldn't get it up at all.

246
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,140
But, it became like this right now...

247
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,220
Well, that's...

248
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,220
This thing has been stressing me out pretty heavily.

249
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,600
I feel so dejected.

250
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,620
I don't quite understand, but...

251
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,900
Maybe it's because of this familiar scent or something?

252
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,720
Hongyo...

253
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,660
Sorry, please let go of me...

254
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,160
Sorry!

255
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,240
I think Terada-san...

256
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,080
...is my only hope for now.

257
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,740
So...

258
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,660
I don't have any weird intentions, but I wish you can help me.

259
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,720
I will never do anything weird to you.

260
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,960
Your first boyfriend,

261
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,600
that you just met after a long time,

262
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,640
- is impotent?
- Hey, hey!

263
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Keep your voice down!

264
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,940
Sorry..

265
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,180
But...

266
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,840
Why does he only react to you, Aki?

267
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,480
That's why he asked me to help him out.

268
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,260
- What the hell with that?
- I don't know!

269
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,880
Well...

270
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,380
I felt the warmth of a human's body after such a long time.

271
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
It also felt nostalgic...

272
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,440
I was...

273
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,080
...losing my mind for a while, but...

274
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,320
But?

275
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
I decided to go back to my room.

276
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,700
I mean,

277
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,680
if you don't like it, you can just tell him straight, right?

278
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,540
It's nothing to worry about, is it?

279
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,260
It's not like you guys are the only ones living in there.

280
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,500
He can't do anything weird either, right?

281
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,580
If something happens, you should just run away.

282
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,240
If I don't like it, I should tell him straight?

283
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,800
In junior high, I was at the top of the school's caste system.

284
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,120
But...

285
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,960
As I grew up, I realized that I wasn't really that special.

286
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,480
We're sorry to inform you that you didn't pass...

287
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,240
Thank you for everything...

288
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,540
We wish you the best of luck.

289
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,000
Every single day, I kept being rejected...

290
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,620
...by all the companies I applied to.

291
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,980
Shall we make it today?

292
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,260
On top of that,

293
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,700
my boyfriend dumped me...

294
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,560
- Let's play on the slide!
- Okay!

295
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,480
I'm worthless after all...

296
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,480
I'm pitiful...

297
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,240
That's why I couldn't help it...

298
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,600
But...

299
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,600
I think Terada-san...

300
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,480
is my only hope for now.

301
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,300
Welcome home, Terada-san.

302
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,680
Hongyo...

303
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,680
I'm home.

304
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,300
It's about the favor I asked you for yesterday.

305
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,280
If you don't want to do it, it's okay.

306
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,780
It's not like I wanted to force you.

307
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,560
In the future,

308
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,000
all I have to do is live like a corpse anyway.

309
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,980
A c-corpse?

310
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,980
It's impossible!

311
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,220
Isn't it obvious that it's impossible?

312
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,100
Right.

313
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,060
But!

314
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,580
Just don't...

315
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,460
Just don't do anything weird to me!

316
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,280
Then, I will...

317
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,700
...help you somehow.

318
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,160
Really?

319
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,660
Thank you, Terada-san!

320
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,960
Hongyo!

321
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,880
Sorry!

322
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,280
Okay, for now...

323
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,840
Come.

324
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,040
I just want to make sure one more time...

325
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,980
I think one more important thing is to let the body learn...

326
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,460
...that it still has the ability.

327
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,080
Is that so?

328
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,640
All right...

329
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,420
Then...

330
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,820
Excuse me...

331
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,560
It's transforming!

332
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,300
It's Hongyo's...

333
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,660
Hongyo is...!

334
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,400
I'm still alive...

335
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,860
What the hell?

336
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,220
Thank you, Terada-san...

337
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,340
He's doing this...

338
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,440
...on purpose?

339
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,740
No! But...

340
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,740
I'm home~!

341
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,160
Tomo?
