1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,560
In other words,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,000
for the last 2 years, I haven't been able to get hard, or write a single novel.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,520
Will you be in trouble if you can't write again?

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,960
Rather than be in trouble, I'll be done for.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,260
- Only three more times...
- Really?

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,820
Can I move my hand a little bit?

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,360
I just came.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,460
Eeeehhhhhh~?

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,640
Well, umm...

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,900
That thing inside my underwear and my pants,

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,140
I rubbed it too aggressively...

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,520
I even do it in my sleeps...

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,080
Something like that can happen too...

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,260
Okay...

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,220
But...

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,220
You know,

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,820
it happened after a really long time...

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,340
I'm happy.

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,480
A little.

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,820
We've changed the sheets, so let's go back to sleep.

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,000
But...

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,500
Doesn't it mean that...

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,420
...you've been cured?

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,920
But, I only came a little bit.

25
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,840
And I'm still not sure about my "healthy morning".

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,840
All right.

27
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,840
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,220
Good morning, Terada-san!

29
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,700
Good morning!

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,940
- Thank you for doing the chores.
- No problem.

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,620
Since I'm indebted to Akari-san, I thought I should clean at least the shared spaces.

32
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,380
What do you mean?

33
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,060
Anyway, thank you.

34
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,140
I'm going to make coffee. You want some?

35
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,180
Yes!

36
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,740
May I?

37
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,040
Yes, okay.

38
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,480
Good morning.

39
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,480
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,080
Terada-san, why didn't you wake me up?

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,460
I did!

42
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,700
FYI, I tried to wake you up this morning!

43
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,700
I woke you up many times, but you slept like a log and didn't even...

44
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,260
Did you guys sleep together again?

45
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Yes...

46
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,300
And, how do you feel now, Tomo?

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,820
Well...

48
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,220
I'm doing my best.

49
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,060
I see. Good luck!

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,240
We run out of coffee beans, so, I'm going to buy some.

51
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,840
Thank you.

52
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,300
Did you sleep well?

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,640
Yeah.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,640
Thanks to that.

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,760
Glad to hear that.

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,420
Why are you wearing a mask?

57
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,760
I've been dusting the house.

58
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,800
It was an indirect kiss, so, it's safe, right?

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,120
I'm going to wash my face.

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,280
Should I feed you?

64
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,500
No need to.

65
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,380
The cutlets are done.

66
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,060
Here.

67
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,180
Incredible...

68
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,500
Tomoya,

69
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,520
let's eat.

70
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,140
Itadakimasu!

71
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,960
These look good.

72
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm glad you think so.

73
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's eat.

74
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,740
You look more cheerful somehow, Tomo.

75
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,660
Not really.

76
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,220
You've spent your time in the living room more often, lately.

77
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,280
Well, yeah.

78
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,120
You too, Akari.

79
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,040
Of course! Because there's bait here.

80
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,740
- Terada-san, seconds!
- Okay.

81
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,280
Don't call it "bait".

82
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,480
But, cutlets for breakfast?

83
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,380
Hase-san, you can have some if you like.

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,820
Thanks!

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,080
But, I don't usually have breakfast.

86
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,320
You need the most calories in the morning, you know.

87
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,120
But, cutlets are too heavy for me.

88
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,820
Hey, Hase-kun!

89
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,860
Your phone's ringing. You won't answer it?

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,520
Ah, sorry, sorry.

91
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,120
It's from someone who's a bit annoying.

92
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,380
I haven't slept with Hongyo since then.

93
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,380
I remembered that!

94
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,120
I wonder...

95
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,720
...what that was all about?

96
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,760
Hongyo...

97
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,380
What was he thinking of me?

98
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,320
Good work!

99
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,340
Hase-kun? What brings you here?

100
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,960
- Is Terada-san here?
- Yes!

101
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,720
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?

102
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,280
You don't need to work overtime tonight, so, you can go.

103
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,540
Okay.

104
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,080
We might become a couple in the near future, so, we need to know each other better.

105
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,280
For real?

106
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,300
You guys are in such a relationship?

107
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,380
No, we aren't!

108
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,880
She hasn't said "Okay" after I proposed to her, though.

109
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,220
PROPOSE??!

110
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,440
You should have told me this earlier!

111
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Then, see you tonight, Terada-san.

112
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,680
Congratulations on your marriage!!

113
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,680
Sorry for asking you so suddenly.

114
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,780
I have already ordered the food.

115
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,420
Yes...

116
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,900
Hello.

117
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,900
Nice to meet you.

118
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,540
Sorry, I made you come all the way here.

119
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,840
I'm Taichi's mother.

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,200
Mom, this is Terada-san, who is nice enough to allow me to date her.

121
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,060
She's such a pretty young lady.

122
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,120
Terada-san, this is my mother.

123
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,040
Nice to meet you.

124
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,740
I'm Terada Aki.

125
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,480
I was tricked!

126
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:33,580
This restaurant is so popular that you should make reservations in advance to ensure that you'll get a seat.

127
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,280
- Aki-san!
- Yes.

128
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,420
Don't hesitate to eat a lot today!

129
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,420
Okay! Thank you so much!

130
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,900
So.. How old are you now, Aki-san?

131
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,060
And which university did you go to?

132
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,060
Umm.. I'm 24 years old.

133
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,960
I graduated from Keihin University.

134
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,400
That's fine!

135
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,320
What kind of university you went to doesn't really matter...

136
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,960
Such an education-conscious society is not relevant anymore!
Don't worry about that!

137
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,820
Thank you for waiting.

138
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,540
Mom, that's our appetizer.

139
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,500
Here's your seafood terrine and seasonal appetizer platter.

140
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,680
Well, they look so good.

141
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,300
Please excuse us.

142
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,220
So, you guys are getting married, right?

143
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,220
For now, we're only dating with marriage in mind.

144
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,220
We haven't decided on it yet.

145
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,700
Then, get married as soon as possible!

146
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,320
It's never too early to have a baby!

147
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,280
Sorry?

148
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,740
I'm saying this for your sake, Aki-san.

149
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,840
When I gave birth to Taichi, I suffered a lot!

150
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,380
That was so hard!

151
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,620
From there onwards,

152
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,600
she kept on talking about how hard it was for her,

153
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,880
but she raised him with patient and love anyway.

154
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,320
And how she sent her son to a good university,

155
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,820
that he landed a job at a top-level company.

156
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,520
Also about how she raised him into a good adult...

157
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,700
That was how the story continued.

158
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,960
Good job, Terada-san.

159
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,300
Thank you so much!

160
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,420
No need to!

161
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,460
I mean, you deceived me, Hase-san!

162
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,140
I didn't mean to.

163
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,100
But, you really saved me, you know.

164
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,420
I was too careless when talking with her on the phone.

165
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,280
She would have barged into our house if she couldn't meet my girlfriend.

166
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,120
You really don't want her to come over?

167
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,540
Well, every time I think that she might meet Akari and talk to her, I get too scared.

168
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,840
They're like water and oil, or even water and sodium.

169
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,800
You're right!

170
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,360
They would make a strong explosion!

171
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,460
Also,

172
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,200
I want to keep her away from Tomo.

173
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,440
I won't let her get closer to you either. Don't worry.

174
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,980
Okay.

175
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,480
We got mails?

176
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,480
Yeah. Plenty of them.

177
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,580
This one is a wedding announcement from my acquaintance.

178
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,660
- I'm home!
- I'm home.

179
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,800
Huh? Did you guys go out together?

180
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,500
Yes, we went out for dinner.

181
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,800
He stopped at that part.

182
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,440
This one is for you.

183
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,080
It's a wedding announcement from Asami-chan.

184
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,280
Eh?

185
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,000
We Got Married !

186
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,560
Amazing!

187
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,920
She's married now.

188
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,180
What's so amazing about this is that she sent it to you.
She must have done it out of spite.

189
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,980
She's beautiful, isn't she?

190
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,860
Is she your acquaintance, Hongyo?

191
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,900
You can say that, but, she's Tomo's ex-girlfriend.

192
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,100
They went out for a year or so.

193
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,700
Yeah, maybe.

194
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,500
But, she dumped him.

195
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Because he couldn't get it up for her.

196
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,860
I see, he had a girlfriend?

197
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,160
That could happen, right?

198
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,780
About that,

199
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,780
my deepest condolences!

200
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,780
It's very kind of you.

201
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,140
You must be pretty hurt right now, right?

202
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,780
Don't worry about that!

203
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,160
Tomo and I are similar.

204
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,900
We've never really fallen for someone even if we have a girlfriend.

205
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,860
Is that so~?

206
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,500
That's why we hit it off very well since the beginning.

207
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,300
But, that is the only thing we have in common.

208
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,740
Right, Tomo? You've never really fallen for someone, have you?

209
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
No, I haven't.

210
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,740
Maybe it's because of this familiar scent?

211
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,420
Such people really exist, huh?

212
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,380
Those who have never really fallen in love...

213
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,120
There are such people out there, you just don't realize that.

214
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,020
No, no, no. I really don't think so.

215
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,540
Speaking about the old days,

216
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,160
Actually, I kind of had my hopes up about Hongyo...

217
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,960
I was pretty shocked...

218
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,280
After hearing that Hongyo had a girlfriend, and his statement about how he never fell for someone.

219
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,000
Stop pulling such a long face first thing in the morning!

220
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,300
- Good morning!
- Morning!

221
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,600
What kind of miso soup today?

222
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
It's a radish-with-fried-tofu one.

223
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,860
I smell miso soup.

224
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,420
Good morning, Tomoya!

225
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,840
Good timing! Let's have breakfast together!

226
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,640
Good morning, Hongyo.

227
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,700
Good morning.

228
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,960
Thanks.

229
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,360
Did you sleep well?

230
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,900
At the end of the day,

231
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,720
I always end up like this...

232
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,820
Every time I get my hopes up about something,

233
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,160
and then get proven wrong,

234
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,540
Daisuke...

235
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,280
my own price tag will be replaced by the cheaper one once again.

236
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,100
70% off

237
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,780
And right now, it's plunged again to a new low.

238
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,780
By the way, Terada-san,

239
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,120
I heard you had dinner with Hase-kun's mother?

240
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,720
Yeah.

241
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,420
You guys are progressing really steadily.

242
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,100
Well, about that...

243
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,660
Thanks for the food.

244
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,880
Tomoya, you've finished your meal?

245
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,380
- I'm going out for a while.
- Yeah?

246
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,260
Goodbye!

247
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,600
Take care!

248
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,700
Take care.

249
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm off.

250
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,880
Are you really okay with that, Terada-san?

251
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,440
Hase-kun is not a terrible person, but I can't say he's a good person either.

252
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,620
I won't stop you, but I can't support you either.

253
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,460
But, I haven't said "OK" yet...

254
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,260
Is that so?

255
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,520
Yes.

256
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,540
Actually, I'm kind of thankful to him, though.

257
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,860
He was willing to accept someone like me.

258
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,860
Well, you know,

259
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,940
compared to Hongyo, Hase-san, or you,
I'm kind of at the bottom of the pyramid, right?

260
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,220
Let me refill the tea.

261
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,440
I don't have any goals, or special skills.
I'm a third-class job-hopper.

262
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,120
I don't even belong here.

263
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:17,060
Well, I just happened to be here that Hase-san proposed to me.
But, if I were him, I wouldn't even want to choose someone like me.

264
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,060
Hase-san is really unlucky, in a sense!

265
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,060
Terada-san,

266
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,940
you speak like that sometimes.

267
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,240
Laughing like an idiot, thinking you couldn't help it, or underestimating yourself.

268
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,240
Can you stop doing that?

269
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,040
It was so unpleasant to hear.

270
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,240
If you have such a low self-esteem, keep it to yourself,

271
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,440
you don't have to show it to others.

272
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,100
I'm sorry...

273
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,940
You don't need to apologize, though.

274
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,180
It's a request, not a warning.

275
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,180
Okay...

276
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,420
Well...

277
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,980
You know,

278
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,260
in the past,

279
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,440
I used to think so highly of myself.

280
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,120
It was really just a meaningless self-confidence...

281
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,120
But, as the time went by,

282
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,660
the reality had hit me so hard.

283
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,640
To put it simply,

284
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,440
it was like, after you put an expensive price tag on yourself,

285
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,240
you've been gradually replacing it with the cheaper ones over time...

286
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
That's a really low price tag...

287
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,940
It's so pitiful.

288
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,840
That's all.

289
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:49,060
So, you're saying, you decided to put such low price tags on your worth?

290
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,120
I see.

291
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,600
Terada-san, you said you had such an unnecessary high pride.

292
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,940
You're quite self-conscious, aren't you?

293
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,320
Self-conscious?

294
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,800
In the first place, people won't care about the price tags if they're not buying.

295
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,920
It's okay, Terada-san.

296
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:13,240
If you don't deliberately show your low self-worth,
most people won't see it anyway.

297
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,580
Also, you can always negotiate your price with those interested in you.

298
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,120
That's right.

299
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,700
Then, whether now or in the past,

300
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,660
he never looked down on me, or felt I looked down on him.

301
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,480
You've never really fallen for someone, have you?

302
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,000
No, I haven't.

303
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,300
I was flustered and upset...

304
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,580
But, it was me who was overthinking it...

305
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,960
In the first place, from Hongyo's point of view,

306
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,860
there might not have been any price tag attached on me.

307
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,220
Why is it?

308
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,780
Somehow, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my mind.

309
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,060
Welcome home.

310
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,480
Terada-san, there are still 2 more times left, right?

311
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,780
You're talking about sleeping together?

312
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,400
Yes, there are.

313
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,200
You want to do it tonight?

314
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,660
If you can.

315
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,560
All right, then.

316
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,900
If I don't get my hopes up,

317
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,260
I won't have anything to worry about.

318
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,220
By the way, Terada-san,

319
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,020
is everything okay?

320
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,840
Well, today,

321
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,960
I feel like you look way too calm regarding this.

322
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,060
That's so unlike you.

323
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,060
Really?

324
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,740
Well,

325
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,440
I've been complaining a little too much up until now.

326
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,120
Well, that's because I asked for such weird things.

327
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,680
You're right.

328
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,860
If I don't get my hopes up, I can speak this easily with Hongyo.

329
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,280
I don't feel restless, or nervous anymore.

330
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,780
My back...

331
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,220
...feels so warm.

332
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,060
After all...

333
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,040
It just simply feels really good.

334
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,280
Hey, Hongyo...

335
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,280
You said this before, right?

336
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,740
When we're in this position,

337
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,420
it makes you want to do it.

338
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,140
Yeah.

339
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,020
Do you still want to do it today?

340
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,440
Well,

341
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,020
yeah.

342
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,260
Then you can do it, if you want.

343
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,260
Well...

344
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,100
If you don't want to do it, I won't...

345
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,740
I don't think like that...

346
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,420
Whether it's restless or nervous,

347
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,120
anxious or excited,

348
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,620
I won't have such unnecessary feelings anymore.

349
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,140
It has simply become clearer now.

350
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,900
I can't say I want to do it,

351
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,400
but I feel like...

352
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,960
...I want you to touch me a little more, Hongyo.

353
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,460
Thank you...

354
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,460
Terada-san...

355
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,460
I'm not sure if I can't handle this,

356
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,980
so, can we do it in this position?

357
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Yeah.

358
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,780
Even if something changes after this,

359
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,260
or even if nothing changes at all,

360
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,960
I think I will be fine either way.

361
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
Then...

362
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,620
Excuse me...

363
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,120
It feels weird that I can't see the other person.

364
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,580
Terada-san...

365
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,060
Please lift your waist a little...

366
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,700
Right...

367
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,340
It's okay.

368
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,640
Right...

369
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,300
Don't avoid it, Terada-san.

370
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,480
Stay still.
