1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,460
I want you to help me.
I won't do anything weird to you.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,860
If he's with you, he will "react", the hell is that?

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,420
It's like you're feeling guilty.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,880
What's considered "weird"?

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,180
Everything you don't want to do is the "weird" thing.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,780
If you're okay with that, then, it's not considered "weird".

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,100
Even if he told me that...

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,060
Hey...

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,880
You should have at least turned on the lights.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,260
Akari-san!

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,900
Good morning!

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,000
- You're up so early!
- It's not that I got up early,

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,120
I just came home now.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,040
You've worked hard!

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,260
What are you doing this early  in the morning, Terada-san?

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,480
Eh?

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,240
Don't tell me,

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,940
- you were doing something with Tomoya?!
- No!

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,380
I just couldn't sleep...

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,280
Really? That's fine, then.

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,020
I'll be back to work this afternoon, so, I'm going to sleep for a bit.

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,760
You should get some sleep too.

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,160
Yes...

24
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,620
- Good night!
- Good night.

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm so relieved...

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,580
She didn't see me coming out of Hongyo's room...

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,840
Hongyo,

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,220
you don't have any urge to do "that"?

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,660
Even if it's just a little bit?

30
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,340
Of course I really want to do it.

31
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,300
Aaaakkkhh!! What was with that?!

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,300
Let's just make breakfast for now.

33
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,840
It's an escape from reality!

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,260
I made too much breakfast, you can have some if you like.
Terada.

38
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,900
I smell something delicious...

39
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,120
Eh? Akari, you're home?

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,060
What about you? It's unusual seeing you here.

41
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,580
Btw, what's with this smell? Did you make something?

42
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,580
Can I have some?

43
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,560
Ah no, it was Terada-san who made it.

44
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,080
She made a bit too much. We can eat them all.

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Fried eggs!

46
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,680
Boiled veggies with soy sauce!

47
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,080
Stew?!

48
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,020
It's all homemade!!

49
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,860
Calm down, Akari.

50
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,860
What time is it now?

51
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,140
Tomoya!

52
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,820
Long time no see! How are you?

53
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
It's 11 am now.

54
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,220
Ahh...

55
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,980
I slept so well for the first time in forever. My head hurts...

56
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,600
Are you okay?

57
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,220
But, I'm glad that you had a nice sleep.

58
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,220
Let's have breakfast together!

59
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,000
It's a luxurious one, today!

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,340
Terada-san made it.

61
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,200
By the way, where is she?

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,620
She already went to work. She wasn't here when I woke up.

63
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,240
I see...

64
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,020
Terada-san!

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,020
Good morning!

66
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,680
Thank you for the breakfast!

67
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,300
It was really good!

68
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,300
You're welcome.

69
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,420
Especially the pork stew.

70
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,600
It's the best!

71
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,440
The finest!

72
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,640
The strongest!

73
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,160
Thank you so much.

74
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,560
You saved me a lot because I had such a big breakfast this morning.

75
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,180
But, because of that, everything is gone.

76
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,500
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,300
That's okay!

78
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,180
I intentionally made too much breakfast to refresh my mind.
I'm glad that you liked them all.

79
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,840
Well, it was a large amount of food, indeed.

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,040
I was going to use those food ingredients gradually until I received my paycheck from my previous job, but I used them all up.

81
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,560
I don't know what to do now...

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,000
Hey, will you be all right?

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,200
Umm... well...

84
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,140
I still have rice, though~

85
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,520
Then, if I can pay for the food ingredients,

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,320
will you make the food I want to eat?

87
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,560
Eh?

88
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,580
As long as it's within my abilities!

89
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,760
I don't know what's going on, but congratulations~!
Sorry. You can continue...

90
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,880
And then, can you also make food for Tomoya?

91
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,380
Once he's absorbed in writing, he will totally forget to eat.

92
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,520
Ah, okay!

93
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,660
The 3rd part of The Dusk series seems to be selling well.

94
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,640
As expected of Hongyo Tomoya.

95
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,260
It's Tomoya's new book. You haven't read it?

96
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,600
Ah, to be honest, I haven't even read the 1st part...

97
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,500
Unbelievable!

98
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,100
Please read them immediately.

99
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,460
It's my missionary work, you don't have to return them.

100
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,220
If possible, I don't want to see Hongyo for a while...

101
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,880
While saying he won't do anything weird,

102
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,200
he also said it won't be considered "weird" as long as I'm not against it.

103
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,560
What the hell is that?

104
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,080
Welcome home, Terada-san.

105
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm home~

106
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,320
By the way,

107
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
why didn't you wake me up today?

108
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,660
I wanted to see if I could get my "healthy morning" back.

109
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,260
Didn't I ask you to wake me up too?

110
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,080
I got up a bit late.

111
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,080
Yet you still have time to cook a lot of breakfast?

112
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,420
Well, it wasn't successful today...

113
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,920
- So, next time...
- You know what,

114
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,900
I won't sleep with you anymore.

115
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,520
Why?

116
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,520
Well,

117
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,920
no matter how I look at this, it's still weird...

118
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,340
How is it weird?

119
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
What do you mean "how"....?

120
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,160
I get it...

121
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,580
Then...

122
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,400
- How about 2 or 3 more times...
- Seriously, though!

123
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,520
No matter what you say, I won't do this again...

124
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,880
I understand if you find it really uncomfortable...

125
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,920
Can I touch your body directly?

126
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,540
Rather than "uncomfortable",

127
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,360
I find it disgusting...

128
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,680
I expected something to happen last night...

129
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,940
I'm really disgusted with myself.

130
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,820
I'm home!

131
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,080
Terada-san, you're already home!

132
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,600
Welcome back!

133
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,360
Sorry! Am I interrupting you guys?

134
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,980
Not really...

135
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
You're home early today, Hase.

136
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,380
I have something to talk to Terada-san.

137
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,180
Do you have a moment?

138
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,640
Yes.

139
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,940
I want to ask you this,

140
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,860
do you have any dreams or goals in life?

141
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,600
Like a dream job, or a qualification you want to take? Just anything...

142
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,240
Nothing in particular...

143
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,080
Then, what about marriage aspiration?

144
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,460
Like building a happy family and stuff...

145
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,560
Well, of course I would love to, if possible...

146
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,920
Why are you asking this?

147
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,200
I have a favor to ask you.

148
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,940
It's a proposal.

149
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,580
Well,

150
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,080
will you marry me?

151
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,920
Sorry?

152
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,460
I think I heard you wrong...

153
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,860
Will you marry me or date me with marriage in mind?

154
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,360
Huh?

155
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,860
Eh?!

156
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,420
I'm actually not interested in marriage, but, my parents keep bugging me so much, it kinda annoys me.

157
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,160
I don't feel like going on blind dates either...

158
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,520
Ah! You want to have some beer?

159
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,020
Ah, well... eh?

160
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,740
But, why me...?

161
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,180
You're the one who cleans the living room, and the kitchen, right?

162
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,560
As well as the bathroom.

163
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,320
The dust that had piled up was all gone now.

164
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,100
Although it's our duty to do the cleaning,

165
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,600
the other two don't do anything at all.

166
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,400
But, since you came here, this house has become really clean.

167
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,260
It's nothing special. All I do was clean the house normally...

168
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,440
Also, your food this morning was really delicious.

169
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,740
Is that all?

170
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,200
Well, including all those, to sum it all up,

171
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,880
you have the bare-minimum common sense and life skills,

172
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,540
yet you don't have any particular dreams or goals that might become troublesome someday.

173
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,020
Although you're a caring person, you have no confidence in yourself.

174
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,480
And since you're servile and passive, you won't meddle in other people's affairs either.

175
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,480
Somehow, I feel like you're just adequate for my needs, Terada-san.

176
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,720
Adequate for your needs?

177
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,900
I don't want you to misunderstand, but I'm not asking you to be a housekeeper or anything.

178
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,760
Here, Tomo.

179
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,540
Of course, you can also continue helping Tomo.

180
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,180
If you're telling me this so suddenly...

181
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,260
Well, you don't have to give me the answer right away.

182
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,500
Try to look into it with an open mind.

183
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,240
- You're also free to date whoever you want.
- Wait.

184
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,920
It doesn't seem right after all...

185
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,440
Really?

186
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,100
If you think it's not right, you should just say no.

187
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,280
Or, you don't want to reject it, Terada-san?

188
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,020
Huh? Tomo, are you against the idea?

189
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,800
Why?

190
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,300
Why do you ask?

191
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,480
I just think how improper it will be to press my crotch against my friend's fiancee...

192
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,760
It's still improper even if I'm not your friend's fiancee, you know.

193
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,620
Well, yeah...

194
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,540
Well, if I don't have permission, then I'm just being a pervert.

195
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,900
Eh? I don't mind at all...

196
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,200
I do...

197
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Well...

198
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,360
Hase-san, I'm sorry...

199
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:55,240
No matter how much your parents are bugging you, I think you shouldn't make important decisions like marriage so lightly.

200
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,660
This was actually my grandpa's house,

201
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,980
but, it belongs to my parents now.

202
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,480
They told me this,

203
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,500
"If you don't get married within one year, get out of here."

204
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,140
Really?

205
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,880
If I get married, they will give me this house,

206
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,260
otherwise, they will sell it.

207
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,720
Then, you should marry Akari instead.

208
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,740
Tomo, are you trying to kill me?

209
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,460
It's my editor.

210
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,080
Is it about the new book?

211
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,620
Excuse me for a sec.

212
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,560
Hello?

213
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,900
I'm sorry, Terada-san.

214
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,700
You got dragged into my mess.

215
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,700
Ah, that's okay.

216
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,340
But, are you okay with this, Hase-san?

217
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,700
Me?

218
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,900
My feelings don't really matter, that's why I asked you.

219
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,280
Well, I mean, if you meet someone you like in the future,

220
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,680
it will bother you big time.

221
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,720
It will never happen.

222
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,980
I've never really fallen for someone anyway...

223
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,640
I've dated around a few girls before, though.

224
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,300
Anyway...

225
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,440
When you were in junior high, something definitely happened between you and Tomo, right?

226
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,540
Because Tomo is obviously attached to you, Terada-san.

227
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,360
That's so not like him.

228
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,680
Well, about that,

229
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,160
that's only because he wants to keep pressing his crotch against...

230
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,000
...my body...

231
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,120
Hearing these things come out of my mouth, I feel a bit surprised...myself.

232
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,480
Well, it doesn't really matter.

233
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,700
I'm not curious about what happened in the past anyway.

234
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,180
I'm heading back to the office now.

235
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,480
Please seriously think about it, Terada-san.

236
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,440
Yes...

237
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
"What happened?"

238
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,060
Well...

239
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,840
"Something" indeed happened...

240
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,340
Hongyo!

241
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,860
Let's go home together.

242
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,800
Hongyo was quiet and expressionless.

243
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,700
I couldn't figure out what he was thinking...

244
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,600
To be honest, going out with him was no fun at all.

245
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,060
And the thing I hate the most was...

246
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,040
...the fact that his attitude didn't change at all after dating me.

247
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,640
Somehow, I wanted to crush out his deadpan expression...

248
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,340
Hey, Hongyo...

249
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Have you ever kissed someone before?

250
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,500
No...

251
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,200
I haven't...

252
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,200
Then, do you want to kiss me?

253
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,860
You can kiss me if you want.

254
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,900
I did not resist...

255
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,760
I was just..

256
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
I was just so surprised...

257
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,620
I didn't really understand what was happening back then.

258
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,900
Isn't it time for you to go home?

259
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,100
For the first time in my life, I knew how it felt to be looked down upon...

260
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,300
It seemed like the world had turned upside down...

261
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,560
But even so, I desperately pretended to be calm at that time...

262
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,020
The next day after that,

263
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,560
I started to ignore Hongyo completely...

264
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,040
Huh? By the way, Aki, aren't you going out with Hongyo?

265
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,060
Well, he was so boring...

266
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,060
I'd had enough.

267
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,480
I couldn't tell them the truth...

268
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,260
I felt so lame....

269
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,120
I was embarrassed...

270
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,540
It was just...

271
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,400
Hongyo's intense gaze on me was so scary...

272
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,660
So, I kept ignoring him after that...

273
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,240
Then, we graduated just like that...

274
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,800
When I think about it now,

275
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,500
I wonder if that was actually my first setback in life...

276
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,500
I realized...

277
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,380
...that I wasn't that great after all.

278
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,940
Where is Hase?

279
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,480
He went back to the office...

280
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,480
I see.

281
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,480
What happened?

282
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,360
They want me to work on my 4th book as soon as possible,
since the demand is getting higher.

283
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:57,880
Isn't that good? People are looking forward to your new work.
The 3rd one is also selling really well, right?

284
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,140
That book was just a collection of short stories that I frequently sent to a magazine.

285
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,160
Then, the 2nd one was just spin-off stories that I had compiled before...

286
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,100
It's not like I wrote them from scratch...

287
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,440
Is that so...?

288
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,080
In other words, I haven't been able to wrote a proper story for the last 2 years.

289
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,780
For 2 years?

290
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,080
For 2 years...

291
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,640
I feel like I've heard about this somewhere before...

292
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,060
Yeah...

293
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,260
In other words,

294
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,980
for the last 2 years, I haven't been able to get hard, or write a single novel.

295
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,700
I don't know which one came first,

296
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,960
but they might be related.

297
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,960
I see...

298
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,940
So, Terada-san,

299
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,480
- it's not about sleeping together,
- I'm sorry!

300
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,900
I just remembered I have some works to do!

301
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,380
I'm sorry!

302
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,760
He told me such things...

303
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,480
These are pretty thick...

304
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:42,040
This is the story of the protagonist "I" and the immortal "She".

305
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,440
I finished them all!

306
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,960
They were so interesting...

307
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,340
Eh?

308
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,640
It's morning already?!

309
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,660
Let's go grab some snacks. Then sleep for a bit.

310
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,140
Hongyo?!

311
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,900
You startled me. What are you doing?

312
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,620
I couldn't sleep...

313
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,520
Now that I have to put a more serious effort into my 4th book...

314
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,860
It's really impossible.

315
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,860
But, I kinda want to read your next book, Hongyo.

316
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,200
Eh?

317
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,480
Did you read them all?

318
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,200
Well, your books are pretty easy to read...

319
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,200
Really?

320
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,120
Hongyo...

321
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,620
If you can't sleep, it will make you feel better when you're lying down...

322
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,620
If you go to your room...

323
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,600
I knew it...

324
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,880
I will only feel calm when I'm with you...

325
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,440
What should I do?

326
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,160
Right now...

327
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,160
I...

328
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,800
..don't hate this.

329
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,200
Hongyo...

330
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,920
...relies on me so much.

331
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,940
Anyway, Hongyo...

332
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,940
Will you be...

333
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,660
...in trouble if you can't write again?

334
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,460
Rather than be in trouble,

335
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,640
I'll be done for.

336
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,640
In many ways...

337
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,620
If you can get that healthy morning back,

338
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,140
will you be able to write again?

339
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,480
I don't know, but,

340
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,740
I think there's still a possibility.

341
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,940
Three more times...

342
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,720
Eh?

343
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,480
I'll help you out,

344
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,440
if it's only three more times...

345
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,020
You mean it?

346
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,620
- Thank you, Terada-san!
- Hey...

347
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,540
Hongyo, let go of me...

348
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,020
Can I move my hand a little bit?

349
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,580
If you don't like it, just tell me.

350
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,580
I will stop right away.

351
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,260
It's amazing.

352
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,300
Your heart is beating so fast.

353
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,680
Well...

354
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,680
You're so soft...

355
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,300
It feels good.

356
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,880
I feel something wet...

357
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,380
...behind my neck.

358
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,660
I'm sorry.

359
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,320
Did it penetrate to your butt?

360
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,320
What do you mean?

361
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,640
I just came.

362
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,880
Eeeehhhhhh~?
