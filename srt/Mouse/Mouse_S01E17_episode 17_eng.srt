1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:10,180


2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,150
   

3
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,650
   

4
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,140
 We are closed! 

5
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,270
 You were a boxer. 

6
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,200
 No wonder. 

7
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,200
 Well... Who are you? 

8
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,540
 Why did you kill them? My family? 

9
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,880
 You must remember now? 

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,490
 That's a little unfair. 

11
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,480
 I didn't forget about you for a moment. 

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,180
 Since that day, I've been looking for you. 

13
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,700
 I even became a police officer because I thought it would help me find you. 

14
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,870
 Your face. Your fist. I don't know anything other than that. 

15
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,230
 I had a pretty hard time finding you. 

16
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,330
 Come here so I can see your skills. 

17
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,540
 An eye for an eye. 

18
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,510
 A tooth for a tooth. 

19
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,670
 I already did the part for you beating my mother. 

20
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,320
 This is for my dongsaeng that died in the fire. 

21
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,340
 This is for my father. 

22
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,630
   

23
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,240
   

24
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,410
 What are you going to do? 

25
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,760
 I asked what you are going to do! 

26
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,890
 I can't live with him anymore. 

27
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,740
 Ah, the child! 

28
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,250
He buried his younger brother!

29
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,120
I knew since that bastard killed Choco and the goldfish.

30
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,720
That punk is going to kill someone in the end.

31
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,880
Stop it. The child can hear.

32
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,720
Geez.

33
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,420
Look, look. Look at those eyes.

34
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,450
- This guy, I should justâ€“ 
 - Honey!

35
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,590
Ah, seriously.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,850
Jae Hoon, you should come out.

37
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,780
You need to wash up.

38
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,440
You're hungry, right?

39
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,170
What about Jae Min and Jae Hee?

40
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,020
Dad took them to the playground.

41
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,520
Don't misunderstand.

42
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,710
I wasn't going to kill Jae Min.

43
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,080
He kept telling on me, so

44
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,420
I was going to scold him.

45
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,950
I was just going to scold him.

46
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,480
It's true, Mom.

47
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,320
Sure.

48
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,910
Just hurry and eat.

49
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,920
Mom, why are you crying?

50
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,230
You monster!

51
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,710
Die. Die!

52
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,090
Die...

53
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,460
Move. Die!

54
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,300
Ah!

55
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,490
Mom.

56
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,420
Mom.

57
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,640
Mom.

58
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,220
Jae Hoon.

59
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,250
I'm sorry

60
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,030
that I didn't believe you.

61
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,000
Mom.

62
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,200
I... couldn't help it.

63
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,180
You...

64
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,240
You were born with

65
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,470
a special gene.

66
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,690
Why?

67
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,680
Why only me?

68
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,360
No. There is someone else.

69
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,990
A child like you.

70
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,780
There is one more child.

71
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:40,230
My pitiful baby.

72
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,410
Mom, get ahold of yourself. Mom.

73
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:05,710
My son... You're a good son, right?

74
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,830
You need to

75
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,110
be kind and

76
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,460
live well.

77
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,800
My baby.

78
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,700
Ah, what can we do?

79
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,280
Oh my goodness.

80
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,160
How could this happen?

81
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,080
How could he come home to something like this?

82
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,280
I know, right?

83
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,780
- What to do... 
 - I know.

84
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,050
   

85
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,210
 His entire family is dead and he didn't cry. 

86
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,990
 Even so, if you do that to a child... 

87
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,550
 Did you see anything that day? 

88
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,810
 No, I didn't see anything. 

89
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,990
 You dare touch my family? 

90
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,400
 I'll chase you to the end of the world and do to you 

91
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,350
 exactly what you did to my family. 

92
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,080
It's a revenge murder.

93
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,210
I did it for revenge.

94
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,640
I'll borrow these pictures.

95
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,290
Why? Is there something wrong?

96
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,330
I need to look into something.

97
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,320
I'll tell you later.

98
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,530
Was Song Soo Ho still practicing boxing?

99
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,780
No.

100
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:44,330
He quit shortly after what happened to his sister.

101
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,250
He used to work at a company.

102
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,870
Company? Which company?

103
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,960
Some security company.

104
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,350
He was having such a hard time back then...

105
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,960
Was it the national support counseling center?

106
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,720
I guess he got introduced to someone while receiving treatment there.

107
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,700
He was there for about 10 years?

108
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,680
He was diligent in going to work

109
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,350
but one night

110
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,180
he was crying all night.

111
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,440
 Soo Ho, what's wrong? 

112
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,290
He was like that after what happened to his sister.

113
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,040
I had never seen him cry like that.

114
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,020
The next day, I was cleaning his room.

115
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,390
I saw a receipt for the Guryeong tollgate in his clothes.

116
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:42,770
Then he quit and started helping his friend out at a boxing gym.

117
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,680
Guryeong...

118
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,380
He didn't say what's going on?

119
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,410
I asked him a little bit, but he would never tell me.

120
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:57,030
Oh. A few days later, a detective came by.

121
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:02,140
He asked Soo Ho this and that and just left.

122
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,080
A detective.

123
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,450
This is Guryeong Lake, right?

124
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,420
 I didn't get an answer in the end 

125
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,010
as to why he killed my family.

126
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,880
Robber? No, if he were a robber, I would have also been killed.

127
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,090
Why did he intentionally take me out of the house before setting it on fire?

128
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,700
Why only me?

129
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,300
This person...

130
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,200
This person looks familiar.

131
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,920
 You should have let me die! 

132
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,180
 Why? Why? 

133
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,210
No wonder he looks familiar.

134
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,360
You shouldn't have saved me that day.

135
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,330
Then he wouldn't have been born.

136
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,900
But...

137
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,280
- Why did he save only me? 
  - Why did he save only me? 

138
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,400
Seong Yo Han went to elementary school in Guryeong.

139
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,690
Then this child is Seong Yo Han...

140
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:00,030
That's right. Then the relationship between Seong Yo Han and Song Soo Ho will be resolved.

141
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,080
Who are you?

142
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,220
I'm a police officer. I'm investigating something.

143
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,220
What business would the police have at this house?

144
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,750
It's you, right? The Nation's Son, Officer Jung!

145
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,450
Aigo!

146
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,890
I saw you on the news!

147
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:35,320
You went through a lot because of that rotten bastard, right?

148
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:41,510
Ah. You came because of Seong Yo Han.

149
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,730
Seong Yo Han?

150
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,070
In the beginning, I thought that guy was Jae Hoon.

151
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,670
That night, when I saw the news, I almost fainted!

152
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,660
- No, what are you... 
 - That guy, Seong Yo Han.

153
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,730
That night. He looked at this house for a while.

154
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,050
You're saying Seong Yo Han came here?

155
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,230
When you say that night...

156
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,090
That's right. The night he was shot by a gun.

157
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:11,010
During the day, he looked at the house like this.

158
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,620
So I took a quick glance and he seemed about Jae Hoon's age.

159
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:21,160
So I asked, "You're Jae Hoon, right?"

160
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,050
He said that he wasn't, that I had the wrong person and then hurried off.

161
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,420
- Is that right? 
 - Yes!

162
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,600
Ah, that's right. Before leaving

163
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,750
he asked about this family's twin daughter.

164
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,380
 Jae Hee? 

165
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,470
The youngest daughter disappeared.

166
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,160
Since there were only three bodies found.

167
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,830
Everyone whispered that the oldest son killed his family.

168
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,710
They even said that punk killed his younger sister and hid her.

169
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,760
Jae Hoon, that child, was very weird.

170
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,440
I wonder what he is doing and how he's living.

171
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,070
If he's living like a person.

172
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,640
Just like our nation's son, Officer Jung!

173
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,920
I hope he grew up nice like you.

174
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,010
Thank you.

175
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,910
 Why did he come here? 

176
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,450
 How did he know Jae Hee? 

177
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,560
She went missing in 2005.

178
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,150
She should be 23 years old right now. Her name was Jung Jae Hee at the time of disappearance.

179
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,390
Ah, she was someone who had Savant Syndrome. She would remember everything she heard.

180
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,330
There was no missing child with such characteristics reported in 2005.

181
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,230
I'll check with the disability protection agency.

182
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,150
Oh, thank you.

183
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,340
Please help me find my younger sister.

184
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,100
This is Jae Hoon of class 3,

185
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,430
not Yo Han.

186
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,610
- Jae Hoon? 
 - Yes.

187
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,160
His name is Jung Jae Hoon. Did you not hear about the Guryeong family murder case?

188
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,160
That house's eldest son.

189
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,500
Guryeong family murder case.

190
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,760
 I saw a receipt for the Guryeong tollgate in his clothes. 

191
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,660
 He was crying all night. 

192
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,400
 A few days later, a detective came by. 

193
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,390
Then, what happened to this boy?

194
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,270
I think I heard that his relative came to get him.

195
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,020
Go and ask the police station. It'll be faster.

196
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,790
Thank you.

197
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,720
That house is still in the parents' name.

198
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,020
Ah, that's why the house hasn't been sold yet and is still in such a ghastly state.

199
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,980
What about the missing twin?

200
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,860
- The daughter? 
 - Yes.

201
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,680
We couldn't find her.

202
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,580
Hello!

203
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,960
- Hey, Jung Ba Reum! 
 - Detective.

204
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,910
You punk, I've been calling you all day and you haven't picked up!

205
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,170
Oh, I was looking into something.

206
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,780
What brings you here?

207
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,330
I'm Detective Go Mu Chi from the Mujin station.

208
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,160
By any chance, is the detective in charge of the Guryeong family murder case still here?

209
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,170
I was the detective in charge.

210
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,130
Oh, that's great.

211
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,450
Do you remember this kid?

212
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,480
Oh yes, he is the eldest son of that family.

213
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,570
 It's from the day I killed Choco. 

214
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,510
Was he a suspect too?

215
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,510
He was on the suspect list for a while, so I remember going to Mujin to find him.

216
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,890
So what happened then?

217
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,570
Just a minute. I'll have to look at the files.

218
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,030
 There's no file. As soon as I'd become a police officer, I'd looked into all the suspects of that case. 

219
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,490
 I couldn't find any files on him. 

220
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,970
Huh? The file isn't there.

221
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,920
That's strange. Why is his file missing?

222
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,230
I'm sure I'd written the report.

223
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,960
 It's missing? 

224
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,050
That's so weird. Who made such a mistake?

225
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,370
But the investigation records of the eldest son are still all there.

226
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,480
The eldest son, you mean him?

227
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,460
Was he also a suspect? But he's a part of that family, isn't he?

228
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,230
About that, despite the horrible thing that had happened to his family

229
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,720
the kid didn't show the slightest sign of sadness or any expression at all.

230
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,480
He was so suspicious that we did

231
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,470
a lie detector test on the kid. Unofficially.

232
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,440
- And so? 
 - Nothing really stood out about him.

233
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,060
It's not like an 11-year-old could kill his family.

234
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,290
We just tried it out because we were at a dead-end.

235
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,940
Do you know where this kid is right now?

236
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,440
His aunt took him.

237
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,100
His aunt? Could you give me her contact information?

238
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,840
Yeah, it's right here.

239
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,070
   

240
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,020
 The number you have dialed does not exist. 

241
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,490
This phone number isn't in service.

242
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,480
- Can you do an identity check on the aunt? 
 - Just a minute.

243
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,030
    
    

244
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,030
Why isn't it coming up?

245
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,070
That's strange. We had checked their identification back then.

246
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,690
- Then run an identity check on the kid. 
 - Yeah, just a minute.

247
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,550
 They'll realize that I'm Jung Jae Hoon right away. 

248
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,430
 What should I do? 

249
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,100
His resident registration number was cancelled.

250
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,570
- Cancelled? 
  - Cancelled? 

251
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,750
That only happens when the person is dead or overseas.

252
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,090
 It's different from the one I have. I was told that I was adopted under my aunt's family name. 

253
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,370
 But instead of adoption they had my resident registration number cancelled? 

254
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,220
 Then, what's the resident registration number I have now? 

255
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,270
Why did you come here?

256
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,430
Oh, I ended up here as I was investigating the guy who killed Chi Kook.

257
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,610
I went through the case files to see if Seong Yo Han might have had an accomplice.

258
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,900
There are records of him living in Guryeong a long time ago.

259
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,770
Well, so I came here just in case.

260
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,970
By the way, where did you get that kid's picture from?

261
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,080
From Song Soo Ho's album.

262
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,470
Song Soo Ho had an OZ tattoo on his leg, too.

263
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,390
I went to Song Soo Ho's house to look into that.

264
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,540
I think Song Soo Ho is connected to this child's family murder case.

265
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,140
 - Song Soo Ho is on their side too?  
 - Here's what Song Soo Ho's mom said,

266
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,950
Song Soo Ho would cry all night after coming back from Guryeong.

267
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,440
It was around that time that the kid's family died.

268
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,780
In any case, this organization that Song Soo Ho is a part of, OZ

269
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,680
is allied with the psychopath that killed Kang Duk Su, Lee Jae Sik, and Kim Byeong Tae.

270
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,880
He's hiding in the shadows for now, but he'll come out soon.

271
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,740
A psychopath like that can't go long without killing someone.

272
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,200
We should head back before it's late.

273
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:42,450
 You were born with a special gene. 

274
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,440
 There is another 

275
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,090
 child like you. 

276
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,470
How could mom have known about that?

277
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,070
A special gene.

278
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,830
 You knew about everything from the beginning? 

279
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,320
 Even the fact that I was a predator? 

280
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,020
 Would I have worked with you if I'd known it was you? 

281
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,580
 - I was sure it was Seong Yo Han. 
 - How were you so sure about it? 

282
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,790
 Because I had tested Han Seo Joon's wife's child for the psychopath gene. 

283
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,590
How long has he been following me?

284
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,050
Alright.

285
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,610
If Song Soo Ho had killed this kid's family, this child could have wanted revenge from him.

286
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,360
But this kid isn't Seong Yo Han.

287
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,390
But the one who killed Song Soo Ho out of revenge is Seong Yo Han.

288
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,090
What the hell is going on?

289
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,290
Okay, so the one who tried to kill Na Chi Kook is Seong Yo Han.

290
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,160
But after waking up, Na Chi Kook was being threatened by someone.

291
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,700
And the one who killed Na Chi Kook is OZ.

292
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,810
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

293
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,250
Right!

294
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,090
- Isn't this an evidence box from the Seong Yo Han case?
- It is.

295
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,940
Why are you going through it all of a sudden?

296
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,070
I can't just sit and watch Sunbae Go being anxious about whether or not Seong Yo Han is the real killer.

297
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,680
So I'm going to comb through each and every piece of evidence,

298
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,060
and give him the surety that Seong Yo Han is indeed the real killer.

299
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,730
Hey.

300
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,560
- Yes? 
 - How's it going with finding the fingerprint on the statement?

301
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,580
- They did look into it and a third-party fingerprint was found. 
 - What?

302
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,890
But it's not clear, so it's impossible to identify.

303
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,590
Where is Detective Lee right now?

304
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,690
Am I doing the right thing, Jennifer?

305
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,220
Oh, what's the matter? You didn't tell me you were coming.

306
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,120
You deceived me.

307
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,630
- Goddamnit, I'm so pissed off. 
 - Why?

308
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,820
The cyber unit keeps suspecting us of damaging the security footage that we restored.

309
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,290
What do you mean it was damaged?

310
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:35,010
Oh, Sunbae Go had taken the footage to see if it was edited.

311
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,570
What are you saying all of a sudden?

312
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:41,670
The fact that I have a special gene and that there is another child like me.

313
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,690
How did my mother know about that?

314
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,070
Is that you? You're Min Gyu's son?

315
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,110
Park Min Gyu and Kim Hee Jung's son?

316
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,200
That's right. My mother is Kim Hee Jung and my father is Park Min Gyu.

317
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,790
I thought your mother would have

318
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,270
had an abortion for sure.

319
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,080
Abortion?

320
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,980
Are you looking for this?

321
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,400
 - Where is Detective Lee right now? 
 - Probably out for a smoke. 

322
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,060
 - Hey, Parachute. 
 - Yeah? 

323
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,120
 When Detective Lee is back, indirectly let him know 

324
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,730
 - that I found out about the edited footage from the lobby's CCTV. 
 - What? 

325
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,160
 I need to know how he reacts to that. 

326
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,420
Are you looking for this? Why? Worried whether I restored the footage in which your face was shown?

327
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,270
What are you talking about?

328
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:50,600
Then, why are you going through my desk? Follow me.

329
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,110
Ah, damnit! What the hell are you doing?

330
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,790
Hey, show me your hand.

331
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,150
Darn it.

332
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,930
Here it is.

333
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,810
You were in a hurry, weren't you? Looks like you got nervous.

334
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,140
What are you guys? A group of psychopaths?

335
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,020
- What the hell are you guys? 
 - What are you talking about?

336
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,460
I got my girlfriend's initials tattooed, but we broke up a few days ago so I got it removed.

337
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,000
Alright. Then what about the edited footage?

338
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,550
You showed Kang Duk Su's mother's statement to OZ, didn't you?

339
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,530
What are you accusing me of doing?

340
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,580
That CCTV footage is restored, I'll show it to you, you bastard! Come here!

341
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,680
Is that what you were talking about?

342
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,210
I dropped that statement in the lobby and someone picked it up for me.

343
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,220
And I never cut the video or anything like that.

344
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:49,670
Okay. A police officer's salary isn't enough, huh?

345
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:56,240
It hurts, doesn't it. But that bastard gives you lots of money huh?

346
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,490
Ah, seriously. What are you saying?

347
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,250
You bat-like bastard.

348
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:14,380
Money? I'm doing this as a duty.

349
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:37,010
Hey! Where did you get this from? It looks nice.

350
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,490
- Move. 
 - Ah, let me see. Where is this from?

351
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,190
Oh! Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

352
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,810
Hey, hey. Take this off.

353
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,580
- I'm sorry. 
 - Are you okay? Detective Shin, you should've been careful!

354
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,850
Ah, did you get burned? Aigo Detective Lee, it turned red.

355
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,010
- Ah, I said I'm okay. 
 - Okay.

356
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,230
Oh, it looks like it's waterproof.

357
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,360
It'll smell like coffee so what should we do?

358
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,620
- Do you want to sell it to me for cheap? 
 - No thanks.

359
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,740
Ah, I'm sorry.

360
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,050
Did you see?

361
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,950
 Sunbae! 

362
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,050
It's a burner phone. The cellphone base station appears as the Ministry of Science and Technology.

363
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:17,570
- Ministry of Science and Technology? 
 - Yeah. Should we start investigating Detective Lee?

364
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:21,200
About what? That he removed his tattoo or that he used a burner phone?

365
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,710
He erased the video from the CCTV.

366
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,840
There's no evidence that Detective Lee erased the video.

367
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,560
And that video alone can't prove that Detective Lee is with those OZ guys.

368
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,070
If we mess with him without solid evidence, it can come back to us.

369
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,720
Then why did you mess with Detective Lee? You will be the one in danger.

370
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,080
But now I'm sure. Let's watch him for now.

371
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,530
- Keep on watching who Detective Lee meets and talks to. 
 - Okay.

372
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,930
You're still looking for that 6264 unregistered vehicle, right?

373
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:50,920
Ah, I'm still looking for it but it's a little hard to find the unregistered vehicle before the car accident.

374
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,220
But where did Officer Jung go that we don't even see him?

375
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,960
For the time being, let's work together between the three of us.

376
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,970
- Why? 
 - I feel something isn't right, that's why.

377
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,740
 Your father was a researcher on my research team. 

378
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,530
 I convinced your mother to help with the research 

379
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,950
 and did a genetic test on her baby, 

380
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:19,150
 but a psychopath gene came out. 

381
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,620
 I had no choice but to tell her the truth. 

382
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,580
 I told her to get an abortion and she said she was going to. That's why I 

383
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,820
 didn't know that she had the baby. 

384
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,920
 You said a psychopath only cares about himself. 

385
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,360
 The fact that I got revenge on Song Soo Ho 

386
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,550
 means that I had affection for my family. 

387
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,790
 It's not affection for your family. "How dare you touch mine?" 

388
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:52,170
 "You invade my territory?" It's punishment for that. 

389
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,450
   

390
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:07,380
 I killed an innocent person because of you! 

391
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,060
 When I checked with the criminal database, it came up right away. 

392
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,590
 - I'm your aunt. 
 - My mom didn't have a younger sister. 

393
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,820
 His resident registration number was cancelled 

394
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:26,440
   

395
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,870
 That day, the witness who saw my murder ran away. 

396
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,420
 I've decided to find that person and take care of it. 

397
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,180
 - Hey, Officer Jung!  
  - Detective. 

398
00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:00,290
 I happened to run into Detective Go and failed to find that witness. 

399
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:04,880
 The moment I saw Detective Go's jacket, I remembered that jacket. 

400
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,390
   

401
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,170
   

402
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,650
That's right. I brought Kim Joon Sung's laptop.

403
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:38,230
I took these pictures when they were alive and these are pictures when they were dead.

404
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,040
It's the same as the pictures in Seong Yo Han's house.

405
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,840
Then he watched my murder and took a picture of the body afterward?

406
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,370
Without even reporting it to the police?

407
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,840
It looks like I'm right.

408
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,230
   

409
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,060
   

410
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,470
No. Seong Yo Han tried to kill me.

411
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:21,810
Why did he try to kill me if he was OZ? Unlike other OZ?

412
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,630
Song Soo Ho killed my mom to save me.

413
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,790
But why would Seong Yo Han try to kill me?

414
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:31,470
 Save that child first. Han Kook, who is under your feet.  

415
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,510
He was definitely trying to save Han Kook.

416
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:40,200
If it were OZ, he would've taken care of Han Kook's body and covered up the murder.

417
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,960
 We... 

418
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:01,420
What was he trying to say? What was he going to say?

419
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,370
 We... 

420
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,890
I need to confirm it.

421
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,290
Just who did you talk to that's in this building?

422
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:38,620
Does it have anything to do with Seong Yo Han's friend, Kim Joon Sung, who's an employee of the Ministry of Science and Technology?

423
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,930
Then is Kim Joon Sung part of the OZ organization?

424
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,310
It wasn't there.

425
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,280
Are you sure?

426
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,880
Officer Jung. My job is to thoroughly look at corpses.

427
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,510
Do you think I wouldn't remember that? It wasn't there.

428
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,460
Did Seong Yo Han have an autopsy?

429
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,820
No, his mother didn't want one.

430
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,780
Is it not Kim Joon Sung?

431
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,330
Then Seong Yo Han...

432
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,060
- Officer Jung? 
 - Yeah.

433
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,000
He asked me the same thing.

434
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,840
He asked if Kim Joon Sung's body has a tattoo on it.

435
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,640
What is this punk trying to look for?

436
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,380
I don't have time to look for that.

437
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,470
He had a gunshot wound on the abdomen, but I had no time to look elsewhere.

438
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:43,540
By any chance, is there a close doctor who might have seen Yo Han's body?

439
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,770
There is no one like that.

440
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:48,540
He had a cold personality and wouldn't open up to anyone.

441
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,930
Where can I go to find out?

442
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,190
There are no video records from the surgery.

443
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,310
There aren't any?

444
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,810
I mean, it's the first ever brain transplant in the world.

445
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,930
There's no way you wouldn't take video to keep as a record.

446
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,860
Han Seo Joon demanded absolute secrecy.

447
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:14,740
Never mind video recording, no-one else was allowed in the operating room other than him.

448
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,270
It means he doesn't want to let anyone else know.

449
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,860
I don't get why, since he's a death row convict.

450
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,050
That kind of medical skill should be shared.

451
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,620
It's very unfortunate.

452
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:29,560
Also, even if the surgery was recorded,

453
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,130
it's brain surgery.

454
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:34,030
The other parts of the body don't get filmed.

455
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,650
I understand.

456
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,850
Wait a minute.

457
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,500
Have your headaches gotten any better?

458
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,510
I'll prescribe some medication for you.  Go get it from the pharmacy.

459
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,360
He really is a crazy bastard.

460
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,930
He really accomplished it.

461
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,110
What a waste. If only he hadn't killed people,

462
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,520
he'd be a worldwideâ€“

463
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,860
No. Was he only successful in the brain transplant because he had killed people?

464
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,070
How ironic.

465
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,690
 Don't try so hard to die.  You don't have much time left anyway. 

466
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,040
 You're going to die also. 

467
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,040
Oppa.

468
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,350
I'm tired.

469
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,690
Why are you doing this to me?

470
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,720
You really are clueless.  Why do you think I'm doing this?

471
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,320
I don't like you anymore.  You're burdensome.

472
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,530
Go home quickly.

473
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:54,320
It's because of Kang Duk Su.

474
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,580
I know everything.

475
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,380
That you killed Kang Duk Su, and that's why you're avoiding me.

476
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,270
You...

477
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,300
Oppa, it doesn't matter to me.

478
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,080
Kang Duk Su deserved to die anyway.

479
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,830
If you hadn't killed him, Yoo Na would have died.

480
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,190
- So... 
 - Yes, you're right.

481
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,640
I killed Kang Duk Su.

482
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:34,160
Because of you... because you could be in danger, I killed him.

483
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,030
Look what happened because of you.  I should have just left it alone!

484
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,970
How did I become a murderer?

485
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,860
- Oppa. 
 - When I see you, I keep thinking about that time.

486
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,840
It's horrible.  It's so horrible that I can't stand it.

487
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,760
So please, get out of my sight.

488
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,570
Oppa.

489
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:58,290
You... If you appear in front of me one more time,

490
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,750
I'm going to confess to killing Kang Duk Su and go to jail.

491
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,710
If you don't want to see me rot in jail for the rest of my life,

492
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:09,270
don't appear in front of me again. Do you understand me?

493
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,190
I remember everything.

494
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:34,510
 Save... Save... 

495
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,680
 Please save me. 

496
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,460
 Back then. 

497
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,750
 Bong Yi. 

498
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:53,510
 Save... Please save me. 

499
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,650
 Back then, I... 

500
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:59,200
 Please save me. 

501
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,050
 What should I do, Bong Yi? 

502
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:11,840
 What should I do? 

503
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,200
If this child is the culprit, and not Seong Yo Han,

504
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:21,870
then he threatened and killed Na Chi Kook, who knew about this.

505
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,090
Then why was Seong Yo Han trying to kill Officer Jung?

506
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:29,060
Then what about the victims' photos that were at Seong Yo Han's house?  There's no explanation for it.

507
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,850
   

508
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,280
   

509
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,090
   

510
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,060
   

511
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,770
   

512
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,060
   

513
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,180
Wait a minute.

514
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,660
Did PD Choi find out something?

515
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:59,300
Why does PD Choi suddenly want to do a show about the Mujin serial killer case when the culprit has been made known.

516
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,400
What did you say?

517
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,060
Why are you doing another show on the Mujin serial killings?

518
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,170
You found out something, didn't you?

519
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,920
What do you mean?

520
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,630
It's just that the culprit who killed Kang Duk Su, Lee Jae Sik, and Kim Hyung Tae

521
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,990
left a similar crime signature to the Song Soo Ho murder case.

522
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,310
I wanted to look at the case from the beginning.

523
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,850
 She has something.  There is something. 

524
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,590
I got it.

525
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:36,710
 Oppa, I made this.  Make sure you hang it in your car, okay? 

526
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:41,790
 I wanted to make sure there wasn't another regrettable victim like you. 

527
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,860
 In the end, Oppa... 

528
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,750
   

529
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:13,410
Hello.  Hello?

530
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,320
What is this?  What punk is calling in the middle of the night?

531
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,680
 Hello. 

532
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,590
Get yourself together.  If you lose this, we'll be in big trouble.

533
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:02,760
Ah, you were there.  I was really busy.

534
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,890
Excuse me?  Hello.

535
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:07,340
 Ah, I have something to do today. 

536
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,750
 I'll go see you tomorrow. 

537
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:19,960
Jung Ba Reum has been using a burner phone.

538
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,550
 Find out the place where we got the signal. 

539
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:24,050
 Find out who he's contacting. 

540
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,430
I'm leaving now.

541
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,830
He's headed toward Mujin.

542
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,450
I have located his hideout.

543
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:56,400
Welcome to the mouse trap, you rat bastards.

544
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,460
Shi*!

545
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,180
 Hello? 

546
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,220
 - Detective, I can't hear you well. 
 - Where are you? 

547
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,800
 Hello? 

548
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,030
 Why can't I hear him? 

549
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,030
 My phone has been duplicated. 

550
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,990
 I recommended an abortion, and she said that she did it.  So, I... 

551
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,050
 I really didn't know that she gave birth to the child. 

552
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:28,270
 He already knew that my mom gave birth to me. 

553
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,810
 You examined my DNA, 

554
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:36,870
 OZ knew that I had the psychopath gene, and has been following me since I was  a kid. 

555
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:39,360
 You were on the same side as those guys. 

556
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:42,620
 Then, the reason you're hiding as if you were dead right nowâ€“ 

557
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,760
 I need to find out what that reason is. 

558
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,380
 If OZ is looking for you, 

559
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,420
 I'll gladly use you as bait. 

560
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,810
 The best way to catch rats: placing tempting bait in a trap. 

561
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:59,790
 Ah, it was there.  I was really busy. 

562
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,990
 I have something to do today. 

563
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,080
   

564
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,800
Tell me.  Who are you?

565
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,480
You know me, right?

566
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,140
You must know very well what kind of monster I am.

567
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,640
If you don't tell me, I'll cut this bastard's neck and open up his head.

568
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,710
And then I'll viciously chew his brain.

569
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,630
Okay, one...

570
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:24,750
Two...

571
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:29,190
- Three. 
 - Hey.

572
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:35,280
Whether Oh Bong Yi will be dragged off and discovered as a corpse... or if she will be safely let out at her destination...

573
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,550
you decide.

574
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,640
Darn it.

575
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,720
It will be fine, right?

576
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,640
Where did it go?

577
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,130
I put it in there.

578
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,410
What happened?

579
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,610
I lost them.

580
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,380
- Why? 
 - Huh?

581
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,950
I think I left a photo there.

582
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:43,360
A photo?  What photo?

583
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,820
My younger sister Jennifer.  If that is foundâ€“

584
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,140
I'll go find it.

585
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,850
I'll go get it.  Stay here for now.

586
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:58,260
 I'm sure that he's being chased by those guys. 

587
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,560
 Those guys even know all about the doctor's family. 

588
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,400
   

589
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,480
   

590
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,810
Dr. Daniel?

591
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,800
 This is the first message. 

592
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,780
 Yo Han, it's  me, Joon Sung. 

593
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,620
 It's Seong Yo Han's phone? 

594
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,270
 Daniel and Seong Yo Han talked on the phone frequently? 

595
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,420
 About the thing that you asked me to look into. 

596
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,120
 I'm really scared.  I think I made a mistake. 

597
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,830
 It's an organization called OZ.  Anyway, let's talk in person. 

598
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,530
What is this?

599
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:14,320
That means neither  Seong Yo Han nor Kim Joon Sung are OZ.

600
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,240
Then why is this here?

601
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,610
Then back then...

602
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:40,040
 Sit here for a moment. 

603
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:07,990
 That day, I found out that my diary went missing. 

604
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,520
   

605
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,770
   

606
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:46,120
 17 of October, a sunny day 

607
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,760
 I was curious as to whether it had gained weight or was pregnant. 

608
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,990
 I didn't get first class in the whole school. 

609
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:59,200
 This is awarded to the above student for 

610
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,190
 his outstanding achievement in the math competition. 

611
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,830
 Wow! 

612
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,690
 That good, annoying transfer student. 

613
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:15,620
 It's strange, that child... 

614
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,760
 Everyone avoids me, 

615
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,460
 but that child is different.  That's why he's more annoying. 

616
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:28,330
 And, I want to become that child. 

617
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,200
 I want to become like that child. 

618
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,980
 That annoying transfer student.  What's the point of being first place of the whole school? 

619
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:48,510
 He's a dummy who doesn't even know that someone is following him. 

620
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:54,280
That's right.  Someone was following that child around.

621
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,660
Following.  Surveillance.

622
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,620
Could it be?

623
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:10,750
Over a year has passed since the Mujin case.  How have you been?

624
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,160
I have been doing well.

625
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:22,930
Actually, I attempted suicide several times.

626
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:25,300
I couldn't even breathe.

627
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,790
What sin did I commit in a former life

628
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:32,620
that my two kids...

629
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,760
I'm alright now.

630
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,500
I'm now... doing well.

631
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,960
It's because of that person.

632
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,430
That person?

633
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:49,070
The grateful person that gave me the will to live.

634
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:58,550
Okay.  Since I was wrong to speak badly of the child,

635
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,860
let's just apologize about this one thing.

636
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:07,230
 I mean, you don't even live here, but you left this dog tied here. 

637
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,860
I'm sorry. I couldn't just leave it at home alone.

638
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:12,300
No, Bokshil is usually a gentle dog.

639
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,260
Just take him and get out of here right away!

640
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:17,730
Don't you see that my baby is freaked out?  All because of your limping dog!

641
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:20,490
Limping dog? That's quite harsh.

642
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,050
What?

643
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:25,130
I mean, I knew your mouth was full of shit, turns out your ears are too.

644
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,320
We meet at a place like this.

645
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,230
Oh back then, I went to see you the next day but you had moved.

646
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,590
Something came up.

647
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:37,320
Gosh, just tell her to take it and leave now!

648
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,390
Is that lady for real?

649
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,530
- Have you been well? 
 - Please take the dog and leave right away.

650
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:47,360
I don't want to stay with the homeowners association.

651
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,990
I'm sorry but the baby's mother said she's coming soon.

652
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,830
So just let him be here for thirty minutes. Just thirty minutes.

653
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:54,240
I can't so please take him and go.

654
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,530
Then I'll take Bokshil for a walk for thirty minutes.

655
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,500
Bokshil, let's go for a walk.

656
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:05,160
Thank you, Ms. Writer! Please do me this favor. The baby's mother told me she's is coming soon.

657
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,120
- Yes, you don't need to worry. 
 - Thank you.

658
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,890
Ajusshi, can you give this to the tenant in 805 when she gets back?

659
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:18,110
- Apartment 805? 
 - Yes.

660
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:20,240
Come on, let's go!

661
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:28,330
Oh, Bokshil.

662
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,590
- Are you alright? 
 - I am.

663
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:33,220
- Bokshil, it's alright. 
 - Do you need to go to the hospital?

664
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,730
No, I'm fine.

665
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:48,100
Did you have a nice walk, Bokshil?

666
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,730
- Thank you. 
 - Don't mention it.

667
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:52,720
I got to go on a walk after a long time thanks to Bokshil, so I enjoyed it as well.

668
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,260
- Then, I'll get going. 
 - Oh, there.

669
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,130
Have dinner at my house before you go.

670
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:58,840
Oh, no, it's okay.

671
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,430
My house is right in front.  I'm going to eat by myself when I'm back home.

672
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,980
So, if you're fine with it then let's eat together.

673
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,760
How cute.

674
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:29,720
He does seem to be that puppy.

675
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:37,330
- The food is ready. Come on. 
 - Oh, yes.

676
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,300
Wow!

677
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,420
I live alone so I don't prepare too many side dishes.

678
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:52,400
That's not a problem at all. It's been a while for me since someone has set up a home cooked meal for me like this.

679
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,700
Well,

680
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:06,990
you said that your son had picked up this dog from some bridge, right?

681
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:10,030
Could you tell me where that was?

682
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,260
It was a bridge in Anshin-dong.

683
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,670
I had lived in Anshin-dong for a while, a long time ago.

684
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,960
Oh, then by chance,

685
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,630
wasn't there an accident in the neighborhood around that time?

686
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,260
You're right. The Kang Duk Su case.

687
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,100
But how do you know about that?

688
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:39,100
Then that child,

689
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:43,630
your son, where is he now?

690
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,030
About that.

691
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:52,330
He left this world first. Due to an accident.

692
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:04,300
I owe you a great deal for today. Thank you so much.

693
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,590
Not at all. Thank you for the meal.

694
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:10,540
- Alright. Head back safely. 
 - Yes, I'll get going.

695
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:35,170
   

696
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,700
Oh Bong Yi.

697
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:40,990
Ajussi, when that case happened back then,

698
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:44,990
you found me and carried me on your back till the hospital, right?

699
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:50,030
I did carry you on my back.

700
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:53,000
But I wasn't the one who found you. I went there after getting a report.

701
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:55,030
 Yes, this is the Anshin-dong Police Station. 

702
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:58,560
 Here, under the the Anshin-dong bridge... 

703
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,030
 Student, is somebody hurt? 

704
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:04,280
 Please come over here quickly. Hurry. 

705
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:08,100
 Are you okay? 

706
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:15,540
 Are you okay? 

707
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,670
   

708
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:27,400
 - Doctor, she's badly hurt. 
 - Please come this way. 

709
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,480
 Prepare some water and warm blankets. 

710
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,710
 - Call the surgeon too. 
 - Yes, doctor. 

711
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:37,200
   

712
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,150
   

713
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,180
Your grandmother and I took that uniform and went to the school.

714
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,240
But none of the kids said it was theirs.

715
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,880
So we couldn't find him.

716
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,550
But why did you bring that up all of a sudden?

717
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,690
I met that student's mother

718
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:08,210
by coincidence.

719
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,680
Really?

720
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,640
It must be fate.

721
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,940
But he died.

722
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,960
That person.

723
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,310
Hello?

724
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:25,790
I found that unregistered vehicle. 67 DO 6264.

725
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:26,850
Okay.

726
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,130
Sorry, I'll get going first.

727
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,420
   

728
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:06,460
Did you find out who he is?

729
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:10,010
He had no ID or cellphone, so we took his fingerprints.

730
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,190
Let me know when the results are out.

731
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:17,580
The black box was taken.

732
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,750
He didn't died by suicide. He was made to look like it.

733
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:34,240
 The number you have dialed is switched off. You will be connected to voicemail. 

734
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:43,800
Detective Shin, check the number I'm going to tell you right now.

735
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,880
Its cell tower, too.

736
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:02,930
Why would he hang something personal in an unregistered car that wasn't even his?

737
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:10,350
What's this?

738
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,120
He had two storage devices?

739
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,120
What a smart guy.

740
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,820
He had a backup ready, just in case something happened.

741
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,770
You were that child?

742
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:30,810
Yes. I just checked at the police station.

743
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:38,540
I was told, after he found me as I was dying, he reported it to the police and carried me on his back and ran.

744
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:43,200
Your son saved my life.

745
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,560
I see.

746
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:51,390
He didn't say a word about this to me.

747
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:53,980
So I couldn't even have imagined this.

748
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,480
Thank you.

749
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,570
I should have found you much earlier and relayed my thanks.

750
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:08,290
It would have been nice if I could have seen him and said thank you in person.

751
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,500
My child.

752
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,760
My child is that kind of person.

753
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,600
He's a good child.

754
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:40,560
Why did she remove that picture?

755
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:46,040
She removed the picture of her son back then too.

756
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:49,290
Why did she remove it?

757
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:57,590
It seems like something is going on.

758
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:04,350
It was definitely around here.

759
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,740
There.

760
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:28,510
What does it say?

761
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,450
 I'm okay now. 

762
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:38,450
 I'm doing well. 

763
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:42,650
 I'm eating well too. It's because of that person. 

764
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,210
 That person? 

765
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:49,960
 The person who gave me the will to live. 

766
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:54,720
 It's Doctor Seong Yo Han. 

767
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,040
   

768
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,490
Seong Yo Han saved my life?

769
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:14,310
   

770
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:20,330
A life saver and someone who takes care of injured dogs

771
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:23,480
killed my grandma like that...

772
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,460
Ah.

773
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:30,460
That's right. It's because he's a psychopath.

774
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,760
He could've been acting.

775
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,020
Pretending... He was pretending to be nice.

776
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,950
 Please don't die. 

777
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:40,670
 Hang in there. Don't die. 

778
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:43,180
 Think about your family. 

779
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:47,410
 If you die, think about how sad your family will be. 

780
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:50,750
 Your mom. Your dad. 

781
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,330
 Grandma. 

782
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,740
No.

783
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:03,380
That wasn't acting.

784
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,800
It was definitely sincere.

785
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:11,140
No, can a psychopath can be like that?

786
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:13,150
It doesn't make sense.

787
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:19,160
 As time passed, I started to think that it wasn't the doctor. 

788
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,660
No. No way.

789
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,020
No way.

790
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,090
There's clear evidence.

791
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:34,420
Seong Yo Han tried to kill Oppa. He definitely hit his head with a hammer.

792
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:41,980
If it isn't Seong Yo Han,

793
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:47,820
who killed my grandma like that?

794
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:59,210
The base station is coming up as Yeongja-dong?

795
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:02,140
I got it.

796
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:07,400
I'm right. He was killed trying to call me yesterday morning.

797
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:41,020
I think it's him.

798
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:44,710
Take a look.

799
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:47,190
Thank you.

800
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,830
   

801
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,200
   

802
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,520
Seong Yo Han?

803
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:58,530
 The kid who treated my hand back then was Seong Yo Han. 

804
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:01,980
When he was young, he studied well but...

805
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:06,160
How did he... You never know what people are really like.

806
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,990
   

807
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:15,130
Here, "compulsion." What does this mean?

808
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:19,420
I'm not sure. They don't usually write this way.

809
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:25,690
By any chance is Seong Yo Han's homeroom teacher from this time still at this school?

810
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:28,120
What is this?

811
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,070
Why is he only chasing Officer Jung?

812
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:34,290
This is the bridge near Bong Yi's place.

813
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:44,240
What is this?

814
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,630
Who...?

815
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:07,360
Ah, you were Seong Yo Han's homeroom teacher in the past, right?

816
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,740
I'm busy.

817
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:12,520
I'm busy preparing for the science class competition.

818
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:15,870
Excuse me, I'm a police officer.

819
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:18,810
Let me ask you one thing.

820
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:23,950
You wrote "compulsion" here. Do you remember why?

821
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:26,290
"Compulsion." "Compuls..." Ah!

822
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:31,340
Yo Han said that he felt like someone kept following him.

823
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:32,700
He kept saying that.

824
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,810
Thatâ€™s why he even received psychotherapy.

825
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:41,030
  Just like me, someone was following Seong Yo Han when he was young.  

826
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:44,460
It's time for the kids to come. Please go now.

827
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,690
Thank you.

828
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:00,730
- Uh... What are those rats for? 
 - Ah.

829
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:04,870
They're lab rats for the kids to use in science class.

830
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:07,750
By sharing the carbohydrate and proteinâ€“

831
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:09,840
Wait a moment.

832
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,820
What did you say?

833
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,260
 We... 

834
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:41,980
Jung Ba Reum.

835
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:47,090
Why are you at the murder site for Kang Duk Su, Lee Jae Sik, and Kim Byeong Tae?

836
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:51,150
Jung Ba Reum.

837
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:52,950
Is it you?

838
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,940
What did you say?

839
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,420
  We...  

840
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,410
I said lab rats.

841
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,890
 are lab rats... 

842
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:05,500
 Lab rats? 

843
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:14,550
 We... are lab rats. 

844
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:24,670
We are

845
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:30,360
lab rats.

846
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:57,050
