2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,080
   

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,700
   

4
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,020
What are you looking at? Get lost.

5
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,650
You have a deep cut. It must hurt.

6
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,560
I said, get lost.

7
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,250
- What are you doing? 
  - Stay still.

8
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,020
My mom told me that pennywort is good for disinfecting wounds.

9
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,000
Aren't you scared of me?

10
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,200
Huh?

11
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,770
Everyone avoids me ever since I cut the rabbit's stomach open.

12
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,070
I can't leave behind a friend who's been wounded.

13
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,240
Killing an animal is a very bad thing to do.

14
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,090
Don't do it ever again.

15
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,060
 Why wasn't I born like this kid? 

16
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,400
It's all done.

17
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,800
 I... want to be like this kid. 

18
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,500
 I... want to be him. 

19
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,740
   

20
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,610
What do I do?

21
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,140
What do I do? I think he's dead!

22
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,030
How do you feel?

23
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,020
You!

24
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,170
It's exhilarating, isn't it? Killing someone?

25
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,600
   

26
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,020
What do I do?

27
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,840
What do I do? I killed someone.

28
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,470
I killed a person...

29
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,690
No. No, I didn't kill him.

30
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,560
 Seong Yo Han.  Damn it!

31
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,720
 Seong Yo Han. It's because of that bastard! 

32
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,180
Does it make you feel better if you do that?

33
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,810
Does it make you feel better if you blame me?

34
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,990
This... This a hallucination.

35
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,850
Hallucination! Hallucination! Hallucination!

36
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,730
Even if you deny it, you're just a murderer. A murderer.

37
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,000
It was self-defense! Self-defense!

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,750
That's right! Since Woo Hyeong Cheol tried to kill me first. I had no other choice!

39
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,670
Self-defense?

40
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,180
Be a little more honest.

41
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,120
You enjoyed the moment when he stopped breathing.

42
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,100
When you strangled him, it was rapturous.

43
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,070
No! No, that's not true!

44
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,150
I... I'm different from you! I'm not like you!

45
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,810
Look at the state you're in right now.

46
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,110
Can you still say that?

47
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,050
Get lost! Please, get lost!

48
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,820
Huh!

49
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,020
See that?

50
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,500
From this point, we lost him.

51
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,260
- That's Ochang IC, right? 
 - Yes, if you keep going that way, it's Ochang IC.

52
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,240
This is where the bodies of Kim Yeong Hee and Park Hye Won were found.  It's not that far.

53
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,760
Woo Hyeong Cheol's uncle's house is right here.

54
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,370
- I came to turn myself in. 
 - Flip it to the right side.

55
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,550
- I don't think it's far from here. It just got disconnected here. 
 -  I killed Woo Hyeong Cheol.

56
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,450
It ended here, that's it.

57
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,010
I said, I killed Woo Hyeong Cheol!

58
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,170
Stay here.

59
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,330
What's going on?

60
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,610
What?

61
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,130
Where did he go?

62
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,630
Where did he go?

63
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,670
He must have something. Stay here.

64
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,820
There's no blood. Officer Jung and Woo Hyeong Cheol's fingerprints weren't found.

65
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,130
This is not the scene of a murder.

66
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,230
You said Officer Jung received brain surgery, right?

67
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,140
I heard you can never tell what side effects there may be with brain surgery.

68
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,830
Take him to the hospital.

69
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,140
Good job. See you.

70
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,010
What did he say?

71
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,420
It's true.

72
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,490
Unless I have gone crazy, would I say that I killed someone when I didn't?

73
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,880
- Officer Jung. 
 - By the road over there,

74
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,670
you will find Woo Hyeong Cheol's car and the truck I drove. Check for yourself!

75
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,680
- Over by that route– 
 - We got Woo Hyeong Cheol's location! He must have turned his cellphone on!

76
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,120
What?

77
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,220
Wh– Where?

78
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,280
It's true... navy jacket, black pants, hiking cap...

79
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,180
All of it... That's everything Woo Hyeong Cheol was wearing...

80
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,760
That's right.

81
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,660
We checked everything, but there wasn't a sedan or a truck.

82
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,950
And no reports came in for a stolen truck in the area either.

83
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:07,040
Ah, Officer Jung, I found this at that house. Your cellphone.

84
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,140
Would you like me to go with you to the hospital?

85
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,670
No, it's alright.

86
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:25,430
Detective, you knew, didn't you?  That Woo Hyeong Cheol was the culprit who killed the high school student and the masseuse.

87
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,690
 By chance, have you seen this person here? 

88
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,600
 Ah, why are you here asking about this again? 

89
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,900
 - Someone came and confirmed it earlier as well. 
 - Earlier? 

90
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,010
 The detective who appeared on TV did.  You know, the one whose brother died. 

91
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,840
 You mean Detective Go Mu Chi? 

92
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,720
Yeah, I knew it.  At first, I was nervous after hearing what you said.

93
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,200
I thought perhaps I had shot Seong Yo Han when he was innocent. But Kim Jin Ah's corpse was a little different.

94
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,720
Song Soo Ho was burned while still alive but Kim Jin Ah was burned after she was killed.

95
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,350
But, what was even more conclusive was the fact that business flyers were found at the victim's house.

96
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,470
 The culprit came and took them. 

97
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,560
 They were the same as the one on the floor of Woo Hyeong Cheol's office. 

98
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,830
So, I had him tailed.  That way, we would catch him if he committed another crime.

99
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,430
But, Detective Lee lost him so...

100
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,220
If you knew, you should have told me.

101
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,460
I went to the police substation to tell you that.

102
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,510
But, after seeing Park Hye Won's video on your computer, I remembered where I saw her.

103
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,880
Anyway, thanks to you, we found the bodies of both Park Hye Won and Kim Yeong Hee.

104
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,890
Good job.

105
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,620
I will be going.

106
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,580
You know...

107
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,690
Why did you want so badly for Seong Yo Han not to be the real culprit?

108
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,070
You seemed desperate, in my eyes.

109
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,160
Just because.

110
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,330
Just.

111
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,240
How is Miss Seul Gi?

112
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,870
Fortunately, they say that she's not hurt badly anywhere.

113
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,460
Thank you, Ba Reum.  If it weren't for you, really...

114
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,220
When I heard the news that you killed that bastard,

115
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,790
even though I was thinking that you would never do that,

116
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,280
a part of me thought that you did right.

117
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,410
Because that kind of bastard... deserves to die.

118
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,650
 It has come to light that the real culprit of the "knot" case is the son of the deceased Mr. A. 

119
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:59,960
 The police, presuming that Woo Hyeong Cheol has illegally stowed away on a boat to the Philippines, asked the authorities in Philippines for cooperation in investigating. 

120
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,660
 Unless I have gone crazy, would I say that I killed someone when I hadn't? 

121
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,820
Officer Jung Ba Reum has been assigned to our team.

122
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,060
Isn't Officer Jung's condition still—

123
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,040
For now, we will just have him work inside the office.

124
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,500
I told the Pyeongan substation as well, to have him start work here.

125
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,020
I understand.

126
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,030
Evidence storage team?

127
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
Ah, thank you.

128
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,050
But, would I be okay?

129
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,630
What did they say at the hospital?

130
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,900
They said there is nothing specially wrong.  They said it's probably because I experienced a lot of stress.

131
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,820
Okay. Start your work tomorrow, for now.

132
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,230
Yes, I understand.  I will see you tomorrow.

133
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,040
Na Bee (Butterfly).

134
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,160
Na Bee, come out and eat.

135
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,080
I am sorry. I will never do that again.

136
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,020
I understand.

137
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,110
I will leave it here, so think about your babies and make sure to eat.

138
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,260
 It's a little quieter now. 

139
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,850
What is this?

140
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,060
Is this a hallucination as well?

141
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:26,790
Ah, the bird?  I told your aunt at that time but I guess you haven't heard.

142
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,860
Aunt?

143
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,060
 The kids hospitalized in the pediatric unit found it on the flower bed. 

144
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,120
 They were crying so much saying they felt bad for it, that we buried it in the backyard and even made a grave. 

145
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,890
I killed it.

146
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,480
I did.

147
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,160
Then, Woo Hyeong Cheol as well...

148
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,000
 It's right, this spot. 

149
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,840
It wasn't a hallucination.

150
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,570
Then, who would, with me...?

151
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,960
   

152
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,990
I think he noticed, what should I do?

153
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,720
 This bus stop is the Northern Police Station. 

154
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,770
 The next stop is Dawoon High School, if you want to get off. 

155
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,880
 What should I do? 

156
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,230
 If I turn myself in, they'll treat me like a mentally ill person. 

157
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,010
 No, I still need to turn myself in. 

158
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,150
So, are you going to turn yourself in?

159
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,700
What?

160
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,080
Are you thinking of turning yourself in, Jung Ba Reum?

161
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,630
 - Are you okay, sir?  
  - Ah, yes. 

162
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,690
 This is not my phone. 

163
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,200
Hello?

164
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,030
 You are curious why Woo Hyeong Cheol disappeared, right? 

165
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,220
Who are you?

166
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,820
I will tell you the details in person but there is something you need to keep in mind.

167
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,240
 Any of this should not be known to anyone. 

168
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,560
Not only for those involved in brain surgery, but for your aunt as well.

169
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,320
 Please promise me. 

170
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,950
 Brain surgery? Aunt? He knows everything about me. 

171
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,960
 Just who is this?  Where should I go?

172
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,250
At the station...

173
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,320
   

174
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,550
   

175
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,830
   

176
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,130
D-Doctor Daniel?

177
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,110
You were killed? By Seong Yo Han.

178
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,980
There is something else you are more curious about than that.

179
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,040
Where did Woo Hyeong Cheol's body disappear to?

180
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,140
Then, you were the one who got rid...

181
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:15,040
No. I definitely saw Woo Hyeong Cheol get on a smuggling boat.

182
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,510
Did you confirm his face?

183
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,400
No, I didn't do that but his back, clothes and shoes–

184
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,150
What if someone with a physique similar to Woo Hyeong Cheol cosplayed as him

185
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,090
and purposely got caught on the CCTV?

186
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,160
Then.

187
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,800
If you look at it, Woo Hyeong Cheol did get on that boat with someone.

188
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,390
Of course, it probably got eaten by fish by now.

189
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,030
What does that...

190
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,260
Who on Earth...

191
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,140
To cut it short, I will give the reason why I wanted to meet.

192
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,060
How did you feel when you killed Woo Hyeong Cheol?

193
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,280
It was a mistake.

194
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,670
It was self-defense because Woo Hyeong Cheol was trying to kill me!

195
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,050
Let's be more honest.

196
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:08,430
When Woo Hyeong Cheol stopped breathing, you must have felt pleasure that you didn't even know at that moment.

197
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:18,490
Unfortunately, the frontal lobe of the killer, Seong Yo Han, has engulfed a large part of your brain for the past year.

198
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,200
Even at this moment, it's eating up your brain.

199
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,070
And in the end, your brain will be completely taken over by Seong Yo Han's brain.

200
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,440
What do you think will happen after that?

201
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,750
Killing is an addiction.

202
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,790
After murdering Woo Hyeong Cheol, the urge to murder inside of you has been awakened.

203
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,130
The switch has been turned on.

204
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,430
The switch?

205
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:46,320
As time passes by, that urge will get worse and worse.

206
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,200
You won't be able to stop it. Not even with treatment.

207
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,840
How about solving the awakened murderous instinct from a different side?

208
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,420
By killing the top 1% of psychopath predators like Woo Hyeong Cheol,

209
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,680
you are punishing them.

210
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,630
If you bring me their DNA,

211
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:13,780
I'll confirm if that person is a predator.

212
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,110
Are you telling me right now

213
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,620
to kill people?

214
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,570
Instead, thanks to Jung Ba Reum,

215
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,010
there will be no victims who are killed unfairly.

216
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,390
You are crazy. You are crazy!

217
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,050
I'm going to turn myself in.

218
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,310
I will pay the price for killing Woo Hyeong Cheol.

219
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,770
How will you do that without his body or evidence?

220
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,170
If you want people to believe that you killed Woo Hyeong Cheol,

221
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,550
you will have to say that your brain was engulfed by the killer, Seong Yo Han's, brain.

222
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,970
Are you okay with telling the world this?

223
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,990
Among the people you tell, who's going to believe you?

224
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,100
Even if somebody believes you,

225
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,950
you're going to end up being an experimental mouse in the science or medical world. Is that okay?

226
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,220
There is not much time left.

227
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,270
Because sooner or later, the switch

228
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,760
will turn on again.

229
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,230
You're crazy. You're so crazy.

230
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,630
It'll be good to listen to what I say.

231
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,590
Jung Ba Reum.

232
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,560
If you don't listen, in the end,

233
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,980
you'll kill your family and loved ones first.

234
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,520
Yes, aunt?

235
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,480
Did you go home? How are you feeling?

236
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,830
I left you carp juice. When you feel weak, there's nothing like carp juice.

237
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,840
Why didn't you tell me?

238
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,260
That Uh Bung Yi died.

239
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,840
Ba Reum, when you woke up, you couldn't even recognize  me .

240
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,380
How could I tell you when you were in such a state?

241
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,060
Okay, I understand.

242
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,230
The switch will turn on?

243
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,920
No, no. That will not happen.

244
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,840
Oh! Officer Jung.

245
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,750
You finally transferred. Congratulations!

246
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,320
Thank you.

247
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,870
Evidence from Woo Hyeong Cheol's case.

248
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,870
Okay.

249
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,030
But are you going on a blind date, all dressed like that?

250
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,890
What do you mean blind date? When in a few days, I'll be taken.

251
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,690
Go Sunbaenim said he'll be the MC.

252
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,600
Are you getting married?

253
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,570
Ah, I didn't give you the invitation, huh?

254
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,730
- I'll bring it next time with Team Leader's. 
 - Okay.

255
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,820
How do I look? Not bad, right?

256
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,630
I got a brand new suit for the TV appearance.

257
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,420
I see. You're going to be on TV?

258
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,080
At 10:00 p.m. tonight, Sherlock Hong Ju returns. The first guest on the first episode.

259
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,500
The hero of the City of Mujin, Officer Shin Sang. Yeah!

260
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,170
- Is PD Choi doing a TV program again? 
 - Yeah.

261
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,460
That's good.

262
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,820
But where's Sunbae Go?  Why are you here alone? Do you want me to help you?

263
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,700
Not at all. I can do it alone.

264
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,370
But then again, if I get this brand new suit dirty, it wouldn't be good.

265
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,130
Okay, then I'll go get a drink for you.

266
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,230
No, it's fine. I'm good.

267
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,890
Is there any loose change lying around?

268
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:48,480
Oh, Sunbae put this here? I'll use this then.

269
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,910
Hey! Stop right there!

270
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:56,560
This bastard, after causing that huge problem taking that instant coffee packet, you still don't have your head on straight!

271
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,450
Why are you touching this?

272
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,520
Oh, is it evidence or something?

273
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,370
It's a retainer for murder.

274
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,280
What? A retainer for murder?

275
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,040
That's right.

276
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,000
A little kid gave it to me asking me to kill some bad guy for him. It's like a deposit.

277
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,070
Today, we looked at the gasoline terrorist incident, one of the three major unsolved cases in Korea.

278
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,580
Next week at this time, coinciding with the one year release of Kang Duk Su,

279
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,220
we will take the time to diagnose the current status of sexual offenses against children.

280
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,400
I will see you next week.

281
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,940
You worked hard.

282
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,450
- You worked hard. You worked hard. 
 - You worked hard.

283
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,690
You worked hard.

284
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,350
- You did really well today. 
 - Ah, what do you mean?

285
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,700
Oh, but next week's topic is about sex crimes against children.

286
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,870
Then, a detective like me who is a child psychology major should appear again...

287
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,160
Okay, I'll tell the writer.

288
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,490
Yes! Ah, then should I come with Go Sunbae?

289
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,990
- Detective Go Mu Chi? 
 - Yes.

290
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,460
Go Sunbae was the one who caught Kang Duk Su.

291
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,830
That's why even now, the victim in that case is special to him.

292
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,440
 Do you think you can take someone in? 

293
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,190
 For about a month? 

294
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,440
That's why he was like that.

295
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,260
When I find a house to move to, I'm going to pick you up right away.

296
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,750
Until then, you have to listen well, okay?

297
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,030
Okay.

298
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,580
You have to come and get me.

299
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,920
If you miss me, use this to call Bong Yi Unnie. Okay?

300
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,470
Unnie will run quickly and give the phone to your mom any time.

301
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,320
- Thank you. 
 - Welcome.

302
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,210
What do you want to eat?

303
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,760
Welcome.

304
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,280
When you choose what you want, please call me.

305
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,540
Is that her?

306
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,880
- We will order! 
 - Yes!

307
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,000
- What would you like to order? 
 - It's you, right? Oh Bong Yi.

308
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,480
 - Please forgive her just this– 
 - Why are you doing this? 

309
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,320
Please sign.

310
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,210
This is a tip.

311
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,810
If you don't want it, then never mind. I was giving you a tip because you're pitiful.

312
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,020
- Did you get a call from Bong Yi? 
 - Yes.

313
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,500
Bong Yi.

314
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,180
Get up, Bong Yi. Oh Bong Yi.

315
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,840
Bong Yi.

316
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,280
Oppa.

317
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,950
Ba Reum Oppa.

318
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:57,060
Aigo, our Ba Reum Oppa. You are so upright.

319
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,470
What's the point if you are that upright?

320
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,510
You can't even remember saying that I should marry you.

321
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,640
This stupid idiot.

322
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,520
Excuse me. Why did she drink so much?

323
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,320
I'm not sure. It seemed like her school classmates

324
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,470
after saying, "that case," "what to do," and "how pitiful,"

325
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,210
started to grab each others' hair and get into a fight. Geez.

326
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,960
 That case? 

327
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,360
Aigo.

328
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,010
Ah.

329
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,620
 Wow! How can you look so good while eating so well? 

330
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,370
 My goodness. 

331
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:11,140
Grandma. I miss you, grandma.

332
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,250
 It's desirable, huh? 

333
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,860
 You want to press the neck hard, huh? 

334
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,420
 Hurry and press it. 

335
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,930
 Just feel how soft it is. 

336
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:55,110
 Feel it, try feeling it. 

337
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,440
 Why are you hesitating? 

338
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,060
 Press, hurry and press it. 

339
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,970
 It'll be good to listen to what I say. 

340
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:25,740
 If you don't listen, in the end 

341
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,070
 you'll kill your family and loved ones first. 

342
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,360
 Killing is an addiction. As time passes by, 

343
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,820
 that urge will get worse and worse. 

344
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,330
 You won't be able to stop it. Not even with any treatment. 

345
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,990
 What's the point if you are that upright? 

346
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:18,880
 You can't even remember saying that I should marry you. 

347
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,080
Ah, how embarrassing!

348
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,640
Oppa! Oppa, your cellphone!

349
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,760
My cellphone. Ah, at Bong Yi's house.

350
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,580
Kang Duk Su?

351
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,380
Are you okay?

352
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,200
That guy.

353
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,050
 Because I sent her out on an errand to get me drinks.  

354
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,310
 I let that awful thing happen to her. 

355
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,280
 Aigo, I should be the one to die. 

356
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,730
 I should die. 

357
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,480
 It's not your fault. Don't blame yourself. 

358
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,980
 Aigo, how sad, my child. 

359
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,420
 My little puppy. 

360
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:59,560
 Officer Jung, my Bong Yi. 

361
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,060
 I trust her with you. Okay? 

362
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:10,320
Is he living in the same neighborhood as Bong Yi?

363
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,090
 If you bring the DNA, 

364
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,990
 I'll confirm for you if he's the predator. 

365
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,990
That man just a second ago... What did you say to him?

366
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,590
I didn't say anything.

367
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,070
I simply tripped because my shoe came off.

368
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,660
Bong Yi... This isn't some joke.

369
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,540
Did you come here for news coverage?

370
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:58,020
I know who you are now. What? Are you going to broadcast this too?

371
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,300
Don't do it. You guys are crazy about ratings so you only make provocative content.

372
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,300
You don't think about the victims at all!

373
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,740
Stop pretending like you're on the side of justice. That's even crueler.

374
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,580
You are the ones inflicting harm because in my eyes you're all the same.

375
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,960
You must've misunderstood me. I'm not here to cover you.

376
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,580
Detective Go worried about you a lot.

377
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,590
- That's why he wanted you to live with us— 
 - Why? Why should I do that?

378
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,340
Have I committed some crime?

379
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,690
That bastard is the one who committed the crime, but why is it me who has to keep running away?

380
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,930
I'm no longer the same child from back then.

381
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,860
I can at least take care of myself.

382
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,990
So please leave.

383
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,740
Leave. Quickly.

384
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,670
Look for it. The psychopath genes.

385
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,530
Are you testing me?

386
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,440
This punk hasn't been here that long and he's already skipping work! He didn't even finish cleaning up.

387
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,210
Where'd you go?

388
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,630
He's not right in the head yet. I should be more understanding.

389
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,510
What's going on?

390
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,160
Kang Duk Su came across Bong Yi.

391
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,400
- What? Where? 
 - In the neighborhood.

392
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,620
Kang Duk Su is back in town? That little piece of shit!

393
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,330
This is the footage from my car's black box.

394
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,030
This little piece of—

395
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,620
Hey!

396
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,800
Are you guys going to keep slacking off like this?

397
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:59,370
- Now what? 
 - Kang Duk Su approached the victim.

398
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:02,210
Kang Duk Su sent a move application to this region a few days ago.

399
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,690
Then you should monitor him! He needs to be monitored 24 hours a day!

400
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:08,460
Kang Duk Su is currently within the jurisdiction.  There are no worries or problems.

401
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,450
What? Then, is it fine if he threatens the victim? Everything is fine as long as he's within that region?

402
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,290
Legally, there's no problem.

403
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:18,810
Because the victim's restraining order doesn't apply to him.

404
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,660
 Who is it? 

405
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,380
 You don't need to know. 

406
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,260
 You must make him stop. Someone who's a psychopathic predator of this degree, 

407
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,620
 once they commit this crime once, they will commit the same kind of crime again, no matter what. 

408
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,590
 They'll never be able to stop. 

409
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,610
 Their crimes will continue to grow more destructive because they will continue to evolve. 

410
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,870
   

411
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,090
   

412
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:15,270
 Don't worry. I'll make sure to catch him. 

413
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:25,500
 After dad passed away, Grandma drank a lot of alcohol. 

414
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,880
 We ran out of makgeolli that night too, so I was told to get more. 

415
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,920
 Aigoo. You're here at this time of night again? The makgeolli...  

416
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,840
 That girl is the daughter of  Mr. Oh, the man who died in the falling accident at the construction site. 

417
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,540
 My gosh, poor girl. 

418
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:54,830
 - Are you leaving already? 
 - My mother's home alone... 

419
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,510
 Okay. 

420
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:02,720
 Someone tied a puppy to a bridge and abandoned him. 

421
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,690
 So I tried to free him. 

422
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,750
 The... The puppy. 

423
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,530
So that's why she was like that.

424
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,520
   

425
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,800
    
    

426
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,760
 No! Don't fall asleep! 

427
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,390
 Kid, you can't fall asleep. I'll catch that bastard! 

428
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,100
 Who is it? 

429
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,750
 You bastard! 

430
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:01,260
 - You little bastard. 
 - Wh-Why are you doing this? I was drunk, 

431
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,410
 so I don't remember anything! 

432
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,360
 The defendant may now make his final plea. 

433
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,940
 This is really driving me nuts. 

434
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,910
 I truly don't remember. 

435
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:17,420
 Even if I were so drunk that I act like an idiot, 

436
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,680
 how could any human being do such a thing to such a young child? 

437
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,530
 - I really am not such human trash like that!  
  - What? 

438
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:31,760
 If any of this is true, you can completely cut off my you-know-what. 

439
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,360
 I really feel unjustly accused! 

440
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,460
 Due to the cruel methods used, 

441
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,810
 and due to the history of repeated crimes in the past, you will be given severe punishment. 

442
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:03,980
 However, as asserted by the defendant, reduced emotional and physical capacity is partly recognized. 

443
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:10,930
 Defendant Kang Duk Su is sentenced to 10 years in prison and 10 years of probation. 

444
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:14,390
 What? 10 years you say? 

445
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:18,150
 Wh-Why you! You rotten little piece of shit! 

446
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,410
 You! You said you didn't do it? 

447
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:26,100
 That little piece of shit deserves to die! He must die! 

448
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,660
 That damned man needs to die... 

449
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,840
 Whenever it rains, I think of you. 

450
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,320
 Could I marry you? I'll be good to you. 

451
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,100
 What is this?  Are you asking me to get revenge for you? 

452
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,590
 Okay.  When that guy gets out, I'll kill him for you. 

453
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,830
Oh, run, run, run!

454
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,670
 When I heard the news that you killed that bastard, 

455
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:36,350
 on one hand, you thought there was no way I did that.  But on the other hand, you thought it was a good thing. 

456
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:40,690
 Because that kind of bastard deserves to die. 

457
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:03,870
Detective, what brings you here?

458
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,820
- What did you say to Bong Yi? 
 - What?

459
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,760
There's a video of you running into her at the crosswalk. So don't you lie to me.

460
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,920
Ah... Well, I didn't say anything.

461
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,470
I just ran into her by chance–

462
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,080
What did you say?  You're not going to tell me?

463
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,150
I really... didn't say anything.

464
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:31,020
I just gave her a little greeting.

465
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,830
You son of a bitch!

466
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,950
Son of a bitch!  I said that I'd kill you!

467
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,970
Son of a bitch!

468
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,220
I'm telling you that he was going to shoot me.

469
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,730
It's the truth.

470
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,610
I didn't do anything–

471
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:12,740
You didn't do anything?

472
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,280
Do you know what that bastard said to Bong Yi?

473
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,490
Team Leader, that bastard–

474
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,910
I really didn't do anything.

475
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,580
Mother, say something.

476
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,610
You saw everything, Mother.

477
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:28,690
Yes. My son didn't do anything, but that Detective–

478
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,890
Why are you asking?  She's on her child's side!  Why are you asking that Ahjumma?

479
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:35,490
I think you're really too much.

480
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:40,990
I've lived the last ten years of my life repenting, and I'm trying to live the rest of my life in atonement.

481
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:46,220
For now, you should calm down and head back home. We'll give you a call.

482
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,860
- Why is he going home? That bastard is putting on a show! 
 - Mother, let's go.

483
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,710
That bastard is putting on a show!

484
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,810
Stop putting on a show, bastard.

485
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:56,270
You can't just send him, Team Leader!

486
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,830
Team Leader!  Team Leader!

487
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,630
Seriously.

488
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,580
Detective Shi– Shin!  Detective Shin!

489
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,500
Detective Shin, come here!

490
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,690
What is it?

491
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,630
I think I got taken by that bastard.

492
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,490
He provoked me on purpose.

493
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:24,130
To separate me from Bong Yi.  I think that bastard is going to do something.

494
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,240
He can't do that realistically.  He even has the ankle monitor.

495
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,520
You're wrong! Bong Yi is in danger!

496
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,320
Hey, let me out!  Please!  Please!

497
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,780
Where is Officer Jung?  He was supposed to stay close to you, Sunbae.

498
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,360
-  Sheesh. 
 - Then... let me ask you for a favor.

499
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,670
   

500
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,060
Hey, get back to your senses!

501
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,980
Wake up!

502
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:29,980
I was wrong.

503
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:33,030
Kang Duk Su is not a psychopath.

504
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,890
No, even if he were a psychopath, he's not one now.

505
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,450
 He was reformed. 

506
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:41,290
 He was repenting and trying to atone for his sins. 

507
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:54,500
 Kang Duk Su, who was the culprit of the Ohyang case, has attempted suicide. 

508
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,510
 Some say it was an attempt to commit suicide under pressure from society. 

509
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:01,290
 But others are angry that his 

510
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:04,020
 sentence was reduced due to his inebriated state at the time. 

511
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:09,680
- Buy it for me! 
 - No!

512
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,760
- I said, buy it for me! 
 - Aunt!

513
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,450
- Buy me one! 
 - Aunt!

514
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:14,400
Ba Reum.

515
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,760
Who is he?

516
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,620
- You don't remember Hoon Seok, do you? 
 - Mom!

517
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:21,320
- Buy it for me! 
 - When Hoon Seok was a baby, you practically raised him on your back.

518
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,160
Buy one for me!

519
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,350
Please!

520
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,090
Hoon Seok, I'm your older cousin.

521
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:30,510
Hyung hurt his head and can't remember you.  I'm sorry.

522
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:34,470
- Ah, buy me one. 
 - He's asking me to buy a cat for him so that he can raise it.

523
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,540
You should let him raise it.

524
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,830
Buy it for me!

525
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:40,090
Mom will buy you a doll, a cat doll.

526
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,160
Kitty cat!

527
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,660
- Hoon Seok, should Hyung buy you something delicious?
 - Kitty cat.

528
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,230
That will be twenty seven thousand won.

529
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,670
You should eat.

530
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,160
Hoon Seok.

531
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,220
There's a cat at my house.  Do you want to see a picture?

532
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,300
Ta-da!

533
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,600
I want to go see it!  I'm going to go!

534
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,100
Do you want to?

535
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,820
Then, not now, but when she has kittens.  I'll call you.

536
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,880
Really?

537
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,640
Promise!

538
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,290
Promise.

539
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:12,620
Okay, now eat.

540
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:18,760
- Here! I'm buying this for you instead of the cat. 
 - Wow!

541
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:25,060
 That's right.  You can overcome it. 

542
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:28,100
 I'm going to show them that the professor is wrong. 

543
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,220
 I will never be defeated by Seong Yo Han. 

544
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,640
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

545
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,240
Sunbae Go assaulted Kang Duk Su, and is in jail.

546
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,920
Excuse me?

547
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,420
This.

548
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,060
Sunbae Go wanted me to pass this on to you.

549
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:58,750
 This is the weather. 

550
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,430
 High pressure in China and low pressure in Japan will take place, 

551
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:06,610
 with the two pressures meeting in the eastern sea area and creating a strong east wind. 

552
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:11,300
 As a result, it will rain with thunder and lightning in inland areas starting this weekend. 

553
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,120
 This was the weather. 

554
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:17,620
 Look forward to it.  When it rains, I'll come to your house. 

555
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,260
Why is it raining like this?

556
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,500
I know, right?

557
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,790
 If it just rains... 

558
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,180
Hey, is it raining? Is it raining right now, huh?

559
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,510
Let me. Let me out.

560
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,080
Ki Hyuk Hyeong!

561
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,390
Hey, Parachute! Team Leader!

562
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,870
Ah, I have to give her food.

563
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,490
She had babies!

564
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,880
Hyung!

565
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,950
Oh, Hoon Seok. You picked up so fast. What about your mom?

566
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,520
She went to grandma's house.

567
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,350
She said that grandma was in pain and crying.

568
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,630
She left her cellphone.

569
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:17,690
Grandma?

570
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,590
Yes, Jeju grandma.

571
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,810
Jeju grandma?

572
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:25,030
Then, are you by yourself?

573
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,450
No, I'm with Ajumma.

574
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:31,000
Ajumma is sleeping and snoring in her room.

575
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,330
Hoon Seok. Look at this.

576
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,460
 How cute! Hyung, I want to go and see them. 

577
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,790
You want to see them, Hoon Seok?

578
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:42,380
I want to see.

579
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,180
Okay, I'll come and get you. Get dressed.

580
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,750
What is the address?

581
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,880
- Hold on. 
 - Okay.

582
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:54,710
Mujin, Mujin-dong.

583
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:57,630
 Mujin Apartment Building 1. 

584
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:00,060
Room 301.

585
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,630
Oh, I got it.

586
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:06,650
Mujin-dong?

587
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,910
Wasn't it Pyeongan-dong?

588
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,050
How weird.

589
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:13,630
Yes? I am going to film.

590
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:17,320
Last time, my face was swollen and I came out looking ugly.

591
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:22,230
I'll call you a bit later.

592
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:25,530
Oh, mother. Why are you here?

593
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:27,950
Ah, actually,

594
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:30,880
please release that detective.

595
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,580
That punk, Duk Su, lied.

596
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:39,000
- Huh? 
 - Because that detective came and got angry,

597
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,040
- my son got annoyed and lied. 
 - Ah.

598
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:48,090
That detective didn't do anything wrong, so please release him.

599
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:50,850
I'm sorry.

600
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:53,550
I raised my son wrong.

601
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:00,290
Because I wasn't sure, I also wrote this statement.

602
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,480
Then I will go.

603
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,320
    

604
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,790
Detective Ki. Detective Ki, Detective Ki!

605
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,450
Can you give this to Team Leader?

606
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:28,120
I have the broadcast. Please do this for me.

607
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:36,560
 Aunt, Hoon Seok will be at my house. 

608
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,060
 When you see this, please call me. 

609
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:58,290
 It was raining when that terrible accident happened 12 years ago. 

610
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:02,300
 It has been a year since Kang Duk Su was released. 

611
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,230
 I will ask you straightforwardly. 

612
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,520
Are the children safe while he's wearing the electronic anklet?

613
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,360
 Since the incident, we have strengthened management and supervision. 

614
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:17,090
 Criminals with a high risk of a repeated offense can be observed one-on-one now. 

615
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:21,830
It's been a year since he was released and there have been no problems. Can you be reassured?

616
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:24,130
For the first six months, everyone is watching.

617
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:27,860
But when a year passes like now, people start to relax.

618
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:31,930
And then they start to believe that he has been rehabilitated.

619
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:38,160
 They are waiting for that time. As the boundaries are lifted, they start to commit crimes again. 

620
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,390
 That's the most dangerous time. 

621
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,770
Go slowly.

622
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:55,270
How cute.

623
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,410
It's cute, huh?

624
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:04,180
But, the cat must not like you.

625
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:08,670
No, she's just sensitive since she gave birth.

626
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,970
Hoon Seok, you're hungry, aren't you? I'll make you something.

627
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,290
Yes, Probation Officer.

628
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,780
I'm at the pharmacy.

629
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,880
Ah yes, because I'm out of the medicine that the hospital prescribed.

630
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,140
 - 99% of the sex offenders  
 - Okay.

631
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:59,480
 rely on voice calls to manage their movements. 

632
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,330
- Is it good? 
 - Yes!

633
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:04,810
Eat a lot.

634
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,540
Yes.

635
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:24,960
Hyung, what's wrong? Are you hurt somewhere?

636
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,650
No, it's nothing. Hoon Seok, I'll cut it for you more.

637
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,900
 I'll show you why I did martial arts like that. 

638
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,910
 Kang Duk Su. 

639
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,910
What is this?

640
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:00,400
This is the situation room at the probation office. Kang Duk Su's electronic anklet was damaged.

641
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,990
This is an emergency call!

642
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:05,500
 The location of Kang Duk Su's cellphone is in the same direction, 

643
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,880
 currently exiting the Muchang Interchange. 

644
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:22,710
 Breaking news. 

645
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,570
 Kang Duk Su, a child sex offender who was released a year ago, 

646
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:27,930
 cut off his electronic anklet and ran away. 

647
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:30,830
 As a result of tracking Kang Duk Su's location,  
    

648
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:34,370
- What? Did he run away? 
  - it's found that he is heading toward Jeongsoon, Gangwon-do. 

649
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,070
You're watching Sherlock Hong Ju?

650
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,250
I'm a fan of Choi Hong Ju.

651
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:56,410
In an interview somewhere,

652
01:01:56,410 --> 01:02:00,710
it said she's an orphan, but she studied very hard to get where she is.

653
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:03,230
Ah, right. Yoo Na came.

654
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,650
Yoo Na came? When?

655
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:09,470
In the evening, she bought some bread to give to her mom.

656
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:10,530
 Child sex offenders, 

657
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:14,260
- Huh, Yoo Na? 
   - including pedophiles, never change. 

658
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:18,200
  Their only concern is young children.  

659
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:22,330
Hyung, should we play with the cat?

660
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:39,250
Hyung, play with me!

661
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,670
The cat. The cat's shape...

662
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,610
Ah, Hoon Seok, wait a moment..

663
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:46,200
Hyung! Play with me!

664
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,500
Hide and seek. Hide and seek.

665
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,120
Hide and seek!

666
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,350
I will hide first.

667
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:59,650
Count to 100 and find me.

668
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,160
 Aish, so loud. 

669
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,310
 So annoying. 

670
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,760
You worked hard.

671
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,660
I could have done better.

672
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,910
What about Detective Go?

673
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:46,950
The thing is... He's in jail right now.

674
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:49,160
In jail?

675
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,600
Hyung, Hyung, Hyung!  Hyung Ki Hyuk!

676
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,990
Hyungnim, let me out, okay?

677
01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:00,640
Bong Yi is in danger.  Bong Yi is in danger!

678
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,460
Please,  turn a blind eye just once.

679
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,030
There's no one here.

680
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:06,400
I– I'll say that I stole the key and left.

681
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,380
I– I'll say that I stole it.

682
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,160
Thank you.

683
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:21,570
The moment you open the door with that key and leave here to save Bong Yi, you'll lose your job as a police officer.

684
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:25,320
Make your choice.  Is it Han Seo Joon, or Oh Bong Yi?

685
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:39,590
   

686
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:44,600
♪ Hide yourself well ♪

687

688
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:51,600
Hyung, you're really bad at seeking.

689
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,110
Dummy.

690
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:05,160
 Could rain be that switch? 

691
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,180
Yoo Na!  Yoo Na!

692
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:11,600
Yoo Na!

693
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:15,480
Ahjumma!

694
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,380
Ahjumma, where is Yoo Na?

695
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:02,130
 When you miss Mom, use this to call Unni Bong Yi. 

696
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:08,160
   

697
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,060
It wasn't me.

698
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:15,440
It was Yoo Na from the beginning. 
    

699
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:20,800
Hello?

700
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,800
Yes, this is 52 Anshin-dong.

701
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,360
Please come quickly!  Kang Duk Su has taken a child!

702
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:37,340
It can't be.  It can't be.  Please.

703
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,420
Not Yoo Na.

704
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,340
   

705
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,870
Why are you here at this time of night?

706
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:10,140
We got a report that a child went missing.

707
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:12,330
My child did?

708
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,170
She's sleeping right there.

709
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:19,500
Who made a freaking prank call?

710
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:24,720
No.

711
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:43,860
Take Yoo Na.

712
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,700
Please.

713
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,250
Sa-Save her.

714
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,470
Yoo Na. Yoo Na.

715
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:53,700
Take... Yoo Na.

716
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:15,000
 You should listen to me, Jung Ba Reum. 

717
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:28,100
 If you don't, in the end... starting with your family and the people you love, 

718
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,580
 you'll kill them. 

719
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:06,750
