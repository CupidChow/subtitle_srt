1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400


2
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,090
   

3
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,680
   

4
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,730
    
  There's a reason why I choose to take this route rather than the short cut. 

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,250
 Because no one takes this road. 

6
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,200
 I enjoy this time, where no one interrupts me. 

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,160
 Help me. 

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,900
 Help... me. 

9
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,160
 On that road, 

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,710
 Save me. 

11
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,990
 I saw a dying child. 

12
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,120
 Save me. 

13
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,740
 Irritation swept over me, 

14
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,980
 at the thought that I'd be interrupted while playing my game. 

15
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,190
 Stories related to that child came on the news throughout the evening. 

16
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,050
 And people cry as they watch the news. I wonder why they would need to. 

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,170
   

18
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,210
   

19
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,240
 What you said was right, doctor. 

20
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,710
 That if I didn't accept it, 

21
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,310
 I'd kill my family and my loved ones. 

22
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,400
 So? How do you feel? Are you distressed? 

23
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,950
 It was exhilarating. 

24
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,430
 Now I feel refreshed. 

25
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,930
  It's as if something that was weighing me down was suddenly released. 

26
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,770
Move.

27
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,070
Detective.

28
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,590
Sunbae, why are you so late?

29
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,950
I was just at the hospital...

30
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,820
Damn it.

31
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,770
Motherly instinct. How touching.

32
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:46,980
 Around 10:00 p.m. today, the body of a woman in her 70s who hung herself on a tree, on a trail in Ino Park, was found.  

33
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,800
 At the time of discovery, she was severely bruised all over her body. 

34
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,850
 Police identified her due to a handwritten suicide note found at the scene. 
   

35
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,530
 That's when I realized, 

36
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:09,890
 that the suicide note that I'd seen wasn't written by Kang Duk Su, but his mom.  
    

37
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,740
 That look in her eyes was resentment for me. 

38
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,380
 At that moment I was out of my mind so I didn't realize it. 

39
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,460
 I thought about it. Why did she try to kill her son? 

40
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,560
 It was the last thing she could do 

41
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,530
 in order to stop her son from committing yet another crime. 

42
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,070
 Once a psychopathic predator to this degree 

43
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,660
 commits a crime, he will commit the same kind of crime again, no matter what. 

44
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,240
Bong Yi...

45
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,110
 Yoo Na... 

46
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,070
 Please... don't kill me! 

47
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,980
 Don't kill me. 

48
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,970
 Don't kill me. 

49
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,080
 Someone... please... 

50
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,750
   

51
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,900
Hey, what's that?

52
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,580
Oh, the forensics team hasn't come yet so I just left it as it was.

53
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,100
Sunbae.

54
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,150
Hoon Seok, get up. Get up now.

55
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,460
How could you come here without even telling me?

56
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,630
Do you know how much I looked for you all night long?

57
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,870
Aunt, aunt, aunt, it wasn't Hoon Seok's fault. I brought him here.

58
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,930
Since you had left your phone behind, I had left a note on the fridge. I guess you weren't able to see it.

59
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,700
- I'm sorry, aunt. 
 - Let's go quickly.

60
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,190
Aunt.

61
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,900
Hoon Seok.

62
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,210
Hoon Seok, I'm sorry.

63
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,430
Put your shoes on. Quick.

64
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
I'm sorry, aunt.

65
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,530
 This is really driving me nuts. 

66
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,940
 I truly don't remember. 

67
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,440
 I lied. I didn't drink. 

68
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,940
 Please don't kill me. I won't... 

69
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,930
 I won't do something like that ever again. 

70
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,350
 Even if you wanted to do that now, you wouldn't be able to. 

71
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:32,630
 This is the knife that Elder kept sharpening over and over again, as she waited for your release from prison for 10 years. 

72
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,700
 But if it's too sharp, it's no fun. 

73
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,500
 So I nicked it a little before bringing it here. 

74
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,490
 I really am not such human trash. 

75
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,350
 If this is true, you can completely cut off my you-know-what. 

76
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:59,870
 If a man harms his neighbor, what he did must be inflicted upon him. 

77
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,640
 An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. 

78
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,920
 Why am I feeling déjà vu from that case? 

79
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,110
This guy is a psychopath.

80
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,840
A bastard like Seong Yo Han has appeared.

81
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,730
Eat. You're hungry.

82
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,610
 Jung Ba Reum, when your feelings come back, 

83
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,940
 a great sense of guilt will come. 

84
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,210
 It will be very painful. 

85
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,940
I'm sorry.

86
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,180
I'm really sorry.

87
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,730
 Kang Duk Su has been murdered. 

88
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,930
 At the scene where the case from 12 years ago occurred,  
    

89
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,720
 An important body part was found to be amputated. 

90
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,140
How could he do this to her?

91
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,150
A child in that neighborhood was the target.

92
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,720
She held out until the very end to stop the child from being dragged away.

93
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,530
If you were going to protect Bong Yi, you should've stayed by her side until the end instead of chasing Kang Duk Su.

94
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,320
- Please forget about Han Seo Joon and– 
 - Who are you to tell me this and that?

95
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,480
- It's not that I don't understand how you feel– 
 - Do you? Do you know how I feel?

96
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,520
I'm sorry. I didn't answer the phone.

97
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,650
I didn't hear the ringtone.

98
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,340
Did you see Bong Yi?

99
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,950
Not yet...

100
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,330
You will be very upset when you see her.

101
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,590
What's wrong?

102
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,260
I don't know.

103
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,580
I also don't know...

104
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,380
 What are you thinking so hard about? 

105
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,560
 I'm sad. 

106
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,250
 The sunlight is going through the leaves. 

107
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,020
I'll be going first.

108
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:26,350
 She held out until the very end to stop the child from being dragged away. 

109
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,840
Ajusshi is sorry. I'm sorry.

110
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,400
My gosh.

111
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,890
Ah, you scared me.

112
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,480
I'll stay here, so you can go.

113
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,400
I got it.

114
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,950
I got it. Let go.

115
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,940
I said let go.

116
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,750
Oh, that punk, his strength is like the Hulk.

117
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,540
No way Officer Jung. Are you jealous of me?

118
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,750
But this punk.

119
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,590
- Yes, Team Leader? 
  - Where are you? Hurry and come here. 

120
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,100
 Ms. B, who was seriously injured while fighting Kang Duk Su to save Ms. A, 

121
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,390
 was found to be the victim of Kang Duk Su case 12 years ago.  
    

122
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,760
 The police department's complacent response, despite her report to the police, has angered many. 

123
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,130
 Given the gravity of the case, 

124
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,860
 the police have decided to set up a special team to investigate. 

125
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,570
 Ah, how creepy. 

126
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,820
No wonder, the baby seemed unusual.

127
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,760
Once she starts crying, she doesn't stop. 
      

128
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,350
You came Choi PD?

129
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,320
Yes. I'll watch her. You can go home and rest.

130
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,570
Oh? Oh, okay.

131
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,480
I'm sorry, Eun Chong.

132
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,350
I'm sorry, baby.

133
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,560
Oh, thank you.

134
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,400
You guys did great.

135
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,110
One threw the keys to get him off the force.

136
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,740
And the other took those keys, opened the cell door and ran away.

137
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,090
That's why, if you became the Team Leader for the Special Investigation Team then you should have brought me in.

138
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,450
You only brought these two.

139
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,850
You even brought Detective Lee and excluded me. How disappointing.

140
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,300
Hey, if Kang Duk Su's mom didn't bring this then not only would your police career have ended,

141
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,570
you would've gone to jail, you bastard.

142
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,870
It seems like she brought this and immediately hung herself afterward.

143
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,120
Now that I think about it, it seemed like her leg was injured and she had a bruise.

144
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,880
It seems like Kang Duk Su hit her.

145
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,790
How could he hit his own mom? Seriously, he's a crazy bastard.

146
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,280
That's why Parachute, you should have brought this immediately. Why did you bring this so late and make things so complicated?

147
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,710
Late? What do you mean late? I gave this to Detective Lee immediately.

148
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,250
But, that bastard gave it to Team Leader late.

149
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,220
Ah, I don't trust that jerk either. That's why you should hurry up and put me on the Special Investigation Team.

150
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,740
From the contents of the note,

151
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,210
it looks like she died by suicide because she knew Kang Duk Su was targeting someone.

152
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,790
She must've thought that if he finds out she died by suicide because of him, he would stop committing crimes out of guilt.

153
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,190
From a mother's point of view, it seems like that was the best.

154
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,960
But those kinds of humans don’t feel any guilt.

155
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,930
Hey, that's that. What were you doing last night from this morning that we couldn't contact you?

156
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,790
Answer properly. If you don't, you're the first suspect in Kang Duk Su's murder.

157
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,460
I was robbed.

158
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,030
Robbed?

159
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,770
Bong Yi!

160
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,820
Are you awake?

161
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,640
Oh. Ah!

162
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,730
- Lay down. Lay down. 
 - Yoo Na. What about Yoo Na?

163
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,820
Don't worry. She didn't get hurt anywhere

164
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,210
and she's at home with her mom.

165
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,980
Ah... What about Mu Chi Ajusshi?

166
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,680
I don't know.

167
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,400
Ah, Kang Duk Su. He died.

168
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,080
Did you know?

169
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,930
Oh, no.

170
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,670
How would I know? I just found out now.

171
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,870
Ah, I'm telling the truth! When I opened my eyes, my wallet was gone!

172
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,490
Who would rob you like that?

173
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,510
It's not like your car is some foreign car. It's just a junk car.

174
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,950
That's true. It's not like you were followed and hit from behind.

175
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,220
On the other side, it was raining and a truck came to my side.

176
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,620
I reacted and immediately turned left, but there were trees right in front of me!

177
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,640
So I turned right and then spun two times.

178
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,610
Oh, you guys don't believe me. Go confirm the CCTV.

179
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,740
Confirm it. I also need to find my wallet. My one and only family photo is in it.

180
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,480
- Okay, go. 
 - Hurry up and confirm it.

181
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,980
Just go. Don't act rashly. You're a suspect.

182
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,250
I also wish I were the criminal!

183
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,780
I should have killed that bastard, Kang Duk Su, with my own hands!

184
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,450
I am regretting that it got taken away from me by some other punk!

185
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,050
Sunbae, it's not him, right?

186
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:02,390
It's not him. He's someone who would say he killed him even though he didn't.

187
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,150
But he's not the kind of guy who would say he didn't kill him when he actually did.

188
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,940
- Mu Chi said the suspect is a psychopath, right? 
 - Yes.

189
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,910
He said a punk like Seong Yo Han appeared.

190
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,850
If that's true, Mu Chi will try to catch that psychopath and kill him.

191
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,990
That's why we need to catch him before Mu Chi does. Got it?

192
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,010
Yes.

193
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,080
What kind of bastard steals Go Mu Chi's wallet?

194
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,630
This thief bastard.

195
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,410
 Who would rob you like that? 

196
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,090
 It's not like your car is some foreign car. It's just a junk car. 

197
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,370
 It's not like you were followed and hit from behind. 

198
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,060
That's true.

199
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,760
It's weird.

200
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,150
   

201
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,690
OZ.

202
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,600
Hey! Why did you bring the statement late and make me hear Parachute, Parachute?

203
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,870
- You should've done it yourself then. 
 - What?

204
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,960
Blinded by appearing on the broadcast...

205
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,780
Look at the way this bastard talks.

206
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,330
There's something else you probably forgot about too, huh?

207
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,720
Aish. Forget it.

208
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,490
It's an unregistered vehicle? Aish, okay.

209
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:46,270
Ah, how can I find it then? My one and only family photo.

210
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,080
Ah, I'm glad that I have this.

211
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,730
   

212
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,910
 It's been a day since Kang Duk Su was murdered. 

213
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,330
 In the midst of not catching the suspect, 

214
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,320
 there is a surge of public opinion demanding the withdrawal of the Special Investigation Team for the murder case. 

215
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,090
 Meanwhile, during the investigation of Kang Duk Su's murder, 

216
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,400
 It's known that a Blue House petition has even appeared.  
    

217
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
You're already here.

218
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,780
Is something happening outside? The atmosphere is a little...

219
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,990
How is Bong Yi?

220
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,920
Ah, yes. She got much better.

221
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,260
But, what are you looking at?

222
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,010
We have to catch the bastard who killed Kang Duk Su.

223
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,080
It seems like the entire country doesn't want to catch him.

224
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,080
They are mistaken, thinking that a dark hero has appeared.

225
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,320
Not even knowing his identity.

226
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,790
His identity?

227
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,730
A psychopath.

228
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,150
He's a bastard like Seong Yo Han.

229
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,900
There are a few more things I need to confirm.

230
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,690
Hey, Parachute. Are you guys going to bring the evidence?

231
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,550
How long has it been since the incident happened?

232
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,050
Hey, you bastard. You. You are too much.

233
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,290
You think I'll let you off even if the president comes?

234
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,630
Hurry, hurry and... Hello?

235
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,860
Ah, this bastard hung up?

236
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,310
Just see if I vote for your dad.

237
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,570
Follow me with an empty box.

238
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,670
Yes.

239
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,810
Didn't you know the on-site evidence is sent directly to the Evidence Storage Team?

240
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,390
I'm sorry.

241
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,860
Hey, did the President really come?

242
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,600
I told you.

243
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,320
Hey, it's my first time seeing him in real life.

244
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,330
He came here in the middle of jogging because this case has the attention of the entire country.

245
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,080
Yes, this is the photo of Kim Yoo Na from Kang Duk Su's phone.

246
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,460
This photo is from the day after Kang Duk Su returns to his mother's house.

247
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,810
From then on, it is believed that he planned a crime against Kim Yoo Na.

248
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,540
Has this suspect been specified?

249
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,280
Yes.

250
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,330
The wound near the back neck of Kang Duk Su is a taser mark.

251
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,320
If the taser doesn't touch the flesh properly and misses,

252
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,980
a small burn mark like this will remain.

253
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,610
If the taser missed,

254
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,950
it means the suspect is more likely to be a woman.

255
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,600
Yes, that's right.

256
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,050
The fingerprints of Ms. Oh, a victim of Kang Duk Su 12 years ago, were found at the site.

257
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,420
I also got a statement from Detective Shin that he delivered a taser to Ms. Oh.

258
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,510
Because of that, this seems like a typical revenge murder–

259
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,930
What are you doing right now? Revenge murder?

260
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,410
That's not direct evidence of murder!

261
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,520
Yoo Na said that Bong Yi and Kang Duk Su got into a physical fight. He must've got hurt during that time.

262
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,670
Did you not see Bong Yi?

263
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,320
Was she in a state where she killed someone?

264
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,940
Stay still, Mu Chi.

265
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,300
Yes, here, here and here.

266
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,560
As you can see, the wounds on the body of Kang Duk Su are

267
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,470
the same as the wound that Kang Duk Su inflicted on the victim 12 years ago.

268
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,210
It is believed that it was reproduced at the time of the incident.

269
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,300
Stop fooling yourself. This is a typical psychopath crime.

270
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,000
- Ah, I told you to stay still. 
 - Psychopath?

271
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,570
- On what basis? 
 - Ah, yes.

272
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,600
I will tell you the basis.

273
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,540
Here. This wound. How will you explain this wound?

274
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,370
What do you mean how to explain?

275
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,950
This wound is also the same wound that was on the victim's body 12 years ago—

276
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:36,230
That's right. But other wounds are wounds that occurred before death while this wound happened after death.

277
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,280
This is where the artery passes.

278
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,810
If you're stabbed here, blood should be scattered, but it's not there.

279
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,660
It's a wound after the heart stops.

280
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,750
Don't speak informally.

281
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,360
That punk missed this wound.

282
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,300
After murdering him, he realized that he missed this wound and returned.

283
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,840
He returned and precisely re-wounded this spot.

284
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,220
Team Leader, show the picture of his thighs.

285
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,120
Now, if you look here, there are traces of burn marks from a lighter.

286
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,850
There are burn marks from a lighter.

287
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,550
Don't speak informally, Mu Chi.

288
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:14,560
If what you're saying is right, the victim from 12 years ago should have the same wound in the same position and place (informally) yo! (formally).

289
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,990
But 12 years ago, there were no signs of burn marks on the victim, right?

290
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,680
Why wouldn't there be any?

291
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,340
Why.

292
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,650
Why would he do that?

293
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,470
Yeah, why would he do that?

294
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:30,590
Now, if you look closely, there is a wound underneath this burn mark.

295
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,230
He left a wound by accident. A wound that shouldn't be there.

296
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,910
That's why he tried to get rid of the wound by burning it.

297
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,540
It's like erasing a wrong letter with an eraser.

298
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,210
C-Can you conclude that it's a psychopath with just this?

299
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,050
The psychopath Unabomber, who was famous for being a random bomber terrorist,

300
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:55,570
sent his writing to the press and police. If there was a wrong letter, he drew over it, over and over again,

301
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,370
until the back of the paper was pierced.

302
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,860
It's not because he wanted to fix his writing, but

303
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,570
he's trying to erase his own mistake.

304
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,580
That kind of psychopath is called a power control killer.

305
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,310
The punk who killed Kang Duk Su is like that.

306
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,610
He is a killer with an obsession in that he has to control everything. I'm certain.

307
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:18,750
This accidental cut was burned with fire and tried to get rid of because there was no wound on the victim from the beginning.

308
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,150
Because the wound wasn't there, on a replica,

309
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,420
he did not want to leave a single flaw.

310
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,850
In addition to this,

311
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,430
there are also large fractures inside that are not visible from the outside.

312
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,240
He was assaulted so he wouldn't bruise. All of the bones are broken.

313
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,300
 Try to target areas without blood vessels. That way there are no traces. 

314
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,260
Castration was even carried out while he was alive.

315
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,760
Now, all of these were sadistic acts to make Kang Duk Su suffer in a painful way.

316
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,790
Sadism is completely a psychopathic trait.

317
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:52,060
Therefore, this case isn't a revenge murder but a typical psychopathic crime.

318
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,250
- This– 
 - Then, how can the suspect copy the incident from 12 years ago?

319
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,000
Only the victim who is directly involved–

320
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,770
"The victim who is directly involved?"

321
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,720
The entire country knows. The entire country.

322
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,230
Those trashy media outlets who wanted to increase the number of sales and views,

323
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,090
revealed everything about the horrible case every day. Without even thinking about the child, not one little bit!

324
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,240
Even so, there were some things not released to the press.

325
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,060
Team Leader. These burn marks from a cigarette

326
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,030
were something only the members of the investigative team in charge knew about.

327
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,210
These are records that have not been posted online

328
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,520
and only retained on handwritten documents.

329
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,250
Ah, then what is it?

330
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,180
It could have been someone inside.

331
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,620
Hey, you...

332
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,780
Where is that handwritten file right now?

333
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,750
Ah, yes. It's in the evidence storage room.

334
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,640
Please check and see.

335
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,300
- Yes. 
 - Because I have an afternoon schedule, I will go now.

336
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,300
Are you candidate Shin's...

337
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,550
- Ah, yes. 
  - I received a call from my wife, saying that she's pregnant. 

338
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,260
 It is a child we've been waiting for 10 years. 

339
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,500
You have a great father.

340
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,440
His son must be like his father.

341
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,940
Thank you, sir.

342
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,890
You're our country's son, Officer Jung Ba Reum, right?

343
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,560
Yes. I am Jung Ba Reum from the Evidence Storage Team.

344
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,810
It is nice to meet you in a healthy state.

345
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,330
Thank you. It's because of you.

346
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,420
No matter how deserving of death, murder is a serious crime.

347
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,500
Acts that break the law can never be justified.

348
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,040
I will trust in you guys.

349
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,840
Catch the criminal as soon as possible and let's show the strength of governmental power.

350
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,180
Sunbae, we...

351
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,550
Can we check the CCTV for the Evidence Storage room?

352
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,140
What's wrong?

353
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,970
There's nothing special.

354
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:02,220
Inside? Who are you to talk about an insider in front of the president?

355
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,460
Look up Oh Bong Yi's credit card statement and communication records

356
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,070
from the night before and the day of Kang Duk Su's death.

357
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,690
Card statement.

358
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:16,350
No one knows about the wound except the detective in charge or the doctor.

359
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,620
Is it really Oh Bong Yi? That can't be the case.

360
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,980
What if it's her?

361
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,470
If Oh Bong Yi was the one who killed him, are you going to let her go?

362
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,840
Are you going to leave her to get caught?

363
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,860
No... It can't be her because she's pitiful. Her life...

364
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,730
Then move first before the Special Investigation Team makes their move.

365
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:40,510
What are you doing? You should go help him. I'll clean up here.

366
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,230
Ah, yes.

367
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:48,110
It's withdrawal symptoms because I quit drinking.

368
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,290
Ah, I committed a great sin to Bong Yi.

369
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,340
I am really sorry to Bong Yi.

370
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,540
I finally decided to quit drinking.

371
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,840
Give it to me. I'll peel it.

372
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:06,010
I did read everything you told the female police officer, but I came here because there is something I'm curious about.

373
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,650
Is it okay if I ask you a few more questions?

374
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,440
- I will be recording this. 
 - Yes.

375
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,380
You said there were a pair of shoes where you were hiding, right?

376
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,770
Can you tell me more about them?

377
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,560
 Please don't kill me. 

378
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,860
 That's when I heard some strange noise. 

379
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:51,050
 I was in a rush so I went inside the cabinet. 

380
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:06,230
And someone locked the doors? But why didn't you scream? It could have been Kang Duk Su.

381
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,800
It wasn't him.

382
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,180
You didn't see his face, though. How do you know that?

383
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,620
If it was that bad guy then he would have opened the doors and dragged me out. He wouldn't have locked them.

384
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,210
How smart of you, Yoo Na. Good job.

385
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,590
And then?

386
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:30,400
And then, I was really scared so I just stayed still.

387
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,510
 I didn't know how much time had passed. 

388
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,540
 Then I heard the door opening. 

389
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:43,240
 But I was too scared so I couldn't go out. 

390
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,400
And the shoes were right there?

391
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,700
Oh, a plate...

392
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,000
I'll go get one.

393
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,690
Think about it carefully.

394
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,850
But, actually...

395
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,430
Why? Do you have something else to tell me?

396
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,290
What? Me?

397
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,980
No. I don't.

398
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,160
Mom, I'm sleepy.

399
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,520
Alright.

400
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,360
She's tired. Let's stop here.

401
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,200
I'll need to put her to bed.

402
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,030
Yes.

403
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,830
It's weird, right?

404
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:42,350
What? Oh, yes.

405
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:47,040
For a psychopath to save a child like that, and be kind enough to leave behind shoes.

406
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,270
It doesn't make sense.

407
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,570
So was it really Bong Yi who killed him?

408
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,640
Yeah?

409
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,770
What?

410
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,970
What is it? Detective!

411
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:16,630
A knife purchase is listed on the card statement, so I went to the store you brought it from and checked.

412
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,180
According to what the owner testified–

413
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,480
What are you doing right now?

414
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,200
Why are you interrogating her when she's so hurt?

415
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,680
- I told you. It's not Bong Yi! 
 - Get him out of here.

416
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,580
- Hyeong! 
 - Get out.

417
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,720
Hey, Bong Yi! It isn't you, right?

418
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,400
Let go of me. Tell him it's not you. Okay?

419
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,040
You... You didn't kill him.

420
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,380
Bong Yi!

421
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,040
Bong Yi!

422
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,000
Let go!

423
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,390
 Why isn't Bong Yi saying she didn't do it? 

424
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,410
 Why is she keeping her mouth shut? 

425
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,580
- Detective. 
 - I think it was Bong Yi.

426
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,420
What?

427
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,890
For now, let's just get rid of any evidence that Bong Yi might have left behind.

428
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,980
It's over for her if she confesses. Let's make it quick.

429
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,390
Why?

430
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,910
- Huh? 
 - Why are you going that far for Bong Yi?

431
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,330
It's not like she's your little sister.

432
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:11,410
If you were in my place, you would've thought the same.

433
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,140
Bong Yi has had it very hard. Her grandmother died, too.

434
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,430
After going through all that, Bong Yi has a right to be happy.

435
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:23,240
Even if Bong Yi did actually kill Kang Duk Su, I will back that choice.

436
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,510
If you don't like that, then you can opt out.

437
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:33,410
No. I'm going to do this with you.

438
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,550
Then, I'll go meet the person who filed the report. You meet Choi Hong Ju.

439
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,380
Make sure she doesn't catch on. Be smart.

440
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,590
It was around midnight, I had grabbed a drink with my friend and on my way home.

441
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,470
No matter how many times I called you, you wouldn't pick up.

442
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,050
Detective Go was in jail, so he couldn't pick up the phone.

443
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:57,130
I went to Bong Yi's house but she wasn't there, so as I was looking for her. I ended up below the bridge.

444
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,870
That's where I found her and took her to the hospital.

445
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:08,170
I was about to cross the bridge when a car without any headlights came all of a sudden.

446
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:11,170
As I was avoiding that car, my bicycle rolled down to the bridge.

447
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:15,040
 Hey! Watch where you're going! 

448
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:30,210
For some reason I had a weird feeling about it, so I came here again in the morning.

449
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,390
Then maybe, did you see something else?

450
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,200
No.

451
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,190
Okay.

452
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:04,440
 I didn't know how much time had passed. Then I heard the door opening. 

453
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,140
 For a psychopath to save a child like that, and be kind enough to leave behind shoes. 

454
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,260
 Hey, Bong Yi! It isn't you, right? 

455
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,910
 Tell him it wasn't you. 

456
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,510
 You... You didn't kill him. 

457
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,480
 Bong Yi! 

458
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,280
Those are drag marks.

459
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,750
Officer Jung, I figured it out.

460
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,510
How Kang Duk Su was murdered.

461
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,900
Yoo Na said she heard some noise, and while Kang Duk Su was looking back, she picked up the dirt and threw it at him.

462
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,750
So, the killer must have made that sound, right?

463
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,210
The guy who killed Kang Duk Su.

464
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,420
When Yoo Na went inside this cabinet, the killer locked its doors.

465
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,410
So that Yoo Na couldn't come out.

466
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,140
Now, look here. Right here.

467
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,650
He moved this tube.

468
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,740
And then he finished all of his preparations and waited above this bridge.

469
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,160
For Kang Duk Su to show up.

470
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,030
 Where did you go? 

471
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,980
 Where did you go? 

472
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,970
You're telling me that Oh Bong Yi pulled Kang Duk Su from here to the top of the bridge with a broken rib and wrist?

473
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,410
Oh Bong Yi, who's 50kg, could have done that to Kang Duk Su who is 70kg?

474
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,960
The killer is a strong, sturdy man in his 20's or 30's.

475
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,120
Take a look here. You see traces of him being pulled, right?

476
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,960
He tied him up and pulled him right here.

477
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,440
Do you still think it's Oh Bong Yi? That poor child?

478
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,210
It's alright now. 
    

479
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,870
Those detectives won't bother you anymore.

480
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,890
Thank you, Ahjusshi.

481
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:13,940
Why are you thanking me? They were suspicious of an innocent person for no reason.

482
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,220
You should rest.

483
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,180
Rest up.

484
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,530
 Don't! 

485
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,270
 Yoo Na! 

486
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,550
 Yoo Na. 

487
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,090
 Yoo Na? 

488
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,580
 Ahjussi! 

489
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,330
 This morning, the President unexpectedly visited the Mujin Police headquarters, whose special investigation team is investigating Kang Duk Su's case. 

490
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:24,960
 Due to the President's unexpected visit, the Special Investigation Team held a briefing about Kang Duk Su's case. 

491
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,560
 The President ordered a strict investigation while encouraging the detectives in charge. 

492
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,950
 I definitely put it here. 

493
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:00,330
   

494
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,670
 It's the fee for a murder. 

495
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:14,040
 A kid asked me to kill the bastard. 

496
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,380
 I'll take this. 

497
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,200
 It's my commission fee. 

498
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:26,430
Where did I drop it?

499
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,460
 Yes, the sound I heard... 

500
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,680
This one's for Officer Jung. But where has everyone gone?

501
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,550
What are you so excited about?

502
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:39,460
Bong Yi was cleared of the charges. That's a good thing.

503
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:44,070
Speaking of which, don't Bong Yi and Da Seul look alike?

504
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:47,830
Really? It seems so.

505
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,460
But my Da Seul is even prettier.

506
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,990
Where has Officer Jung gone?

507
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,590
I came to give him the wedding invitation. Does he know we're not receiving wedding gifts?

508
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:59,490
He knows. After all, it's the son of a presidential candidate's wedding.

509
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,560
I had no choice. I wanted to wait a little more,

510
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,190
but she said she wouldn't marry with a big belly.

511
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,810
Sunbae, this. Look at this!

512
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,960
Our lucky charm!

513
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,640
Just looking at her, I'm sure she'll be a "paepi." 
  (T/N: Korean slang for a fashionista) .

514
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,090
Paepi? What's that?

515
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,190
You're so outdated. Do you know what you are?

516
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:25,170
- Paete. A paete. 
 - Paete?

517
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:27,250
A fashion terrorist.

518
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:31,620
I wish for my child to be as pretty as this one.

519
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,220
But, why are you watching Yoo Na's statement?

520
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,910
Don't meddle in our case.

521
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,670
Actually, I don't want to catch the criminal.

522
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:43,580
Out of all people, I bet she would not want us to catch him the most.

523
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,830
That's weird. Why does it seem Yoo Na is lying?

524
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,090
- What? 
 - Well, look.

525
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,260
She keeps covering her mouth with her hands.

526
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,160
It's something done when lying.

527
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,230
And her gaze keeps looking at her upper right.

528
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:02,150
It's a behavior that children do when lying or scheming.

529
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:06,560
- Really? 
 - Yes. I told you many times I was a child psychology major.

530
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,980
- Then touching the nose– 
 - It's also a reaction that comes from lying.

531
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:14,860
When lying, catecholamines are secreted and then your nose starts to itch.

532
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:18,320
It seems Yoo Na saw something.

533
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,260
S-She saw what?

534
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,450
You saw something, right?

535
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,340
Don't worry. As a policeman, I'm going to protect you.

536
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,640
Policeman?

537
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,820
Yeah.

538
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,720
Yoo Na definitely saw something, but she won't talk about it.

539
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,350
Go to Bong Yi. She's the only one that can make Yoo Na talk.

540
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,730
I'll stay with Yoo Na because it can be dangerous.

541
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:48,020
- Yoo Na? 
 - Yes, it seems she saw something.

542
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,440
But she won't say anything.

543
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:56,170
Sunbae said that when he said he would protect her as a policeman, she kept her lips closed even tighter.

544
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,290
- Really? 
 - Aigoo.

545
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,020
 Did she see Ahjussi? 

546
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,630
 She must have seen me. 

547
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:06,260
 Yoo Na. You must not open your mouth. 

548
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,790
You are the only one who can persuade Yoo Na to talk.

549
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:14,650
Right. I'll meet her. I'm sure she'll tell me everything.

550
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:16,390
Then I'll bring her.

551
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,510
Let's go see Yoo Na.

552
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,890
The doctor said you could leave the hospital.

553
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,110
Oh, that's better. I'll go see her.

554
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,700
- So I'll report this to Sunbae. 
 - Right.

555
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,570
Wait for a little while. I'll solve the discharge procedure as fast as possible.

556
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,980
Right.

557
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,900
 What the hell did you see? There's no way she would have seen my face. 

558
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:49,900
 What the hell? She will tell Bong Yi everything. 

559
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:56,310
 I have to stop her from meeting Yoo Na. 

560
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:01,540
Yeah, what is it? I sent all the evidence.

561
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,340
Oh, it's that...

562
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,840
The clothes Bong Yi wore to the hospital

563
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:12,080
- are different from the registered ones in PD Choi's black box. 
 - Clothes?

564
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,110
I discovered it by accident while organizing the evidence.

565
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:18,080
Look. They're different.

566
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,770
Wait a moment.

567
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,360
What is this?

568
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,150
I found the murder weapon.

569
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:42,190
Oh, Bong Yi. There are many procedures for hospital discharge.

570
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,310
I'm almost done.

571
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,330
Hello, is this Jo Mi Jeong's mom?

572
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,450
I'm calling because

573
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:01,300
we'd like to do an interview for the Mujin serial murder case.

574
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:06,010
 I'm taking Eun Chong for a little walk! 

575
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,820
Nanny! Nanny!

576
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,880
I'll do it.

577
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:37,220
PD Choi Hong Ju.

578
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,640
- Where did you hide them? 
 - Hide what?

579
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,910
Oh Bong Yi's clothes. She changed into pricey clothes in the hospital's parking lot.

580
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:49,080
The clothes are similar so everyone overlooked them.

581
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:54,310
The clothes covered with Kang Duk Su's blood and this knife she was holding, where did you hide them?

582
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,990
 Miss Bong Yi! 

583
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,060
 Are you all right? 

584
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,560
Bring them. You know how serious of a crime it is to destroy evidence, right?

585
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,070
The sentence  is up to 5 years of imprisonment.

586
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,600
Would you like this child to grow without a mother?

587
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:26,960
Miss Bong Yi, would you go to the police station for a bit?

588
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:32,850
How many times do I have to tell you that it's not Bong Yi?!

589
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:38,070
There was a lot of Kang Duk Su's blood found on Miss Oh Bong Yi's clothes and the knife she purchased.

590
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:50,120
Yoo Na, mom will go buy some trash bags so put these books in

591
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,320
and put the newspapers down, okay?

592
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,160
Yes.

593
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,360
Are you moving?

594
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,450
Yes.

595
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:20,230
The reporters keep coming by so mom says it's bothersome.

596
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:23,750
Then, I will help you.

597
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:28,810
Yoo Na, I heard that you saw something that day, is that right?

598
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,000
What did you see?

599
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,950
It was you, right ahjussi?

600
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,020
I saw this

601
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,140
when you locked the door.

602
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,150
In the end, Seong Yo Han

603
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:56,270
will completely take over my brain, won't he?

604
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:02,040
What should I do then?

605
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,810
How would I handle it?

606
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:08,870
I am scared.

607
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,030
I am scared.

608
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:12,150
What are you doing here?

609
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,420
You must be like this because you are upset about Miss Bong Yi, right?

610
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,390
I am scared.

611
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,500
I am scared.

612
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:37,950
 I am scared.  I am scared. 

613
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:26,600
What is this?  Where did they go?

614
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:37,770
Yeah.

615
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:40,920
What?

616
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,150
They are right, aren't they?

617
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:47,180
But why did you contact me first?

618
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:50,760
Because just in case Miss Bong Yi's DNA or fingerprints are found on them.

619
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,570
What?

620
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:57,140
To be honest, even if  Bong Yi killed Kang Duk Su, I don't think she should be punished.

621
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,270
"Parachute" kids even posted 1,000 comments.

622
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:11,040
Here you go.

623
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,680
What is this?

624
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:26,750
Detective, Bong Yi got released?

625
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:37,350
Oppa! Ahjussi!

626
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:39,820
You went through a lot.

627
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,350
- Let's go.  Let's go eat something. 
 - Sure.

628
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:45,680
Hurry up!

629
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,190
I am sorry.  It couldn't be helped.

630
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,170
I have a kid.

631
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:04,250
If anything were to happen to me,

632
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:09,210
I don't have any family members or friends who can take care of my child.

633
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,750
I understand.

634
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:19,410
The thing that I asked you separately...

635
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,890
Here.

636
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:36,690
Do you think I killed him?

637
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,360
At first, I did.

638
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,470
That's why I hid the knife, and your clothes too.

639
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:46,460
But, I got to know that you didn't.

640
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:50,590
How did you know

641
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,990
that I am not the culprit?

642
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,380
Just...

643
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:58,820
I just knew.

644
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:04,690
Get some rest.

645
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:09,890
Thank you...

646
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,970
for leaving him alone.

647
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:09,210
 H... Help, help me. 

648
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,060
He deserves to die, doesn't he?

649
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:35,160
Why aren't you getting out?

650
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:48,310
Aren't you curious as to why Bong Yi got released?

651
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,140
- You are not asking, I see. 
 - Oh...

652
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:59,400
How did Bong Yi...

653
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,740
Detective Shin found the crime weapon, right here.

654
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:07,400
Not Bong Yi's knife, but the real crime weapon.

655
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:11,830
It seems that the culprit wrapped it in a raincoat and threw it out.

656
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:13,150
You know how it rained a lot that day, right?

657
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:17,350
He probably thought that because of the strong currents it would be carried far away.

658
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:21,720
But, because our awesome God helped, it got caught here

659
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,430
and it was found.

660
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:26,550
From the knife and Kang Duk Su's clothing that was wrapped around the knife,

661
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:30,030
not only Kang Duk Su's DNA, but also someone else's DNA were found.

662
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:33,700
Bong Yi was released because that DNA was not hers.

663
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:38,330
It seems that the culprit was injured while stabbing Kang Duk Su as well.

664
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:54,030
But, a totally incomprehensible result came out.

665
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,200
I am confused

666
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:03,630
as to how to accept this situation.

667
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:33,820


668
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,000
   

669
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,540
 Inside your brain, Jung Ba Reum and Seong Yo Han are still fiercely fighting. 

670
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,990
 But for now, good instincts are repressing the predatory instincts. 

671
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:58,620
 What do you think about the Suseong serial killings? 

672
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,430
 Officer Jung likes you a lot. 

673
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:04,160
 Let's have you be happy now. 

674
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,420
 Before Seong Yo Han's instincts wake up, preparations need to be made. 

675
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:10,520
 - The owner of the blue toothbrush— 
 - Is he the next target? 

676
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,070
 What happened? 

677
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:15,170
 Detective Go Mu Chi is a predator?
