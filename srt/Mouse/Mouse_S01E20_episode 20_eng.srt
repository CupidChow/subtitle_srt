1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:10,780


2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,300
   

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,930
   

4
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,970
How come you're here...

5
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,420
Not long ago, Doctor Daniel had requested me to kill somebody.

6
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,460
 Your next target. 

7
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,190
 You can consider this person to be the worst kind of predator there is out there. 

8
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,080
The address he gave me was here.

9
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,270
As expected, you have a good memory.

10
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,580
It must be true that you have both the predator and the genius gene.

11
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,640
What's the reason why you visited?

12
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,640
Were Seong Yo Han and I your lab rats?

13
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,510
Oh right, I should first thank you.

14
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,640
Thank you for being a great killer,

15
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,440
Jung Ba Reum.

16
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,100
Unfortunately, Seong Yo Han disappointed me.

17
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,830
If only the bill for forced abortion of fetuses with the psychopath gene was passed at that time.

18
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,480
No, I thought maybe it was a blessing in disguise that the bill was dismissed.

19
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,450
If it had passed the committee, it would have been dismissed at the plenary session.

20
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,360
To make sure it passes,

21
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,150
I thought I needed a long-term plan.

22
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,630
A long-term plan?

23
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,140
That's why you ask Daniel...

24
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,050
I asked him to hand over a list of fetuses with the psychopath gene.

25
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,770
It was at the same time Daniel was in shock after Han Seo Joon murdered his sister,

26
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,310
so it wasn't difficult to persuade him.

27
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,180
 Is this right? 

28
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,870
 I'm not sure either. 

29
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,600
 But Daniel, a Utopia without war and crime 

30
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,630
 doesn't come by itself. 

31
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,950
 We have to create it. 

32
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,750
 Think about Jennifer's death. 

33
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,440
 Let's make it so there isn't any other victims, a second Jennifer. 

34
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,380
 So if we really grew up as murders, 

35
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,990
 it was a long-term plan to pass the abolished bill again. 
   

36
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,070
So within the National Intelligence Service (NIS),

37
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,990
you even set up your own private organization.

38
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,750
That's right.

39
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,090
I've been watching the ones from the list since they were fetuses,

40
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,290
so that they would be born well and alive.

41
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,060
 Make sure to give birth to that child. 

42
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,140
After the two children were born, I put agents on them to observe every single move.

43
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,270
They would protect the observed child

44
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,320
and a group of experts analyzed every single one of their behaviors.

45
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,600
That's why you ordered Song Soo Ho to kill my mother who tried to kill me

46
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,080
then kill my whole family?

47
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,710
It was a mistake. Song Soo Ho suffered a lot because of that incident.

48
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,220
But it couldn't be helped.

49
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,160
There will be problems with the experiment if you die.

50
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,400
How could you use a victim's family?

51
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,560
Are you human?

52
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,260
I just enlightened you to imagine the same world.

53
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,400
A world where there are no more victims nor bereaved families, not ever again.

54
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,960
A world without crime.

55
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,860
Why were you just watching when I was killing psychopath criminals?

56
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,420
Of course, I was taken back at first because this wasn't it.

57
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,100
However, I changed my mind when people treated you as a hero.

58
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,400
The people who treated you as a hero and an Apostle of Justice.

59
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,380
When they find out who you really are,

60
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,650
that anger would be even more intense.

61
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,290
Then it will be much easier to pass the bill.

62
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,010
Using the pitiful victim families

63
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,550
and killing innocent people.

64
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,640
You are a monster just like me, Choi Young Shin.

65
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,130
My essence is a scientist, a geneticist.

66
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,940
Only science can solve the world's crime.

67
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,380
Eliminating potential killers before they are even born.

68
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,320
My ultimate goal is to reach a peaceful Utopia

69
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,280
without murder and civil war.

70
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,380
In the world I dream of,

71
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,910
a psychopath criminal like you shouldn't exist.

72
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,600
I'm going to get rid of them, from their roots.

73
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,540
That's right, kill me.

74
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,830
I have to be miserably killed by you

75
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,210
in order for the world I dream of to come true.

76
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,520
Psychopath genes are spreading rapidly as society evolves.

77
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,920
A time will come when people with the psychopath gene

78
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,700
will annihilate ordinary humans.

79
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,250
Before such a terrifying world comes,

80
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,030
we have to completely get rid of people with the psychopath gene.

81
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,690
Kill me. Kill me!

82
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,270
What is this place?

83
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,940
Whose house is this?

84
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,410
What is this? Is it a villa?

85
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,200
Song Soo Ho.

86
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,460
Detective Lee.

87
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,100
What is this?

88
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,930
Laptop. It's because of that laptop that he died.

89
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,950
Then the guy who killed Detective Shin is here...

90
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,110
Kill me. Hurry and kill me!

91
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,130
You may have

92
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,990
kneeled in front of Han Seo Joon because of me, but because of that surgery

93
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,540
a guy like me got feelings.

94
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,010
Your lab rat

95
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,120
is no longer capable of killing someone.

96
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,500
No.

97
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,900
Kill me. Hurry and kill me!

98
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,770
Hurry and kill me!

99
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,250
That way, everyone can live in a safe and peaceful world.

100
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,640
Kill me! Hurry and kill me! Kill me!

101
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,900
You are also a pitiful human.

102
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,710
Jung Ba Reum, this bastard.

103
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,040
 You have a message. 

104
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,660
 Ajusshi, I'm going to kill the guy who killed grandma. 

105
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,880
 I'll get revenge for Father, too. 

106
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,770
Damn, Oh Bong Yi!

107
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,780
Aunt?

108
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,300
No, why are you here...

109
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,440
Jung Ba Reum. Where is Jung Ba Reum?

110
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,090
Calm down. Ba Reum is doing this for your safety.

111
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,190
Safety?

112
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,620
You will know soon.

113
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,040
 Will Bong Yi be dragged and found as a corpse 

114
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,950
 or will she be dropped off at the destination safely? 

115
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,500
 I think they will take Bong Yi as hostage. 

116
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,300
 Until I'm done, 

117
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,990
 please make sure Bong Yi doesn't get out of here. 

118
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,350
Please take care of the rest.

119
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,910
Ba Reum.

120
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,160
You are

121
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,090
no longer that person from the past.

122
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,970
Seeing how you are restraining from killing Choi Young Shin.

123
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,880
Even so, nothing changes.

124
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,230
Jung Ba Reum! Jung Ba Reum!

125
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,960
Hyung, can you track Oh Bong Yi's phone?

126
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,420
In here...

127
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,230
Jung Ba Reum, that bastard...

128
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,800
 That plastic piece is indeed a part of the Goat Man's mask. 

129
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,750
 Kim Han Kook's DNA was found on it. 

130
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,510
It was Jung Ba Reum.

131
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,450
That bastard killed my brother!

132
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,830
 - Have you gone mad? 
 - Detective Go Mu Chi! 

133
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,620
 Detective Go! 

134
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,550
 Detective! 

135
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,390
 Let's have a drink. 

136
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:16,510
 I heard that you were a good person to my brother. 

137
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,140
 I want to be like a good brother to you, just like my brother did to me. 

138
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,370
Bong Yi...

139
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,240
You despicable jerk...

140
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,050
Did you have fun? Did you have the time of your life?

141
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,360
How much have you laughed at me?

142
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,790
While I didn't know a thing,

143
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,690
not even that you were the one who killed my grandmother,

144
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,570
I...

145
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,530
Did you have fun?

146
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,180
 You're watching, right grandma? 

147
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,880
 Please, I ask you. 

148
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,890
 Give me the strength. 

149
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,550
The thing that you like, "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

150
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,810
Just like what you did to my grandma,

151
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,800
I'll kill you.

152
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,060
Why don't you try to kill me too?

153
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,860
Just like you did to my grandmother!

154
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,260
 No... I won't make you a murderer. 

155
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,000
Don't you know how good my grandma was to you?

156
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,320
How could you do that to my grandmother!

157
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,120
Bong Yi...

158
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,600
Bong Yi, sorry.

159
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,330
Grandmother...

160
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,690
I am really sorry.

161
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,250
I...

162
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,760
I'll turn my self in.

163
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,120
Just allow me to do that, please?

164
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,060
Bong Yi, sorry. Huh?

165
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,660
Bong Yi...

166
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,690
You!

167
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,510
 That's right. I killed Kang Duk Su. 

168
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,990
 Because of you. I was scared he would put you in danger, so I killed him. 

169
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,600
 I am a little sick, you see. 

170
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,910
 But... I might be able to get better. 

171
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,280
 I saw that kind of hope today. 

172
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,380
You're not even worthy of dying like this.

173
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,310
Turn yourself in...

174
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,580
Turn yourself in and live miserably for the rest of your life.

175
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,740
Until the guilt eats you whole.

176
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,090
Until it hurts so much that you feel like dying is better.

177
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,240
Live in that hell, paying the price for your sins.

178
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,240
Bong Yi...

179
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,930
Was it you?

180
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,870
The one who killed my brother, was it you?

181
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,570
Detective,

182
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,780
please...

183
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,740
arrest me.

184
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,280
That thing you want to do...

185
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,480
- I'll do it. 
 - Stop talking nonsense!

186
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,670
Please don't ruin your life.

187
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,460
I...

188
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,100
- I'll be the one to do it. 
 - You lying son of a–

189
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,540
 Three days after discovery: Very good state. 

190
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,280
 It's active and has no problem moving. 

191
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,280
 Ten days after discovery: Dull movement. 

192
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,580
 Noticeable decrease in movement and activity. 

193
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,580
 Twenty days after discovery: Very bad state. Barely any movement. 

194
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,480
 Thirty days after discovery: Dead. 

195
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,990
   

196
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,430
   

197
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,140
   

198
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,720
No... No!

199
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,430
No way!

200
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,680
You bastard!

201
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,060
Execute the psychopath!

202
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,570
Bring my son back. Bring my son back! Bring my son back!

203
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,300
 Keep your promise, Jung Ba Reum. The promise you made to Go Mu Chi. 

204
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,600
 - Let's start the surgery. Please give her the anesthetic. 
 - Please lift your head. 

205
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,540
 I will administer the anesthetic now, Choi Hong Ju. 

206
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,760
 I'm scared. I'm scared. 

207
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,330
  I'm sad. The way the sunlight is pouring through the leaves.  

208
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:48,430
- Wait a moment. 
  - Psychopaths have no emotions. 

209
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,050
 If he wasn't the culprit, why did he have a photo of Byeon Sun Yeong's corpse here? 

210
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,330
 Han Kook, who was hidden here, was moved to a closed hospital. 

211
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,240
   

212
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:54,820
 That's right. If there was something, the police would've already found it. 

213
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,890
 Choi... PD Choi Hong Ju. 

214
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,430
 Dr. Daniel! 

215
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,390
 Did you say it's Jung Ba Reum? 

216
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:35,660
 If it wasn't for Seong Yo Han, I would've been dead. 

217
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,690
 I didn't even know that. 

218
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,640
 At that time, to Choi Young Shin... 

219
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:55,890
 Are you free for dinner tomorrow? I'll tell you everything tomorrow. 

220
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:00,460
 I killed you. I was the one... 

221
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,010
But how come the cops weren't able to find you?

222
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,870
 There is a passageway that leads directly to the sewers. 

223
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,880
 I hid there when the police had come. 

224
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,180
 I see. 

225
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,210
 I'll nurse you until you're recovered. 

226
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,570
 Thank you PD Choi. 

227
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,650
 I will do whatever it takes to prove Seong Yo Han's innocence. 

228
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,790
 No. Doing just that won't cut it. 

229
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,750
 Jung Ba Reum has lost his memories. 

230
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,730
 He's under the impression that he's a good guy. 

231
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,100
 You should use him before his instincts are awakened  

232
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,540
 and get rid of all the bastards that deserve to die. 

233
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:35,980
 And on the day Choi Young Shin plans to expose Jung Ba Reum's identity to the world, we should reveal it first.   

234
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:42,060
 Both Jung Ba Reum's real identity and Choi Young Shin's terrible atrocities. 

235
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,540
 I was the bait for the victims that Han Seo Joon murdered. 

236
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:56,260
 I saw from up-close what kind of a monster Han Seo Joon is. 

237
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,500
 Someone like that can never change. 

238
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,430
 We should dispose of anyone who is like Jung Ba Reum.  

239
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,140
 So that there won't be any more unfortunate victims 

240
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,700
 like your sister and Yo Han. 

241
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,340
 In order to do that I need lab equipment. 

242
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,850
   

243
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,160
Let go! Let go!

244
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,500
I need to kill that bastard. Let go!

245
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,900
- I have to kill him! I have to kill him! 
 - Calm down.

246
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,600
You know how he killed my brother!

247
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,870
Hey! Let me go!

248
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,210
Hey. Hey!

249
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,390
I said let me go! Hey!

250
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,890
Hyung!

251
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,840
   

252
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,770
No, you need to tell us why you were tied up in that house.

253
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:27,930
Well then, what happened in that amusement park a year ago?

254
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:32,050
You need to tell us something! Do you want me to call a lawyer?

255
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:38,240
- What? 
 - Seong Yo Han's mother insists that she needs to meet Jung Ba Reum.

256
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,510
What? You can't let her. She'll kill Jung Ba Reum. Go.

257
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,580
Nothing of that sort will happen. Let her meet him.

258
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,310
Would she

259
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,700
kill her own son?

260
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,850
So... Son?

261
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,910
 Mom, there's a strange kid in my school. 

262
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,410
 He cut open a rabbit's stomach. 

263
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,520
 I went to your house, just to check. 

264
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,680
 I realized right away. 

265
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,810
 Are you okay? Hurry home. 

266
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,200
 - Go home, hurry! 
 - Mommy! 

267
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,910
 Die! 

268
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,260
 Die. You must die. 

269
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,180
 You monster. 

270
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,280
 I shouldn't have given birth to you. 

271
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,560
 I should have never given birth to you! 

272
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,090
That wasn't a dream.

273
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,380
You should have just killed me then.

274
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,500
Why didn't you kill me?

275
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,180
Why?

276
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,780
That...

277
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,190
was the reason we switched the both of you.

278
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,680
 He did that to Jae Min? 

279
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,360
 Jae Min didn't say a word about it. 

280
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,750
 He was probably too scared to speak. I saw it happen. 

281
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,670
 I saw him trying to bury his brother. 

282
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,900
 You didn't forget our promise, right? 

283
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,690
 If you let  

284
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,850
 Jae Hoon be, he'll end up killing his brother. 

285
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,550
 I beg you. 

286
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,500
 For Jae Hoon's sake. 

287
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,220
You probably thought that I had killed my family back then.

288
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,710
That's right.

289
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:09,570
I went looking for you so that I could kill you myself.

290
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,720
But then I heard someone had already taken you, calling herself your aunt.

291
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,220
I looked for you everywhere but I couldn't find you.

292
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:25,790
I realized quite late that your resident registration number had been canceled. I wished that it was because of your death

293
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,490
that your resident registration number had been canceled.

294
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,390
After that, I had started to live a life forgetting about you.

295
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,920
 Tonight, around 8:00 p.m., at an empty house in the redeveloping district of Gudong, 

296
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,440
 an old woman in her 70s was found stabbed to death several times. 

297
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,490
 The police think that this case... 

298
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,980
 You need to die, you monster. 

299
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,870
 I shouldn't have given birth to you. 

300
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,530
 I should have never given birth to you! 

301
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,710
 I had a gut feeling that it was you. 

302
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,620
 Looks like it hurts. 

303
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,160
 How could he do this to a child face? 

304
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,220
 Why did you marry me? When you didn't even love me! Why? 

305
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,050
 Well, 

306
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,750
 you can call it the "propagation of a species." 

307
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,980
 I needed an offspring. 

308
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,950
 A second generation of me, Han Seo Joon. 

309
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,860
I was reminded of myself and Han Seo Joon.

310
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,300
Like when I fell in love without ever knowing who Han Seo Joon really was.

311
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,870
 Are you alright? 

312
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,970
But why did you just keep watching?

313
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,390
Already a step ahead of me,

314
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,610
Yo Han found you first. Yo Han...

315
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,400
After sending Yo Han off,

316
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,670
I went to your hospital room

317
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,480
to put an end to it for once and for all.

318
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,490
 Where did Uh Bung Yi go? 

319
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,950
 Where am I? 

320
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,110
 Oppa! 

321
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,740
 Oppa! Oppa! 

322
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,150
   

323
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,820
 Who are you? 

324
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,990
 Officer Jung Ba Reum, who underwent three operations, has been discharged from the hospital. 

325
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:33,020
 According to doctors at the Mujin hospital, Mr. Jung is in a normal state of recovery, 

326
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:38,110
 but he has been showing signs of temporary shock and partial amnesia. 

327
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,900
I went to the house you had moved to, as well.

328
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,040
And I really thought you had become a good person.

329
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,600
Even after that, I kept watching you

330
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,600
and I had a ray of hope.

331
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,820
That maybe... That you really

332
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,620
might have changed.

333
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,370
That's why...

334
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,840
That's why...

335
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,200
To me,

336
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,740
Han Seo Joon and you are both just the same.

337
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,050
It's time for your interrogation.

338
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,430
This won't change a thing, but

339
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,660
I really wasn't trying to kill Jae Min.

340
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,000
And I didn't

341
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,920
kill my family either.

342
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,840
 You should arrest me. 

343
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,630
 I killed a man. 

344
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,490
 I killed an innocent man to save that bastard. 

345
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,020
 Lock me up. 

346
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,180
I killed an innocent person!

347
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,560
Please, don't do this!

348
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,260
Get up! Hold on.

349
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,630
- Call 911! 
 - Hey!

350
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,320
 Did you shoot him? 

351
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,800
 My pitiful Yo Han. That pitiful child. 

352
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,220
 Did you shoot him? 

353
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,870
It wasn't Detective Go who killed Yo Han,

354
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,130
so don't feel guilty.

355
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,670
Han Seo Joon was the one who killed him, not Detective Go.

356
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,010
 There is Han Seo Joon's hideout there. 

357
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,240
 Go and confirm it. 

358
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,520
That's why.

359
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,670
That's why he changed, Jung Ba Reum.

360
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,800
Ah.

361
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,290
   

362
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,350
Is it true what that woman said?

363
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,070
Who? Sung Ji Eun?

364
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,090
Is Jung Ba Reum your son?

365
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,830
Is that why you transplanted Seong Yo Han's brain to Jung Ba Reum even though he was still alive?

366
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,950
That's right. Everything.

367
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,320
How can that be possible for someone on death row?

368
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,100
Is there anything that Choi Young Shin cannot do in this country?

369
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,600
She even kneeled down in front of me.

370
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,920
That the whole nation earnestly prays

371
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,670
and asks to save the country's son.

372
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,190
Why do you think she kneeled down in front of you to save Jung Ba Reum?

373
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:37,320
People say you're a genius but you are just as dumb as me.

374
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,460
You and your son are being used by that woman.

375
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,690
Just wait and see. Your son will be disposed of very miserably.

376
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:02,860
Choi Young Shin, this wench.

377
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,370
 When did you know? 

378
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,950
 You monster. 

379
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:32,190
 I shouldn't have given birth. I shouldn't have given birth to you. 

380
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,990
 I tried to believe it wasn't true. 

381
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,950
  Even when I was a victim of violence for being the son of a killer. 

382
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:41,790
 Yo Han! Get me the beige coat and nothing else. 

383
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:03,190
 Then I saw a picture of you holding another child. 

384
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,560
 That's why I had my DNA tested 

385
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,790
 with you and even the killer, Han Seo Joon. 

386
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,160
 You should have called before coming. 

387
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,100
 What is wrong my son? 

388
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,810
 You already knew about it, right? 

389
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,660
 About what? 

390
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,470
 That your son is a killer. 

391
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,760
 No, how... 

392
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,700
 How could it be like this? 

393
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,300
 Yo Han. 

394
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,730
 I'm sorry. I was wrong. 

395
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,530
 I'm sorry. 

396
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,730
 - I was wrong. 
 - Let go! 

397
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,900
 You are the same. 

398
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,230
 You're the same as  your husband, Han Seo Joon, and your son, Jung Ba Reum. 

399
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:08,160
 I will never forgive your son who killed my family. 

400
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,190
  Your son, Jung Ba Reum, who killed my one and only friend, Joon Sung, gruesomely. 

401
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,560
 And you, who knew everything and yet chose to abet. 

402
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,730
 I'm going to kill your son right now. 

403
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,460
 Watch me kill him with my own hands. 

404
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,430
 No! No! You can't, Yo Han! 

405
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:33,230
 - No, no! That guy is a monster. 
 - Move. 

406
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,160
 You'll die. You'll end up dying! 

407
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,760
 I said move! 

408
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,640
 Yo Han! 

409
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,700
 Ah! Let go! 

410
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:55,190
 I brought the receipt. 

411
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,770
 Ma'am. Ma'am! 

412
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,400
 Ma'am! Wake up! 

413
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,930
 I couldn't bring myself to say it. 

414
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:14,400
 Because you'd hate me and resent me. 

415
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,930
 My pitiful son, Yo Han. 

416
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,960
 You must think I'm horrible, 

417
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:29,030
 but I still want to be next to you. 

418
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,020
By the way, is Doctor Daniel still remaining silent? 
    

419
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,140
Yeah. He is a victim too, but I don't know why he isn't saying anything.

420
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,110
If the doctor stays silent, will we get an arrest warrant to come out?

421
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,740
The Blue House is moving, so it won’t be easy to get one.

422
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,230
It's right before the presidential election, so they're desperate to stop it.

423
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:05,840
I know right. In this state we'll ask for a warrant,

424
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,030
but it'll be dismissed immediately.

425
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,960
Still, we should hang in there as long as possible.

426
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,830
And we should somehow convince the doctor to give the final blow.

427
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,930
Hey, turn the volume up. Isn't that Choi Young Shin's lawyer doing an interview?

428
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:22,610
 My client also doesn't know why the laptop and victim's belongings are there. 

429
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,590
 It seems like Jung Ba Reum purposely put it there. 

430
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,450
I knew it'd be like that.

431
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,850
- Did a message come? 
 - Why did it ring?

432
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,920
What is this?

433
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:39,670
Hey, look at this. If this goes well, it'll change things.

434
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:40,870
 Breaking News 
   

435
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:44,530
 Mrs. A, who identified herself as a member of the private organization OZ in the NIS, 

436
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:48,680
 - volunteered to do a press conference. 
 - The secretary general of Choi Young Shin will reveal the shocking truth 

437
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,380
 from the past 26 years. 

438
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,990
 What if Choi Young Shin escapes even though I turn myself in? 

439
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:58,840
 Don't worry. With this, even Choi Young Shin won't be able to escape. 

440
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,480
 Hoon Seok's father is going to take Hoon Seok. 

441
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,410
 Once Hoon Seok gets on the plane, I'll do the press conference right away. 

442
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,480
Ah, what do we have to wait for?

443
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,810
- She's late. 
 - I know, right?

444
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,670
- What's the content? The content? 
 - Just how long do we have to wait?

445
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,780
- She must be late? 
 - We should hear what she has to say.

446
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,010
 - It has been 30 minutes already. Isn't this too much? 
 - What time is it? 

447
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:26,970
Excuse me. Detective Kang. Captain!

448
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:43,840
The father kills my mom and dad. The son kills my Hyung?

449
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,470
I'm going to kill you. No matter what.

450
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:52,420
Detective, you need to find my aunt first.

451
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,070
We have no time. If we want to clear Seong Yo Han's name–

452
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:58,870
 Brain transplant, lab rat. Are you writing science fiction? 

453
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,730
 My client is also speechless. 

454
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:02,410
 Seong Yo Han. Jung Ba Reum. 

455
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:06,110
 Both of them are psychopath killers. That's the fact. 

456
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:10,850
My aunt has evidence that will reveal everything.

457
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,930
Please zoom into this.

458
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:28,050
Hyung, track his phone. I'll go to this bastard's house.

459
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,720
- Yes, Hyung? 
 - His phone is turned off.

460
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,860
 We can't track his phone. 

461
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:52,520
Please go in.

462
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,990
That side did something already.

463
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,330
- But something's weird. 
 - What is?

464
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,460
There's something strange about Choi Young Shin's side. The mood seems serious.

465
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,180
Lee Min Soo disappeared? What do you mean by that?

466
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,560
Didn't you receive a call that he was definitely bringing her?

467
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:14,140
Yes, but I suddenly lost contact.

468
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,330
Find him right now.

469
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,820
- Anyway, I'll keep looking. 
 - Where are you going to look?

470
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,250
Then should I stay here with my hands tied?

471
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:25,830
Team Leader, I... I need to clear Seong Yo Han's name.

472
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:28,000
I will definitely do it.

473
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,970
It's a waste waiting for this long.

474
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,490
- Ah, let's just go. 
 - Let's go, let's go.

475
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:41,040
 - How did you know to come here? 
 - I beg of you. 

476
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,930
 I have already promised Ba Reum anyway. 

477
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:48,500
 I'll bring evidence and have a press conference. 

478
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,510
 Ba Reum went to turn himself in. 

479
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,570
 I have a favor to ask. I'm going to change the item for tomorrow. 

480
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,680
 Help me. 

481
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,890
 I need security. The only person I can trust is Bong Yi. 

482
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:06,190
 This is the file that we've been covering so far. Look at this and decide. 

483
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,560
 I'll do it. Because someone needs to do it. 

484
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,070
 As you can see, there's no conclusive evidence. 

485
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,820
 But still, let's try to get an arrest warrant. 

486
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,850
Excuse me!

487
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,650
- The front house... 
  - Because Choi Young Shin was arrested without a warrant, 

488
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:51,400
 the police have entered a 48 hour battle to arrest Choi Young Shin. 

489
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,860
 The unprecedented situation in constitutional history 

490
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,670
 is now emerging as an urgent concern to arrest Choi. 

491
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:00,230
The time to request a warrant is almost over.

492
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:05,550
- Hey, did Go Mu Chi find Lee Min Soo yet? 
 - No, I haven't heard from him.

493
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:09,220
 If the police fail to make an arrest, it is likely 

494
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,630
 they will run into some difficulties with the investigation from the higher-ups. 

495
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,990
 Lee Min Soo. 

496
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,890
We found Lee Min Soo.

497
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:49,540
Yes, I'm leaving now.

498
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,050
Did you find him?

499
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:01,700
I haven't heard from Mu Chi.  It's time to meet with the profiler.

500
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:09,310
This is Choi Hong Ju of 'Sherlock Hong Ju.'

501
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:14,530
"I am the real culprit of the Mujin Serial Killer case.  I am a serial killer."

502
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,740
The entire country is in shock due to Jung Ba Reum's confession.

503
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,170
The first one. The first murder... Why did you commit it?

504
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:28,470
I looked for Song Soo Ho, who killed my family... for a long time.

505
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:31,430
He was the first victim to my murders

506
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:36,760
and after killing him, the killer instinct within me exploded.

507
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,150
 - After that time–  
 - This is the Chief.

508
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:44,420
What's more shocking than the fact of Jung Ba Reum's murders is knowing the truth.

509
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:47,870
it was covered up and even though he could commit murders,

510
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:51,360
there was testimony about a perpetrator guiding him.

511
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:58,800
Dr. Daniel said that Seong Yo Han and I were both born with the psychopath gene.

512
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,190
As for Choi Young Shin...

513
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:06,570
to see if we were really growing up to be psychopath killers,

514
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:11,080
she was watching and monitoring us.

515
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,950
I will escort you out.

516
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,560
Just a minute.  It hasn't been 48 hours yet.

517
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,560
Then get a warrant.

518
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:25,350
Since you don't have any evidence but only the evidence of that crazy guy, you can't get a warrant. Isn't that right?

519
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,870
If you won't request a warrant, don't keep her in here. She's a busy woman doing the nation's work.

520
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:34,210
Why are you so busy?  There's still 5 minutes left.

521
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:36,360
Have you heard from Mu Chi yet?

522
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:43,870
Choi Young Shin used state agencies to illegally surveil the two children and their families.

523
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:50,250
That was possible because she was powerful enough to order around high-ranking officials.

524
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,070
- Team Leader Bok! 
 - Yes.

525
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,900
What are you guys doing?  Are you not getting out of the way?

526
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,790
But there's still a minute left.

527
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,460
Dammit, Bok Ho Nam! Hurry up and get out of her way!

528
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,470
Yes, we'll request the warrant right away.

529
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,040
Yes.

530
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,450
   

531
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,850
- Hello? 
  - It's been rejected. 

532
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:28,850
What garbage! You didn't have time to even open the email. He didn't even review it.

533
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,320
You've worked hard.

534
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:42,040
As of now, the statement from murderer Jung Ba Reum,

535
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,800
and that of the President's Chief Secretary, Choi Young Shin are complete opposites.

536
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,940
However, I found out that the arrest warrant for the Knot Killer Case, Woo Hyeong Cheol

537
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,690
was dismissed right before it was to be issued.

538
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,920
I asked about the reason for that.

539
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,380
 I have nothing to say. 

540
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:04,060
 After Woo Hyeong Cheol's arrest warrant was dismissed, two more women were killed.  Aren't you regretful? 

541
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,560
 It's not because of me.  Do you think I wanted to do that? 

542
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:11,060
 The order came from above.  I got demoted for objecting and I'm here wasting my time. 

543
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:17,240
 There was an order from above.  Something about the entire nation's mass trauma.  They were grand words. 

544
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,460
 Honestly, isn't that strange? 

545
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:24,770
 We can't go public because the higher-ups tell us to keep quiet. 

546
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:28,900
That's not me.  It doesn't look anything like me.

547
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,000
It looks exactly like you. You can't say that.

548
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,920
Why was the arrest warrant directly denied?

549
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,490
 Did you order that the arrest warrant be denied? 

550
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:38,060
The dismissal of Woo Hyeong Cheol's planned arrest warrant,

551
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,410
and the site of Woo Hyeong Cheol's murder

552
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:45,670
being set up with to look like a copycat crime by the actions of an organization.  What could be the reason?

553
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:48,160
That is an absurd accusation. That's stretching it.

554
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,660
Let's say that Woo Hyeong Cheol's arrest warrant was dismissed.

555
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:54,360
How would that make Jung Ba Reum commit murder?  Are you saying that he was being controlled?

556
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,710
 In 1995, when the nation was in an uproar  
    

557
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:04,710
 about the Headhunter murders, legislators gathered to discuss 

558
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:08,800
 legalizing fetuses with the psychopathic gene. 

559
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,390
 - Hey! 
 - If you have something to say– 

560
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:17,340
 When the bill failed to pass, Choi Young Shin 

561
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,550
 asked me to give her the list of fetuses with the psychopathic gene. 

562
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:25,300
 I accepted that request. 

563
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,170
 Jung Ba Reum.  Seong Yo Han. 

564
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:34,200
 And the data about the child who was already born with the psychopathic gene, Woo Hyeong Cheol. 

565
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,680
 I went to Choi Young Shin and asked her to stop.  However, she– 

566
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,090
 The higher the number of Jung Ba Reum's victims are, the anger of the citizens will grow regarding his corruption. 

567
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:46,770
 You're crazy.  Stop it right now.  Right now!  That child is getting out of control as we speak. 

568
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:51,340
 Just a little bit more.  There's not much time left until the election.  Just wait until then. 

569
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,170
 I'm going to pass that law for sure. 

570
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:57,520
I never received such documents.  Those are the one-sided claims of Dr. Daniel.

571
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,010
Are those really the one-sided claims of Dr. Daniel?

572
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:05,480
Are Jung Ba Reum and Dr. Daniel both lying?

573
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,380
It's the truth... all of it.

574
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:21,340
We found her.

575
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,400
That side already did something.

576
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,480
 But there's something strange about Choi Young Shin's side.  The mood is serious. 

577
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,750
 - I think they lost Detective Lee. 
 - He was the kidnapper, but they lost him? 

578
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,380
 Anyway, I'm going to search for him. 

579
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,930
 There was a picture.. when I went to Detective Lee's house. 

580
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:44,330
 A picture that OZ, who we chased at the motel, took together. 

581
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:48,560
 - That 6264 OZ? 
 - Yes, he was with a woman 

582
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,740
 and Detective Lee was in the picture also. 

583
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:55,070
 If Detective Lee didn't take my Aunt to Choi Young Shin, there must be a reason. 

584
00:56:55,070 --> 00:57:00,440
 Yoo Jung was stalked for 7 years, then was killed by a guy disguised as a parcel delivery man. 

585
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,790
 By chance, do you know this person? 

586
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:09,900
 Oh, Min Soo?  In high school, Min Soo and Yoo Jung were always together. 

587
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:12,650
 Ah, I see. 

588
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:18,910
 Then, do you happen to know where Yoo Jung's ashes were spread? 

589
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,970
 Lee Min Soo! 

590
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,900
 You bastard, where are they– the mother and child?  Huh? 

591
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,540
 You bastard, you didn't– 

592
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,870
 Mom, who is that Ahjusshi? 

593
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:45,070
 Don't scold him.  He said that he would take us to the broadcasting station. 

594
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:52,070
 I'm sorry. They said we were going to make a world without victims like Yoo Jung. 

595
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,450
 Let's go. 

596
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,480
 Sheesh, you scared me, Ahjusshi! 

597
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:05,180
 A show's airing today? Shouldn't this be a secret? 

598
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,590
 Ahjusshi... I trust you, though. 

599
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,050
 I trust you also. 

600
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:14,040
 That's why I brought them here.  I can't trust those damn cops. 

601
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,940
After I started the job in 2005, my first assignment was

602
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,890
OZ, Choi Young Shin's private group within the National Intelligence Service.

603
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:31,810
 At the time, after Jung Ba Reum's family was killed by Song Soo Ho, 

604
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:36,170
 - I was added in the role of his Aunt.  
 - Ah, Go Mu Chi and Jung Ba Reum

605
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:38,270
worked together one last time.

606
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:43,560
 After that, reporting on Jung Ba Reum's daily life was my assignment. 

607
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,370
Ah, this is–

608
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:47,000
It's someone I don't know!

609
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,760
Do you have something to back up your testimony?

610
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,720
I swear that doesn't exist.

611
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,990
In here... all the evidence exists.

612
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,510
   

613
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,150
   

614
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:08,260
   

615
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,490
   

616
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,760
This is my first time seeing these.  They're all fabricated.

617
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,250
 Is there no movement yet? 

618
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:31,830
 Send Song Soo Ho's address to Jung Ba Reum. 

619
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:37,870
 Yes, Song Soo Ho's address is– 

620
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:40,590
 Let's throw some bait. 

621
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:43,200
 How many people has Jung Ba Reum killed so far? 

622
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,370
 Including the grape field murder case, there are five. 

623
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:49,500
 That's still not enough.  Let's wait until the Presidential election. 

624
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:58,640
- What happened? 
 - What happened?

625
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,630
- Go catch Choi Young Shin again! 
 - Yes, we will.

626
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:23,310
What should I do?  The evidence is overwhelming.

627
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,980
Please get out.

628
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,170
Get out.

629
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,260
Come on.

630
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:40,760
I bought this as a gift for Detective Shin's baby,

631
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,280
but I didn't know the baby was a girl.

632
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,910
You have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. Anything you say can and will–

633
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:51,530
You knew the truth, yet stood by and watched?

634
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:56,440
There isn't a government office that is free from Choi Young Shin's reach.

635
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:01,740
That's why Seong Yo Han probably went to see Jung Ba Reum in person.

636
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:08,500
Then was Seong Yo Han really an innocent person?

637
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,340
Or was he a heinous killer just like Jung Ba Reum?

638
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:17,450
 The thankful person who gave me the will to live... 
  

639
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:22,600
 I'm not saying you should forgive him.  Until that guy kneels down and begs for forgiveness, 

640
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,700
 you need to hang on and stay alive. 

641
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,310
 It's Dr. Seong Yo Han. 

642
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:30,400
 The person who carried me to the police on his back when I was dying,  
    

643
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,740
 that middle school student Oppa was Seong Yo Han.
   

644
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:35,940
 The person who saved me when I almost died because of Choi Young Shin 

645
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,900
 and treated me was Dr. Seong Yo Han. 
  

646
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,170
While preparing for this broadcast,

647
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:46,070
I discovered a video that was recorded by chance.

648
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:54,850
   

649
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:58,500
 The thing you were going to tell me today, I'll look forward to it. 

650
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,530
 Perhaps a marriage proposal? 

651
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:04,350
 I made dinner for you.  Eat well, and I'll see you later. 

652
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,940
Here's what Doctor Daniel said:

653
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:04,850
"Psychopaths never put on an act when they are alone."

654
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:07,820
   

655
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:19,170
I am also deeply involved in this case.

656
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,790
I told Doctor Daniel to use Jung Ba Reum.

657
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:28,430
Even after hearing the entire truth from Doctor Daniel, I didn't report Jung Ba Reum,

658
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:34,990
and used him to kill psychopaths like Kang Duk Su.

659
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:42,680
As soon as this broadcast ends, I will pay for all of my sins and undergo a police investigation.

660
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:48,260
She's coming out! Were you involved directly with the murders?

661
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:54,410
- Could you explain what you mean? 
- Were you involved?

662
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:58,510
I am a murderer.

663
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:03,840
I killed someone twenty-six years ago.

664
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,130
 Unni! 

665
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,600
 My dad... 

666
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,860
 Where is your father right now? 

667
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:26,020
 Excuse me, Ajusshi. Ajusshi. Ajusshi? 

668
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:35,190
 Please let me live. Let me live. 

669
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:42,780
 Don't be afraid. 

670
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:48,560
I have lived with guilt for my entire life.

671
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:53,250
 I sincerely apologize to Unni Soo Jung's mother. 
   

672
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:14,690
- Detective Kang. 
 - Yes?

673
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:16,590
Let me do it.

674
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:51,390
Why did you come so late?

675
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,500
I'm sorry, dad.

676
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:04,590
I couldn't be happy all alone,

677
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:07,560
leaving Hyun Seok and Soo Jung alone.

678
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,110
Let's go.

679
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:54,070
Dad, what about mommy? Isn't she coming with us?

680
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:58,160
She told us to go first and wait for her, okay?

681
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,970
What made you do this?

682
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:03,330
The organization OZ has come to light.

683
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:06,090
 Choi Young Shin, Chief Presidential Secretary, dismissed her own organization and 

684
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:08,580
 with a determination to make a world without crimes, 

685
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:13,880
 she not only investigated civilians but also killed them. 

686
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,780
 In light of this matter, citizens are voicing calls for a thorough investigation 

687
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:20,800
 into private organizations and their individual greed. 

688
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:28,660
Shin Seong Min was elected in the 20th presidential election. 
    

689
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:35,100
I sincerely thank the citizens who chose to vote for me.

690
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:40,570
My son Sang, who left this world early, would have been the happiest.

691
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:45,310
A bill to mandate prenatal genetic testing and psychopathic gene abortion 
    

692
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:49,300
was vetoed by me twenty-six years ago. 
    

693
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,640
Today, I announce that I will put this bill up for a referendum before making the final decision on passing the bill.

694
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,090
The first trial of the notorious serial killer, Jung Ba Reum, has now started.

695
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:11,430
Even before the first trial started, the wall of the Mujin Police station 
    

696
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:17,200
is covered with funeral wreaths that appear to have been sent by the citizens. 
    

697
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:25,040
 The referendum on the  psychopathic gene abortion bill, which has been a topic of national interest, is over. 
    

698
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:30,400
 As a result of the poll, the bill for the abortion of fetus' with the psychopathic gene was passed with a high margin of difference between vote counts. 

699
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,180
Execute Jung Ba Reum! 
    

700
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:37,810
 The prosecution requests the death penalty for serial killer Jung Ba Reum. The trial will be held at three today. 

701
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:42,430
 Rather than whether Jung Ba Reum is guilty or not, people are more interested to know how long he will be sentenced to 

702
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:47,700
 and on what grounds the court will decide how long the sentence should be, which is why 

703
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,300
 people are tuning in for the live trial with keen interest. 

704
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,660
The defendant is sentenced to the death penalty.

705
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:59,740
 Serial killer Jung Ba Reum was sentenced to death in his first trial. 

706
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:03,170
 In consideration of the unimaginable pain the victims went  through, 

707
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:06,280
 the court announced that he must be isolated from society forever. 

708
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,110
 Jung Ba Reum, who was once praised for being the nation's son 

709
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:12,610
 turned himself in as the culprit of the Mujin Serial Killings 

710
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:15,820
 which caused great shock to the entire nation. 

711
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:28,150
 The serial killer, Jung Ba Reum has given up on making an appeal. 

712
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:32,060
 Thus, his death penalty is now confirmed. 

713
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:53,960
   

714
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,290
   

715
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:06,660
   

716
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:13,970
   

717
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:40,310
   

718
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:53,830
That's right. That look in his eyes has come back.

719
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:07,820
Your food is here.

720
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:19,130
Out of the people that I decided to kill you're the only one still alive.

721
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:22,210
You remember how your friend Kim Byeong Tae died, don't you?

722
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:25,420
An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.

723
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:27,010
Wait for it.

724
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,320
Guards! Guards!

725
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:47,430
Did you threaten Kim Soo Cheol

726
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:49,030
that you'd kill him?

727
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:51,570
That rat-like bastard.

728
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:54,510
Did he scurry off and snitch on me?

729
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:59,920
Are you even human? How could you...?

730
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,060
Why did you apply to be posted here?

731
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:03,750
Did you maybe...

732
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,230
miss me? Huh?

733
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:11,550
You missed me?

734
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:13,110
Yeah.

735
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:17,100
I had something I needed to ask you so I applied to be here, you bastard.

736
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:22,030
How could you do that? It wasn't even some stranger. It was Chi Kook.

737
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:28,550
How could you do that to Bong Yi's grandmother, to Father? How could you do that? How?

738
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:32,800
So what if a lion killed a few rats?

739
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,030
- What? 
 - Aren't you curious as to why I didn't kill you?

740
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:42,440
You... weren't even worth killing.

741
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:56,800
You scumbag!

742
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:09,350
Emergency in cell 7! Emergency in cell 7!

743
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:12,110
- Hey, run! 
 - Emergency in cell 7!

744
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:23,660
What are you doing?

745
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,710
Are you okay?

746
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,970
It's a fine day.

747
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:44,690
It makes me sad that I can't go see flowers on a day like this.

748
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,300
I missed you, Father.

749
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:20,930
Yeah. I realized it from the very beginning by just looking into your eyes.

750
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,890
That you had the same superior genes as I did.

751
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:28,820
Besides that.

752
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:33,820
Don't you have something else to tell me?

753
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:39,060
I was very pleased when I got to know you were my son.

754
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:41,990
I was proud of you.

755
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:47,080
Don't forget. We have genes superior to normal humans.

756
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:51,750
It can't change again... That look in your eyes.

757
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:23,230
Don't worry.  We will get out of here.

758
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:26,610
That would be

759
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,340
the best, wouldn't it?

760
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:37,290
Of course.  I already have a plan.

761
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:16,360
 Dong Koo, listen to me. 

762
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,150
 Gu Dong Koo! 

763
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,720
 When the time comes, open Han Seo Joon's cell door for me. 

764
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,610
 I... 

765
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:28,630
 I have to finish it. 

766
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:11,890
 Breaking news!  Headhunter Han Seo Joon's head has been decapitated. 

767
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:17,240
 Just as you did it in front of my eyes, shouldn't I do it in front of your kid? 

768
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,990
 Han Seo Joon, I will kill you 

769
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:26,100
 in the worst possible way.  Keep your promise, Jung Ba Reum. The promise you made to Go Mu Chi. 

770
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,660
   

771
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,070
What is it?

772
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:18,350
Please, please kill me.  Hurry up and kill me, please.

773
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:50,250
I visited Hyun Soo at the prison.

774
01:18:55,650 --> 01:19:00,710
Jung Ba Reum will die soon.

775
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:04,090
- What? 
 - They say it's the side effect of the brain surgery.

776
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:08,310
According to the correction's officer, it's tough to even watch.

777
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:10,750
I guess the pain is enormous.

778
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:15,120
Jung Ba Reum told them that it's like a mouse is gnawing at his brain.

779
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:21,690
That bastard shouldn't die like that.  He should die a more painful death.  Much more painful.

780
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:29,810
You have some things to say to Jung Ba Reum as well, don't you?

781
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:34,590
- Before he dies, for one last time— 
 - No, I don't want to! Why would I see him?

782
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,170
- Sit down, sit down. Sit down! 
 - Ma'am.

783
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:48,360
Where did you drink so much like this?

784
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,030
Stop drinking.  You are going to die if you keep this up.

785
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:54,650
Ma'am.

786
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:59,170
I have something to ask you.

787
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:03,510
I heard that you forgave them, the psychopath father and son, is that right?

788
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:06,720
How did you forgive them?  Are you crazy?

789
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:10,140
The reason why I am trying to forgive them

790
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:13,530
is not for them.

791
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:16,220
It's because I want to live.

792
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:19,750
If I don't do it, I would really feel like dying.

793
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:25,760
At that time, hearing Father talk,

794
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,570
the pain

795
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:32,340
and weariness during all this time were felt.

796
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:37,870
And my pain and weariness, too.

797
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:48,320
At that time, I let it go as well.  Let's forgive.

798
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,780
The kids would want me to live as well.

799
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:55,300
I should show them that I am doing well.

800
01:20:56,090 --> 01:21:01,220
And then I slept for days.

801
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:07,120
And when I woke up, I had the will to live.

802
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:13,720
And, my Soo Jung and Soo Ho,

803
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:16,470
I was able to face them.

804
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:20,470
Don't talk bullshit.

805
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:24,110
I can't forgive.

806
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:28,140
Of course.  I understand that too.

807
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:34,500
Since we, the ones left behind, must live our own ways.

808
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:39,050
The important thing is

809
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:44,800
that we must live.

810
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:52,460
I hope that you distance yourself at least a little bit from the pain

811
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:57,420
and find your own daily life.

812
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:00,710
Your brother wanted that as well, right?

813
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,530
You are lucky.

814
01:22:58,530 --> 01:23:06,170
I heard that you will die naturally, is that right?  Damn.  You should die by my own hands with your head cut off.

815
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:09,970
I came to watch.

816
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:12,890
To see how you look.

817
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,530
Do you think I will forgive you because you killed your father?

818
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:21,320
Don't even dream of it.

819
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:31,000
I am sorry.

820
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:34,700
And, always...

821
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:40,150
I felt thankful to you.

822
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:48,240
 In order to kill a person, your eyes must be empty. 

823
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:52,410
 But your eyes are completely filled. 

824
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:57,500
 Anger, pain, regret. 

825
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,950
 Love. 

826
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:03,950
 I now understand what it means for the eyes to be filled. 

827
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:08,940
 You bastard, are also hurting and in pain, I can see it. 

828
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:11,940
I know I am being shameless but I have a favor to ask you.

829
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:20,290
The wealth left in my name, please use it for the families of the victims.

830
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:25,620
Do you think doing that would wash away even the tiniest bit of your sin?

831
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:28,850
And finally,

832
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,490
Bong Yi...

833
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:41,910
I want to see Bong Yi.

834
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:47,230
You, shameless bastard.

835
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:49,670
Would you come if you were her?

836
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,330
Oh my.

837
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,210
 I heard you are dying, is that right? 

838
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,320
I heard you are dying so I came to watch.

839
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:21,700
If you die that comfortably, it would not be fair though.

840
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:29,430
A bastard like you should... with a stake through your stomach...

841
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:37,080
burned alive... with your lungs taken out...

842
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:41,710
with your stomach filled with rocks... That's how...

843
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:50,290
What is it that you want to say?

844
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:53,730
What did you want to say that you called me all the way over here?

845
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,030
I wanted to say,

846
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:03,650
I am sorry.

847
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:14,710
I... I won't forgive you

848
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:17,220
until the day I die.

849
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:20,870
I will curse you for the rest of my life.

850
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:24,520
I came to tell you that.

851
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,210
In the next life,

852
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:35,110
I will be born as a normal person.

853
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,060
Then...

854
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,170
Then...

855
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:29,670
 I... was born as a monster. 

856
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:36,460
Please don't let me be a monster.

857
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,520
Please.

858
01:28:59,470 --> 01:29:05,450
God listened to your prayer.

859
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:20,150
You are no longer

860
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:24,690
a monster.

861
01:30:05,770 --> 01:30:07,790
   

862
01:30:07,790 --> 01:30:09,860
- Oppose! Pardon! 
 - Oppose! Pardon!

863
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:11,990
 Breaking News! President Shin Seong Min 

864
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:16,830
 gave a pardon to former Secretary Chief Choi Young Shin today despite public opposition. 

865
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:18,690
 The Blue House emphasized the need for amnesty 

866
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:20,980
 in terms of social integration. 

867
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:22,600
- Oppose! 
 - Pardon!

868
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,280
- Oppose!

869

- Oppose!

871

872
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:34,120

873
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,910
- Oppose!

874
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:37,560
- Oppose! 
 - Pardon!

875
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,900
- Mom! 
   - Oppose! Pardon!  

876
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:43,140
Eun Chong! Come here.

877
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:53,040
- Have you been well? 
 - Yeah.

878
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:03,220
 Former Secretary Chief Choi Young Shin's pardon has heightened public anger. 

879
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:06,690
 The president's approval rating is falling. 

880
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:35,430
 Eggs have come. Eggs! 

881
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:37,590
Oh Bong Yi! Eggs!

882
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:39,610
Hey, wake up! You have to go to school!

883
01:31:39,610 --> 01:31:42,100
 - The sun has risen!  
 - Aish!

884
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:44,210
 Get up! Let's go to school! 

885
01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:45,310
- Enjoy! 
 - Yes.

886
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:46,610
- Thank you. 
 - Work hard!

887
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:48,060
You're so noisy from the morning!

888
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:49,470
Hey, you punk. What time is it?

889
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:52,130
Do you know how many eggs I have to sell to pay for your tuition?

890
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:53,850
Ah, I'm going to pay you back.

891
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:56,340
That's why I told you I'm not going to college.

892
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:00,450
You're telling me to go to the broadcasting station and school. Do you think I have two bodies?

893
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:12,580
Ajusshi, I got a call from the main writer of a new current affairs program.

894
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:18,530
Just wait. When I become a main writer, I'll create a fair and just world.

895
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:20,770
- Make sure there isn't one unfair person in the world– 
 - Let's see. Let's see.

896
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:23,210
You'll get tuition and interest.

897
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:25,360
If you become a main writer, you get a higher writer's fee, right?

898
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,830
Are you in the loan business now?

899
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,150
What is this?

900
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:37,390
Ah. I bought it for myself to eat.

901
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:40,930
Ajusshi, you dislike beans as much as carrots.

902
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:44,790
By now, she must've been released, right?

903
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:45,980
Who?

904
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:48,110
Who are you fooling?

905
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:51,510
Go. Go and tell her you're sorry.

906
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:53,770
- See her face– 
 - Eggs have come!

907
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:55,150
Eggs!

908
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:56,790
No, see her face like a man and–

909
01:32:56,790 --> 01:33:00,160
Fresh and large eggs!

910
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:02,170
No, who uses that nowadays?

911
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:05,920
They use a machine. What a lousy speaker.

912
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:10,060
Hey, you punk. You don't have any sense. Don't you know retro? Retro?

913
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,930
- On the way, drop me off at the market. 
 - What are you doing?

914
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:16,200
I invited PD Choi for a meal at dinner time.

915
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:20,510
Dong Gu Oppa is coming too. Come if you want.

916
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:24,840
How can I go? With the sins I've committed.

917
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:29,210
I bought japchae and pork.

918
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:31,810
Next.

919
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:46,030
Ah, that's right. I should buy sweet and sour chicken that children like.

920
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:21,330
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

921
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:28,050
It's not your fault.

922
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:32,530
I didn't believe in him. I didn't...

923
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:37,240
We both committed an unforgettable sin to Seong Yo Han.

924
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:42,370
I'll live atoning for the rest of my life.

925
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:44,140
Me too.

926
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:50,220
I want Detective Go to be happy.

927
01:34:52,670 --> 01:34:54,810
You too.

928
01:34:56,740 --> 01:35:01,370
I'm going to try for Eun Chong's sake.

929
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:09,470
I'm going.

930
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:21,450
Jae Yi Unnie! Eun Chong!

931
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:24,440
What are you doing? What are you doing over here?

932
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:27,540
It's a bird.

933
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:29,940
It flew from over there.

934
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:32,080
Is that so?

935
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,430
How pretty.

936
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:38,560
Should Noona give it a name?

937
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,910
Yes!

938
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:42,960
How about Uh Bung Yi? Uh Bung Yi.

939
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,770
I like Uh Bung Yi. It's cute.

940
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:46,830
It's cute?

941
01:35:46,830 --> 01:35:50,930
Uh Bung. Uh Bung.

942
01:35:50,930 --> 01:35:54,700
I like Uh Bung Yi. Uh Bung Yi is cute.

943
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,970
 Eggs have come!

01:36:03,970 --> 01:36:08,210
 Large eggs directly from the farm. 

945
01:36:08,210 --> 01:36:11,650
Eggs have come! Eggs!

946
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:16,410
 There was a monster that could never be saved. 

947
01:36:16,410 --> 01:36:20,030
 God gave that monster emotions. 

948
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:24,860
 God listened to your prayer. 

949
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:27,270
 You are no longer 

950
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:31,740
 a monster. 

951
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:15,700
 So he died feeling pain and anguish in repentance of what he has done. 

952
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:20,780
   

953
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:28,500
 Did God give him the Divine punishment 

954
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:33,180
 or is it that He gave him salvation?
