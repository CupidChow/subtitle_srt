1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:10,170


2
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,120
   

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,680
   

4
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,100
 Mom, why are you crying? 

5
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,170
 You monster! Die! 

6
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,970
 Die! 

7
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,630
   

8
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,010
   

9
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,810
 Officer Jung! 

10
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,530
Jung Ba Reum!

11
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,930
Doctor, what happened?

12
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,810
It appears to be a shock from a heart attack.

13
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,920
No, that can't be the case.

14
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,550
When I was talking to him earlier, he was fine.

15
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,450
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,110
He was fine though...

17
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,750
Chi Kook, get up.

18
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,410
Chi Kook.

19
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,620
Hey.

20
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,410
Chi Kook, get up!

21
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,650
No...

22
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,050
You said you wanted to be happy with your mother.

23
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,790
How can you go like this?

24
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,720
Chi Kook.

25
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,780
Chi... Chi Kook. What to do?

26
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,860
Chi Kook.

27
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,560
Hey, Ba Reum...

28
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,220
Chi Kook.

29
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,130
Shoes.

30
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,590
Hey. Hey!

31
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,640
Oh. Mother.

32
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,880
Mother!

33
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,590
Doctor!

34
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,100
I'm going to borrow this.

35
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,380
Hey, hey! Hey, stop right there.

36
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,750
Hey! Hey!

37
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,650
What is he doing, that punk?

38
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,100
I took care of it.

39
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,590
Yes.

40
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,780
   

41
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,610
   

42
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,730
   

43
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,440
Delivery.

44
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,320
Did you order food?

45
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,540
You killed Chi Kook, didn't you?

46
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,850
Why did you kill him?

47
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,370
Why did you kill that pitiful person?

48
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,560
How can you say "pitiful" out of that mouth? You despicable bastard.

49
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,150
That's right. I killed him, you monstrous bastard.

50
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,050
I killed an innocent person because of you!

51
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,020
There was an accident. Please hurry and take care of the area.

52
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,730
Hey!

53
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,070
Where did I see him?

54
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,080
What?

55
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,840
Did they clean it up?

56
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,060
In this short time?

57
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,980
It seems like there was more than two of them...

58
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,020
Those guys are the one who cleaned up Woo Hyeong Cheol and Han Kook.

59
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,750
Yes, Detective?

60
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,190
Where are you, you bastard?

61
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,790
Hello?

62
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,470
Detective, I can't hear you that well.

63
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,990
What do you mean you can't hear? Where are you?

64
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,860
Hello? Hello?

65
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,490
Why can't I hear him?

66
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,410
   

67
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,850
I followed that robber OZ to this place.

68
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,780
Detective Go. Chi Kook–

69
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,210
Hey, you punk! What's up with you? Why are you being so suspicious?

70
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,030
What did you do to Na Chi Kook?

71
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,880
Chi Kook was murdered.

72
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,160
- That guy confessed. 
 - "That guy?"

73
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,370
It's this guy. Right here.

74
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,690
We can't see his face.

75
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,190
What about the CCTV in the parking lot?

76
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,590
Customers don't like that. We have people come in who can't have their privacy violated.

77
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,550
So, there's no way for us to know what he looks like.

78
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,480
If it's an unmanned motel, how do people use it?

79
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,740
They usually make reservations online.

80
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,090
If not, there's a kiosk so they can pay here instead.

81
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,970
Show me the payment records for room 802.

82
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,790
Just a minute.

83
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,260
- Room 802 is vacant. 
 - What?

84
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,880
It has been vacant for a while.

85
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,070
I'm sure it's that room. It was definitely room 802!

86
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,060
Let's go check.

87
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,400
I saw a laptop, two jackets, and suitcases. They were all here.

88
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,390
And as soon as the door opened,

89
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,140
I threw the jjamppong. 
  (T/N: A Korean noodle soup with vegetable and spicy seafood or pork-based broth.) 

90
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,590
Those guys got rid of everything, even the jjampong on the wall!

91
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,220
How could they get rid of all of that in such a short time?

92
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,280
Spilled jjamppong soup? Where is it?

93
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,830
I'm telling you,  it's the truth.

94
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,290
Then look into the car that he came in, 67 DO 6264.

95
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,540
The car he came in–

96
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,410
Wait. What did you just say? 67 DO 6264?

97
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,640
Yes.

98
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,810
 67 DO 6264. 

99
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,440
It's jjampong soup alright.

100
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,050
Exactly. You believe me now, right?

101
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,980
67 DO 6264.

102
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,670
- It's the guy who struck me on my head and stole my wallet. That thief.
 - What?

103
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:12,040
It's that guy's number plate. I had followed him to this motel.

104
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,060
It's him. He killed Chi Kook.

105
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,290
Why? Why would a thief kill Na Chi Kook?

106
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,940
 How can you say "pitiful" out of that mouth? You despicable bastard. 

107
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,450
 That's right. I killed him, you monster. 

108
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,400
 I killed an innocent person because of you! 

109
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,720
 He knew my true identity and Chi Kook knew it as well. 

110
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,590
 That's why he killed Chi Kook. 

111
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,170
It's clean. At this rate, you'll become the boy who cried wolf.

112
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,970
 Someone is actively covering up the murders that I commit. 

113
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,240
 Who is it? And why in the world are they doing this? 

114
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,510
Have you taken him to the hospital?

115
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,360
Doing this twice might be a severe side effect of brain surgery.

116
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,550
Thanks.

117
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,800
I just talked to the Blood Analysis Team Leader.

118
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,250
There weren't any signs of poisoning from Na Chi Kook's body.

119
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,800
But there are poisons that don't show up in blood tests.

120
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,550
We should do an autopsy. With an autopsy, we'll know for sure–

121
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,250
An autopsy can only be done if there is evidence of murder. It's something the bereaved family must apply for.

122
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,170
I-I'll give her a call.

123
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,230
A murder?

124
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,560
Yes, that's why Ba Reum insists on an autopsy.

125
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,960
As you might already know, Officer Jung has been showing signs of delusion after his brain surgery.

126
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:53,120
Even before this, he claimed to have killed a person which was revealed to be false.

127
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,720
Your son's condition was already unstable so we were continuously monitoring him.

128
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,480
Heart attacks are a common symptom in patients

129
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,080
who have been unconscious for a long time like your son.

130
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,860
We won't stop you if you want to go ahead with it.

131
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,730
As you know, autopsies involve disassembling the entire body.

132
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,820
If it were me, if it were my child,

133
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,990
I would just let him go in peace.

134
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,040
Mother, all you need to do is sign here.

135
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,670
Let's stop Ba Reum.

136
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,120
Chi Kook won't come back to life by doing this.

137
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,760
But mother, Chi Kook didn't die simply of a heart attack.

138
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,280
If we want to find out who did this, we must do an autopsy–

139
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,000
I said let's stop!

140
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,570
Who would kill my Chi Kook?

141
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,910
Seong Yo Han is already dead. So who would?

142
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,870
I... don't want to put a knife

143
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:22,600
to my Chi Kook's body anymore. Not anymore...

144
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:31,830
My child, Chi Kook, let's send him away now.

145
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,000
Let him go in peace.

146
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,700
But mother–

147
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,270
   

148
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,200
 I can't die just yet. 

149
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,160
 It will be after I catch and kill the person who killed Chi Kook. 

150
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,300
Ba Reum!

151
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,220
Don't take it too hard. Let's find another way.

152
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:44,230
But why did you go to Na Chi Kook's hospital room?

153
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,620
It wasn't even visitation hours.

154
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,750
Because Chi Kook asked me to come.

155
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,630
Na Chi Kook did?

156
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,440
Why? So what did he say?

157
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,910
He said he wanted to have a happy life with his mother.

158
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,740
What?

159
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:12,540
And, I think he was being threatened by someone.

160
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,980
With his mom as the bait.

161
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,900
Threatened?

162
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,300
Ah yes, if that was the case it makes sense why he lied.

163
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,710
- He lied? 
 - Yeah.

164
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,400
 I don't remember the culprit's face. I was attacked from behind. 

165
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,100
He said he was attacked from behind so he couldn't see the face of the guy who stabbed him.

166
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,310
But based on the stab wounds on Na Chi Kook's body, he was definitely attacked from the front.

167
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,600
So it didn't make sense that he said he couldn't see that culprit's face.

168
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,640
But it's possible if he said that because he was being threatened.

169
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,270
There's still one thing I don't understand.

170
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,240
 Just the fact that someone attacked me in the shower. 

171
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,870
Na Chi Kook was attacked in the showers outside.

172
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,370
- Showers? 
 - Yeah.

173
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,350
I found Na Chi Kook's bloodstain there.

174
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:03,260
But Na Chi Kook was found in the magic box in the auditorium.

175
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,340
So how did he move Na Chi Kook to the auditorium?

176
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,510
Anyhow, we need to look into Na Chi Kook's case again from the start.

177
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,640
   

178
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,770
 I want to live a happy life with my mother. 

179
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,250
 Please. 

180
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,810
 Turn yourself in. I can't turn a blind eye to this just because I want to live. 

181
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:03,240
 You must do it. That's how we all live. 

182
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,410
 I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise, Chi Kook. 

183
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,710
 I'm not going to turn myself in right now. 

184
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:17,770
 After I kill the guy who killed you with my own hands, that's when I'll turn myself in. 

185
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:25,080
 But I'm told I'm going to die soon. 

186
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,440
 I'll follow you soon. 

187
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,940
 When I'm... I'm there and we meet... 

188
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,070
- Oppa. 
 - You came.

189
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,710
You're here.

190
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,910
Upon hearing the news that Chi Kook had woken up

191
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,410
we were so happy, as if our Mi Jeong had woken up.

192
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,320
 Mi Jeong. Jo Mi Jeong? 

193
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
You used to come to the hospital frequently as well...

194
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,180
 Song Soo Ho's mother? 

195
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,340
- Our Jong Ho, who left this world first, will be nice to him. 
  - Park Jong Ho's sister? 

196
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,580
He won't be alone so you don't need to worry.

197
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,580
 The families of the people I killed. 

198
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,570
Come here.

199
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,900
Sit down.

200
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,360
You haven't had one meal. Eat something.

201
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,130
Are you okay? It must be hot!

202
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,630
Hey!

203
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,750
Why are you so annoying?

204
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,400
No, I... I'm just worried about you.

205
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,100
- Why are you worried about me? 
 - You came?

206
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,380
- When were you close to Chi Kook? 
 - Hey. Why are you like that to Bong Yi?

207
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,630
You should be thanking her... Ba Reum!

208
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:33,090
Move Bong Yi. I'll do it.

209
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,610
Ah, you came.

210
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:40,750
Go home. Ba Reum is like that because he doesn't want you to have a hard time. Go ahead.

211
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,350
Hey, Oh Bong Yi.

212
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,950
- Please go and eat. 
 - Okay. 
 - Yes.

213
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,270
 Die. 

214
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,140
 Ah. 

215
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,680
 - Die. 
- How did you become a police officer with such low endurance? 

216
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,900
 Ah I give! I give! Ah I give! I give! 

217
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,800
 Grandma will get old and won't live for long. Then you'll be an orphan. 

218
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,200
 You don't have any friends either. 

219
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,430
 Then it'll be easy to deal with you, even if you find out who I am. 

220
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,690
 That's right. There are no conditions like this. 

221
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,850
 She's the woman who'll give birth to my 2nd generation. 

222
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,810
 Don't get sick. You need to be healthy 

223
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,720
 in order for my 2nd generation to be born healthy. 

224
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,680
What should I do about this, Bong Yi?

225
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,080
What should I do?

226
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,230
Did you get the call?

227
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,980
Yes, I told her I don't want to and refused.

228
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,740
She even came to my house to find me. I threw a bunch of salt at her.

229
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,570
I was so speechless.

230
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,790
What phone call?

231
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,670
She must not have called you. Choi Hong Ju asked for an interview.

232
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:02,090
- Interview? 
 - Yes. About the Mujin serial murder case, after one year.

233
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,030
She said she's filming a documentary.

234
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,270
She said they're going to re-examine that case or something like that.

235
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:12,250
- Why all of a sudden? 
 - Exactly, why would she suddenly make that?

236
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,260
She's probably making it just so that she can prove that her child's father wasn't a killer.

237
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:23,120
It's Seong Yo Han, right? That she has Seong Yo Han's child.

238
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:45,450
 She must not have called you. Choi Hong Ju asked for an interview. 

239
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,830
 About the Mujin serial murder case, after one year. 

240
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,100
 She said she's filming a documentary. 

241
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,450
   

242
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,420
 - You look great in uniform.  
  - Thank you. 

243
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,040
 - It's his leg.  
  - But why does he only have one leg? 

244
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,370
 - Ba Reum, this is a penis, right?  
  - It's his leg. 

245
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,260
 - Oh, let go. 
 - My arm is too short. 

246
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,530
 Stop this! Stop this! Stop! 

247
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,350
 Oh? Uncle? 

248
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,300
Let's hurry and go.

249
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,710
   

250
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,270
   

251
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,100
 It's someone who looks similar, right?  
    

252
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,780
 The name and family are different. That's right.  
    

253
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,080
Now that I think about it, I haven't heard from my aunt.

254
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,200
 The number you have called does not exist. 

255
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,580
 The number you have called does not exist. 

256
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,310
What is this? Both of them changed their phone numbers?

257
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,930
   

258
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,890
It is uncle...

259
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,360
What is this?

260
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,370
Thank you.

261
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:25,070
- Where is it from? 
 - Brother-in-law's company sent it.

262
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,910
Let's go inside.

263
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:35,380
     

264
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,250
The company is different, too.

265
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:45,450
But how can he look just like him? Were they twins?

266
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:53,990
 Park Min Seong; Lee Pil Seung. The last names are different, too. 

267
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,880
I'm sorry.

268
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,940
 That's right. It was that. 

269
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,400
 - What the?  
  - Oh no! 

270
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,880
Was it the car from that day?

271
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,700
It was disconnected here.

272
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,900
I don't see it from this point.

273
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:43,000
Ah. Where did it go?

274
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,080
The guy who killed Chi Kook and the car that hit me one year ago... Is this really a coincidence?

275
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,700
Ah, here it is.

276
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,660
- Ah, this number? 
 - Yes.

277
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,600
   

278
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,520
 The number you have called does not exist. 

279
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,400
What is this? Why are they all numbers that don't exist?

280
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,750
- Please do a background check on this person. 
 - Ah, wait a moment.

281
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:15,300
Why is a different person coming out for this number?

282
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,500
- What is this? Why is it like this? 
 - This can't be.

283
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,610
At that time, they would've checked the ID and confirmed everything. What's going on?

284
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,410
- No... 
 - Ah! He settled it with your aunt.

285
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,020
If it's something urgent, you should ask your aunt.

286
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,010
If not, then try contacting the insurance company.

287
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,310
There's no such employee.

288
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,940
No, the accident report has his name on it.

289
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,410
He came to an agreement with my aunt. Look here.

290
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,100
Could you please tell me the vehicle number again?

291
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,600
67 DO 6264.

292
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,530
Ah, it must have been a personnel accident because I was injured.

293
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,750
There is no report of an accident with that vehicle.

294
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:56,080
No... At the police station.

295
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,700
 Just what is going on? 

296
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,720
What are you looking at?

297
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,180
How shameless.

298
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,060
What?

299
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,700
I mean that wench, Choi Hong Ju.

300
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,590
It wasn't long ago that you thought she was cool.

301
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:13,050
Cool, my foot. Out of all the men in the world...

302
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,370
She's looking for a babysitter. She posted it on the mom-cafe of my old neighborhood.

303
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,980
Han Kook, that little kid was found without his lungs.

304
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,380
And she's looking for someone to babysit her child in the midst of all that?

305
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,190
She dares to put up a post?

306
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:31,200
There are a lot comments, so I thought I'd give her a piece of my mind as well. But I can't think of anything.

307
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,000
Eun Chong, peekaboo!

308
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,640
Peekaboo!

309
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,690
- Hey, assistant director.
 - Yes?

310
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,360
- Shake the toy a little. 
 - Oh, yes. 
    

311
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,770
Eun Chong, Eun Chong, Eun Chong! 
    

312
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,450
Eun Chong, Eun Chong! 
    

313
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,290
Eun Chong! 
    

314
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,940
   

315
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,940
   

316
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,060
   

317
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,180
Yes?

318
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,780
 Is this PD Choi Hong Ju's number? 

319
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,870
Yes, it is.

320
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,230
   

321
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,670
Why?

322
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,840
It's not worth writing anything like this.

323
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,450
This is all for attention, Ajumma.

324
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,500
Don't even read this kind of stuff. It's bad for your mental health.

325
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,420
Just hurry up and ring these up for me.

326
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,710
   

327
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,150
   

328
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:37,100
   

329
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,630
Hello, I'm calling after reading the online message you sent.

330
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,860
I think I've seen you before. You seem familiar.

331
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,250
It's because I have a common face.

332
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,100
I hear that a lot.

333
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,060
I don't think you have a common face.

334
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:04,960
Have you ever raised someone else's child before?

335
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,340
No, I haven't.

336
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,830
But since I've raised my son,

337
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,040
I'm confident in raising children.

338
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,660
I see...

339
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,080
Excuse me.

340
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,120
Are you hungry? There we go.

341
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,190
Here.

342
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,730
Then, do you live with  your son?

343
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,720
No.

344
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,890
He died of an accident.

345
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,670
Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

346
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,850
Do you have a plastic bag?

347
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,720
Hold on.

348
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,760
Here.

349
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,450
While I raised my son, when he cried, I always did this.

350
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,980
Then he would strangely stop crying.

351
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:07,250
Right now, he's not crying because he's hungry, but because he needs a diaper change.

352
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,180
Okay.

353
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,500
Come here.

354
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,520
Alright.

355
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,980
Are you able to work starting tomorrow?

356
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,920
Of course.

357
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:33,100
Actually, the last babysitter...

358
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,220
One second.

359
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,590
Yes, Writer Kang.

360
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,360
Really?

361
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,790
Okay, let's hang up for now.

362
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:48,790
Actually, are you able to work starting today?

363
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,380
Yes, of course.

364
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,680
I'll take care of the baby, so don't worry and go to work.

365
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,760
Thank you.

366
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:07,760
How are your eyes so similar?

367
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,450
Your nose is also the same.

368
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,060
Hello, I'm Soo Ho's mother.

369
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,020
How have you been?

370
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,480
I saw you come by our house yesterday.

371
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,220
Don't misunderstand.

372
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,890
I heard it from the bereaved families,

373
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,920
that you're preparing a broadcast.

374
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,570
Yes.

375
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,060
 I'll do it. 

376
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,350
Pardon?

377
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,770
I'll do the interview.

378
00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:00,190
There's something I really want to say on TV.

379
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,650
Okay. When are you free?

380
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,320
Should I go to your place?

381
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,450
No, not my house. Let's meet tomorrow at the broadcasting station.

382
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,470
Oh, sure. Okay.

383
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,630
I'll see you then.

384
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,420
I wonder what it is that she wants to say.

385
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,360
He came alone and left alone?

386
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,110
He was bold enough to come and receive something at the Mujin Police Agency.

387
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,710
Then who's this guy?

388
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,900
It looks like he's handing him a piece of paper.

389
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,480
This guy has to be someone in the police force.

390
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,680
Porn guy. You sent me something new, huh?

391
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,700
This darn punk.

392
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,050
Wait a minute.

393
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,990
Isn't this the statement written by Kang Duk Su's mother?

394
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,690
- Hey, Parachute. 
 - Yes?

395
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,490
I was going to visit you to thank you. Thank you for being the MC at my wedding.

396
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,810
The ceremony went great. I bought you a rock statue too.

397
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,530
It's really cute. I'll give it to you later.

398
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,360
Hey, when did you give the statement written by Kang Duk Su's mother to Detective Lee again?

399
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,390
The day when 'Sherlock Hong Ju' was being shot. I gave it to him right after I got it from her.

400
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,220
Really?

401
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,090
I still can't believe he forgot and handed it in too late.

402
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,520
He really needs to pull himself together.

403
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,550
If he had given that to the captain right away,

404
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,230
you would've gotten released quicker and Bong Yi wouldn't have gotten hurt.

405
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,060
The only good thing that came out of Detective Lee's mistake

406
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,300
is that Kang Duk Su died.

407
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,530
I'm just  saying.

408
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,140
Team Leader.

409
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,620
What time did Detective Lee gave you the statement written by Kang Duk Su's mother?

410
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,940
I don't remember the time.

411
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,000
But he gave it to me while I was throwing a fit at Ki Hyuk for having released you.

412
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,780
So he gave it to you after I got released?

413
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,740
Yes.

414
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,050
He told me he forgot that I gave it to him.

415
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:22,430
There's no way he showed that to someone. It's absurd.

416
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,690
Especially to an outsider.

417
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,800
Look. Detective Lee showed the written statement to OZ at 8:00 p.m.

418
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,150
Then he just kept it with him.

419
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:32,450
Then you released me at 10:00 p.m., and that's when he gave it to the team leader.

420
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:36,190
Why? He no longer needed to keep it hidden because I had already gotten released.

421
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:41,600
This guy, who saw the statement, tried to hit me with a truck while I was on my way to Bong Yi.

422
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,730
And I got in an accident while trying to avoid that truck.

423
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,740
He hit me on the back of my head as soon as I got out of my car.

424
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,840
And he only stole my wallet to make me think he was a robber.

425
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,750
So you're saying he was waiting for you there because he knew you'd go over to Bong Yi?

426
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,490
That's right.

427
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,320
But why?

428
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,950
If I had gotten there on time, Kang Duk Su wouldn't have died.

429
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,170
That means that OZ and Kang Duk Su's killer are a team.

430
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,210
He was buying time for the killer to kill Kang Duk Su.

431
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:11,060
Don't you think you're taking this too far?

432
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:15,560
Does that mean Detective Lee killed Kang Duk Su?

433
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,710
That makes sense. You said the

434
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:22,060
killer might be someone in the police force, so we came here and went through all the CCTV footage.

435
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,850
No, I checked the footage again just in case.

436
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,270
But he was here when Kang Duk Su died.

437
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,520
Yes, he was with me.

438
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,630
Then what is it? Why not just question Detective Lee? Then we might get something.

439
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,430
We need to be careful. If we do anything rash, he might get rid of evidence.

440
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:41,650
- I want you to keep your eyes on Detective Lee and keep looking for that car with license number 6264. 
 - Okay.

441
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,710
Let's keep this between us for now.

442
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,670
- Between us. 
 - Okay.

443
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:53,280
But I think the guy who killed Kang Duk su also has something to do with Na Chi Kook's murder.

444
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,300
What?

445
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,950
- Na Chi Kook was murdered? 
 - Yes.

446
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,150
There's no evidence.

447
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:04,020
But Officer Jung saw something. I think that guy killed Na Chi Kook.

448
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,950
Why did he kill Na Chi Kook?

449
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,690
I think he was being blackmailed.

450
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,840
What do you mean?

451
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:18,500
There's something weird about the place where Seong Yo Han killed Na Chi Kook.

452
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,860
What's so weird?

453
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,480
Do you think I made a mistake?

454
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,060
What are you talking about? What mistake?

455
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,450
What if it wasn't Seong Yo Han?

456
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,420
What if Seong Yo Han wasn't the guy who tried to kill Na Chi Kook?

457
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,660
Don't you remember what he said on the live show?

458
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,820
Seong Yo Han mentioned Na Chi Kook.

459
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,750
He said he judged him because he wasn't prideful.

460
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:49,410
What if it wasn't Seong Yo Han on the phone during the show?

461
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:53,480
- What if Seong Yo Han wasn't the Mujin Serial Killer? 
- Darn it.

462
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,720
But Seong Yo Han cracked Officer Jung's skull open.

463
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,230
He had pictures of Byeon Sun Yeong's corpse in his home.

464
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,600
How could it not have been him?

465
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,230
That's what you call a slam dunk. Slam. Dunk.

466
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,960
Right? Right?

467
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:17,220
But I have a bad feeling about this.

468
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,920
 The fact that it was cleaned up this fast means 

469
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,170
 that it was the work of professionals. 

470
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,580
Quickly!

471
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,270
 When I checked with the criminal database, it came up right away. 

472
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,210
Was it him?

473
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,230
Oh, please come in later.

474
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,240
It is him!

475
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,860
Who are you?  Are you sure you are a family member?

476
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:48,620
 You know your uncle works for an architectural design company after all. 

477
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,760
 It's my uncle. 

478
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,660
There is no departure record under the name of Park Min Seong or Lee Pil Seung.

479
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,820
Then, Kim Hee Jin.

480
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,010
How about Kim Hee Jin or Park Hoon Seok?

481
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,690
They are my aunt and cousin.

482
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,260
There is no departure record.

483
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,060
I see.

484
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,940
- Excuse me. 
 - No one lives there.

485
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,200
They moved.

486
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,730
By chance, did Hoon Seok live here?  I am his cousin.

487
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,310
I suddenly lost contact with him.

488
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:26,120
You must not know that Hoon Seok moved.

489
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,480
Well...

490
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,660
They did move suddenly.

491
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,040
They left like they were fleeing in the middle of the night.

492
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,630
I wondered if something happened.

493
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,440
"Fleeing in the middle of the night?"

494
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,380
When did they move?

495
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,870
Well, Hoon Seok went missing one day.

496
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:47,170
There was such a fuss in search of the kid.

497
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,060
The next morning the kid was brought back.

498
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,360
That same day

499
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,920
the moving truck came and emptied the place.

500
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,970
 That day was the day he slept over at my place. 

501
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:01,040
By chance, who lived here?

502
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,150
Hoon Seok and his mom, the two of them.

503
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,400
How about his dad?

504
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,520
Hoon Seok doesn't have a dad.

505
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,810
They got a divorce when Hoon Seok was a baby.

506
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,130
I heard that he lives in the USA.

507
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:17,210
 Aunt's house was originally in my neighborhood. 

508
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:21,350
 After my surgery, I moved close to aunt's house. 

509
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:24,800
 How do you like it?  Your uncle and I did a lot of legwork to buy this house. 

510
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,830
 The house is more than 50 years old. 

511
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:29,330
 But we remodeled the house ourselves. 

512
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,070
 It was really hard. 

513
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,740
 Ba Reum, I will completely fix your house too. 

514
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,830
 You know your uncle works for an architectural design company after all. 

515
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,350
 So, trust me and leave it to me. 

516
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,470
 - That's right.
 - Let's eat.  Eat. 

517
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,810
 At that time, Hoon Seok definitely wasn't there.  It was only the two of them. 

518
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,660
 You don't remember Hoon Seok, do you? 

519
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,270
 You practically raised Hoon Seok on your back when he was a baby. 

520
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,150
Everything was a lie?

521
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,490
Everything around me was fake?

522
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,200
This is the Family Relations Certificate for Mr. Kim Man Ho.

523
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:04,560
   

524
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,010
Mom doesn't have a sister.

525
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:16,400
 Are you Jae Hoon? 

526
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,900
 Ah, you poor thing! 

527
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,950
 My nephew. 

528
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,690
 Who are you? 

529
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,650
 Jae Hoon, I am your aunt. 

530
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,660
 Your mom's younger sister. 

531
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,130
 I was living in America, 

532
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,760
 so I received the news late. 

533
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,950
 It's bothersome having people look at me strangely, 

534
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:44,910
 so I need to live looking just like other people. 

535
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,130
 Aunt... 

536
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:48,710
 Unnoticed. 

537
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,400
 My heart aches so much. 

538
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,390
 Don't worry. 

539
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,010
 From now on, let's live together with aunt. 

540
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:10,640
 This is the house you will live in from now on. 

541
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,380
 Glad to see you, Jae Hoon. I am your uncle. 

542
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,030
 Hello. 

543
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:24,920
 Jae Hoon, I will move you to my family registry. 

544
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,610
 Then, please change my name for me as well. 

545
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,230
 What name would you like? 

546
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,710
 Ba Reum. 

547
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:33,980
 "Righteous Jung," Jung Ba Reum. 

548
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,910
Hourly wage is...

549
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,860
Ah, this is pretty good.

550
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,690
Ah, I left all my things at the company.

551
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,130
I can't ask to have them delivered to me, either.

552
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,730
Okay, it's not like I did anything wrong.

553
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,240
I can just go pick them up, that's all.

554
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,840
Writer Kang, it looks like I might be a little late.

555
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,700
Song Soo Ho's mother is probably waiting in the lobby.

556
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,150
For now, escort her upstairs.

557
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,400
Okay, I got it.

558
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,830
Where in the world did the Assistant Director go when we are so busy!

559
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,070
Hey, Bong Yi, what's with you?  Ignoring calls even?

560
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:15,540
I am sorry.

561
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,840
- Actually—
 - Whatever.  Let's hear your excuses later.

562
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,230
Go to the cafe in the lobby and escort a guest here.

563
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,820
I am sorry, but today, I am here just to get my things—

564
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,230
Go look for Song Soo Ho's mother.

565
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,350
She's a bereaved family member of the Mujin serial killings case victims.

566
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:30,090
So pay extra attention and politely escort her here.

567
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,830
Mujin serial...

568
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,360
Why would she come here?

569
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,390
She agreed to an interview for that case's special edition.

570
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:39,460
- Why that case, all of a sudden?
 - I don't know either.

571
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,210
PD Choi sure does things to bring herself trouble.

572
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,420
Anyway, go down and escort her here, okay?

573
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:52,150
Am I not enough?

574
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:54,970
Even other bereaved family members, too.

575
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,570
This punk's fingerprints might have been left.

576
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:07,380
Kang Duk Su's mother's testimony.

577
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,060
Kang Duk Su, Kang Duk Su.

578
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,970
Ah, damn!

579
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:22,190
This punk, Jung Ba Reum, I told him to organize it right!

580
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,870
Yes, Ma'am, it's me.

581
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:56,910
I have something to ask you.  Where are you now?

582
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:00,010
 - I have some things to attend to, so I am out of the house. 
 - Where are you?

583
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:04,180
I am at the OBN broadcasting company for an interview.

584
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,500
An interview?

585
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,430
Okay, I will go there now.

586
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,460
What is this about?

587
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,990
Did you come to meet Choi Hong Ju?

588
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:17,160
Yes.

589
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,300
Please don't do the interview.

590
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:22,880
I am saying please don't get used.

591
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,030
I am the granddaughter of Gudong's grandmother.

592
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,320
The one who was killed by Seong Yo Han.

593
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,960
Choi Hong Ju, knowing that I am a victim's family member,

594
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,640
approached me pretending ignorance.

595
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,950
I think there is some sort of misunderstanding.

596
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:49,670
- PD Choi is not a bad person—
 - No.

597
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,710
It's because you don't know.

598
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,000
After what happened to Soo Ho,

599
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,260
I tried many times to kill myself and follow him.

600
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,580
One day I jumped into water,

601
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:06,010
but PD Choi jumped in and saved me.

602
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:10,500
She could have died as well.

603
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,380
At the hospital,

604
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,440
she even nursed me throughout the night.

605
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,930
Maybe she at least had a little bit of a guilty conscience.

606
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,900
Do you know who Choi Hong Ju is?

607
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,490
She is Seong Yo Han's lover.

608
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:27,110
She even had his baby and is raising her now.

609
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,160
I know.  I heard.

610
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:34,940
At that time, I was wondering why she was so devoted to me.

611
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,200
It was because she had that kind of relationship with Seong Yo Han.

612
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,200
I came to understand that.

613
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:45,000
Seong Yo Han is the bad one, not PD Choi, right?

614
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,650
It must have been hard for PD Choi, too.

615
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:50,400
- We should understand—
 - No.

616
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,450
Choi Hong Ju is a strange woman.

617
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:56,570
If necessary, she will use anyone.

618
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:59,460
So, please don't get used.

619
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,710
And don't do the interview, please.

620
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:03,540
I called her first.

621
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,830
To do the interview.

622
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,260
Why?

623
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:15,320
Because there is something I really want to say.

624
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,320
Because it keeps bothering me.

625
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:23,010
What is?

626
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:30,780
I don't think Seong Yo Han is the culprit.

627
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,310
What did you say?

628
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:43,210
What are they doing here?

629
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:50,960
Why aren't you going upstairs?

630
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,310
- Well...
 - First, come with me, please.

631
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,630
Choi Hong Ju!

632
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,580
Just because we said we wouldn't do it, you lured Soo Ho's mother in?

633
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,500
It's not that. I–

634
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,740
If we told you not to do the broadcast, shouldn't you understand?

635
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,930
Why are you reopening our wounds all over again?

636
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,470
I'm not trying to pick sides. It will be according to the facts–

637
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:15,220
"According to the facts?"

638
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,720
Even a dog passing by would laugh at that.

639
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,990
You're using naive Song Soo Ho's mother to put your man at an advantage.

640
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,590
You're making this documentary to exonerate him, aren't you?

641
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:28,280
Just because you want to prove that your child isn't the child of a killer!

642
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,580
Don't speak so carelessly.

643
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:33,460
You shameless wench. Of all the men in the world!

644
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,040
Please don't say things you will regret.

645
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,120
What did you just say?

646
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,550
- Why are you doing this? 
 - You witch!

647
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,400
Let go of her and we can talk!

648
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,500
- Let go of her! 
 - How dare you!

649
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,040
Hey! Hey! Ma'am!

650
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,060
Ma'am!

651
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:48,000
- Please calm down! 
 - Bring my daughter back!

652
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,060
 I don't think Seong Yo Han is the culprit. 

653
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:58,860
At first, when I heard what Seong Yo Han had done to my child,

654
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,530
I was so shocked that I couldn't think of anything.

655
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:10,020
But as time passed by, I thought it might not be the doctor.

656
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,760
So, I wanted to talk about it.

657
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,940
About the Doctor Seong Yo Han that I know.

658
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,310
What is it?

659
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:23,220
I'll talk about it during the interview.

660
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:33,390
So, you believe that Seong Yo Han isn't the culprit?

661
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,680
I fought with him myself–

662
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,830
Did you see his face?

663
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,760
Was it Seong Yo Han for sure?

664
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:47,210
No, at the time...

665
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,030
I couldn't see his face at the time, but

666
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:54,620
I definitely saw Seong Yo Han trying to hit Oppa's head and kill him.

667
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:58,440
Besides, the victims' photos were found at Seong Yo Han's house.

668
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,290
I don't understand that part either.

669
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:05,930
That's why I thought I'd just stay quiet about it.

670
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:10,690
But I still wanted to talk about the things I'd seen myself.

671
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,440
What's with that lady?

672
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,060
So annoying.

673
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,950
So why are you doing this again?

674
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,080
I don't understand.

675
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,570
Are you really making this so that Seong Yo Han will be exonerated?

676
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,640
You shouldn't be doing this, at least not for my sake.

677
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,600
Let's go. I'll give you a ride to your house.

678
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,600
What about the interview?

679
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,980
Let's go, I said.

680
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,850
By the way, why did you call me?

681
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,540
I wanted to see some old photos of Song Soo Ho.

682
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,710
Why do you want to see Soo Ho's photos?

683
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:59,140
There is something I need to check.

684
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:09,280
 Oh, that child? He was so odd. 

685
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:15,560
 He brought a mouse from somewhere and put it in the snake's cage. Ah, it was such a mess. 

686
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:21,270
 The child's mother was practically begging so he managed to graduate. 

687
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:26,340
 According to the rumors, he kept causing trouble even after he went to elementary school. 

688
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:31,050
 I heard he went to Guryeong elementary school. 

689
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:55,660
 You can draw whatever you want to in today's art class. 

690
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,480
 Class President, does it itch a lot? 

691
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,880
 You should stop drawing and go to the infirmary– 

692
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,480
 Why did you kill the rabbit? 

693
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:31,500
 I was curious to know if it had actually gotten fat or was pregnant. 

694
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,180
 What? 

695
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,220
Who's this?

696
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,660
Jeong Jae Hoon?

697
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:52,160
Jeong Jae Hoon.

698
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,560
 Mom. 

699
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,430
 Mom. 

700
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,640
Mom.

701
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,970
 It was me. 

702
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,680
 I... 

703
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,020
 I killed my entire family. 

704
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,420
Mom.

705
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,180
Why are you crying?

706
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,720
 You monster. Die. Die! 

707
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:54,660
 Die! 

708
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,620
Die!

709
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:17,430
Song Soo Ho.

710
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:26,350
    

711
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:35,750


712
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:42,580
   

713
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:44,460
 Where did he start following me? 

714
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,130
 Seong Yo Han tried to kill Na Chi Kook. 

715
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:48,720
 OZ killed Na Chi Kook. 

716
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,430
 Money? I do this because of my sense of duty. 

717
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:55,250
 Who are you guys? A group of psychopaths? 

718
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,660
 Who in the hell are you guys? 

719
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,280
 Let's move on our own for a while. 

720
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,420
 Because something is bothering me. 

721
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,290
 Why? 

722
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:05,880
 My little sister, Jennifer. 

723
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,940
 Welcome to the rattrap, you rat bastards! 

724
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:14,110
♫  I will take it with me  ♫
