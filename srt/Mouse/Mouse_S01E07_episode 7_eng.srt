1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,180


2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,030
   

3
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,700
   

4
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,110
Just a second.

5
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,010
I can see his head.

6
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,220
Just a little more.

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,030
More, more!

8
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,730
Baby.

9
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,100
Is he okay?

10
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,040
You worked hard.

11
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,690
How can he look just like me?

12
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,070
No one can deny he is Han Seo Joon's child.

13
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,460
Here.

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,240
You should hold him too. Heâ€™s our child.

15
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,900
   

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,570
Did you have a nightmare?

17
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,260
Nightmare?

18
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,320
How did I get here? 
    

19
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,190
I went to your house to give you receipts...

20
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,790
It's a relief I discovered you. Something could have really gone wrong.

21
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,000
I was going to report it...

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,340
It was your son, right?

23
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,050
It's a misunderstanding.

24
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,180
He was trying to stop me from hurting myself. You misunderstood the situation.

25
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,870
So you shouldn't report it, okay? Huh? Never.

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,550
Okay. Thank you.

27
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,830
My cellphone...

28
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,270
I brought it. Here.

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,800
   

30
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,030
Oppa. Oppa!

31
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,070
Oppa!

32
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,140
Oppa, are you okay?

33
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,410
Oppa. Wake up. Oppa!

34
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,020
There are two emergency patients here. Please send an ambulance as soon as possible.

35
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,390
- Here. This is... 
 - Oppa, wake up!

36
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,550
- 356-4 Gu-Ryeong Ro. 
 - Ajusshi! Ajusshi!

37
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,160
Th-The house with the green door on the rooftop!

38
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,670
What do I do?

39
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,800
Where is Han Kook? I said, where is Han Kook?

40
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,400
That's right. Han Kook. Where is Han Kook, you bastard?

41
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,100
What?

42
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,670
No!

43
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,290
Hey, you bastard. Come to your senses!

44
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,840
Where is the child?

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,660
 Tonight, around 9 o'clock, a police officer and the suspect of the Mujin serial killings got into a fight. 

46
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,840
 Both of them were seriously injured and taken to the hospital. 

47
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,800
 Breaking news. Suspect in the Mujin serial murder case who claimed to be god and who got into a fight with a man in his 20's 

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,810
 turned out to be Officer Jung Ba Reum. 

49
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,270
You can't go in. Stop her!

50
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,660
Just a moment!

51
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,350
He will go into surgery! Please call room 5!

52
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,770
Jung Ba Reum will go into surgery.

53
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,560
 Officer Jung Ba Reum suffered a major head injury upon getting hit with a blunt object that the suspect swung at him. 

54
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,940
 He is the primary witness for the murder of the elderly woman. 

55
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,960
 The police suspect that the attacker was trying to break into Officer Jung's house in order to shut him up. 

56
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,300
This is the frontal lobe, and the fracture in this area is very severe.

57
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,600
The patient is unconscious to the point of not being able to respond at all even to pain, so the prognosis is not good.

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,830
What about Seong Yo Han?

59
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:38,100
The bullet penetrated his abdomen and the small intestine causing serious damage to surrounding organs.

60
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,520
Well, his prognosis doesn't look good either.

61
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,310
But first, we'll have to wait until after the surgery.

62
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
Seong Yo Han. Where is Seong Yo Han?

63
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,580
- Huh? 
 - I asked, where is my child?

64
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,790
Ah! His condition isn't good, so he went into surgery.

65
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,680
First, calm down and sign the guardian form.

66
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,720
How bad is his condition? How bad?

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,130
Ah, it's a little hard to say...

68
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,160
Did you shoot him?

69
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,650
My pitiful Yo Han.

70
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,670
Did you shoot that pitiful child?

71
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,980
Pitiful?

72
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,580
Your son?

73
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,830
Then what about Officer Jung?

74
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:46,690
Your son struck Officer Jung on the head with a hammer and almost killed him by smashing his head!

75
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,190
Your son is pitiful?

76
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,610
How do I handle this?

77
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,450
How?

78
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,540
   

79
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,510
What about Han Kook? Have you not found him yet?

80
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,110
I asked if you found him!

81
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,010
We searched nearby Seong Yo Han's house, but there was nothing.

82
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:52,900
I think he was moved somewhere else then.

83
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,960
Then?

84
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,410
Officer Shin and I stopped Seong Yo Han's car and checked his trunk.

85
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,250
But Han Kook wasn't there.

86
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,290
I think we found him!

87
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,260
Oh!

88
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,020
Wow. 
  (T/N: They are spraying luminol which turns purple when it detects blood proteins.) 

89
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,210
Give me that.

90
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,400
Damn!

91
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,340
He definitely must have switched cars here.

92
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,360
Check the CCTV footage in the surrounding areas.

93
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,370
Check all of the cars that have passed at the same time. Also, confirm the unregistered vehicles.

94
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,720
Let's hurry and go.

95
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,680
We have to check all of the cars coming out of this street.

96
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,260
- This car, too. 
 - I found it. The unregistered vehicle.

97
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,440
Put it on the big screen.

98
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,810
The vehicle number is 10 Mo 4219.

99
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,050
10 Mo 4219. Follow that car.

100
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,170
Check all the CCTV where the car appears.

101
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,650
- It's not caught from there. 
 - What is that? Where is that?

102
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,660
Show the map.

103
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,480
There. There is a nursing hospital that closed 20 years ago.

104
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,220
Run, run.

105
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,720
Hurry and go!

106
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,200
Hurry, hurry.

107
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,590
Sunbae!

108
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,920
Is there anything?

109
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,060
Oh, this was in the carrier.

110
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,190
This is the right place.

111
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,200
I'll let everyone know about it.

112
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,150
What is this?

113
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,790
 Sunbae, hurry and come here! 

114
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,000
Confirm it.

115
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,150
Call the forensics team.

116
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,190
He has the child with him, so he probably hasn't gotten far.

117
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:57,600
Keeping in mind the possibility of abandonment of the corpse, search the insides of the buildings, surrounding woods, everywhere thoroughly.

118
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,020
 While the surgery of "A," the man believed to be a serial killer, is underway, 

119
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,740
 the police are concentrating all their efforts on finding the missing Kim Han Kook. 

120
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,880
 They're doing a progress briefing in the lobby.  Hurry, let's go! 

121
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,860
 Seong Yo Han's surgery went well. 

122
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:41,550
 We excised the areas with severe organ damage, washed the abdominal cavity to remove the infection and performed necrotic tissue removal. 

123
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,110
 How is Officer Jung Ba Reum's condition? 

124
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,940
The frontal lobe is severely damaged due to a cerebral hemorrhage.

125
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,900
 Since the intra cranial pressure kept rising, there was a cause for concern over brain herniation, so we performed an emergency surgery. 

126
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,800
 However, due to a heavy cerebral hemorrhage, we had to stop the surgery, leaving a partly damaged brain. 

127
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,410
   

128
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:13,250
 Officer Jung is dying from his brain being smashed by the hammer your son swung. 

129
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,900
 I felt sorry for you because you were in pain due to the fact that you were a murderer's child. 

130
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,470
 Every time I saw you, I thought that you were a lot like me. 

131
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,260
 That's why Iâ€“ 

132
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,760
 You'll never get redemption from the things you did... Not even after death. 

133
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,210
 This is the best I can do for you. 

134
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,690
 While there is no progress in the search for Kim Han Kook, Officer Jung Ba Reum's condition has become more critical. 

135
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,800
 We have been informed that his surgery has been suspended. 
   

136
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,790
 Due to this situation, the citizens' harsh criticism is falling on the government. 

137
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:57,330
 According to the survey, the President's approval rating dropped as much as 40% compared to last month. 

138
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:02,320
 Their handling of the Mujin serial killings being the big cause for the negative evaluation, 

139
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,520
 the ruling party's approval rating is also at its worst. 

140
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,850
 With the presidential election one year away, all are paying attention to whether the ruling party will maintain its long-term power, 

141
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:33,770
 or if the long-feuding opposition party will recapture the regime. 

142
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,120
A package has arrived for you.

143
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,700
- Who sent it? 
 - The thing is... There is no sender.

144
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:47,080
 The publicâ€™s support from a year ago... 

145
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,460
 During the year ahead, the elections... 

146
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,320
   

147
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,650
The swelling in Officer Jung Ba Reum's brain has decreased a little.

148
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,160
 After meeting with Neurosurgeons, Officer Jung Ba Reum's surgery is considered a success! His progress will be monitored. 

149
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,270
 We have decided to attempt another surgery. 

150
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,360
- My kid! 
 - No, you can't!

151
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,280
I want to ask where my child is!

152
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,550
Come out!

153
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,040
Oppa is dying, but you're going to live, you bastard?

154
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,220
Die. Die, you bastard!

155
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,820
   

156
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,410
 The surgery was a success. 

157
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,210
 In the patient's case, there was not only the primary damage to the brain due to a skull depression fracture, 

158
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:44,320
but secondary damage due to the increased intracranial pressure also occurred.  He is in serious condition.

159
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,310
After monitoring his progress, we will be doing two or three more surgeries.

160
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,980
It is now out of the hands of the doctors.

161
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,420
The sincere prayers of everyone is needed.

162
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,320
- What is it? Did something go wrong with the surgery? 
 - Is Officer Jung Ba Reum in critical condition?

163
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,240
Patient Seong Yo Han has died.

164
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:11,450
 Patient Seong Yo Han's direct cause of death is acute septic shock. 

165
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,100
 During the surgery performed earlier, we removed the infected areas as much as possible. 

166
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,940
 However, it is presumed that the septic shock death was caused by leftover infection inside the abdominal cavity. 

167
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,710
You should have died after telling us where Han Kook is!

168
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,400
 After three major surgeries, Officer Jung Ba Reum has not regained consciousness even after ten days, 

169
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,080
 causing the entire nation to feel regretful. 

170
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,620
 Everyone is praying together for Officer Jung to wake up. 

171
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,650
 While vigils are being held all over the country for Officer Jung, 

172
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,850
 stories of Officer Jung's good deeds are spreading. 

173
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,700
   

174
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,580
Usually, animals are prohibited in patient rooms.

175
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,430
The Director gave special permission because it's Officer Jung Ba Reum.

176
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,150
Oppa...

177
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,060
You can hear Uh Bung Yi, right?

178
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,710
Uh Bung Yi is also telling you to wake up quickly.

179
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:38,050
Listen to Uh Bung Yi and wake up quickly, okay?

180
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,600
Ajusshi, I'm really okay.

181
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,470
What do you mean you're okay? Just look at you! You look like you're about to faint!

182
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,900
What is the big deal if I faint? Because of me, Ba Reum Oppa isâ€“

183
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:28,190
Bong Yi... It's not because of you. So don't feel guilty about it.

184
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,590
They said the surgery went well. He'll wake up soon.

185
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,380
Now, lay down. Take off your shoes.

186
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,550
- Yes. 
 - Hello.

187
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,520
Get some rest. Don't fret about him.

188
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,560
- Ajusshi. 
 - Yeah? What?

189
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,910
Thank you.

190
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,480
If it weren't for you,

191
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,690
Oppa Ba Reum would've died.

192
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,720
And... for giving me strength.

193
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,670
Get some sleep, kid.

194
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,350
   

195
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,480
 What should I do with all my sins? 

196
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,290
 My sins... 

197
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,340
Where did Uh Bung Yi go?

198
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,460
- Oh no! 
 - How sad!

199
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,520
Mom!

200
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,170
Where is this?

201
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,550
Oppa!

202
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,430
Oppa! Oppa!

203
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,440
Oppa!

204
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,140
- How many are these? 
 - Two.

205
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,750
How about this plus this?

206
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,640
Ten.

207
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,750
What is this?

208
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,680
It's a ballpoint pen.

209
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,380
What is your name?

210
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,000
How about your age?

211
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,350
Who is this?

212
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,880
Why can't he remember anything?

213
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,950
His frontal and temporal lobes were damaged in the accident. There's a structure in the temporal lobe, which is the hippocampus.

214
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,500
A nudge to it could result to memory disorder.

215
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:35,220
From what I have noticed, it seems to be due to a temporary shock from the surgery.

216
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,460
Brain surgery is a serious surgery.

217
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:42,690
It might be too much to expect his brain to function normally already.

218
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:48,660
Oppa... Do you really not remember me?

219
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,790
Not even a bit?

220
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,190
 Who is this? 

221
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,090
Don't look at me like a stranger.

222
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:04,690
You were such a loving and caring person to me.

223
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,560
I'm too tired. I need to sleep.

224
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:30,960
 To celebrate the discharge of Officer Jung Ba Reum, who was seriously injured after fighting a serial killer and received three brain surgeries, 

225
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,730
the hospital entrance is crowded with people from all over the country.

226
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,770
He's coming out! He's coming out!

227
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,290
Thank you.

228
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,050
Jung Ba Reum!

229
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,080
Excuse me. Excuse me

230
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,880
Thank you. Thank you.

231
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,900
Sit here.

232
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,150
Rest here for a while. I'll cook some rice porridge for you.

233
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,080
Okay.

234
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,120
Gosh.

235
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,460
   

236
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,890
   

237
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:34,910
I must've been a good person.

238
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,970
Hey, are you kidding me?

239
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,680
Ever since you were a child, you were an upright kid that never once caused problems.

240
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,940
And you're the same now, Ba Reum. You're a really kind and just person.

241
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,930
That's a relief.

242
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,710
That's your 100-day photo.

243
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,020
Where's my mom?

244
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,090
When you were young, she passed away from an accident on a rainy day.

245
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,280
How can I not remember any of this?

246
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,860
It's because you had several big surgeries.

247
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,060
The doctor says it's nothing to worry about.

248
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,660
It will all come back slowly. So don't feel rushed.

249
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,050
At any rate, let's hurry with the move.

250
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,580
If not, the house would have been redeveloped anyway.

251
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,500
I can't leave you alone

252
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,020
in this horrid place anymore.

253
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,400
Make sure to say it was a mistake. Say that you were aiming for his leg, but you missed.

254
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,120
Tell them that you have a nephew of Han Kook's age and you reacted that way because it made you think of your nephew.

255
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,030
I have no nephew. I'm an only child. A precious only child after 10 years' effort.

256
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,780
- Just say you do! That way you wouldn't get disciplined. 
 - Alright.

257
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,610
I can't believe you followed all of this troublemaker's orders.

258
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,050
You know that your dad can't get you out of everything.

259
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,680
Please come in.

260
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,880
I have a nephew like Han Kook.

261
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,890
So I did it because of my nephew.

262
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,660
I'm sorry.

263
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,740
Detective Go Mu Chi. Why did you not shoot the suspect's leg?

264
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,230
Don't you know the rules for using guns and aiming for the lower body after a blank bullet warning?

265
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,800
In the situation where he was about to hit the police,

266
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,770
if he had followed the rules for firearm use,

267
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,100
Jung Ba Reum wouldn't be alive right now.

268
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,650
Please tell us yourself, Detective Go Mu Chi.

269
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,970
It was an accidental discharge, right?

270
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,500
You were aiming for his leg but you aimed wrong, right?

271
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,760
No, it wasn't an accidental discharge.

272
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,640
I shot that bastard trying to kill him.

273
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,200
So please investigate for murder.

274
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,850
Ah, this crazy guy.

275
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,940
I will let you know the results of the Disciplinary Committee for Detective Go Mu Chi.

276
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,520
In an urgent situation of using firearms to rescue the victim,

277
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,310
we concluded with no charges.

278
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,540
What are you talking about?

279
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,330
- I told you that I killed someone. 
 - Sunbae.

280
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,460
I intentionally shot the gun. Do you not understand?

281
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,290
I told you I deliberately shot him!

282
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,090
I intentionally shot to kill him!

283
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,550
One year suspension and 6 month salary reduction for Officer Go Mu Chi.

284
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,240
And two months salary reduction for Detective Shin Sang.

285
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,770
- Dismiss the Disciplinary Committee for Directors. 
 - Wait a minute. Please wait a minute! Wait a minute!

286
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,830
- Wait a minute! 
 - Sunbae!

287
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,230
Please send me to that bastard!

288
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,120
Please send me to Han Seo Joon. Send me to jail!

289
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,080
- Aigoo! 
 - Chief!

290
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,890
- Chief. Are you okay? 
 - Chief!

291
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,550
You are bleeding.

292
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,470
Aigo, father.

293
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,160
We will start the surgery now. Please give the anesthesia.

294
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,170
Please lift your head.

295
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,990
The anesthetic will be given to Choi Hong Ju.

296
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,910
 I'm sorry, baby. 

297
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,850
 From the basement of Seong Yo Han's house, 
   

298
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:12,080
a photo of the body of the second victim, Byeon Sun Yeong, was found.

299
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,860
Also, during the approximated times of the victims' deaths,

300
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,830
the location of Seong Yo Han's cellphone

301
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,470
 has been confirmed to be near the site of the crimes. 

302
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,720
The witnesses, Officer Jung Ba Reum

303
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,230
and Miss "A," whom he followed home and attempted to murder,

304
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,190
and with additional circumstantial evidence,

305
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,200
we have determined that

306
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,240
Seong Yo Han is behind the Mujin serial murders.

307
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,540
 Ba Reum! 

308
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,470
I'm coming out.

309
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,570
- I'm throwing this out. 
 - Okay.

310
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,800
I'll take this with me.

311
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,710
Since it overlaps with what I'm studying.

312
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,080
I'm going to prepare for the corrections government official exam.

313
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,270
- A corrections officer? 
 - Yeah.

314
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,620
I promised Chi Kook that if he woke up,

315
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,970
I would work with him.

316
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,310
Chi Kook? Chi?

317
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,440
Dude. Chi Kook, you, and I were the three musketeers.

318
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,960
Check if you have anything to take in the backyard.

319
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,670
 - That's getting thrown out, so just leave it out. 
 - Okay. 

320
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,230
 Thank you. 

321
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,230
Is this also getting loaded?

322
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,820
You can just leave that.

323
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,400
Then everything is loaded. Come out and we'll get going.

324
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,220
 However, since Seong Yo Han has died, and there is no right of arraignment, 

325
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,140
 the case will be forwarded to the prosecution. 

326
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,890
 Even after the case has been forwarded, 

327
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,470
 the search for Kim Han Kook will continue. 

328
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:42,190
â™«  That day when a soft wind passed by briefly  â™«

329
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:48,500
â™«  You and I faced each other  â™«

330
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,880
â™«  I'm forgetting the memories  â™«

331
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,270
â™«  The colors are fading, getting weaker  â™«

332
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,780
 Bong Yi, when you become an adult, marry me. 
  â™«  of the day I looked at you  â™«

333
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:10,280
â™«  Even if the wish that I hoped for grows smaller  â™«

334
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,720
â™«  That vivid gaze of yours,  â™«

335
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,720
â™«  will it remain?  â™«

336
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,640
 Kang Duk Su, whose sentence was reduced to 10 years after medical approval, 

337
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,360
 is getting released a day from today. 

338
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,350
 The police are preparing in case an incident occurs, 

339
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,670
 and are on high alert. 

340
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:37,290
 Surrounding Building A in Mujin, where it is suspected Kang Duk Su will live, 

341
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,870
 a tense atmosphere is already present. 

342
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,470
 As the police constantly comes and go, 

343
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,350
 residents have been watching this with worry 

344
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,320
 and voicing their concern. 

345
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,670
Sentence Kang Duk Su to death!

346
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,540
Sentence him! Sentence him!

347
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,780
Guarantee a safe world!

348
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,480
Guarantee it! Guarantee it!

349
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,580
- Oh Bong Yi... sorry. 
 - Reform the sentence for sexual offenses!

350
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,540
Reform it!  Reform it!

351
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,540
- Guarantee a safe world! 
 - Guarantee it! Guarantee it!

352
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,300
Sentence Kang Duk Su to death!

353
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,320
- Oh Bong Yi 
 - Sentence him! Sentence him!

354
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,560
I'm sorry.

355
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,880
Guarantee it! Guarantee it!

356
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,520
That's a relief. It doesn't seem like she's here.

357
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,400
Guarantee a safe world!

358
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,530
Guarantee it! Guarantee it!

359
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,520
Kill him!

360
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,790
Kill him!

361
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,700
Kill him!

362
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,680
Hey, are you even human?!

363
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,550
Kang Duk Su.

364
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,130
Officer Go?

365
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,050
You have a good memory.

366
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,240
Yes, it's me. The very one who locked you up in there.

367
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,030
Why... are you here?

368
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,720
I came to give you a warning.

369
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,820
If you do something like that one more time, you'll die at my hands.

370
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:08,260
I'm sorry.  I'll live my whole life repenting.

371
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:14,110
I've got radar on my eyes right now because I'm willing to catch and kill anyone.

372
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,050
Heed my words.

373
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:21,960
I'll work really, really hard.

374
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,660
He needs to die!

375
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:37,540
He's not human!

376
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,760
Just where did you disappear to, Oh Bong Yi?

377
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:48,360
 The campaigning for the election of the 20th President starts today. 
   

378
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,210
 The ruling party, National Party's Lee Kyeong Sun... 

379
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,810
â™«  Our Kyeong Sun, our Kyeong Sun, number 1...  â™«

380
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,900
Hey!  Let me sleep!

381
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,080
â™«  Our Kyeong, National Party's...  â™«

382
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,830
All that bullsh*t so early in the morning! Bullsh*t!
  â™«  Preparing for you, number 1  â™«

383
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:29,160
â™«  Number 1, our Kyeong Sun  â™«

384
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,790
Make as much noise as you want.  I'm going to vote for the candidate who brings back capital punishment.

385
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:38,350
My gosh.
â™«  Number 1, our Kyeong Sun  â™«

386
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:43,240
â™«  Our Kyeong Sun, our Kyeong Sun number 1  â™«

387
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,930
- Yes, Team Leader. 
 - Yes.

388
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:48,850
 You rested well for a year, right?  You're being transferred. 

389
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,560
Where to?

390
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,660
Aigoo.

391
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,120
You suffered being trapped in a place like this, Detective Shin.

392
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,800
Those small-minded people.  It's not like I did it on purpose.

393
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,360
All that just for a senior superintendent's chin getting a little hurt.

394
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,390
They send me to a place like this to convalesce for a year?

395
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,070
Anyway, when I get back on the Violent Crimes Team,

396
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,610
I won't have to wear this uniform anymore.

397
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,310
It will be bye bye to Pyeongan Police Station.  Bye bye.

398
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:25,920
I'm Officer Jung Ba Reum, who has been assigned to work at Pyeongan Police Station as of today.

399
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,410
Officer Jung, I heard the news that you were coming in as my successor.

400
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,850
- Let's work together well. 
 - Let's work together well.

401
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,780
The face of Pyeongan Police Station,

402
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,050
Officer Jung is here.

403
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,890
Officer Nam, why aren't you going to get it?

404
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,160
You know that the whole country is cheering you on, right?

405
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,350
Just think of this as an adjustment period and don't overdo it.  Got it?

406
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:51,570
- I'll work hard. 
 - But I told you not to work hard.

407
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,800
Why don't you have some of this. It's Chong Myoung Tang.
 (T/N: A medicine that's meant to clear your mind.) 

408
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,920
- Sit down and drink it. 
 - Oh, okay.

409
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,220
Put that down for a minute and follow me.

410
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,470
There are a lot of things to do for transfer of duty.

411
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,150
Rest, rest, rest.  Sit down and eat.

412
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,870
Why?  I need to do a transfer of duty quickly so that I can get everything in order.

413
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,880
An order came down from the higher ups.

414
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,590
- He's still not back to normal. He still needs to rest. 
 - What?

415
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,810
Isn't he all better? Then why was he reinstated?

416
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,160
The presidential elections are not far off!

417
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,460
The entire country was wishing for Jung Ba Reum to survive.

418
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,290
If people see that Jung Ba Reum has safely been reinstated and working well as a police officer,

419
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,340
that will make the ruling party's approval ratings go

420
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,420
far far up and will get fixed up there.

421
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,650
- I'm sorry to say this to you, Detective Shin, butâ€“ 
 - Why? What is it?

422
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,970
We can't have anything happen to him if he overdoes it.  Don't make him work.  Leave him be.

423
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,560
No matter what, leave him be.

424
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,590
If he wants to go home, let him go.

425
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,960
If he doesn't come to work, then think, "Oh, he didn't come."  Okay?

426
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,430
What is he, some kind of royalty? Looks like Officer Nam is going to suffer from this.

427
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:52,810
The Nation's Son has a strong backing.

428
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,210
So, did all your memories come back?

429
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,400
Ah, yes. There are some missing parts,

430
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,560
but I got most of them back.

431
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,940
That's fortunate.  Then, you remember Detective Go, right?

432
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:15,580
I heard a lot about him from Dong Koo, but the memories about Detective Go are still...

433
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,280
Wow! You don't remember Detective Go?

434
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,790
- This kid's still not back to being normal yet. 
 - Pardon?

435
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,230
What?

436
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,140
I heard you live in a nearby neighborhood somewhere around here, is that right?

437
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,230
Yes, I live behind this apartment.

438
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,080
My aunt wanted me to move near her place.

439
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,750
Your aunt lives here as well, I see.

440
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,340
Anyway, I wonder if I returned to work prematurely.

441
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,820
I need to do well, but I worry that I might become a nuisance.

442
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,600
That's right.  A nuisance, a nuisance.  I am leaving,

443
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,080
- but Officer Nam who is left behindâ€” 
 - Just a moment, please.

444
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,340
- Why? Why? Why? 
 - Can you pull over here, please?

445
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,260
Who did this again?

446
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,940
Why does he enter the race and subject himself to something like this?

447
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,380
I am going to vote for him.

448
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,200
- What? 
 - While I was staying at home, I had a lot of time,

449
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,700
so I listened to all the candidates' speeches and searched their pledges.

450
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,250
I thought that he was most sincere

451
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,690
and he seemed to have a definite plan for our country's future.

452
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,970
He is a very admirable person.

453
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,300
Thank you, Officer Jung.

454
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,650
Detective Shin, why are you doing this?

455
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,410
Just stay still.  There is a reason.

456
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,100
Why are you doing this?

457
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,340
- Detective Shin, there! 
 - Ah, that punk, there he goes again. 
  - A thief! 

458
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,950
Go and stay in the car for a bit.

459
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,450
 My bag... 

460
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,250
Come here!

461
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,340
I said come here!  Come here!

462
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,120
Officer Jung!  Your brain will get shaken!

463
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,770
Why don't you pull over now?  I need to handcuff you.

464
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,310
Stop right there!

465
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,300
Shouldn't we catch him?

466
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,050
- Stay still! 
 - Let go!

467
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:37,000
Ah! Ah! Save me!

468
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:45,280
 What is this feeling? 

469
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,070
What are you doing standing here when there is a mountain of work to do?

470
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:58,780
For now, do you see those over there?  Separate all of them and inventory them.

471
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,790
Do you want me to do all of this by myself?

472
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,880
Who else is here, other than you and me?

473
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,090
Are there only two in this team?

474
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,030
So much for the Ministry of Justice making a loud noise to the press

475
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,760
about how they will establish it on a grand scale, betting on life and death.

476
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,590
Don't you know that the higher-ups set up something to settle things halfheartedly when there is a case,

477
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,730
but forget about it when the press quiets down?

478
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,050
I would rather go to the traffic or civil petition division.

479
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,620
I brought you here because they don't even want you there.

480
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,890
They dare look down on this Go Mu Chi?

481
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,950
They see you as a troublemaker, a time bomb.

482
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,520
In conclusion, no one wants you.

483
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,450
So stop playing around and get to work.

484
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,100
Then I will just hand in my resignation.

485
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,520
Don't you still have something left to do?

486
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,010
Pardon?

487
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:52,290
Evidence Storage Team, it may not seem like much, but don't you know that we are issued guns?

488
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,130
Even when we work inside the office?

489
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,600
Who says we work inside the office?

490
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,530
Don't think that you will be stuck inside here and just organize the evidence.

491
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:05,170
Depending on the situation, we have to go to the crime scene to directly collect the evidence, so a special issuance.

492
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,720
This might be a better place to find an opportunity.

493
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,810
I have a wife to take care of.

494
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,650
If it weren't for her, I would have done it.

495
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,200
What you are trying to do?

496
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,040
There is no wallet or a cellphone.

497
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,900
It's a murder during a robbery.

498
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,640
It's not though.

499
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,930
- What? 
 - It's been disguised as a murder during a  robbery.

500
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,940
Who are you? Who are you to say that kind of nonsense?

501
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,670
- How do you know if it's a nonsense or not? 
 - What?

502
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,200
- What?  What?
 - How old are you, punk?
 - I am old enough.  Why?

503
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,450
Detective Kang!

504
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,970
There are tire markings here.

505
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,110
Let me see.

506
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,870
From here to here.

507
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,330
Oh, our Nation's Son, Officer Jung, was right.

508
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,330
Isn't that right?  That there are tire markings

509
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,950
and markings from the corpse being dragged.

510
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,200
That means the corpse was brought here by car and dragged there.

511
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,250
What kind of robber would kill a person

512
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,810
then take the corpse and the bag back there?

513
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:33,050
- What nonsense are you saying? 
 - Gosh.

514
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,520
He does have a point.

515
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,740
Although personal belongings are missing, the crime scene was well prepared.

516
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,040
And to disguise it as a murder during a robbery, the cellphone and wallet were taken on purpose.

517
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,670
That's right.  And what's more, she was killed face down.

518
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,490
That means someone who knew her well killed her.

519
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,170
It's either a grudge relationship or a revenge murder.

520
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,630
Identify the victim and look into everyone around her.

521
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,440
That's not it though.

522
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,960
It's not a revenge murder.

523
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,010
Ah, Officer Jung, why are you like this?

524
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:00,290
I will talk to him.  Officer Jung injured his head so...

525
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,500
You know, the one who faced off Seong Yo Han and had surgeries on his head.

526
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,560
You should just go and keep control so that the evidence doesn't get damaged.

527
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,810
- Ah, butâ€” 
 - Okay, okay. Come here.

528
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,230
   

529
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,480
 This is the limited edition Hurricane that our Mu Chi has been wanting. 

530
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,190
 I hope you know that your dad waited in line since dawn to buy this. 

531
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,110
 Mu Chi, happy birthday! 

532
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,220
 If anyone bothers my brother, I will teach them a lesson. 

533
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:38,040
 No, let's just camp here.  Yeah, mom? 

534
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,770
 Go Mu Chi, I am letting this slide because it's your birthday. 

535
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,010
Organize this, too.

536
00:45:55,190 --> 00:46:00,520
Even the Supreme Court has already made its decision on Han Seo Joon's case, so why is the evidence here?

537
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:05,790
The Prosecutor's office was about to destroy them but I sent them a request for cooperation and brought them here.

538
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:11,020
Evidence in the Han Seo Joon case is still great material for police investigation.

539
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,610
Our team's duty is not simply to organize and store evidences,

540
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:18,380
but rather accumulating investigative research materials is our main duty.

541
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,620
Well, interpretation of the dream is better than the dream itself. Such an important department this is.

542
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:25,470
Then give me some extra team members.  How can I do  all this by myself?

543
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,390
No one wants to come.

544
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,920
Why don't you recruit them yourself?

545
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,480
Our Chi Kook needs to wake up soon as well

546
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,100
and become healthy like you, Ba Reum.

547
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,260
He will wake up for sure.

548
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:57,370
Ma'am, you can never lose hope.

549
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,260
The invitation.  You are the master of ceremony, of course.  You know that, right?

550
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,460
Me, the master of ceremony?

551
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:11,890
Who else would do it then? Chi Kook is sick. Of course, you should do it for me.

552
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:18,480
Today was my first day at work and I realized how upset Chi Kook must have been.

553
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,640
Is it very hard?

554
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,540
In the area I am in charge of, there is a gangster minion

555
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,530
who keeps harassing his cellmate.

556
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,220
Someone old enough to be his grandfather.

557
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,430
He was too much so I told him to stop.

558
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,320
So now that gangster minion even harasses me.

559
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,830
He calls me, "Dog Shit Dong Koo."

560
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:39,330
I've been called "Sex Dong Koo," but "Dog Shit Dong Koo?"

561
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:43,700
- He looks down on me because I am a newbie.  I was going to handleâ€” 
 - You handled him?

562
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,020
Are you out of your mind?

563
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,760
I was saying that I read his  hand's  palm lines for him.

564
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,640
It was exactly that of a criminal's palm lines.

565
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,800
You punk, how can you joke like that?

566
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,210
You really should be careful. Something awful could happen.

567
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,970
It would be nice if Bong Yi came to the wedding.

568
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:02,720
Where did this girl disappear to?

569
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,750
Bong Yi?

570
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,420
I see you still don't remember Bong Yi.

571
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,170
How was your day today? Tell me how you feel coming back to work.

572
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,110
I saw a corpse.

573
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,590
A corpse? Did you pee your pants?

574
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:25,270
Stop talking nonsense.

575
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,520
I felt something weird.

576
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,940
- My heart started racingâ€“ 
 - Your heart was racing?

577
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,940
You must have been really surprised.

578
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,560
Even when you saw that dead cat's body before, you said your heart was racing.

579
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,380
It was not like that, it was different.

580
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,970
No way. You even vomited all day because you felt sick.

581
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,280
But you'll be fine.

582
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,950
- Oh, right here! 
 - Hello. 
 - Hello.

583
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:57,430
- Hello. You're here. 
 - Hello.

584
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:00,350
Oh, right.

585
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:05,560
This is a hoobae with whom I used to make films. This is Oh Young Cheol, a lawyer who gave me legal advice about my script.

586
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,170
You all know Ba Reum, right?

587
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:11,260
- Of course. 
 - And this is my fiancÃ©e, Kim Seul Gi.

588
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,090
She was the main character in my short film.

589
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:16,270
- Ah, congratulations on your wedding. 
 - Thank you.

590
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:18,080
- Congratulations! 
 - I'll have a good life!

591
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,010
Thank you!

592
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,480
I'm going to the bathroom.

593
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:31,760
Careful, careful.

594
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,020
Hyung, it's not too late yet.

595
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,440
Please think again about this wedding.

596
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,840
Cut it out, you punk.

597
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,540
She'll always want to be successful as an actress, you know?

598
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,610
Do you think she'll be satisfied by marrying a civil servant?

599
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,040
No way.

600
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,410
- Maybe she's going to cheat on you with  someone who offers her the main character role. 
 - Stop it!

601
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,740
Oh, you idiot. I told you to stop.

602
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:04,500
Wait. Hey, cut it out. It doesn't matter that you're drunk, how can you say that?

603
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,600
Hyung, do you know what her nickname is?

604
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,340
The fairy who changes woodcutters. 
  (T/N: Based on a popular Korean fairytale) 

605
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:16,140
Everyone in the field knows her to be like that. He's the only one who doesn't. I'm upset.

606
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:21,510
Oh, my poor hyung. You're a fool, Dong Koo.

607
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:25,540
You punk. You're always like this when you drink.

608
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:29,390
- Let him go! 
 - Let me go!

609
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,670
Ba Reum, are you okay?

610
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,900
This punk, really!

611
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,050
Get off me!

612
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:19,510
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

613
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,820
It just grazed me. I'm fine.

614
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,500
Your forehead is hurt.

615
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:32,420
But since when did your fists become so strong?

616
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,400
You used to be really bad even playing Whack the Mole.

617
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:41,190
 Today's case in Sherlock Eung Nyeo is 

618
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:46,360
 the suicide case of Miss A, a university student in her twenties. 

619
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,080
 According to police reports, she had a hard life 

620
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,210
 and died by suicide in her room. 

621
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,450
This is evidence from the murder case of Pyeongan-dong.

622
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:56,240
Did you eat already?

623
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,610
That rude jerk.

624
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,670
Gosh.

625
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,470
   

626
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,230
These jerks.

627
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,640
Hey, there are two pieces of evidence missing!

628
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,870
The rope and the weapon.

629
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:29,880
Bring it immediately!

630
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,710
 We are busy working, you know. If you have such spare time, come pick it up yourself! 

631
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,160
What?

632
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,720
Did he hang up?

633
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,040
Where is he?

634
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,690
 This is called Highwayman's Hitch knot. 

635
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:53,760
It is ideal to tie objects quickly while climbing.

636
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,120
You can tie the rope fast and securely without knotting the rope for real.

637
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,410
So, is this also a climbing knife?

638
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,940
Yes, that's right.

639
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,850
So we should look for an expert in mountaineering around the victim.

640
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:07,360
Oh, just a moment.

641
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,990
The knot is slightly modified.

642
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:14,220
It's not usually tied like this. This is different.

643
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,680
It's either that the Highwayman's Hitch knot method was deliberately changed,

644
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,240
or that he lacked skill and tied it wrong.

645
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,060
So this is not 100% the high-something knot?

646
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,480
Correct.

647
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,090
Oh Go Mu Chi, what are you doing?

648
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,550
Isn't it obvious?

649
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:37,400
I came to pick up the evidence personally, as I was told.

650
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,790
Sign the right documents and list all of the items if you want to take these back.

651
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,220
What the?

652
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,720
By the way, what do you think about what that cop said before? About the killer not being an acquaintance.

653
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,630
It's nonsense. Don't mind it. He's not normal because of his brain surgery.

654
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:56,280
Was he the officer who got in a fight with the criminal and had his head hurt?

655
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,220
Yeah.

656
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:02,240
It looks like he's been reinstated. Officer Jung.

657
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:09,990
Where is the Pyeongan-dong precinct?

658
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,830
I guess it's around here.

659
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,260
Oh, you crazy bastâ€“

660
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,700
Officer Jung?

661
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,480
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

662
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,880
Some trash rolled over while I was sorting it out.

663
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,910
You were very surprised, right?

664
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,260
 I'm sorry. 

665
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,900
You're still the same, Officer Jung.

666
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,750
Do you know me?

667
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:52,510
 What are you doing? Have you gone crazy? 

668
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:54,600
 You could have been killed because of that bird! 

669
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,650
What? Is your head hurting?

670
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,870
Detective Go Mu Chi!

671
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:04,160
Detective Go!

672
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,240
Detective!

673
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,250
Aigo, aigo!

674
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,030
This is all we have here.

675
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,250
Ah, thank you.

676
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,250
Are you okay?

677
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,290
Yes, I got much better as I continued to go to the hospital.

678
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:22,160
When I remember something about someone,

679
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,800
other memories related to this person will continue to come back.

680
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,560
I'm thankful you remember me.

681
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,750
I should have remembered you sooner. But how did you know I was here?

682
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,710
What if perhaps Detective Shin who told you?

683
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:38,160
- No. I overheard officers at the Homicide Unit badmouthing you. 
 - What?

684
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,350
You talked something about the killer not being an acquaintance.

685
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,720
Could you have a look at this?

686
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:51,680
Here.

687
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,230
This is a knot. If you tie it like this, the victim would be able to move her hands, right?

688
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:59,360
Also, this knot seems to be easy to loosen.

689
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,560
Right. This knot is called highway-something.

690
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,480
So they're looking for a mountaineering expert.

691
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,350
An expert would know this knot is easy to be loosened.

692
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:14,300
Why use this method to tie the victim's hands?

693
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,050
Look here.

694
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,230
You can see traces of the victim trying to move her hands, right?

695
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:22,050
You're right.

696
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,660
So why tie a knot like this?

697
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,100
He was enjoying it.

698
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,870
- What? 
 - It was deliberately tied like this for fun.

699
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:32,060
The victim must have tried to untie the knot,

700
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,900
 hoping to make it out alive. 

701
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,060
The killer took pleasure in watching that.

702
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:42,490
If he took pleasure watching her die, why did he stab her in the back?

703
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,540
Look here.

704
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,030
The cut is not deep.

705
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,240
Stabbed her deep enough to not kill her,

706
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,680
enjoyed watching the victim struggling in pain,

707
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,450
and he chocked her at last.

708
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,430
Only a psychopath would kill someone like this.

709
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,900
This wasn't his first murder.

710
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:07,840
What?

711
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:12,340
When you kill someone for the first time, you are so confused you don't have the spirit to clean the site.

712
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,320
As you can see the site is very clean.

713
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,950
No fingerprints or strands of hair around.

714
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:20,850
If you don't catch him quickly, another murder will happen.

715
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,940
What makes you so certain?

716
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,780
Just...

717
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,570
I just feel it.

718
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,360
You feel it?

719
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,290
Why?

720
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:39,210
No. It seems like you changed.

721
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:41,700
You seem different from before.

722
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,340
Me?

723
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,640
 The victim 

724
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:54,830
 must have struggled to untie the knot in hope of surviving. 

725
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,930
 He enjoyed it. It was deliberately tied like this for fun. 

726
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,040
 Team Leader caught the suspect and is interrogating him. 

727
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:11,780
The owner confirmed that you've been working with Kang Min Joo for a month.

728
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,860
Is it that person?

729
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,670
And this car tire markings were found at the crime scene.

730
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,290
And this.

731
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,610
This is your car's tire.

732
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:25,320
I really didn't go there!

733
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,770
A lot of cars have the same tires.

734
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:30,950
I think he got the wrong person.

735
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:33,390
Does that person seem like a psychopath?

736
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:35,440
These are the things that were seized from your house.

737
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,230
I-I r-really didn't kill that person!

738
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:38,470
He doesn't seem like one?

739
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:41,850
- Who said the culprit is a psychopath? 
 - I just like hiking! Is everyone who likes hiking a culprit?

740
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,080
- Don't get ahead of yourself. 
  - On this day! 

741
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,900
Tell me what you were doing at that time!

742
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,130
That...

743
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:50,390
Team Leader. I got a call from the NFS.

744
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:53,250
The semen from Kang Min Joo's body matches that bastard's DNA.

745
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,120
See.

746
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,450
Who got the wrong person?

747
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:08,970
Feel it?

748
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:13,410
Hey. You're believing in someone whose brain is not normal after having brain surgery.

749
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:16,830
Ah. Mu Chi. Mu Chi.

750
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,620
KFD 2019.

751
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:26,300
 On the 5th, the leading suspect for the murder of a pub part-time worker, 

752
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,360
 victim A's stalker B was arrested by the police.  
     

753
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,380
 Currently he is denying the crime, 

754
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,650
- It's not him. 
  - saying that it was by consensus. 

755
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,410
- That person...
  - What the police will conclude... 

756
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,250
I brought the evidence from the No Jin-dong woman murder case.

757
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,980
Hey, stop! Stop!

758
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,730
Again.

759
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:48,530
Again. Is there any other evidence missing? Huh? Is there any?

760
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,380
No, there isn't.

761
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:53,920
Stay right here until I confirm it.

762
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,480
So...

763
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,050
Hey, what is this scar on the wrist? Are there any ropes or string?

764
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,870
No, there weren't any.

765
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,280
- There aren't any? 
 - Yes.

766
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:13,780
Ah, wait. Heyâ€“

767
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,630
Gosh, that...

768
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:44,320
There's nothing.

769
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,710
Did he go to the army? What's up with those straight angles?

770
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:14,470
He hung up clothes that he didn't even wash?

771
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:40,000
 If he isn't caught immediately, 

772
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:44,140
 there will be another murder. 

773
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:48,520
Officer Jung is right.

774
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:05,280
When Hong Na Ri was discovered, the victim's front teeth were broken and blood was running down her forehead.

775
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,670
Seeing how there's blood on the mirror pieces,

776
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:09,650
the victim's face was thrown onto the mirror

777
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:11,500
and that's how the victim's front teeth broke and tore her forehead.

778
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,450
The door lock was perfectly fine too.

779
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:15,540
There is no sign of escaping on the outside too.

780
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,890
That's definitely an acquaintance of hers.

781
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,790
Aish, is there any water?

782
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,590
But what the weird thing is.

783
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,640
It's different from Kang Min Joo's murder.

784
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:43,340
The location of Kang Min Joo's kidnapping, murder, and body discovery is all different.

785
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:46,350
But Hong Na Ri's body was found in her house. The body wasn't even moved.

786
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:49,910
And there was no evidence left behind. It's different from Kang Min Joo.

787
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:53,590
It's also different that she was lying on her side and not on her stomach.

788
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:55,740
That.

789
01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:00,190
That's right. Is it a different guy?

790
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:01,920
No, it's the same guy.

791
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,760
How can you be sure?

792
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,080
The mirror.

793
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,240
The suspect intentionally hit the victim's face in the mirror.

794
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,920
Intentionally?

795
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,510
Because he wanted to clearly see the victim's painful death.

796
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,970
He wanted to clearly see the victim die through the mirror?

797
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:27,890
In order to clearly see the victim die painfully.

798
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:32,280
Here. He killed her in this position.

799
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:36,620
Then the victim's husband came and performed CPR on her?

800
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:37,770
CPR?

801
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:40,380
Yes, there are traces of CPR done on the victim.

802
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:41,580
The husband was arrested as a suspect.

803
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:44,890
They didn't have a good relationship and were living separately. It's a good enough motive for murder.

804
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:47,180
No, the CPR was also done by the suspect.

805
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,370
What?

806
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:51,040
Hey. If what you are saying is true,

807
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,430
he's a psychopath who enjoys killing his victims.

808
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,870
Why would he bring her back to life? Why did he change his mind?

809
01:03:55,870 --> 01:04:00,340
It's not that he changed his mind. He's trying to save the victim and kill her again.

810
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:04,800
He wants to enjoy the victim's pain as long as possible.

811
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,360
His motive is getting worse. He is more violent than last time.

812
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,470
He is experimenting with ways that he can joyfully kill the victim.

813
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:17,540
Detective, if we don't hurry and catch him, we don't know how many more victims will die.

814
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:20,060
How are you so sure of that?

815
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,200
Just.

816
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,490
If I think about what I would do if I'm the suspect,

817
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:28,500
that's what I would do. I just think of it.

818
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:34,250
He's afraid that this knot will make us realize that it's the same person.

819
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:37,450
He used the clothesline in this house to kill her.

820
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:41,950
And after the murder, he would put it back in place. For the clothes that was hung there,

821
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:46,670
he would precisely hang the clothes at the right angle.

822
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:49,870
That's right. How did you know that?

823
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:52,570
Just because. I just thought it would be like that.

824
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:56,740
And I'm pretty sure he is a complete perfectionist.

825
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,480
Hey, Officer Jung.

826
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,560
Let's catch that punk together.

827
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,950
Huh? With you?

828
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:06,270
You should hand this over to the Violent Crimes team.

829
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,040
No. The story is different now.

830
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,140
If you are right, he already killed two people.

831
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:16,240
But, you said this last time. He could have murdered more people before that.

832
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:22,990
Then there could be more victims. That means this bastard is a psychopath serial killer.

833
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:25,220
That's true.

834
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:31,100
I have to catch a jerk who deserves to die, personally. I failed last time.

835
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:34,710
I'll definitely succeed this time. You'll help me, right Officer Jung?

836
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:40,690
I am thankful for what you say.

837
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:43,360
But I have to fulfill my duties at the police station. At Pyeongan Police Stationâ€“

838
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,410
No. There is no problem if you don't work at the police station.

839
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:51,920
- Huh? 
 - I heard it all from Detective Shin. You don't have to do any work at the police station.

840
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,920
- What do you mean I don't need to do my work? 
 - You don't even have to go to work.

841
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,030
What do you mean I don't have to go to work?

842
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,630
Ah, what did I eat wrong? Ah.

843
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,470
Gosh, it's getting raw.

844
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:31,030
I'm sure... I'm sure the victim knew the killer.

845
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:36,640
But the victims didn't know any of those people.

846
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:42,900
Mu Chi. What are you missing?

847
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:47,940
 To enjoy it. He intentionally tied the knot loosely. 

848
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,000
I've seen this before.

849
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,310
Where is it? Where is it?

850
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:12,500
Number 11.

851
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,270
   

852
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:40,260
 Remember how Team Leader Park's wife kept saying that she needed to find her child? 

853
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,480
 About that... 

854
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:45,620
 That bastard is a mutant monster that should've never been born in this world. 

855
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:48,810
 What he said that night, was all over the media. 

856
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:54,340
 That bastard broke into Sunbae's house and took Hyun Soo and Hyun Seok away. 

857
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:01,090
Hyun Seok was hit by a car on a road about 30km away from home early the next morning.

858
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:04,550
He must have run in the road while escaping.

859
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:06,270
 Check thoroughly! 

860
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:10,740
They sent military and police for a large-scale search to look for Hyun Soo, but they couldn't find her.

861
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:15,430
Five years later, constructions to build the Guryeon Mountain tunnel started.

862
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:16,470
 What is it? 

863
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:22,630
They found the same clothes and shoes that Hyun Soo was wearing when she was kidnapped.

864
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:28,190
They made a DNA test with the hair on the hair tie found at the scene, and it was a match.

865
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:31,680
But he couldn't accept Hyun Soo's death.

866
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:36,930
So he still goes around digging places. Saying he'll find Hyun Soo's body.

867
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:40,610
   

868
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:44,070
 The murder pattern is different from Kang Min Joo. 

869
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:47,450
 The kidnap, murder, and body discovery location for Kang Min Joo were all different, 

870
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:50,630
 but Hong Na Ri was found in her house. 

871
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:56,480
   

872
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,460
Hello, Detective Shin.

873
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,780
You know the bar worker who was murdered.

874
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:19,690
Could I see the knot that was tied on Kang Min Joo's hand?

875
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:22,080
The evidence team?

876
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:26,500
That's right. This is the Highwayman's Hitch knot method.

877
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,000
It looks like the same person tied the same knot.

878
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,910
However, unlike this knot, this knot was tied up clumsy.

879
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:37,110
It's like a little kid tied it.

880
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,760
Is anyone there?

881
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,860
Excuse me?

882
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,850
   

883
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:57,700
 How on earth did Han Seo Joon know how to tie the knot like that? 

884
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:02,780
Surgeons usually learn medical techniques of tying knots, but this is a climbing knot.

885
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:06,950
Han Seo Joon must have learned it from someone. Then who who taught Han Seo Joon?

886
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:14,000
- Yeah. 
 - Or, maybe someone could have learned from Han Seo Joon. The person Han Seo Joon taught.

887
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,560
This person is probably the most likely suspect.

888
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,700
Let's meet Han Seo Joon first.

889
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,960
- What is this? 
 - I think someone has been in here.

890
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,120
What?

891
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,730
This. The location of this is different compared to when I first came in.

892
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:33,510
- What is different about it? 
 - It's different.

893
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:36,030
Hey, are you a genius? Remembering if a box was turned or not?

894
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,620
Hurry up and follow me. We don't have much time. We have to go before the visiting hours are over.

895
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:39,840
Let's go. Hurry, hurry!

896
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,300
It's different though...

897
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:48,610
Ah, that. Han Seo Joon refuses to see you.

898
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:50,690
What?

899
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:55,290
He doesn't want to see the person who killed his son.

900
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:57,030
Instead.

901
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:12,940
   

902
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:17,280
   

903
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:26,370
I heard you accepted to meet me.

904
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:29,220
It's you.

905
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:32,720
I heard you almost died because of Yo Han.

906
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,540
Instead of my son, I wanted to apologize to you.

907
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:51,150
We... We've seen each other before, right?

908
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:52,630
Me?

909
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,610
I'm disappointed. You don't remember me.

910
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:05,410
It looks like the surgery wasn't successful.

911
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:07,730
Unfortunately.

912
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:09,270
But...

913
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:12,610
Compared to before the surgery,

914
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:15,960
the look in your eyes has changed.

915
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,630
Me?

916
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:23,600
 Don't get intimated by him, no matter what. 

917
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,880
You remember this, don't you?

918
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:36,630
The knot that was tied on Detective Park Doo Sukâ€™s daughter, Park Hyun Sooâ€™s hand.

919
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:41,100
This is similar to a knot for a climbing rescue. Who did you learn this from?

920
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,650
I didn't learn it from anyone.

921
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,400
Is that so?

922
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,610
Then you're saying this is a knot you invented.

923
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:50,760
Did you teach this to someone else?

924
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,400
I didn't teach anyone.

925
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:58,400
Then what about someone who saw you do it?

926
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,490
There isn't anyone.

927
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:05,000
Search through your memories.

928
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,120
This is an important question.

929
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:14,450
I have never tied such a knot, learned to tie one nor teach anyone how to.

930
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,150
Don't lie to me.

931
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:21,920
You said you didn't teach anyone,

932
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:27,400
How could the same knot tied to the child you killed 26 years ago come out now?

933
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,120
Why are you asking  me  that?

934
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,750
I don't expect anything from a person like you anyway.

935
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:49,890
I also don't intend to accept your fake apology from you for your son, not in the least bit.

936
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:53,050
You don't believe me even if I'm not lying.

937
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:56,890
Do you not understand my words?

938
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,360
 It's not this person. 

939
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,700
 The murder of the person 26 years ago. 

940
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:23,080
Right.

941
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:26,940
Say hello to my friend before you go.

942
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:31,820
Say hello. This is my friend who lives in the same room as me.

943
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:18,500
 What is this? This memory. 

944
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:44,690


945
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:54,910
   

946
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,760
 A witness? It wasn't in the investigation record at that time. 

947
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,710
 Han Seo Joon killed him, but someone else tied the knot. 

948
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:01,910
 An accomplice? 

949
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:03,790
 Did you become a genius after your brain surgery? 

950
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,760
 Do you know PD Choi Hong Ju? 

951
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,280
 Did I like that person? 

952
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,900
 Do you know where that child is right now? 

953
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,620
 You look healthy. It's good to see you, Officer Jung. 

954
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:17,340
 Why am I suddenly feeling this tingle? 

955
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,990
 - Hey, Officer Jung. 
 - Yes? 

956
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:21,150
 Do you want to be on my team? 

957
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:22,480
 Me? 

958
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:26,540
â™«  That jerk is abandoning me here  â™«
