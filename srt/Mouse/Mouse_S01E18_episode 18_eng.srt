2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,080
   

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,780
   

4
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,140
 Sometimes I go on an unexpected hunt. 

5
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,240
 This unlucky old woman saw something she wasn't supposed to 

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,130
 and became an unexpected target. 

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,720
 The prey must cling to its dear life until its very last breath. 

8
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,420
 But this one doesn't seem to have the strength to do so. 

9
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,850
 Which is why this hunt is boring 

10
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,150
 and quite dull. 

11
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,270
 Why wasn't I born as this child? 

12
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,130
 It's all done. 

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,750
 I want to be like him. 

14
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,730
 I want to be him. 

15
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,980
   

16
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,650
   

17
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,930
 We... 

18
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,890
 are lab rats. 

19
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,970
 Lab rats. 

20
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,520
 We are 

21
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,380
 lab rats? 

22
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,020
If it wasn't Seong Yo Han

23
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,260
   

24
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,400
then who killed my grandmother?

25
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,510
   

26
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,100
Yeah.

27
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,060
I left Jennifer's photo behind.

28
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,590
Jung Ba Reum said he'd go look for it.

29
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,520
But what if those guys find it first?

30
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,290
No, no, let's wait for a while.

31
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,410
Shoot!

32
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,090
Wait a minute.

33
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,290
Damn it.

34
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,780
What about the photo? Did you find it?

35
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,240
Why?

36
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,880
Is there  someone who shouldn't see the photo?

37
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,320
What?

38
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,580
One day, I got a message from an unknown number.

39
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,560
- A message? 
 - My mom,

40
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,130
Jae Min, and my stepfather.

41
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,720
 After I had decided on taking revenge on the guy who had killed my father, 

42
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,830
 all I did was look for him. 

43
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,110
He wasn't an ex-convict.

44
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,880
But his punches were quite good.

45
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,160
We're closed.

46
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,340
 I recognized him the moment I saw him. 

47
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,730
 That day my suppressed murderous instincts burst out. 

48
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,160
After my surgery,

49
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,020
thanks to Seong Yo Han's frontal lobe, my suppressed murderous instinct

50
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,240
got a chance to be awakened once again.

51
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,020
The crime scene that was a copy of my murders...

52
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,450
Woo Hyeong Cheol didn't do that.

53
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,900
After Woo Hyeong Cheol was done, someone

54
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,730
placed a fake brooch, and a necklace,

55
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,650
and even set up the mint scent that I testified that I had smelled from the culprit.

56
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,780
Right?

57
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,030
Argh!

58
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,130
 In the end I killed Woo Hyeong Cheol 

59
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,270
and my murderous instincts awakened yet again.

60
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,920
Who could it be?

61
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,670
And why in the world would they send me Song Soo Ho's address?

62
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,330
Just why would someone set up Woo Hyeong Cheol's crime scenes?

63
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,820
I'm not sure.

64
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,500
Trigger.

65
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,040
They pulled on the trigger on my murderous instinct.

66
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,940
They threw me prey so I could kill it.

67
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,960
What did they get out of doing that?

68
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,410
From the very beginning,

69
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,050
they knew I was born with the predator gene.

70
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,630
I remembered what Seong Yo Han said to me before dying.

71
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,250
He said, "We are lab rats."

72
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,710
If they knew that Seong Yo Han and I had the psychopath gene,

73
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,000
then that means you too, are closely related to this experiment.

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,660
I don't...

75
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,370
I don't know anything about this.

76
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,120
You don't know?

77
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,900
Then why did I find that diary of mine

78
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,090
and Seong Yo Han's burner phone with which he talked to you dozens of times,

79
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,300
in your belongings?

80
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,970
Explain it to me so that I can understand.

81
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,160
You knew I was a predator from the beginning, didn't you?

82
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:04,080
I knew about everything.

83
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,590
 A serial killing suspected to be done by a psychopath 

84
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,450
 was found in Korea. 

85
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,430
 Could it be one of the two fetuses? 

86
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,120
 Apprehensive about that, I came back to Korea in a rush. 

87
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,500
Back then...

88
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,820
I thought that you had killed your family.

89
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,570
That's why I was sure that you were a predator.

90
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,580
Just to make sure, I asked around about the other child.

91
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,540
 Gosh, you're soaking wet. 

92
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,160
 His eyes were filled with jealousy. 

93
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,020
An emotion that a predator can never feel.

94
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,890
That's when I knew that it wasn't Seong Yo Han.

95
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,180
I tried to stop your murders in all ways possible.

96
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,820
Because you were getting out of control.

97
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,500
After much thought,

98
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,790
I contacted Seong Yo Han.

99
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,490
 Ah! 

100
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,870
 Doc-Doctor. 

101
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,520
 No. 

102
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,810
 Don't take me to the hospital. 

103
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,360
 He will kill me. 

104
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,640
 W-W-Who? 

105
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,270
 Right now, 

106
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,110
 we must take care of that guy first. 

107
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,710
 W-W-Who is he?  
    

108
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,000
 Why did he do this to you? 

109
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,850
 Listen carefully to 

110
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,950
 what I say from now on, Seong Yo Han. 

111
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,710
I told Seong Yo Han everything back then, that's why he was able to help me.

112
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,840
I received treatment

113
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,500
in Seong Yo Han's basement.

114
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,180
And then was moved to that abandoned hospital.

115
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,340
You completely deceived me and used me.

116
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,900
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,270
I... I tried to stop you.

118
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,060
 Then why are you just letting him be? 

119
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,940
 You agreed on revealing it if we saw him planning another murder. 

120
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,040
 Why are you going back on your promise? Don't you know how many people he has killed already? 

121
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,870
 You've been watching him do that all this time? 

122
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,250
 You're crazy. Stop him right now. Right now! 

123
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,040
 He's making a duplicate of that child now! 

124
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,360
 Do you think I'm just going to sit back? 

125
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,430
Who is it? Who is it?

126
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,260
Tell me who it is right away. Tell me!

127
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,210
Who is it? Which bastard is it?

128
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,120
What brings you by, PD Choi?

129
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,530
I had a favor to ask of you but I thought you would refuse if I asked you on the phone.

130
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,880
Well, I have a guest at home right now.

131
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,050
- So, let's do this later. 
 - It'll only be a minute.

132
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,760
Please do this interview, Officer Jung.

133
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,830
What interview?

134
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,730
- The Mujin serial killing case? 
 - Yeah.

135
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,810
Since you are the only survivor,

136
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,750
I'd like to have an interview with you. Based on what you remember from then.

137
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,600
I'll talk about all of it soon.

138
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,370
But I can't now.

139
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,930
What the hell?

140
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,480
- Hello? 
  - Officer Jung, why aren't you picking up the phone? 

141
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,010
Thank god we were on a call. You should come to my house for now. I'll look into where you can stay.

142
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,410
It's more important to retrieve the photo. Jennifer's photo.

143
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,570
- I'll go get it later. 
 - You must do it now.

144
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,900
If that photo falls into their hands, then they'll know I'm alive.

145
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,450
Alright, I'll go now.

146
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,900
Also, there is something you need to know.

147
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,880
What is it?

148
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,540
 Don't worry. As a policeman, I will keep you safe. 

149
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,920
 Policeman? 

150
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,430
Yoo Na stopped talking as soon as she heard "policeman."

151
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,030
Why isn't Ajusshi picking up the phone?

152
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,710
Detective, I heard you found that car.

153
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,620
You bastard!

154
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,340
Detective, why are you doing this?

155
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,320
- You're a psychopath, aren't you? Huh? 
 - Detective!

156
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,140
Let go! Let go of me!

157
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,940
Oppa! Ajusshi! Ajusshi, why are you doing this?

158
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,530
You kil–

159
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,390
Follow me.

160
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,010
Ajusshi!

161
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,210
Ajusshi, don't do this!

162
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,540
Ah, Bong Yi.

163
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,080
Ouch, Bong Yi!

164
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,960
Let go!!

165
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,060
Why are you doing this? Why?

166
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,680
What are you doing?

167
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,160
Let go! What the hell! Let go!

168
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,820
Stop! Oppa! Ajusshi!

169
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,690
Hey. Hey!

170
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,310
You killed them all, didn't you? Kang Duk Su, Lee Jae Sik, Kim Byeong Tae?

171
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,830
Why aren't you denying it? Did you actually kill them?

172
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,630
- Hey, what are you talking about? 
 - This bastard killed them!

173
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,740
I have the evidence right here.

174
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,240
Where did Detective Lee go?  Where did Lee Min Soo go?

175
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,080
Lee Min Soo! Come on out. You're in there, aren't you?

176
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,130
Come out quickly!

177
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,270
What is it this time?

178
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,580
- Where is it? Where is it? 
 - What are you talking about?

179
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,010
Ah, Sunbae, calm down. Sunbae!

180
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,700
 How did he know? What undeniable evidence does he have? 

181
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,070
 But I can't get caught now. 

182
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,330
 I need to buy myself time until I find the guy who killed Chi Kook. 

183
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,740
 For now, I need to get out of this situation. 

184
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,430
- Hey! Let me go! 
 - Please stop!

185
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,870
Sunbae!

186
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,580
What's up with you guys? Are you the fantastic duo or something?

187
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
One kills people and the other cleans up afterward?

188
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,410
What the hell did I clean up?

189
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,830
 Cleans up afterward? 

190
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,240
The dash cam footage of the 6264 car in which the suicide happened!

191
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,650
You stole it from me and then flushed it down the toilet!

192
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,630
Suicide?

193
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,100
You bastards! You're playing innocent?

194
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,520
Seriously, why are you doing this?

195
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,770
Did you see me? Did you see me get rid of it?

196
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,070
 - Oh? It seems like he didn't know.  
 - Just tell me, will you?

197
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,260
Did you see me getting rid of it with your own eyes?

198
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,200
- What did you do in the washroom? 
 - I pooped and washed up.

199
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,080
 - Is he on the same side as those guys?  
 - Is there something wrong with that?

200
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,060
- You bastards! 
 - Sunbae!

201
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,770
Go Mu Chi, stop, will you?

202
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,730
- No, wait, these bastards– 
 - Stop it!

203
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,000
- Take these two to the interrogation room. 
 - Okay.

204
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,020
Damn it! Okay, let's have an official investigation then.

205
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,880
You go to the interrogation room as well. Go!

206
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,900
Detective! Can't you let me out of here?

207
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,790
Detective Shin! Detective Shin! Please, let me out of here.

208
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,920
- Calm down and stretch your hand a little bit. 
 - No, my hand is fine.

209
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,760
It looks like you hurt it. Oh. Be careful. It'll scar if you let it be.

210
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,200
- What exactly is going on here? 
 - I don't know either.

211
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,350
Why is Mu Chi Ajusshi doing that to Ba Reum Oppa?

212
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,040
Put this on when it dries. And apply more of this too.

213
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,880
Wait a little bit longer. You'll be released.

214
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,700
Detective!

215
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,700
Detective Shin. Why is Detective Go saying that Officer Jung killed somebody?

216
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,470
Be quiet. It's all nonsense.

217
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,580
 How did he find out? 

218
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,650
 He can't know it was Oppa Ba Reum. 

219
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,430
Calm down and tell me. What were you talking about?

220
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,620
- Jung Ba Reum, that bastard– 
 - I don't know what you are talking about.

221
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,390
I saw him in the dashcam footage.

222
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,510
But Detective Lee stole it from me during the commotion.

223
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,690
He flushed it down the toilet! We need to find it in the septic tank now!

224
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,070
Gosh, this is nuts! Look, I just did my business and I was coming out of there,

225
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,000
and he's suddenly grabbing my collar and swearing!

226
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,020
I clearly saw it with my own eyes.  Jung Ba Reum was at the place where Kang Duk Su was killed.

227
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,390
On the day that Kang Duk Su died, the cat that I used to take care of gave birth so

228
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,430
I was at my house, playing with my cousin.

229
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,190
That day Detective Lee purposely handed in Kang Duk Su's mother's testimony late.

230
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,060
I just forgot about it, that's why I was late! You've got to be kidding me!

231
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,230
That scoundrel has a gang tattoo, you know. He got it removed.

232
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,540
- I definitely told him that I'd got my girlfriend's initials tattooed and that I removed it because we broke up. 
 - Where is that tattoo shop?

233
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,440
He would sometimes come and get henna done. But once he came to get a tattoo done.

234
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,430
A tattoo? Which tattoo was it?

235
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,370
- We take a picture of the tattoo once it's done. 
 - Okay.

236
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,560
- I'll go find the picture. 
 - Yes, please.

237
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,970
It's this one.

238
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,390
   

239
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,830
Thank you.  Have a good day.

240
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,460
He got the tattoo with his girlfriend and it was "OJ," not "OZ."

241
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,530
That's what I thought.  Ah, that punk...

242
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,990
Yes, Sister-in-law.

243
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,800
What?  Okay, I got it.

244
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,860
Did your wife disappear again?

245
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,230
Not just once or twice, what a big problem it is.

246
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,600
- It's not? 
 - That's right.

247
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,190
The tattoo parlor owner must have been bought off, too.

248
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,330
Detective Kang found out the address and Detective Shin went right away.  When was there even the time for him to be bought off?

249
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,030
- Anyway, go ahead and go for now.
- Go where?

250
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,530
Listen for once.  The video of you beating up Officer Jung was posted on SNS and is causing a stir.

251
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,830
Of all the times, in front of all the civilians and reporters...

252
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,560
Hey, you know that Officer Jung is "Nation's Son."

253
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,570
You became the nation's rebel for beating up that poor kid.

254
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,530
Rebel or whatever, it doesn't matter.

255
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,000
"Nation's Son?"  The entire nation will get a damned shock.

256
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,270
Why doesn't it matter?  At the Chief's order, you just got dismissed.

257
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,670
- You are to be taken off duty. 
 - Damn it!

258
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,140
- Where are you going? 
 - I am going to shovel shit!

259
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,060
I am going to find that memory card myself.

260
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,060
Was Lee Min Soo also a part of OZ?

261
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,500
 The dash cam footage of the 6264 car in which the suicide happened! 

262
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,200
How much was captured in the video?

263
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,980
Officer Jung, go home and get some rest.

264
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,860
Ah, what about Detective Lee?

265
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,070
I sent him home too.

266
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,400
   

267
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,000
   

268
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,050
Ki Hyuk, release her.

269
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,580
No matter what, assaulting an officer is not allowed.

270
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,690
What about Oppa Ba Reum?

271
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,680
I will be back.

272
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,260
Then, I will do it.

273
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,430
No, I will retrieve it.

274
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,300
If anyone is to get caught, at least one of us should remain.  Then, it should be you, PD Choi.

275
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,130
You should wrap things up, right?

276
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,200
What should I do?

277
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,000
Yo Han.

278
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,550
Poor Yo Han, what can I do?

279
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,890
Where is it?

280
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,730
You were alive after all, Dr. Daniel.

281
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,350
Sister-in-law!  What happened?

282
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,710
While I went just for a little while to the meat section...

283
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,900
She left her clothes, too.

284
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,020
   

285
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,250
Thank you for your hard work.  I will take a quick look.

286
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,450
She left that way.

287
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,240
Please hang on for just a little while.

288
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,830
There are not many days left until D-Day.

289
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,920
   

290
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,940
   

291
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,800
- Where is Officer Jung? 
 - Uh, the smell!

292
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,820
Did you really shovel shit?

293
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,230
Did you find it?

294
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,500
- It's so small so... 
 - Ah, the smell.  Wash up first. Go—

295
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,810
- I am asking you where Jung Ba Reum is? 
 - I sent him home!

296
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,800
Why did you let him go?! What if he destroys the evidence!

297
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,900
- What about Lee Min Soo? 
 - He just sent a request for time off by email.

298
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,050
- Time off? 
 - Don't come near!  The smell!

299
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,090
See!  He ran away!

300
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,010
Min Soo said he's not going to let this go, either.  He said he will sue you.

301
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,130
 The punk who killed Chi Kook.  Detective Lee. 

302
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,510
What are you?

303
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,370
Why are you coming out from here?

304
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,210
Were the two of you going to make contact here?

305
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,120
Ah, I got dismissed from duty because I beat up the "Nation's Son."

306
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,710
Answer me straight.  Otherwise, I am going to break your head with this and go to prison for it.

307
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,760
You know my wish, right?

308
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,720
Bong Yi's grandmother's knife was also your doing, right?

309
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,050
The CCTV at the Evidence Storage captured only Team Leader, me and you.

310
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,360
Only the three of us were captured not because the culprit avoided the CCTV but because you are the culprit.

311
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,150
Only you and Detective Shin know the inside story about Bong Yi's retainer fee for killing as well.

312
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,090
You took it.  You took it to kill him, right?

313
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,860
It all makes sense now.

314
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,910
Answer, you bastard!

315
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,350
You're right.

316
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,820
I killed him.

317
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,820
What?

318
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,370
I took grandmother's knife

319
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,600
and used it, before returning it.

320
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,620
It was me.

321
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,360
Because Bong Yi was in danger.

322
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,700
Because I thought he would kill Bong Yi.

323
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,470
So that's why I killed Kang Duk Su.

324
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,300
Does Bong Yi know as well?

325
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,300
That's why we broke up.

326
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,470
Bong Yi says she's okay, but...

327
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,170
I feel too tormented.

328
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:23,000
But, as to Lee Jae Sik and Kim Byeong Tae,

329
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,160
I don't know what made you like this...

330
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,420
You.

331
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,670
Why did you go to the prison on the day Lee Jae Sik was released?

332
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,620
 So I was captured in the video at the prison. 

333
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,060
- I got a phone call, from PD Choi. 
 - Choi Hong Ju?

334
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,500
Yes, she wanted to know how to get in touch with Dong Koo.

335
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,970
She said that she thinks Lee Jae Sik might be the real culprit in the Suseong case.

336
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,350
She said she needed to confirm it so I let her know.

337
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,290
If it's true, Lee Jae Sik is a really dangerous punk, isn't he?

338
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,100
So that's why I went.  Because I was worried.

339
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,830
Then, what about Kim Byeong Tae?  Why did you go to Kim Byeong Tae's house?

340
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,920
 I got caught either going in or coming out of that house. 

341
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,810
When I met that granny at the cafeteria,

342
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:18,150
she testified that Kim Byeong Tae poured something over the child's head.

343
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,460
At the time I thought it was nonsense and didn't think much about it. But when I thought about it later on something didn't feel right so

344
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:30,110
I sneaked into Kim Byeong Tae's house. Of course, I knew it was wrong. I didn't find much so I got out of there.

345
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,060
I will pay the price for

346
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,820
killing Kang Duk Su.

347
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,070
I was going to confess my crime,

348
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:48,120
but just give me time until I catch the guy who killed Chi Kook.

349
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,590
Please?

350
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,240
Then how will you explain that?

351
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,240
The day I went to save Bong Yi. OZ, the guy who hit me with a truck, the one who was chasing you?

352
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,860
I don't know. That is driving me crazy too.

353
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,180
What the hell is their identity?

354
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,100
 What's this? Is he lying? 

355
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,620
 Or does a copycat actually exist? 

356
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,250
 What the hell did I clean up? 

357
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,530
 That's right. His expression seemed like he really didn't know about Detective Lee. 

358
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:28,150
I beg you. Just until I catch the guy who killed Chi Kook.

359
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:34,050
Please give me time until then. After I do that, I will turn myself in.

360
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,960
I beg you.

361
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,590
 Detective. 

362
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:59,700
 I know I'm being shameless and contemptible right now, 

363
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,260
 but please wait a little bit longer. 

364
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,440
 Once I catch those guys, 

365
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,870
 I will make sure to be punished by the skies. 

366
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,310
But I should still check.

367
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,310
Officer Jung?

368
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,540
I had called him because of Lee Jae Sik's release time.

369
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,490
But why are you asking about it?

370
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,700
Oh, um...

371
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,980
And, what did you tell Officer Jung?

372
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,220
That the real culprit of the Suseong serial killing could be Lee Jae Sik.

373
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,010
Since Lee Jae Sik's DNA was found on Kang Duk Su's murder weapon,

374
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,950
I told him that he could be the next target.

375
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,790
- Then you should have told me about it. Why Officer Jung? 
 - If I had told you, you would have tried to kill him!

376
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,350
I'll leave. I have a shooting in the area.

377
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:31,480
Right. Bong Yi bought a present for Eun Chong.

378
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,640
Oh, she did?

379
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,310
Bong Yi feels quite sorry for saying that to the kid. She said it was because she lost her temper.

380
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,900
I understand.

381
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,200
It perfectly matches up with what Officer Jung said.

382
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,010
Is there really another copycat? 
    

383
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,650
- My baby. My baby– 
 - Get out of the way!

384
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,730
What are you doing? Please get up.

385
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,190
- Take me to my baby. My baby. 
 - Are you okay?

386
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,740
- Where is your child? 
 - Here.

387
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,820
That's Choi Hong Ju. Are you PD Choi Hong Ju's mother?

388
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,290
Oh.

389
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:22,310
- We have Choi Hong Ju's contact information on the press list, right? Call her right away and escort her. 
 - Yes, sir.

390
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,610
This person here will call your daughter and take you to her.

391
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,890
- Escort her. I'll leave. Let's go. 
 - Yes, sir.

392
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,800
My baby.

393
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,110
 Does Bong Yi know as well? 

394
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,270
 That's why we broke up. 

395
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,830
 Bong Yi says she's okay, but... 

396
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,250
 I feel too tormented. 

397
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,350
It's here.

398
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,680
Who have you come for?

399
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,920
I brought PD Choi Hong Ju's mother here.

400
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,290
- PD Choi's Mother? 
 - Do you know her?

401
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:07,660
Oh, excuse me, PD Choi's mother is here.

402
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,610
- Mother? 
 - Yes.

403
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,670
I think she said she was an orphan.

404
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,180
Just a minute.

405
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:25,480
 The number you have dialed is busy. You will be connected to voicemail. 

406
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,210
Excuse me, what are you doing?

407
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,890
- Oh, it's nothing, don't mind me. 
 - Delete that right now!

408
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,260
- It's my baby. 
 - Gosh, why are you so inflexible?

409
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,800
No, no, no, no, please let go of that, ajumeoni.

410
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,940
I'll blur your face. Blur...

411
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:50,750
PD Choi isn't picking up her phone right now. So until she picks up I'll–

412
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,800
- Where did she go? 
 - What?

413
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,340
Where did she go? She was right here.

414
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:03,270
Where did Eun Chong go?

415
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,920
Eun Chong!

416
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,700
Why did you get dumped by Officer Jung?

417
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:17,480
Well, just, I don't think we even properly dated at all.

418
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,940
Ah, he just stopped liking me. Are you happy now?

419
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,420
Really?

420
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:37,790
But why did you hit Ba Reum Oppa earlier?

421
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,900
I misunderstood so I apologized to Officer Jung.

422
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,420
Oh.

423
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,750
Oh Bong Yi.

424
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,950
You need to be happy.

425
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:02,010
If you're hurting or unhappy then your grandmother will be really sad.  You know that, right?

426
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,360
Take it easy.

427
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,060
But why did you come to the Mujin station?

428
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,940
You had called me a couple of times too.

429
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,780
Oh, that student who

430
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,820
saved me. The owner of the uniform. I found him.

431
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,950
Really?

432
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,540
It's Seong Yo Han.

433
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,430
What did you say?

434
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:37,530
I confirmed that it was Seong Yo Han.

435
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,020
Don't you find something weird about this?

436
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,730
Psychopaths are quite good at acting.

437
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,300
It's all a show so that they can pretend to be good-natured.

438
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,000
- He must have been acting. 
 - No, it wasn't an act.

439
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,640
It was real.

440
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,890
Back then, when I was on his back,

441
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,180
I was unconscious.

442
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,990
 But I woke up for a very short while. 

443
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,080
 And I heard him talking to me, his voice filled with worry and desperation. 

444
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,330
 Think about your family, they'll be very sad if you die. 

445
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,370
 Mom. Dad. 

446
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,240
 Grandma. 

447
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,200
I mean, he wouldn't have had any reason to put up an act in front of me who was unconscious at the time.

448
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,220
It wasn't an act but what he truly felt.

449
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,910
But how can a psychopath do that? Does... Does this make sense right now?

450
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:42,280
Ajusshi, what if...? Just what if

451
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,580
Seong Yo Han isn't the criminal?

452
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,940
Then that means my grandmother and Father

453
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,770
were killed by someone else.

454
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,750
Don't say such ridiculous things.

455
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:02,250
It was definitely Seong Yo Han who killed my brother.

456
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,900
But...

457
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,340
Oh, it looks like they all went home.

458
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,940
Meanwhile, your team leader's hair looks like it's going to fall out.

459
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,120
Ah, it must be nice for you who aren't busy.

460
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,760
But should I trust what Go Mu Chi said or not?

461
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,520
Why is this at Detective Shin's desk?

462
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:17,010
   

463
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,640
   

464
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,870
House of Love?

465
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,020
If it's the House of Love...

466
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,650
 Oppa isn't coming. He won't keep his promise. 

467
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,300
Michaela?

468
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,980
 Song Soo Ho cried all night after my brother came to see him. 

469
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,680
 By then, his family was all dead. 

470
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,980
No way...

471
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,110
Yes, it’s the police. Did you report someone missing?

472
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,300
Yes.

473
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,710
I sent the picture. Can you confirm it?

474
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,360
Ah, yes. That is my wife. Where is that place?

475
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,740
We might miss each other, so we'll take her to you.

476
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,960
Please wait at home.

477
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,960
 Seong Yo Han isn't the criminal? Then that means my grandmother and Father 

478
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,150
 were killed by someone else. 

479
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,620
Thank you. Please go back.

480
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,830
Honey. Where did you get him from?

481
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,660
It's my child. My child.

482
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,330
- Honey. 
 - My child.

483
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,100
Yes? Hello?

484
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,050
Yes, excuse me. Where did you find my wife?

485
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,860
You found him somewhere around here.

486
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,560
Do you remember where you found him?

487
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,740
Ah, hurry up and tell me who's child this is!

488
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,930
His mother must be waiting. You'll be in trouble.

489
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,440
It's my child. My child.

490
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,990
This won't do. Let's take him to the police station.

491
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,630
- No! 
 - Honey!

492
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,560
  Honey!  

493
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,020
Honey!

494
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,770
Honey! Honey!

495
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,920
Eun Chong!

496
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,730
Eun Chong!

497
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,240
- Was there an accident? 
 - Yes.

498
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,560
Ah, it seems like she was seriously injured.

499
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,370
Oh no.

500
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,650
- You cannot enter. 
 - Baby. Baby!

501
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,040
Wait a moment. Baby!

502
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,370
Wait a moment! Baby!

503
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,110
Aish, it was here!

504
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,880
This punk. When did he take it?

505
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,340
Is the Evidence Storage Team a store? A store?

506
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,710
Huh? Just anyone taking this...

507
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:35,230
The endless evidence that shows that Seong Yo Han is the culprit,

508
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,880
I'll prove it by looking through everything, one by one, from beginning to end.

509
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,900
So there's no room for arguing.

510
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,980
Mujin Detention Center accepts AIDS patients.

511
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,910
Blood test with all prisoners.

512
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,830
What was this again?

513
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,400
 What is this? 

514
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,520
What happened?

515
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,700
Fortunately, the child is okay aside from being shocked.

516
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,150
There is no bruising so it's a relief.

517
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,940
- How about the child's mom? 
 - While protecting the child,

518
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,640
it seems like she's more seriously injured.

519
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,880
Tonight will be critical.

520
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,150
Hey, Porn.

521
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,340
Do you see this cut mark?

522
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,400
- Find out what it is. 
 - Ah.

523
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,460
- There's a little left, so would it be possible to figure it out? 
 - You should say, "yes."

524
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,050
Yes. Okay, okay.

525
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:18,960
Anyway, I'll figure it out but it'll take some time.

526
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,850
I'll find out where she got him.

527
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,410
Please take him for tonight.

528
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,720
Excuse me!

529
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,010
Where is my child?

530
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,550
Over there. There was an accident on the road.

531
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,350
Wait a moment. I will confirm.

532
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:59,010
He was Seong Yo Han's child?

533
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,310
Where is my child?

534
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,120
Han Seo Joon, that punk.

535
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,810
In the end, to my whole family...

536
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,530
Hyun Soo and Hyun Seok weren't enough

537
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,830
so even the children's mother...

538
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,120
My baby is okay, right?

539
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,570
Our Eun Chong is okay, right?

540
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,480
Tell this to your husband.

541
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,780
If you want to save your bloodline,

542
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,540
tell me where Hyun Soo is buried immediately.

543
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,160
If not, then your grandson will die.

544
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,260
You

545
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,170
will end up killing him.

546
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:53,080
Please. Please.

547
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,930
Please, just not the child.

548
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,940
What crime did the child commit?

549
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,580
What kind of crime?

550
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,270
Before the kid's mother passes away,

551
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:07,910
I want to find at least Hyun Soo's bones.

552
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,020
Go and tell Han Seo Joon.

553
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,180
Your grandson is in my hands

554
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:16,560
so let's switch for Hyun Soo.

555
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:20,590
No. No...

556
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,700
Oh, Eun Chong's mom.

557
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,560
I tried calling you several times. Did something happen?

558
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,850
Oh. No, nothing happened.

559
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,460
What about Eun Chong? Is he sleeping?

560
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah. He's sleeping.

561
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,550
Yes.

562
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,260
He came.

563
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,060
Prosecutor Yoon Dong Sik. You are the prosecutor who dismissed the arrest warrant

564
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,040
for Woo Hyeong Cheol, right?

565
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,550
What are you doing right now?

566
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,480
I have nothing to say.

567
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:45,000
D-Detective get up!

568
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,830
Come on! Take a look at this.

569
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,280
   

570
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,000
What's this?

571
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,140
Song Soo Ho had sponsored our St. Mary's Love Society for over 10 years.

572
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:06,500
He designated Michaela and has been giving her personal support as well.

573
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,420
Did he also come here to see her?

574
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,690
He would visit from time to time and would just watch her from afar.

575
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:18,280
I can't forget the look in his eyes even now.

576
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,750
Filled with with pain and regret.

577
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:27,110
That was the look in his eyes as he watched Michaela.

578
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,510
 She said Song Soo Ho would cry all night after coming back from Guryeong. 

579
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,860
 It was around that time that kid's family had all died. 

580
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,990
 Die! 

581
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,550
 Dad is back! 

582
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,540
 There was an accident. 

583
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,160
 The child's mother was trying to kill him, so 

584
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,540
 while I was trying to stop that... 

585
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,430
 Jae Hoon's parents... 

586
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,470
 Yes, Jae Hoon is safe. 

587
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,480
 Yes, I understand. 

588
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,810
 I didn't know there was a child. 

589
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,380
 I didn't know there was a child in the house. 

590
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,710
 The reason I killed your family 

591
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,370
 is because your mother tried to kill you.  

592
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:13,340
 If you die, then the world I dream of cannot come true. 

593
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,330
 A world where there are no victims like my sister again. 

594
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,490
   

595
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:50,330
Why did Seong Yo Han come here?

596
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:05,390
Jae Hee, it's me your brother, Jae Hoon. Jae Hoon.

597
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,180
Do you remember me?

598
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,220
Oppa Jae Hoon?

599
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,200
Oppa Jae Hoon.

600
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,080
Yeah.

601
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,340
What happened that day?

602
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:26,350
Jae Min. Jae Min. "No. No."

603
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:30,380
"You can't go. Don't look. Don't make a sound."

604
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:33,110
What? What do you mean by that?

605
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:37,610
- Jae Hee. Don't look. Don't make a sound. 
  - Jae Hee. Don't look. Don't make a sound. 

606
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:06,370
 Oppa, oppa! 

607
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,950
So Jae Min...

608
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,520
That's how Jae Min...

609
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,550
"I'm scared, lonely,

610
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,400
I want to cry,

611
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,820
And I want someone to console me. But there's no one

612
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,490
by my side. I'm scared.

613
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:18,850
I'm scared, Jae Hee."

614
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,840
Jae Hee.

615
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,750
What do you mean?

616
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,150
Who said that?

617
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,530
What's this?

618
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:41,070
It was a short time after I heard the unfortunate news of our benefactor, that he came here.

619
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:46,560
He came here twice. The second time he came he looked extremely exhausted.

620
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,590
That day he asked if he could talk to Michaela in private,

621
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:53,700
so I let him sit there with her.

622
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:57,740
I think he must have thought of Michaela as just a sick child.

623
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,310
He must not have known that she was a special child, who can remember

624
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:04,760
every little word and every action she hears and sees.

625
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:07,360
It's this way.

626
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,310
To think that you've found your little sister after 15 years. You must have a lot to discuss.

627
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:13,370
You should have a chat.

628
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,300
Thank you.

629
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:32,510
"Jae Hee.

630
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:36,410
I'm scared and lonely."

631
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:39,070
 I want to cry. 

632
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,460
 I want to be comforted. 

633
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,820
 But there's no one next to me. 

634
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,210
 I'm scared. 

635
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,720
 I'm scared, Jae Hee. 

636
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,340
Seong Yo Han cried?

637
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:06,310
What else did he say, Jae Hee?

638
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:09,840
Jae Hoon. Jae Hoon.

639
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,720
Jae Hoon?

640
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,860
He talked about me?

641
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:32,480
 "Everyone was scared of that child and avoided him." 

642
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,300
 - Dong Gu– 
 - Let go of me! 

643
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,430
"In those eyes that passed by in an instant,

644
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:44,770
I saw that child's eyes from 15 years ago."

645
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,660
 It was a surprise attack. 

646
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,120
 When someone sees a weapon, they would reflectively block it with their hand. 

647
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:58,530
 The fact that there are signs of defense on his fingers means he was attacked even before he even had time to put his hands up. 

648
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,410
 If it were before his hand was raised, 

649
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:04,300
 it was someone he was close to. 

650
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:08,250
 About that, the one who complained followed Han Seo Joon. 

651
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:12,410
 Guard Na ignored Headhunter to fix his habit... 

652
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,140
 The closest person... 

653
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,550
 Is he indeed that child? 

654
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:21,520
 I have something to say about the recent murder case. 

655
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,240
 What does that have to do with me? 

656
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,630
 I know who the suspect is in that case. 

657
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,870
 He is a very dangerous guy. 

658
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:32,790
  I wanted to confirm  

659
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,070
 if he really was that child. 

660
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,540
 What if him hugging Choi Hong Ju and crying 

661
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,020
 wasn't acting either. 

662
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,090
 What if that was his true self? 

663
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,120
 What are you thinking about, Mom? 

664
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,520
 Whenever you look at the sunlight, 

665
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,730
 you always look sad. 

666
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:11,060
 When I look at the sunlight, I'm sad because you're like that. 

667
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,510
 No. 

668
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,460
 I'm not sad. 

669
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:25,540
 I have Yo Han. Why would I be sad? 

670
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:29,380
 Who is the person visiting 4440? 

671
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,290
He rejected the visit.

672
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:36,100
Excuse me. It's because I really need to meet him.

673
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,410
Just one more time, please.

674
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:42,000
About that... If he rejects the visit, there's nothing we can do about it.

675
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,180
Please. Please, just...

676
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,670
I'm sorry.

677
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,250
Yo...

678
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:55,050
Please tell him that it is about Yo Han's child.

679
00:57:55,050 --> 00:58:00,210
"I couldn't believe Doctor Daniel's words.

680
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:04,040
That's why I asked Joon Sung, who is an employee at that company,"

681
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,960
 for a favor to look into the Finance Team 3. 

682
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,180
 - Why there? 
 - I need to confirm something. 

683
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:13,910
 I want to confirm if it's true. 

684
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,950
 Finance Team 3? Was there a Team 3? 

685
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:24,140
 Is it this? 
   

686
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:26,420
 I'll try to look into it. Yes. 

687
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,430
 You know my hacking skills. 

688
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,770
Ah, that's why Kim Joon Sung...

689
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:33,290
 Yo Han. It's me, Joon Sung. 

690
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:34,940
That voice message...

691
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:38,460
 About the thing you asked me to look into. I'm really scared. 

692
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,750
 I think I made a mistake. 

693
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,330
 It’s an organization called OZ. 

694
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,540
   

695
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:02,490
   

696
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,770
 Doctor Daniel was right. 

697
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:32,010
 How terrible, seriously. 

698
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,740
 How could 

699
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,930
 someone do something like this? 

700
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,450
 Because he's a psychopath, 

701
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:42,110
 he doesn't even doubt what he's doing. 

702
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,760
 What are you going to do? 

703
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,850
 We have to wait. Until he regains consciousness. 

704
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:55,850
 Don't be like that and let's just report it. 

705
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:57,940
 How can we trust the police? 

706
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,670
 Then should we go to the press? 

707
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,180
 Our opponent is the greatest power in Korea. 

708
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:05,210
 After reporting it, we might die without anyone even realizing it. 

709
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,540
 I don't know how far they can reach. 

710
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,350
 Then what should we do? 

711
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:13,590
 For now, let's wait until the doctor wakes up. 

712
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:18,430
 I'm scared. 

713
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:22,930
 Yo Han. If they find out I hacked them and stole data. 

714
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:26,190
 For now, go abroad. 

715
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:26,970
 What about you? 

716
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:30,760
 When Doctor Daniel wakes up, I'll move with him. 

717
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,500
 Don't worry. He'll wake up soon. 

718
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:50,100
 If she reports me, then the grandma will be in danger too. 

719
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:56,030
 I think she got off here. 

720
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,740
   

721
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,780
 Gudong? 

722
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,110
 It's the neighborhood Jung Ba Reum lives in. 

723
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:03,620
 If she reports me... 

724
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:06,260
 Jung Ba Reum can't know about this. 

725
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:44,290
 Only if I didn't wear Joon Sung's jacket that day... 

726
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:48,350
 Joon Sung was my only friend. 

727
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:55,330
 Even when everyone else pointed fingers at me for being the Headhunter's son, he was always by my side. 

728
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,980
 But because of me... 

729
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,730
 I'm going to kill Jung Ba Reum myself. 

730
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:09,720
 That's why he had my photos at his house. 

731
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,690
Then why did Seong Yo Han put Jung Ba Reum's photos here?

732
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:00,890
 A search warrant for a suspect came out just now. 

733
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,740
 Search warrant? 

734
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,280
 Doctor. 

735
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,310
 Are you okay? 

736
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:44,720
Then if it wasn't Han Kook who was inside his car

737
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:50,430
whose blood was it found in his car?

738
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:09,030
Who could it be?

739
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:16,630
   

740
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,050
 Jae Hee. 

741
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:28,460
 In this world, there are only the two of us. 

742
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,060
Huh?

743
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,550
No matter how hard I think, I don't think it's Seong Yo Han.

744
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:58,320
I have no way to confirm it.

745
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,130
Ah, that stings.

746
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:13,900
That's right. Scar from the knife.

747
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:14,450
There's nothing else other than the abdominal gunshot wounds.

748
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:17,760
No, I'm telling you that he had a scar on his left arm.

749
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,960
Something like a cut from a knife.

750
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,190
There's no scar on the arm.

751
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,650
Are you sure?

752
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:26,390
- Look. 
 - There isn't one?

753
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:28,430
It's not there.

754
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:31,050
No, then why are you sure the culprit is Seong Yo Han?

755
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:33,040
I definitely told you.

756
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,610
What are you talking about? Look at this.

757
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,140
It's not in your statement.

758
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:44,450
That can't be. I definitely said so.

759
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:46,680
 Ah, right! 

760
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:50,310
 I think I cut that guy's arm. 

761
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:51,510
 Really? 

762
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:54,520
 On the left. I think it was on his left arm. 

763
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,240
 Okay, I'll tell Detective Kang about this. 

764
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,120
Ah, who did tell? Are you sure?

765
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,760
Who didn't report it?

766
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,120
Are you sure you cut the suspect's arm?

767
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:11,010
That... I might've been mistaken.

768
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:15,120
I'll look into it and let you know.

769
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,000
Okay.

770
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:23,670
   

771
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:26,560
Did he forget to tell him?

772
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:29,930
No how could Oppa

773
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:33,060
leave something important like that out?

774
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:38,020
 The phone is off so you will be connected to voicemail... 

775
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:46,090
Seong Yo Han came to get Han Seo Joon's blood. Not to kill Na Chi Kook.

776
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:48,360
If it's not Seong Yo Han,

777
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:51,900
who is it?

778
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,000
 We whined together and carried it to the front of the concert hall. 

779
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,250
 There we talked about this and that and said goodbye. 

780
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:02,720
 I saw Chi Kook leave and brought the box inside. 

781
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,600
How could you move the magic box to the concert hall?

782
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:10,040
An unconscious, slouchy adult man.

783
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,490
Excuse me.

784
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:36,700
4440 will allow the visit.

785
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:40,980
Oppa.

786
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:57,490
Oppa. I have something to ask...

787
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:07,340
Look at how tired he looks.

788
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:21,460
If the magic box was here in the first place.

789
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:24,740
What if he was inside put in the box and was dragged from here?

790
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:29,610
 There is a diagonal mirror in here. 

791
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:31,840
 So have a person go inside the space behind the mirror... 

792
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,900
 As soon as I entered, I put it here in this corner 

793
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,130
 so that it wouldn't get in the way of the members. 

794
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,270
 Ah, we did leave the box unattended while we were having lunch. 

795
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:41,270
Everything is in Jung Ba Reum's statement.

796
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,560
What if Jung Ba Reum was lying to me?

797
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,350
