00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,990
   

3
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,120
Let's meet the actors! 
    

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,740
You're going to answer honestly, right? 
    

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,940
I had a phone call, but who is this? 
    

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,540
I really hate him, despise him, and want to kill him, but...
    

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,920
Hyung, please watch our drama! Ah, seriously!

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,510
And the award goes to....
    

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,740
- Awesome! 
 - Really?

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,500
 Look forward to it. 
   

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,410
 Did you really put that murder bastard's brain into my head? 
   

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,210
 You found out sooner than expected. 

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,870
 How boring. 

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,810
 You're not a god. You're just not human. 
   

15
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,000
 You're just a terrible monster. 

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,180
 So you should experience the same thing. 
   

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,300
 An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. 
   

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,100
You knew I was a predator from the beginning, huh?

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,430
   

20
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,200
tvN drama

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,910
that marks a new horizon for the genre.

22
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,910
A human hunting drama, Mouse.

23
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,990
What we weren't able to see, the behind story.

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,290
We will have time to dive into behind the scenes.

25
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,010
Let's meet the actors for the protagonists of Mouse.

26
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,980
Please come out!

27
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,710
   

28
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,990
Oh!

29
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,570
Ah! No, this is!

30
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,820
Uh Bung Yi!

31
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,190
It was Uh Bung Yi? 
    

32
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,330
Did you prepare this?

33
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,460
It's a fake Bung Yi, rather.

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,850
The bird got bigger?

35
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,480
It's no fun if we start right away.

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,750
Nice to meet you.

37
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,410
The drama that made everyone like Sherlock Holmes, 
    

38
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,970
filled with mystery and suspense. 
    

39
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,830
Mouse, a terrifying, crime thriller  
    

40
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,110
and human hunting drama, 
    

41
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,850
had the big finale yesterday.

42
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,680
All of you guys worked hard.

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,090
- You worked hard. 
 - You worked hard.

44
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,590
Oh my goodness! 
    

45
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,070
It's really soft chemistry. 
    

46
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,490
Why only to Seung Gi?

47
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,230
Did you hug him and not to anyone else?

48
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,950
- Because they're far. 
 - Because we're far.

49
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,140
   

50
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,020
The mystery that has been piling up

51
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,870
and was revealed one by one as the drama went.

52
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,050
I thought about this. For Lee Seung Gi,

53
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,150
you were hiding and keeping it to yourself

54
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,850
and how hard it must've been.

55
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,360
- This secret? 
 - That's right.

56
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,930
In the beginning of the drama, everyone had the burning desire

57
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,860
to figure out who the culprit is.

58
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,540
I got a bunch of requests asking who the real culprit is.

59
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,680
PSY Hyung got in touch and he usually doesn't say these kinds of things, but

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,600
he sent me a message saying that the drama is really fun.

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,980
He said it's really fun.

62
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,270
It was the scene where Bong Yi's grandma died. 
    

63
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,770
He was asking me who the culprit was.

64
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,160
So I told him, it must be someone.

65
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,410
He said, "Be sure to catch and punish him." But it was me...

66
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,410
- "I can't catch and punish myself." 
 - Right.

67
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,470
You feel refreshed now, right?

68
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,540
I do.

69
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,680
Can you try shouting once, "I am the predator!"

70
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,570
   

71
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,880
"I am the predator!"

72
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,950
- It's really embarrassing. 
 - Why?

73
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,220
I am the predator.

74
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,270
- I am the predator. 
 - Oh! How scary!

75
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,560
So scary!

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,520
   

77
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,160
As the viewers watched, they thought it's Mouse because you get cramps in your head  (T/N: Cramps also means rat in Korean) 
   

78
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,180
That was the viewer's personal opinion. 
    

79
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,120
Did actress Kyung Soo Jin

80
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,870
start filming after knowing the content?

81
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,180
In some character relationship chart, "Do I know Daniel or not?"

82
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,150
- Because of that, I got a cramp in my head. 
 - Are you okay now?

83
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,730
So I asked to meet with the writer

84
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,620
to discuss how the script will flow

85
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,340
and heard from that. 
    

86
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,760
This is my second project with Jae Yun Hyung.

87
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,380
- I didn't know that Jae Yun Hyung was this good at acting. 
 - Then before that?

88
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,460
That's because

89
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,850
Jae Yun Hyung acted as Daniel without knowing his narrative. 
    

90
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,100
Wow!

91
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,710
 Until episode 14. 

92
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,760
I was always on the phone with someone. 
    

93
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,390
He's talking to someone, but doesn't know who he's talking to!

94
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,390
So funny! 
    

95
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,410
He didn't even ask and kept acting very hard.

96
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,430
   

97
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,780
 I think all of his memories came back. 
   

98
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,180
 We need to stop him from creating an accident. 

99
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,690
I only have lines by myself.

100
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,120
There's no one listening to me. I was talking by myself.
    

101
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,850
"Is that so?" "Okay." Hang up.

102
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,600
The whole time,

103
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,040
I thought I was talking to Choi Young Shin.

104
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,800
   

105
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,810
But it turns out, I was talking to Hong Ju.

106
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,160
I found that out in episode 17.

107
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,140
During rehearsal, when he found out it wasn't Choi Young Shin, 
    

108
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,970
but Hong Ju he was talking to. 
    

109
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,710
"Ah, I understand everything now." 
  

110
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,630
Ah, really?

111
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,260
   

112
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,610
   

113
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,520
I filmed like that up to episode 19. 
    

114
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,320
- But the viewers didn't know. 
 - They couldn't have known.

115
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,310
He is really good at acting.

116
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,350
   

117
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,720
There are many things the viewers are curious about the actors.

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,380
I will

119
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,170
ask questions about what the actors and actresses think.

120
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,400
Simply, since it's Mouse,

121
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,980
you should end your answer with "mouse."  (T/N: They are ending every sentence of their answer with "jwi," which means mouse) 

122
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,380
Then you guys should say, "That's right. I did something, something."

123
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,370
Got it, Park Joo Hyun?

124
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,740
- Got it. 
 -  Oh, that's good. That's good.

125
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,630
Lee Hee Jun,

126
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,270
you're going to answer honestly, right?

127
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,410
- Of course. 
 - Of course.

128
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,480
I feel like I'm going to be scolded.

129
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,280
I will ask you one by one. First, Lee Seung Gi.

130
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,180
Did you especially work hard to

131
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,630
set up the character of Jung Ba Reum?

132
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,630
Starting from episode 6,

133
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,430
there is a twist about Ba Reum. 
    

134
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,940
I thought Ba Reum had to be appealing 
    

135
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,960
- until Episode 6. 
 - Is that right?

136
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,430
That's why a little more than the script...

137
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,840
Be more kind.

138
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,240
No.

139
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,210
A little more... 
    

140
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,830
Brighter.

141
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,690
- Brighter? 
 - Brighter. 
    

142
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,710
- Brighter. 
 - You were trying to end with "mouse."

143
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,190
- His personality was brighter. 
 - Yeah, more bright.

144
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,920
I thought about that the most, since there has to be a twist to his character later on.

145
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,200
 Isn't this peppy? You will become the most fashionable person in town.
   

146
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,600
 Hurry and come out. 
   

147
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,320
 That way it's fun for me. 

148
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,170
From episode 3 and episode 4, I thought about

149
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,730
what kind of charm I should capture. 
    

150
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,860
Okay. Next, Lee Hee Jun.
    

151
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,870
If it were me, I would've gave up on living.

152
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,780
But I thought a lot about how Go Mu Chi was able to live on.

153
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,070
- If he's a real person? 
 - Yes-mouse.

154
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,620
   

155
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,630
Everything that Bong Yi went through,

156
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,610
her scars,

157
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,620
and her circumstances. These were all things I had never experienced.

158
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,030
That's why I tried very hard to imagine myself in her position.

159
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,770
Thinking about what she would do in this situation

160
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,720
and how she would get through it.

161
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,090
- How she would get through it. 
 - How she would get through it.

162
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,460
As for me, I had a lot of parts where 
    

163
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,040
I had to pretend to not know.

164
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,790
   

165
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,700
I kept thinking about, what I felt towards my parents, 
   

166
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,350
and why I couldn't go back home. 
    

167
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,570
I was able to show all of those feelings burst out in the end, 
    

168
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,100
and that's how it got resolved for me.

169
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,390
Let's end this 'mouse' play-on-words with Kyung Soo Jin.

170
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,860
I knew I wasn't going to do it anyway. 
    

171
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,190
   

172
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,770
I was prepared for nothing, huh? 
    

173
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,400
   

174
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,670
   

175
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,290
   

176
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,640
From the first episode till the end, 
    

177
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,680
I tried to act so that I wouldn't seem like a serial killer.
   

178
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,280
If someone were to meet a serial killer in the streets,
   

179
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,480
they wouldn't think, "Oh, that guy looks scary."

180
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,070
- You're right. 
 - They wouldn't. 
    

181
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,140
So that's why I tried to

182
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,600
act like any ordinary person out there,

183
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,610
an ordinary doctor.

184
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,010
I focused more on trying to come off as

185
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,390
a normal guy.

186
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,690
- As for Jo Jae Yun... 
 - Oh, me?

187
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,780
What efforts did you put in for setting up your character?

188
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,730
I actually have white hair, this is my hair. 
    

189
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,370
    But I can't have it the same in the past. 
    

190
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,550
So I had to dye my hair. 
    

191
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,390
I was considering wearing a wig.

192
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,110
But I thought it would be too obvious and would look strange.

193
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,680
So I got each strand sprayed one by one,

194
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,430
and got it all dyed.

195
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,860
In order to express my character in the most real way,

196
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,600
I carefully thought about and chose everything from the glasses I used 
    

197
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,660
to each and every outfit of mine. 
    

198
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,980
But as the second half commences, you can't really figure it out.
 (T/N: He still ended his sentence with 'jwi'/ mouse) 

199
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,720
   

200
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,690
- That was hard, wasn't it? 
 - It definitely was.

201
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,480
It was frustrating and quite maddening. 
  (all ending with "jwi" / mouse) 

202
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,700
   

203
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,450
   

204
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,970
   

205
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,890
   

206
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,570
I'm always on the phone with somebody, but with whom?

207
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,190
   

208
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,420
   

209
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,340
I only knew after the call ended.

210
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,380
- Oh really? 
 - Yeah.

211
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,690
- He got to know afterward! 
 - He did.

212
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,070
In your opinion, which is the best line

213
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:23,190
and the best scene of the drama Mouse? 
    

214
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,140
As for me, it was

215
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,420
- the scene after killing Father Mu Won, 
 - Oh yeah.

216
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,920
when I was front of God.

217
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,800
   

218
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,020
 I asked you to not let me become a monster. 

219
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,310
 I begged. 

220
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,070
 But you completely ignored my prayer. 

221
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,540
 How can you call yourself a god? 

222
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,130
 From now on I am God. 

223
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,500
I really liked the line, "I begged."

224
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,430
In that line, 
    

225
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,490
I had to do a lot of variations. 
    

226
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,830
That (the one with the younger actor) was the one picked to air on the actual episode,

227
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,300
but on the set, we had tried various versions of it. 
    

228
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,140
 "I begged." 

229
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,720
 "I asked you to not let me become a monster."  
   

230
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,980
 "I asked you to not let me become a monster." 

231
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,530
I really liked that line that much. 
    

232
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,130
Which is the scene that stayed with you the most?

233
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,550
Or any dialogue? 
    

234
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,860
Goddammit.

235
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,280
That was it.

236
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,700
   

237
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,430
I thought he got upset right now.

238
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,690
I thought he was angry with what was happening right now.

239
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,480
    
    

240
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,010
From the first episode,

241
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,170
this was the most difficult.

242
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,810
 You went through a lot.  
    

243
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,090
 The misunderstanding is all cleared up now. 

244
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,830
 It's you. 

245
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,420
 Goddammit. 

246
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,200
At home, I thought about that line a lot. 
    

247
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,740
"Ah, how should I do this?" I thought about it so much that 
    

248
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,640
while shooting that scene, my throat went hoarse.

249
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,300
   

250
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,400
Rather than a line, there was this one scene

251
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,610
that I got attached to. It was with Kyung Soo Jin.

252
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,080
At the bar... 
    

253
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,640
I was really drunk at the bar and I said to Soo Jin,

254
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,460
 What about that bastard were you so crazy about?  
    

255
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,520
 He's a lot like me. 

256
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,860
 Why? Did you kill someone too? 

257
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,350
 Don't touch me! 

258
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,770
 Don't put your hands on my body! 

259
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,150
That was the scene

260
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,100
that I became really attached to.

261
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,870
Then I'll ask you straight away.

262
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,980
Kyung Soo Jin, did you also get attached to that scene? 
    

263
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,780
I think Oppa really likes that scene.

264
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,730
   

265
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,300
Is it because PD Choi was rude...?

266
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,810
No! 
     
    

267
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,230
I didn't really have that many scenes where I could tell my story.

268
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,630
She did have it quite hard. 
    

269
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,370
As for me personally,

270
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,330
when I meet my mother,

271
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,190
after she gets hurt

272
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,030
because of my child. 
    

273
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,960
   

274
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,380
 Mom, I'm the one at fault. 

275
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,140
 I... 

276
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,110
 I didn't have the confidence to see you and dad. 

277
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,220
 I really missed you. 

278
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,830
It was quite hard for me, talking to my mother after so long.

279
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,490
So that was the scene

280
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,920
where I could express my feelings.

281
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,320
- There weren't many that you could. 
 - There weren't.

282
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,140
Unlike Unni, I had a lot of emotional scenes.

283
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,330
 I feel like I'm going crazy. 

284
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:41,040
She was always exploding with feelings, very honest. 
   

285
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,680
 When I realized that it was actually Ba Reum, 

286
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,950
and that he was the one who killed my grandmother, I hated him a lot, despised him, 
    

287
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,270
I wanted to kill him.

288
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,670
   

289
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,370
You said that with such a strong intonation.

290
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,460
He was Bong Yi's first love. 
    

291
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,790
That's why I think she was more sad. 
    

292
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,300
I think that's what stayed with me the most.

293
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,060
Jo Jae Yun, which was the most memorable scene or line for you?

294
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,360
- When you were on a call with someone? 
 - On the phone?

295
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,410
Would there be any? 
    

296
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,900
As for me, it was actually the word, "Sorry."

297
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,460
It had a really big message.

298
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,790
 I'm sorry, Han Kook.  
    

299
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,500
 I'm sorry.  
    

300
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,390
   

301
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,080
 Hyung will always be sorry. 

302
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,800
You see, "I'm sorry" are the words I use the most at home...

303
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,100
I never thought about what it meant that much. 
    

304
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,330
   

305
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,240
"I'm sorry."

306
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,190
People actually do say this a lot.

307
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,330
Those three syllables have a different meaning in each situation. 
    

308
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,660
Everyone here

309
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,890
are really good actors.

310
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,240
So as a viewer myself, watching them,

311
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,560
- I was very touched. 
 - Yes.

312
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,920
    
    

313
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,250
There is a scene that the viewers of our drama 'Mouse'

314
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,950
can not miss out. 
    

315
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,070
Our production crew tried to assemble

316
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,960
every single crumb of behind-the-scenes videos.

317
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,740
Here's the behind story that our viewers haven't been able to see.

318
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,050
Scenes that weren't able to air were put together for the viewers. 
    

319
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,480
While watching the behind the scenes,

320
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,530
you guys should comfortably talk about

321
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,010
whatever comes to your mind.

322
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,620
I'll start with the first keyword.

323
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,440
- It's rain. 
 - I can't even stand to look at that word.

324
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,710
The first thing Ms. Park Ju Hyun said was that she doesn't even like seeing the word.

325
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,460
         

326
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,270
Bong Yi got drenched by the rain a lot. 
    

327
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,750
Those scenes were almost always shot in the winter, too.

328
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,330
- What month was that? 
 - February. February. It was super cold.

329
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,170
It was minus 17º Celsius that day. 
    

330
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,570
 Let go of me!  
    

331
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,150
- It became like that, didn't it? 
 - How cold was it that, that happened? 
    

332
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,830
My hair froze too. 
    

333
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,930
Does having the blanket make it a little warmer?

334
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,260
- Not really. 
 - It doesn't, right? 
 - It was just to wipe the water off.

335
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,450
You really went through a lot.

336
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,540
But after a day filming in such conditions,

337
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,980
did you not catch a cold? 
    

338
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,420
- Doesn't it hurt all over?
- It does hurt... My whole body aches.

339
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,520
It's because I was trembling all over.

340
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,330
So one of the first things sunbaenim said to me was,

341
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,040
"Do you really want to continue acting?"

342
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,660
I got drenched that day too.

343
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,160
We had to act even in that extreme cold. 
    

344
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,230
I thought it would be cool to shoot such a great scene
   

345
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,260
so I endured it.
   

346
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,720
It was the first time I thought, "Ah, I want to go home."

347
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,300
And then when I saw her

348
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,890
trembling, I asked her, "Ju Hyun, can you do this for 20 more years?"

349
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,030
That's what I asked her jokingly.

350
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,750
But she couldn't answer.

351
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,580
We're having such a hard time filming this show

352
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,440
but we're enjoying it too.

353
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,980
So please give our show a lot of love.

354
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,790
The thing is, it wasn't only our Bong Yi who suffered with the rain.

355
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,590
Ba Reum also had quite the number of scenes in the rain. 
    

356
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,300
Let's see the video.

357
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,610
 Oh Bong Yi!  
    

358
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,590
 It's me, Officer Jung!  
    

359
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,720
 It's me, Officer Jung! 

360
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,160
Now, take a look at this. 
    

361
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,960
I didn't know Lee Seung Gi could look that good in a raincoat. 
    

362
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,530
    
    

363
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,950
When it's raining during the action scenes... 
    

364
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,560
That day was really cold. Super cold. 
    

365
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,930
I was just laying there like that, ahh. 
    

366
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,750
I just wanted to dig a hole in the ground and go into it.

367
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,100
- You really can't sleep on the street... seriously. 
 - You'll get sick.

368
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,740
My mouth... seriously...

369
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,580
   

370
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,850
It was really cold.

371
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,970
The asphalt was much colder than the pavement.

372
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,680
- Which is colder the earth, grass, asphalt, or the pavement? 
 - The earth is really warm.

373
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,010
After that comes the pavement  
    

374
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,140
and the asphalt is really cold.

375
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,710
Wow, you really seem like an expert. 
    

376
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:41,040
There was a scene where Mu Chi's family went camping. 
    

377
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,510
 Is it much further?  
    

378
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,420
 It's supposed to be around here somewhere.  
    

379
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,430
 The way...  
      

380
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:52,370
 Ajussi, do you know where the Oseong Camping Grounds are?  
    

381
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,310
 L-Let me live! 

382
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,940
   

383
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,520
Wasn't this a day when it was supposed to

384
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,920
- snowed a lot? 
 - When we started filming that winter,

385
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,170
it wasn't snowing.

386
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:14,060
So for scenes like that one and the one in Han Seo Joon's yard that needed snow,

387
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,620
we were ready to go to Gangwon or anywhere

388
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,620
it was going to snow, on the first day.

389
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,130
But amazingly enough, from the day we filmed the camping ground scene,

390
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,570
it started to snow a lot. 
    

391
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,370
The entire mountain was covered with snow.

392
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,530
So we decided that we didn't have to really do any CGI. 
    

393
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,200
So I didn't really

394
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,270
have it too hard due to the cold.

395
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,410
But Mu Chi's family really went through a lot.

396
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,380
That was when you were younger.

397
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,490
And later, when you're in prison, it's when a few years have gone by.

398
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,990
So you must have paid attention to the tone or 
    

399
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,240
any changes that you felt, right? 
    

400
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,780
To be honest, whenever I try to imagine the people that I know that are in their twenties, thirties,

401
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,230
forties, or fifties,

402
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,310
- there isn't much of a difference. 
 - There really isn't.

403
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,920
So when I was imprisoned, I made my voice a bit huskier

404
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,600
and a little bit more hoarse.

405
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,850
 Blessing, cover your ears. 

406
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,890
 Your mother needs to only think and speak about good things for your sake  
    

407
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,610
 but she's being naughty, isn't she? 

408
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,690
 I don't have a grandson. 

409
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,740
 You said you killed our Blessing.  
    

410
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,250
 As soon as he was born, with your own hands. 

411
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,460
Let's see the video related to the next keyword. 
    

412
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,910
   

413
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,810
 As you know,  
    

414
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,150
 due to a GCH1 gene mutation located in– 

415
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,430
Actually, the most difficult thing at that time was,

416
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,470
I went on set, and there were so many foreigners there.

417
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,080
I didn't know that it would be full with dozens of people!

418
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,830
My mouth actually started to tremble.

419
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,670
I was quite stressed. 
    

420
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,800
Anyway, on that day, we filmed like that.

421
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,740
 - Yes.  
 - And there was another episode.

422
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,000
The next day, with the patient in the hospital room, 
     

423
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,070
and together with the hospital director and other physicians, 
    

424
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,000
there is a scene where we are talking while looking at the patient.  The director starts talking first.

425
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,100
The American actor speaking with an American accent.
    

426
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,230
   

427
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,160
After they said, "cut," and he left,

428
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,220
I said, "Excuse me, but shouldn't that foreign person be using a British accent also?"

429
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,420
"He's using an American accent."

430
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,320
As for the British accent, 
    

431
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,650
He said that he doesn't feel confident doing it, and can't do it, so he won't do it.

432
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,470
Then what about me?

433
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,720
I memorized the British accent for weeks, 
    

434
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,330
but that person says, "I'm American, so I can't use a British accent."
    

435
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,000
He just left coolly.

436
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,300
 Well, you're in good hands now. 

437
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,790
 We'll take very good care of you. 

438
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,210
   

439
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,200
   

440
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,990
The next video is related to a dialogue.

441
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,100
It's Hong Ju and Mu Chi's broadcast scene.

442
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,720
 We will be holding a special emergency broadcast today. 

443
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,000
 There is something distinct about this serial killer case, isn't there? 

444
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,180
 Among the 7 victims of this serial killer case, Song Soo Ho 

445
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,720
 as well as this elder in her 70s is believed to have been killed 

446
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,650
 after she discovered the criminal's identity. Except for these two victims, the rest of the victims to murder and attempt to murder cases 

447
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,570
 were initially believed to be random. 

448
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,920
 He personally revealed that these 5 crimes were not random, right? 

449
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,380
 Yes, after talking to the culprit, I completely re-investigated these cases.  
    

450
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,080
Wow! It was as if in real life I had turned on a program about crimes. 
    

451
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,000
It was really the same.

452
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,080
The content of the entire fifth episode was mainly the broadcast.

453
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,900
I practiced that scene with Oppa the entire day before we shot that scene.

454
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,620
We rehearsed that scene thrice because it's so long.

455
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,990
I'm telling you this now,

456
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,300
but actually, my energy was drained after rehearsing 3 times.
    

457
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,640
So, during the actual broadcast,

458
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,540
I was not able to do as well as in the rehearsal.
    

459
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,930
- Because you were so exhausted? 
 - So I really regret those scenes.

460
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,890
Lee Hee Joon, how about you?

461
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:03,460
I felt like I was doing a play, something I haven't done in a long time. So I enjoyed it.

462
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,480
Oppa enjoyed it, but I had a pretty hard time.

463
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,560
Is there some kind of know-how to memorize long lines?
   

464
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,250
There isn't any. It's all practice.

465
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,370
I feel like I was asking you for a shortcut know-how. My apologies.

466
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,890
Let's quickly move on to the next scene.

467
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,810
I want to stop watching this scene... It's hard for me.

468
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:26,060
It was quite hard for me to watch as well. 
    

469
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,250
 Get angry at me. I made you like that.  
    

470
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,610
 So please get angry at me. I beg you.  
    

471
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:39,400
 Mu Chi there has never been a moment when I hated you. 

472
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,790
 No, no, hate me now. 

473
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,940
 Please, hate me! 

474
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:53,140
Did you have some kind of after-effect when you finished shooting that kind of scene?

475
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,520
Of course, I did.

476
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:00,280
- What was it? 
 - After shooting all night, I reached home and I had nothing to eat.

477
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,950
Usually, things like that don't irritate me.

478
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,830
But that day I became sensitive.

479
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,410
- Oh, because you were back from shooting? 
 - So I got annoyed at my wife

480
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,080
and asked her why there wasn't anything I could eat.

481
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,730
Later, my wife  watched the fifth episode and

482
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,810
said she understood why I'd become so sensitive.

483
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:22,410
While doing scenes like that are there times when the director says NG? 
  (T/N: "NG" is short for "No Good," similar to saying "cut!") 

484
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,840
- Oh that doesn't happen. 
 - You do it at one go?

485
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,420
I did it all in one take, from the explanations to the crying at the end.

486
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,860
That one take was for 20 minutes.

487
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,380
So, you did that 20-minute scene in ten times?

488
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,950
I shot it ten times and almost passed out afterward.

489
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,760
It's not easy to make such a masterpiece. It's because they are such hardworking actors,

490
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,400
our viewers are able to watch such an amazing final product.

491
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,720
Let's go to the next scene.

492
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,130
Jung Ba Reum vs. The Bad Jung Ba Reum.

493
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:59,210
 I saw the guy who killed the student in the news. What should I do?  
    

494
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,190
 I'm right here, then who was it that this old woman saw?  
    

495
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,270
 Ch-Ch-Chi Kook!  
    

496
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,330
 Correctional Officer Na is injured badly! I think you need to come to the auditorium fast.  
    

497
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,360
 - Doctor! Doctor! 
 -Turn him over.  
    

498
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,680
 How annoying.  
    

499
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,170
 Why the hell is he interfering?  
    

500
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:23,490
You're acting out two different people in the same scene. 
    

501
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,090
Ah, I really used to like Lee Seung Gi.

502
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,500
I got goosebumps. 
    

503
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,840
While doing both versions of Jung Ba Reum which one made you think, "This one suits me better?"

504
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,950
I felt it was much harder to convey something to the viewers while playing the nice guy.

505
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,240
To be honest, when I'm playing the bad guy,

506
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,230
I have many more options, I can do this or that.

507
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,340
But while playing the really kind guy,

508
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,460
- Right, you couldn't swear... 
 - There aren't that many options. That's why I actually,

509
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,410
dwelled a lot on what range I should have along with the writer.

510
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,700
The more I talk to them, the more I realize how much thought

511
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,300
and struggle you had while acting your roles.

512
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,190
There's one more keyword left.
   

513
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,960
   

514
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,170
 The groom will enter now. Welcome him with a warm round of applause. 

515
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,830
When you're acting you usually have smaller groups of actors with whom you shoot.

516
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,090
You don't really get to come together like this, do you? 
    

517
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,770
It must have been really fun to come together like that, after a long time. I heard there were many ad-libs.

518
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,200
When Oppa Mu Chi was MC'ing he did a lot of ad-libs.

519
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,280
I did do many ad-libs but they got edited out in the episode.

520
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,240
   

521
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,510
Two, three, cue!

522
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,550
The bride, today's star, will now be entering.

523
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:46,510
Kim Da Seul majored in Western Arts,

524
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:50,480
in Formative Arts.

525
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,900
The groom chased her around for five years.
   

526
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,280
And they're finally getting married.
   

527
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,740
We were there the entire time and heard everything he said. 
    

528
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,170
- And we hardly made it to the episode. 
 - We looked really tiny, like ants.

529
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,800
We continuously stood there.

530
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,590
They were way back at the entrance.

531
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:18,540
- Bong Yi and Hong Ju. We were acting about 30 meters away from them. 
 - Why was Bong Yi even there...

532
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,340
They were there since there was a chance they might get caught on the camera.

533
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:28,440
Do you remember the ghost that was caught on the subway in Sunbaenim Lee Seung Hwan's music video? 
    

534
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,660
You mean they were hardly seen? 
    

535
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,950
I really wanted to asked this, Ahn Jae Wook,

536
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,370
Who did you have to best chemistry with, in prison?

537
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,080
The electric mouse? 
    

538
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,550
The electric mouse...

539
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,850
 Say hello. He's a friend of mine who stays in the same cell as me. 

540
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,790
   

541
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,200
I was asked a lot if it was a live mouse.

542
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,190
- Oh, it wasn't? 
 - No, no, no.

543
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,850
- That mouse was specially made for the show. It was controlled by a remote. 
 - Oh, really?

544
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,770
If it was real, I couldn't have touched it. 
    

545
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:05,140
So at the set, even though I was the notorious Headhunter, I got scared of it in real life.

546
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,540
Because it was so well-made.

547
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,950
Oh, I thought it was a real mouse.

548
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,510
There's another funny story.

549
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:16,310
Whenever there were dead animals in the show they were blurred because it was too cruel.

550
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,930
But in reality, it was just a teddy bear!

551
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,060
We shot with teddy bears covered in red paint.

552
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,760
As for the mice, we used rubber mice.

553
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,890
We used a cute rubber mice, although they were blurred. 
    

554
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,290
   

555
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:39,850
   

556
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:45,500
This isn't actually that important of a story but seeing Soo Jin reminds me of it.

557
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,000
I was always just sitting in prison, and everyone would come to visit me. 
    

558
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,460
That's true!

559
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,620
Every time I enter the visitation room, the guard lets me in.

560
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,430
But that day,

561
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,300
the guard wasn't ready. 
    

562
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,140
It was a very important scene.

563
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,460
   

564
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,440
Hong Ju was already immersed in her role and done with rehearsal.

565
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,920
And I was immersed in my role as well. I had to open the door and enter.

566
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,160
So completely in my role, I walked in and 
    

567
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,330
I opened the door but Hong Ju wasn't there!

568
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,220
- The room that Hong Ju was in, 
    /i&gt; 

569
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:37,230
I passed by it and went into another visiting room. 
    

570
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,570
So I was like, "Sunbaenim!"

571
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,520
I was so embarrassed.

572
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,560
  It's this room. It's this room!  

573
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,610
Soo Jin grabbed her emotions but was like

574
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,340
I'm h-here!

575
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,020
 Sunbaenim! 

576
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,660
But if something like that happens and you laugh, isn't it tough?

577
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,230
With Mu Chi Hyung and Bong Yi,

578
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,250
I experienced that many times since they both laugh a lot. 
    

579
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,850
There were may times were it was tough.

580
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,680
- Once you start laughing, you can't stop. 
 - That's right, that's right.

581
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,700
We prepared a video where you broke into laughter. 
    

582
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,170
Let's look at the video and talk about it.

583
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,950
 Aren't you curious as to why Bong Yi got released? 
   

584
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,200
 How did Bong Yi... 

585
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,160
    

586
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,880
He's holding his laugh.

587
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,690
His lip is shaking right now.

588
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,210
 As to how to accept this situation. 

589
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,690
I'm holding it in while clenching my teeth.

590
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,130
- What's the reason why you burst into laughter? 
 - About this.

591
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,470
For our drama,

592
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,240
there are twists. Because there are twists, we need to pretend 
    

593
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,220
and need to lie.

594
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,450
Our feeling is bound to be fake

595
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,400
because we know what's next in the conversation.

596
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,110
"I am confused. It came from an inmate."

597
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,310
We have to continue to act like this.

598
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,790
You get embarrassed by being shameless. 
    

599
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,130
   

600
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,610
 There's one thing that doesn't make sense. 

601
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,820
   

602
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,270
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Let's drink some water first. 

603
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,750
 I'm sorry. Just 10 seconds. 

604
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,410
   

605
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:21,880
Hold your laugh 
    

606
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,810
   

607
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,850
If I make eye contact, I can't hold it in. When you make eye contact, it's really funny.

608
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,820
It was really funny when making eye contact.

609
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,570
   

610
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,130
This has no meaning? 
    

611
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,970
I keep looking elsewhere.

612
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,860
That makes the other person laugh more.

613
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,830
   

614
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:46,440
For the viewers, I have an important information to tell you.

615
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,420
If you watch this broadcast until the end,

616
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,660
you will be able to watch another alternative ending of Mouse. 
    

617
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,220
Stay tuned until the end for the complete story.

618
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,480
   

619
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,280
Because many viewers cannot let you guys go after the ending,

620
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,210
we have prepared a special award ceremony. 
    

621
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,890
It's called Hunter Awards. We have prepared

622
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,440
awards for best acting and best script

623
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,540
for the viewers who kept replaying scenes.

624
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,250
Let us see the first award. 
    

625
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,250
   

626
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,250
Romance Hunter Category. Romance Hunter. 
     
    

627
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,500
Nominee 1. It's Babong couple, Babong couple.

628
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,580
 I'll wait. 

629
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,100
Oh! How long has it been since I've held hands like that with someone.

630
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,250
We really don't have many scenes like that. 
    

631
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,440
That's right.

632
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,610
   
   

633
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,320
The second, Yo Han and Hong Ju couple! 
    
   

634
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,190
It's a sad couple...

635
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,420
Always risky and loving. 
    

636
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,440
 Just. I just missed you. 

637
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,580
 Ah, this scene is... 

638
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,860
 What are you thinking about so hard? 

639
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,610
- Oh my goodness. 
 - Mu Chi and Ba Reum couple?

640
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,190
Mu Chi and Ba Reum couple has appeared. 
    
   

641
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,340
But this scene for me 
    
    

642
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,820
was really sad as I watched it.

643
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,340
I thought that the ending would be unpleasant.

644
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,670
That's right. It's a foretelling scene.

645
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:29,360
 - Please do so, Hyung.  
 - Hyung! Wow!

646
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,960
   

647
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,480
We saw the nominees for the Romance Hunter Award. There's a sweet couple

648
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,900
and bromance. There's even a bromance couple.

649
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,820
Out of the three nominees, who will have the honor to take the Romance Hunter Award? 
    

650
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,920
Drumroll, drumroll. 
    

651
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,960
Congratulations, Lee Seung Gi and Lee Hee Joon! 
     

652
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,010
Bromance! 
    

653
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,230
Wow, Mureum Couple.  (T/N: Mu Chi and Ba Reum couple name)  
    

654
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,240
Ah, do we...

655
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,990
   

656
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,590
   

657
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,540
There is a present.

658
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,400
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

659
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,830
- Please open the present. 
 - Oh, it's real? 
    

660
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,810
Is it a couples ring? 
    

661
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,210
Why Oppa? What is it?

662
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,710
What is it? I'm curious. 
    

663
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,960
A tumbler. A tumbler.

664
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,940
   

665
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,410
Wow! It's really big. 
    

666
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,850
- It's nice! 
 - How nice!

667
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,400
We prepared a couples item 
    

668
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,310
- because you are a couple. 
 - There's this too?

669
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,430
Ah, the color is the same too.

670
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,440
It would've been nice if it was a different color, right Honey?

671
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,880
Let's hear your acceptance speech.

672
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,510
I am thankful for receiving a male couple award for the first time.

673
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,310
As I was working with Hee Joon Hyung,

674
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,810
I felt how important it is

675
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:53,670
to work on a project with a good actor.

676
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,520
I'm really thankful.

677
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:01,130
Thank you to everyone who supported Mu Chi and Ba Reum.

678
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,980
My speech seemed too short, because you gave me a lot of compliments. 
    

679
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,220
Congratulations to the two of you. For the next award category,

680
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,620
it's the Goosebumps Hunter Category.

681
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,020
Let's watch the video.

682
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,790
   

683
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,930
   
   

684
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,390
Oh! During this scene, I...

685
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:26,890
 Because of you, I bowed to the likes of that bastard. 

686
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:30,330
 You know what you did wrong, right? 

687
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:34,620
 - For that, I'll kill you slowly. Very slowly.  
 - The tone is really...

688
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,670
That was the first nominee. Wow! The second nominee, Seong Yo Han.

689
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,150
For me, 
    
   

690
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,210
while watching this,

691
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:50,100
I was confident that he was a bad person.

692
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,260
Look at his expression and how his mouth is dry.

693
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,650
   

694
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,330
   
   

695
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,420
Ah! He came out.

696
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:03,070
 Aish. Indeed, my wife is smart. 

697
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:09,180
 I heard that psychopaths cannot love anyone but themselves. 

698
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:14,030
 That they were born that way. When you didn't even love me! Why? 

699
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:20,230
 Well, you can call it the propagation of a species. 

700
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,730
 I needed an offspring. 

701
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,170
 A second generation of me, Han Seo Joon. 

702
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,860
   

703
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,880
Wow! 
    

704
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,830
Well... The mood suddenly got really serious.

705
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:41,520
No one can predict who will get the Goosebumps Hunter Award. 
    

706
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,460
The person whose acting was breathtaking, creepy, and kept viewers tense?  
    

707
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,330
"I needed an offspring."

708
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,890
Ahn Jae Wook as Han Seo Joon!

709
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,150
   

710
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,310
But, I learned about this for the first time.

711
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,830
Was this your first role as a villain?

712
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,630
Well... That's true. For a drama. 
    

713
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:11,350
Was there anything difficult about it? 
    

714
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,870
From the first filming date to the first broadcasting date,

715
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,880
I was very nervous and felt pressured.

716
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,550
If anything, the moment the first episode aired... It's out of my hand...

717
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,330
But, many people enjoyed it.

718
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,420
I see. For the Goosebumps Hunter Award,

719
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,200
that was Ahn Jae Wook's acceptance speech. Now,

720
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,270
the next category is Intelligent Hunter. Let's see the nominees. 
    

721
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,630
   

722
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,040
 Ted Bundy, a serial killer. 
    
    

723
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,870
- A serial killer! 
 - A serial killer!

724
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,750
Nominee, Daniel Lee! 
    

725
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:51,210
He can't lift his head up.

726
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,240
Nominee 2. 
    
   

727
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,570
- Shin Sang! 
 - Ji Hoon. Ji Hoon.

728
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,000
Ah, in this scene?

729
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,390
   

730
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,000
 - Did you go? 
 - Did you go? 

731
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,330
 You did what I said, right? 

732
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:11,480
Next, nominee 3, Han Seo Joon. 
    
   

733
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,990
Scalpel. 
    

734
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,270
 Don't feel unfair. 

735
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:22,710
 You will live in another way. 

736
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:28,590
Among the Intelligent Hunter nominees, who will it be? 
    

737
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,510
The representative of the brains in Mouse...

738
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,870
It's Jo Jae Yun! Congratulations. 
    

739
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,570
- Thank you. 
 - A note.

740
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,690
- A notebook! 
 - I think it's that.

741
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:45,530
We do joke around, but 
    

742
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,640
because Jung Nan Sunbaenim, Ahn Jae Wook Sunbaenim,

743
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,560
Daniel Lee Sunbaenim took care us, it was very reliable. 
    

744
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,270
Of course. Of course.

745
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,960
- I suddenly thought of that. 
 - Hee Joon.

746
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,920
Can I do my acceptance speech now?

747
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,570
- He's really thankful. 
 - I am really thankful.

748
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:07,180
Yeon Woo, Daddy got an award.

749
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,170
Ha, seriously.

750
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,910
We will move onto the next category.

751
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:14,910
Let's see the nominees for the Action Hunter Category.

752
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,710
   

753
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,520
Jung Ba Reum, 
    
   

754
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,120
you've been nominated for almost all categories.

755
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,400
He does it with such an ease.

756
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,630
 Tell me, who the hell are you guys? 

757
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,900
   

758
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,100
Ah, he's a good nominee.

759
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,300
 Come here! 

760
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,740
Playing the role of Go Mu Chi, we have

761
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,970
Lee Hee Jun.

762
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,310
 Hold on. 

763
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:47,230
Look at his expressions!

764
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,270
   

765
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,900
 Come on up.  
     
    

766
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,660
Alright we have our third nominee, Oh Bong Yi.

767
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,920
Armbar, armbar, armbar!

768
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,050
Armbar, armbar! (?)

769
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,650
 How did you become a police officer with such stamina?  
    

770
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,230
Those were the three nominees.

771
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,630
For that last

772
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:12,730
action scene, did you prepare yourself beforehand?

773
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,940
I needed some understanding on those techniques so

774
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,870
I went to a stunt academy and

775
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,400
practiced along with stuntmen.

776
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,700
Ju Hyun actually does the martial arts really well.

777
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,150
- Then did she lock you down good? 
 - Well, actually

778
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,230
I can't do that!

779
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,640
- If she had, we couldn't have continued to act. 
 - Oh, I see.

780
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,030
It's  The  Lee Seung Gi after all! 
    

781
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,080
   

782
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,510
After we'd met for the first time,

783
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,430
that was the first scene we shot together on the first day of the shoot.

784
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,750
   

785
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,020
That's right!

786
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,770
You did well.

787
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,410
Of course the classes she took might have helped her,

788
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,280
but she actually did really well that day.

789
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,840
    
    

790
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,120
Are you really thirsty?

791
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:59,140
Lee Hee Jun, why are you suddenly feeling so thirsty?

792
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,170
I'm worried I might get another award.

793
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,850
Yeah, I might get another one.

794
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:04,570
He's getting ready for it.

795
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,490
Alright then, I'll reveal the winner of the Action Hunter Category.

796
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:12,280
The winner of the Action Hunter Category, approved by the Action Director is...

797
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,620
Drum roll, drum roll. 
    

798
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:20,490
The master of action scenes, Lee Seung Gi! Congratulations! 
    

799
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,790
That's too bad. 
    

800
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,520
- Did you do all of those action scenes by yourself, without any stunt double? 
 - No, no.

801
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,020
- I did some of the action sequences that I could manage by myself. 
 - Oh, is that so?

802
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,760
Yes, that would be the kicking and the chasing.

803
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,780
- The rest of the sequences would be done by stunt... 
 - So you used stunt men? 
 - Yes.

804
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:46,170
Now that the Action Hunter has been awarded, let's quickly move ahead. We have the Tear-jerker Hunter Category.

805
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:49,010
Let's meet the nominees through the videos.

806
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,610
   

807
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:55,620
    
    

808
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,970
Ah, this one is too sad!

809
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,170
 I'm sorry! 

810
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,040
 Please, let my brother go. 

811
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,530
 It was my fault. I'll die instead of him. 

812
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,780
 Please let my poor brother live. 

813
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,290
 No! 

814
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,110
    
    

815
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,850
Ah, this is too...

816
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,700
In this scene you were drenched in tears.

817
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,600
Our second nominee is Oh Bong Yi!

818
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,180
 I... I'm sorry. 

819
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,440
 - I'm...  
 - Oh dear.

820
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,200
    
    

821
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,950
As expected, he's a nominee as well.

822
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:47,230
Jung Ba Reum.

823
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,350
 Chi Kook, get up! 

824
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,080
Seeing it again now is giving me goosebumps.

825
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,970
 You said you wanted to live happily with your mother, didn't you? 

826
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,360
 Chi Kook. 

827
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,390
Alright, we've now seen all of our three candidates.

828
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:04,930
Let's find out who made the viewers cry the most.

829
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,240
   

830
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,410
He keeps getting nervous, what should we do?

831
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:12,820
- He's constantly nervous... 
 - I'm worried I might get too many awards.

832
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,650
   

833
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,450
Lee... 
    

834
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,630
   

835
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,900
Lee Hee Jun! 
    

836
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,120
Thank you.

837
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,740
Oh, it's a big one.

838
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,660
It's big.

839
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,730
Oh, how will you carry this on your own? Your manager is here, right? Gosh.

840
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,230
A training pad?

841
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,250
Thank you.

842
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,590
I think it might really be a training pad.

843
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,070
   

844
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,860
I needed this.

845
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,480
I ran out of these for my room. 
    

846
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,860
Thank you so much.
   

847
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,880
Thank you to the staff members who worked so hard.

848
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,850
And I'd like to thank my wife who is taking care of our child by herself

849
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,900
and I want to tell her that I love her.

850
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,150
He's such a romantic.

851
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,720
   

852
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,930
- Oh, they're stacked. 
 - Definitely stacked.

853
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,720
Doing scenes like that isn't a problem of stamina.

854
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,920
He poured all of his passion into doing that,

855
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,120
that he got so dizzy and was going to faint.

856
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,020
- He was drained. 
 - Yes, exactly so

857
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,790
that was one of his best scenes on which he worked extremely hard.

858
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:19,620
Thank you Sunbaenim.

859
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,020
Let's move on to the next category.

860
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,620
That's an iPad, isn't it? 
    

861
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,550
- You can just tell? 
 - It's obviously an iPad.

862
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,030
- It's heavy though. 
 - Is it an iPad pro?

863
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:30,000
We were joking around until now but not anymore. 
    

864
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,750
- It might even be a laptop. 
 - Because it's the last one.

865
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,120
Now we have the Mystery Hunter Category.

866
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,520
- I really need an iPad. I asked you about it, didn't I? 
 - Yeah. 
    

867
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,240
On the set, there are some people who use the papers and others who use the iPad. 
    

868
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,780
- For the script. 
 - Yes.

869
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:48,290
- I'll say it until the, "Isn't it strange?" part. 
 - Yes, yes. 
    

870
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,750
   

871
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,860
    
    

872
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,700
- Hyung Hee Jun and... 
 - Me.

873
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,280
Bong Yi too.

874
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,780
- We use iPads. 
 - Su Jin, you too? 
 - I use an iPad, too.

875
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,220
All of you use the iPad and I'm the only one who uses the book.

876
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,230
No, I use A4 sheets, too. 
    

877
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,720
- Hyung you... 
 - They get ripped!

878
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,290
Hyung you should really read it in the book form.

879
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,900
You have it in your pocket all crumpled.

880
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,500
It's as if he's cheating.

881
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,350
Hyung Jae Yun really hides his scripts everywhere.

882
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:18,210
He's always taking out little pieces of paper from god knows where,

883
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,810
filled with highlighter marks.

884
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,130
Why do you need to read your own script in secret? 
    

885
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,800
- I do a lot of supporting roles 
 - Ah, yes.

886
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,930
and minor roles, so if I carry around the book, it's heavy.

887
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:33,890
I don't have that many lines. So carrying that small piece of paper has become a habit.

888
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,390
It helps when I forget my lines.

889
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:41,220
Okay then, let's meet our nominees.

890
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,390
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

891
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,890
   

892
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:46,990
   
   

893
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,430
Our first nominee, Jung Ba Reum.

894
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,290
 He didn't even report me to the police? 

895
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,870
 I need to make sure. 

896
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:02,460
Our second nominee, Go Mu Chi. 
     
    

897
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,010
 Then why did Seong Yo Han try to kill Officer Jung? 

898
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,800
 And what about the photos of the victims at Seong Yo Han's house? There's no explanation for those. 

899
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,130
 PD Choi must have figured something out. 

900
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,320
You guys did so good.

901
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,770
 I am PD Choi Hong Ju of Sherlock Hong Ju.  
     
    

902
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:18,200
You guys performed excellently.

903
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,010
I've got good competition.

904
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:23,350
Really, really good.

905
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,680
 We need to find at least the murder weapon. 

906
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,330
 Bastard, it's you. 

907
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,260
- Gosh. 
 - Wow!

908
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:39,690
While the viewers were busy solving the mysteries, this was the person who gave them clues.

909
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:43,160
But sometimes they even made them even more confused. 
    

910
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,550
It's the voice of the people, Sherlock Hong Ju!

911
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,520
Congratulations, Kyung Soo Jin! 
     
    

912
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,480
My gosh, this is...

913
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,630
- But Soo Jin has an iPad. 
 - Oh, she does?

914
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,850
Thank you. It's really heavy.

915
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,450
It really must be an iPad.

916
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,170
Isn't it something more along the lines of a board game?

917
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,750
Something like a calendar.

918
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,660
- Well, she is the queen of mysteries. 
 - Woah!

919
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,430
A board game?

920
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:10,300
   

921
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,960
Woah!

922
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,820
Wow! But seriously, that won't be of any use.

923
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,060
- Boardgames are fun. 
 - It looks interesting.

924
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:23,040
All of these are just mementos. We have actually prepared another gift for you.

925
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,030
We have prepared a thank you gift for you guys who have worked so hard.

926
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,990
Bring in the gifts!

927
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:35,600
   

928
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,650
- There we have it. 
 - You actually had prepared something for us.

929
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:41,780
Wow!

930
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,720
This is really nice.

931
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,450
- We can take this home, right? 
 - Yes, of course.

932
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,170
- We don't have to return this, do we? 
 - Oh, no.

933
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,670
We'll enjoy the fruits! We'll enjoy the fruits!

934
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,760
Thank you for this.

935
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,060
You guys worked really hard. In order to make such a drama, 
    

936
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,800
in front of the camera your spouses... Ah, actors... 
  (T/N: the words 'spouse' and 'actor' are very similar) 

937
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,870
Spouses!

938
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,050
   

939
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,080
Are you having a tough time these days?

940
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,690
My spouse is at home sleeping right now. 
    

941
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,520
Spouse!

942
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,460
Let's learn in front of cameras! Spouses. 
  (T/N: Learn also sounds like spouse) 

943
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,550
We definitely have a lot more to learn.

944
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:16,510
To make such a good drama, you actors

945
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:20,250
do have to work hard in front of the camera but then

946
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,940
there are also the staff members who are standing behind the camera.

947
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,220
The staff members work really hard as well.

948
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,010
So, why don't you all

949
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:31,320
give them a big round of applause?

950
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,970
   

951
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:41,780
♫  That day when a soft wind passed by briefly  ♫

952
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,990
♫  You and I faced each other  ♫ 
    

953
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,780
♫  You and I faced each other  ♫ 
    

954
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,030
 I asked you to not let me become a monster. 

955
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:52,830
♫  I'm forgetting the memories  ♫

956
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:58,940
I realized how much happy I was to be able to work with such great actors and actresses. 
 ♫  The colors are fading, getting weaker  ♫

957
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,680
   

958
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,710
I'd like to thank all my sunbaenim's with whom I was able to work on the longest project of my life.

959
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:11,910
- Welcome! 
 - Welcome!

960
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:14,890
 We had precious memories along with you guys! 
    

961
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:17,800
Each and every staff member of ours,

962
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:23,730
put a lot of effort into choosing every prop and location. It was all quite difficult and complicated.

963
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:27,850
But we were able to wrap things up so well only because they all worked so hard.

964
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:32,310
    

965
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:38,010
Even though our director wasn't getting enough sleep he continued shooting, and all the staff as well.

966
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:42,290
   

967
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:49,690
Thanks to all the love you have been giving us all this, while I was able to be reassured and continue to shoot.

968
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,580
Thank you to our viewers for loving Mouse.

969
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:57,110
It was an honor for me to be able to participate in this drama.

970
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:01,010
I'm quite sad now that things have come to an end. 
    

971
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,190
Even though Mouse has come to an end...

972
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:06,350
Although I'm not sure which new character I will play or project I will participate in,

973
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,300
I will definitely work hard on my acting and come to you with a new project.

974
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,120
Thank you!

975
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,580
Gather around.

976
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,630
Look here.

977
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,870
One, two, three.

978
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,790
   

979
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:24,780
   

980
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,130
Didn't I tell you

981
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:33,320
that you took away the right to live in a crime-free world from your son?

982
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,020
I've heard

983
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,710
that your one and only grandchild was born with the psychopath gene.

984
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,050
I was told that you got rid of the test result right away.

985
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:51,100
For a  president who is supposed to set an example for the citizens, would it be okay for you to do that?

986
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,370
What will you do?

987
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:59,650
Will you get rid of your one and only dead son's child?

988
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:05,380
When the time comes, give me a pardon.

989
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,070
A pardon?

990
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:10,560
I have a dream that I haven't accomplished yet.

991
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,710
You should decide.

992
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,720
I took care of it.

993
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:40,620
Was... this the reason why you gave that woman a pardon?

994
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:44,290
Because you couldn't do it while she's in prison.

995
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,450
Revenge for killing our Sang?

996
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:51,190
♪ Beep Bop Beep ♪

997
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:05,190
Hey, do you want to play in the yard?

998
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,240
There we go.

999
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:28,470
 Today, I, Detective Co Nam, and  Watson solved the pencil case theft case. 

1000
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:29,650
 There is always 

1001
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,480
 one truth! 

1002
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,910
 If you enjoyed the video, please like and subscribe! 

1003
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,260
 Bye! 

1004
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,210
Detective Co Nam!

1005
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:53,330
 Writer Noona, I caught the pencil case thief with Watson today. 

1006
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:58,090
But what about Kot Nim? Aren't you getting too close with Yoo Na?

1007
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,330
Yoo Na, hi! Have you been well?

1008
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,710
 Yes, Unnie! Mom says hi. 

1009
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:10,260
I'm planning on visiting next week. Just wait a bit.

1010
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,680
Got it. Bye!

1011
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,650
Co Nam is very healthy now.

1012
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,080
Yes, his vocal cord reconstruction surgery was a success.

1013
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,310
He's an amazing kid. He went through multiple surgeries.

1014
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,470
He hanged in there.

1015
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,710
What a relief.

1016
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:39,600
He heard on the news that Kim Byeong Tae died while he was unconscious.

1017
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,320
Yes.

1018
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,480
Let's go, let's go.

1019
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,820
Let's go out. Eun Chong, let's go eat.

1020
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,030
Let's go, let's go.

1021
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:52,430
Go, go.

1022
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:53,980
- I just need to bring this out? 
 - Yes.

1023
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,460
Anything else?

1024
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,590
Grandma!

1025
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,250
Aigo, come here Eun Chong.

1026
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,420
Here.

1027
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,870
Why is there so much?

1028
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,310
Dad, give me the bowls.

1029
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:10,580
Ah, okay. Okay. Just wait a minute.

1030
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,220
Eun Chong.

1031
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,320
Here.

1032
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,280
Is it good?

1033
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,180
There is japchae too? Wow! There is so much food.

1034
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,940
I'm not sure if I flavored it right...

1035
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,320
- Hello! 
 - Oh, you came?

1036
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,840
You came?

1037
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,060
Hello!

1038
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,960
Dong Chan!

1039
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,480
But why does Dong Chan keep looking more like you as he grows up? He should have looked more like Seul Gi.

1040
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,580
- Please sit down. 
 - Sit down, sit down.

1041
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,150
Look at the baby. Look.

1042
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,580
You made all this?

1043
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:47,190
I put my cooking skills to good use today.

1044
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:50,130
- Here. 
 - He's asleep!

1045
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,140
I'm hungry, I'm hungry.

1046
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,320
Eun Chong, eat up, okay?

1047
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,950
- Okay, okay. 
 - Please eat.

1048
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:57,350
- You're eating well 
 - Please eat some of this.

1049
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:58,270
Thank you.

1050
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:01,730
You haven't been eating a lot.

1051
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,040
I can't eat if he wakes up.

1052
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,480
He's eating well.

1053
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,330
 Are you okay? 

1054
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:10,300
Hurry and eat, Honey.

1055
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:14,290
Go inside. Bong Yi is inside.

1056
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,420
Bong Yi, Bong Yi. I like Bong Yi.

1057
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,910
- Bong Yi, Bong Yi. 
 - Bong Yi!

1058
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:20,030
Bong Yi!

1059
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,290
Ajusshi, who are you?

1060
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,120
Are you Eun Chong?

1061
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,560
You look like your dad.

1062
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,300
Are you my dad's friend?

1063
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,960
No. I'm a person who's really sorry towards your dad.

1064
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,060
Eun Chong!

1065
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:55,710
When are you coming back to work?

1066
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:59,310
There's a lot of work to do. Come back soon.

1067
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:02,390
I told you I'm not going to. I found my calling.

1068
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:04,940
Selling eggs suits me very well.

1069
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,340
I'm going to buy a building by selling eggs, Team Leader.

1070
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,130
I'll give you a unit after you retire!

1071
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,190
It's fine.

1072
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:16,200
By the way there's this one case that's causing my hair to fall out. You remember the adoptee who was abused?

1073
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,540
His mother's pancreas...

1074
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,080
Eggs have come!

1075
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,350
Fresh and large eggs!

1076
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:27,450
My eardrums are going to pop, you bastard!

1077
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:32,340
Large eggs directly from the farm.

1078
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,790
Former Detective. Guaranteed quality.

1079
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:38,250
 Eggs have come! 

1080
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,270
 Eggs have come! 

1081
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:44,590
 Large eggs directly from the farm! 

1082
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:48,670
Eggs have come! Eggs!

1083
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:52,710
 There was a monster that could never be saved. 

1084
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:56,330
 God gave that monster emotions. 

1085
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:01,150
 God listened to your prayer. 

1086
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:03,430
 You are no longer 

1087
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:08,120
 a monster. 

1088
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:52,120
 So he died feeling pain and anguish in repentance of what he has done. 

1089
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:56,890
