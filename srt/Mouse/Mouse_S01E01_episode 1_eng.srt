1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:08,280


2
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,010
   

3
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,730
   

4
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,130
 Wow, amazing! 

5
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,120
 The rat snake is the largest snake living in our country.
   

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,710
 Teacher, what do the rat snakes eat? 

7
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,770
 Rat snakes eat frogs, sparrows, rodentsâ€” 

8
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,970
 - Ah, and mice. 
 - Ah... 

9
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,780
 - Eat mice... 
 - Eat mice?... 

10
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,890
 Rat snakes appear in folktales. 

11
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,010
 - It's really big, isn't it? 
 - Yes. 

12
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,210
 It's bigger than I thought, right? 

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,720
 It looks 1,000 times bigger! 

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,080
 - It's bigger than I thought. 
 - Wow, it's big. 

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,840
 - Uh, it's a mouse! 
 - It's a mouse. 

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,600
 Really, it's a mouse! 

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,730
 Uh, no. No. 

18
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:14,060
 - Isn't the mouse going to get caught by the snake and eaten? 
 - Uh. Uh. Uh. 

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,190
 Uh. 

20
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,010
 Uh? 

21
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,340
   

22
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,330
   

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,570
 It was the first time 

24
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,480
 coming to this place on my own. 

25
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,930
 I wanted to ask. 

26
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,660
Do I look different to you as well, Mister?

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,900
They say that I was different from the beginning.

28
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,300
They say I was born different to begin with.

29
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,590
   

30
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,450
   

31
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,900
Uh, hey Soo Ho!  What about mom?  Is she asleep?

32
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,620
It's snowing heavily.

33
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,260
So the taxi can't go all the way to the house.

34
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,010
Then what else can I do?

35
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,800
It's a welcome party for new employees so how can I leave early by myself?

36
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,880
Never mind, don't come out. You have a test tomorrow so you should take care of yourself.

37
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,750
Okay. I will be home soon.

38
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,460
 Unni! 

39
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,060
 Unni! 

40
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,780
Hey kid, what are you doing here? At this hour?

41
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,180
The car... The car slid.

42
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,340
The car hit a tree.

43
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,660
My dad...

44
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,920
Where is your dad?

45
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,220
Over there.

46
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,910
He will be alright.

47
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,680
Hold onto this for a moment.

48
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,980
Excuse me, Mister.

49
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,170
Mister, Mister!

50
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,470
Please let me live.  Please let me live.

51
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,860
- Don't be afraid. 
 - Ahh!

52
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,950
 D-D-Dad... 

53
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,980
 Please stop. 

54
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,340
 Okay, I will explain it to you for the last time. 

55
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,770
 After entering the water, please check your equipment one more time, 

56
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,860
 release the air from the buoyancy control device 

57
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,780
 and very slowly descend. 

58
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,290
 And, since the water temperature is very low now 

59
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,010
 there is a high risk of an accident. 

60
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,920
 Please do not go off on your own. Understand? 

61
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,690
 Another decapitated corpse was discovered. 

62
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,730
 This time it was in the ocean. 

63
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,380
 - Noona! 
 - According the DNA test result, the corpse is that of a 20-year-old woman, 

64
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,630
 Miss Song, who went missing a week ago 

65
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,040
 while returning home from work. 

66
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,120
 The police have determined that based on the similarity in the damage done to the body 

67
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,940
 and the marks that were left, 

68
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,890
 that it was done by the same culprit, 

69
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,160
 and they are investigating the case accordingly. 

70
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,120
 With this, the number of victims of the bizarre killer, Headhunter, 

71
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,000
 who kills and decapitates the victims, has increased to 18. 

72
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,800
 With no clear progress 

73
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,110
 after one year of investigation into the case, 

74
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,010
 the fear of citizens is turning into anger. 

75
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,300
 The President cancelled all of his schedule 

76
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,270
 and visited the National Police Agency. 

77
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,250
 This is Kang Moon Jin reporting. 

78
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,970
 The President's visit to the National Police Agency 

79
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,400
 is seen as an attempt by the Blue House (Korean presidential residence), aware of the low national approval rating, 

80
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,040
 to smooth over public sentiment. 

81
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,290
 The President, at the case investigation progress briefing, 

82
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,030
 strongly criticized 

83
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,310
 that the police's careless investigation system is at fault 

84
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,210
 for failure to even profile the culprit. 

85
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,250
 So he said that he plans to oversee the alternative plan for the investigation personally. 

86
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,260
 In addition, he plans to address the nation  
    

87
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,600
 to help strengthen the security of the citizens as soon as possible. 

88
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,830
 And he announced that a plan to innovate the prevention of violent crimes 

89
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,960
 to create a world that is free of crime will be put in place.  
    

90
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,760
Sir, was it like distinguishing the gender of the chicks? 
    

91
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,400
That's a great analogy.

92
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,080
How was it verified that it was within the top 1% of the psychopathic genes?

93
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,200
Right here.

94
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,710
Charles Manson, who killed a total of 35 people

95
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,030
including actress Sharon Tate.

96
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,360
Edmund Kemper, who killed, cut off the head

97
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,670
and raped the corpses of six teenage girls,

98
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,500
as well as his grandparents and mother.

99
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,400
Ted Bundy, a serial killer

100
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,870
who considered murder as a sport and ate human flesh.

101
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,050
As a result of the British government

102
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,660
and U.S. FBI joint controlled test,

103
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,810
their genes and the psychopaths genes

104
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,930
I found were 100% identical.

105
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,280
It doesn't stop there. Sooner or later,

106
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,820
there will be a world where we can know in advance whether

107
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,660
a child in the mother's womb will be

108
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,990
Charles Manson, Edmund Kemper, or Ted Bundy.

109
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,670
Wow. But how?

110
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,090
Well, let's call it a day.

111
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,040
- Tell us more, Professor. 
 - Yes, please.

112
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,100
Come on.

113
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,540
Hello?

114
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,820
Yes.

115
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,110
Sorry.

116
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,320
No classes next week.

117
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,560
I'll be gone for a while.

118
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,080
Did you arrive?  Deplane?

119
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,100
Be on standby and immediately escort him here.

120
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,890
Wow, this beats your average SF (Science Fiction) movie.

121
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,800
This would be our best bet to turn the public sentiment around.

122
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,960
We have to pass it no matter what.

123
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,070
It's all up to the opposition party.  It's questionable whether they will let it pass so easily.

124
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,860
It looks like the ruling party threw in their last ditch effort.

125
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,220
They should be desperate.  Their approval rating is at the bottom and the lame duck period (for the outgoing president) has started as well.

126
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,750
- For us, this is our best chance.  We have to block it no matter what. 
 - How?

127
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,420
- They will try to block it with the human rights issue. 
 - Human rights?

128
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,670
A similar legislation was proposed in England.

129
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,910
The country will administer the DNA of all citizens, not only those of the criminals.

130
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,770
Also, find the DNA of the criminals beforehand,

131
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,590
and prevent violent crimes, or something like that.

132
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,240
- Pass? 
 - Dismissed.

133
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,100
 Ladies and gentlemen, the plane will arrive at Gimpo International Airport shortly. 

134
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,020
 Ladies and gentlemen, we will arrive at Gimpo International Airport... 

135
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,540
 It faced opposing public sentiment because of the human rights violation. 

136
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,970
 Human rights are more important than the lives of the citizens? 

137
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,710
 What rights does a fetus have? 

138
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,080
Yeah, Seo Joon, I just got here.

139
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,850
Okay, I will be there right after work.

140
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,640
Okay.

141
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,540
Thank you.

142
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,240
He is very smart and meticulous. 
    

143
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,350
So they say it will be a long-drawn-out war.

144
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,560
Unexpectedly, he could get caught soon.

145
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,170
That kind of psychopath is so arrogant that sometimes they make an absurd mistake.

146
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,410
Psychopathy is a mutated gene

147
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,160
that was created as the society evolved.

148
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,520
For them, the MAOA (Monoamine oxidase A) gene that controls the human emotions from birth,

149
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,990
are almost non-existent.

150
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,800
Especially, for the top 1% of the psychopaths, such as the serial killers,

151
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
the MAOA gene does not exist at all.

152
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,110
What I learned from this research is

153
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,010
that by DNA testing of fetuses, we can identify the psychopathy gene.

154
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,270
This means that future psychopaths,

155
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,810
future warmongers and future serial killers

156
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,240
can be identified before birth.

157
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,010
This is the unpublished new DNA project.

158
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,190
You can refer to the materials distributed for more details.

159
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,740
So the government will make the DNA testing of fetuses mandatory.

160
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,040
Once the fetus is confirmed to have the psychopathy gene,

161
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,880
for public safety, without the consent of the parents,

162
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,300
the government can abort the fetus by force. This is the legislation I want to propose.

163
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,920
Well, please share your opinion about the legislation.

164
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,270
I am in favor. If a punk like Headhunter was never born,

165
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,280
right now 18, no,

166
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,450
what could be even be several dozens more, would not have been sacrificed in vain.

167
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,470
You are saying that if Hitler weren't born, that there wouldn't have been a World War, right?

168
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,830
This kind of legislation is what this era needs,

169
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,520
an absolutely perfect crime prevention plan.

170
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,050
Dr. Daniel!

171
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,740
Is the DNA testing for psychopathy gene even accurate?

172
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,860
It has about 99% accuracy.

173
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,870
99%?  What about the remaining 1% then?

174
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,120
It is the genius gene.

175
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,030
When you compare the psychopathy gene and the genius gene,

176
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,810
the makeup of the genes are so nearly identical, that even I have a hard time differentiating between them.

177
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,710
Then, you are saying that it's possible to kill Mozart, believing him to be Hitler,

178
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,300
and kill Einstein, believing him to be the Headhunter, right?

179
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,420
Everything aside, this is a definite violation of human rights.

180
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,020
Human rights?  What human rights?

181
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,470
- What human rights does a fetus have? 
 - The Republic of Korea

182
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,500
is a country where abortion is prohibited.

183
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,590
Because a fetus is viewed as a human, abortion is considered murder.

184
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,330
That's why an anti-abortion law was implemented, right?

185
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,470
Are you saying that if a killer like that is born and goes around killing people,

186
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,110
we should just sit back and do nothing?

187
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,290
If you care about the human rights of a fetus,

188
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,430
why can't you think about the human rights of the victims?

189
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,470
If you care so much about the human rights of the victims,

190
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,880
why weren't you able to catch that Headhunter psycho,

191
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,340
and resorting to an expedient like this?

192
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,420
An expedient? Are you done talking?

193
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,750
I am done talking! What are you going to do?

194
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,700
How is this an expedient?

195
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,490
 If you have something to sayâ€” 

196
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,230
 Do you have a better idea? 

197
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,760
 We will take a short recess. 

198
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,140
Then, we will put it to a vote.

199
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,430
We are submitting the government's proposal for mandatory DNA testing of fetuses,

200
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,800
and forced abortion of fetuses with the psychopathy gene.

201
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,530
Those assemblymen in favor?

202
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,060
You can put your hands down. Committee members who are opposed?

203
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,830
 That guy's lost his mind. 

204
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,650
The vote is four to four. 
    

205
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,740
So it turns out, my vote will break the tie.

206
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,860
   

207
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,280
My decision is...

208
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,620
 Why do you think he decapitates the victims? 

209
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,760
 It's a strategy to delay the identification of the victim as long as possible. 

210
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,260
 Disrobing the corpse... 

211
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,390
 Can you taste this for me, Seo Joon? 

212
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,740
Why did you prepare so much when you are heavily pregnant?

213
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,110
It's a special guest, I can't cut corners.

214
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,890
In any case, if he lived in England since he was young,

215
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,970
would Korean food suit his tastes?

216
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,660
Daniel?

217
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,700
How long has it been? It's been seven years since we've seen each other, hasn't it?

218
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,350
Come on in. It's cold.

219
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,110
Hello.

220
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,670
It's nice to meet you.

221
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,130
I am honored to meet such a great man in person.

222
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,910
If not for this man, I would not be who I am today. I should be grateful to him for the rest of my life.

223
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,800
Aw, you don't have to say that. Let's go in.

224
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,160
I really wanted to attend the wedding, but because I was swamped with the research... I am sorry.

225
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,150
There is no need to apologize

226
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,890
But how do you speak Korean so well when you emigrated to England at a young age?

227
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,860
Ah, my adoptive parents were Korean.

228
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,520
So they insisted I speak Korean at home.

229
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,010
Ah, did you find your younger sibling?

230
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,930
Holt is still searching for him, but they haven't found him yet. 
  (T/N: Holt Children's Services Inc.) 

231
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,440
Here. This is a gift from my mother to congratulate you on the new baby.

232
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,590
Oh, you didn't have to. Thank you.

233
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,190
You must be hungry. Honey, can you give him a tour of our home while I prepare dinner?

234
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,210
Yes, shall I? Come this way.

235
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,180
Wow! What is all of this?

236
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,680
Ji Eun is a florist.

237
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,970
When we built this house, I created this space for Ji Eun

238
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,900
and built all of this myself.

239
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,160
I'm so glad to see you happy.

240
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,550
This is the best Korean food I have ever tasted.

241
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,840
Wow, your cooking skills are extraordinary.

242
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,450
I am glad that it suits your taste.

243
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,150
- Please try this, too. 
 - Oh, yes.

244
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,020
But your home is so pretty.

245
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,490
It's like a house from a storybook.

246
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,150
My husband designed it himself and laid each brick one by one.

247
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,780
Ji Eun's dream was to live in a pastoral house like this one.

248
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,560
Oh, right. May I open your gift?

249
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,670
Yes, of course.

250
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,170
My gosh!

251
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,760
My mother made that herself.

252
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,130
She liked him better than me, you know.

253
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,950
   

254
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,750
I told my mother that Seo Joon said him becoming a father was a blessing, and so she embroidered that herself.

255
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,220
Goodness, I am so grateful.

256
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,900
Please let her know that our baby will wear it well, Professor.

257
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,920
Yes, I will tell her.

258
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,790
It's so cute.

259
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,370
But what brings you to Korea?

260
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,070
Drive carefully. The snow looked like it would stop when we began traveling, hadn't it?

261
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,480
What's wrong with this?

262
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,950
Oh my.

263
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,300
Why does this keep giving me trouble?

264
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,560
I knew it when Young Sik was willing to let me borrow it for free.

265
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,490
You should have rented a sedan instead. How is this a camping car? It's a bus.

266
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,000
- So embarrassing, right? 
 - Yeah.

267
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,150
But still, Young Sik put in a lot of effort to remodel it you know.

268
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,910
Yeah, yeah.

269
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,470
Oh, what do we do now?

270
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,880
Oh, the ignition worked.

271
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,340
All right, let's go.

272
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,830
So what happened?

273
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,940
The President was very upset.

274
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,620
Why did you vote against it?

275
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,410
It couldn't possibly be

276
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,750
that you were persuaded by the Opposition Party, were you?

277
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,090
   
 (T/N: Helping the country and keeping the citizens safe) 

278
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,080
We had adjourned for a short while.

279
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,240
At that time, my wife contacted me to tell me that she was pregnant.

280
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,040
It's a child we've been desperately wanting for ten years.

281
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,740
If I were in that situation,

282
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,390
I could not give up on my child.

283
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,990
Congratulations.

284
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,000
- And please give congratulations to your wife on my behalf. 
 - Thank you.

285
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,500
But please don't forget

286
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,160
that your child's right to live in a world without war or crime

287
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,360
was taken away by you, Chairman.

288
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,810
Did you say it was dismissed?

289
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,030
What do you think, Daniel?

290
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:40,650
I am just a researcher, that's all.  I am not on either side.

291
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,660
What do you think?

292
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,040
I am in favor, of course!

293
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,770
I would like for the world  our "Blessing" (fetal nickname) will live in to be free of such heinous criminals.

294
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,620
You seem tired, Honey. Go in and get some sleep.

295
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,470
You should. I will catch up with Seo Joon a little longer then leave.

296
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,510
I'm all right. Because I'm pregnant at an advanced age, I think my husband is anxious.

297
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,460
No, you really seem very tired, Honey.

298
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,830
- There. 
 - But I'm really all right.

299
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,060
Excuse me, Professor. I'll come back after I get a little rest.

300
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,900
Rest well.

301
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,050
You're amazing. The Nobel Prize. In the end, you are realizing your dreams.

302
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,650
I'm just a candidate. Let's not jump ahead.

303
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:20,890
And that guy... You still haven't caught him?

304
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,540
Hmm?

305
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,580
Oh, it's already been seven years.

306
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,200
I am sorry.

307
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,820
Why should you be sorry?

308
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,920
It was so hard for me to see you suffering after what happened to Jennifer.

309
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,240
And I was so happy to hear that you were getting married.

310
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,880
And now you're about to have a child, Han Seo Joon.

311
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,690
Forget everything and be happy.

312
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,630
I'm sure Jennifer is happy for you in heaven.

313
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,050
Thanks.

314
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,390
Hey...

315
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,600
Thanks for accompanying me here. Return home safely.

316
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,050
I am sorry I can't go to the airport to see you off.

317
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,880
If only I didn't have a surgery to perform. Once "Blessing" is born, I will visit you in England with Ji Eun and our baby.

318
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,290
Yes, Mother will like that. Be safe on the snowy roads.

319
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,900
Dr. Daniel!

320
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,610
Is it much further?

321
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,920
It's supposed to be around here somewhere.  Did I take a wrong turn?

322
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,960
- Aren't you sleepy, Mu Won? 
 - I'm a little sleepy.

323
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,000
It's fine, it's close by.

324
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,250
We just have to take a left, and continue straight for about 10 minutes.

325
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,790
He says it's okay.

326
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,160
   
   

327
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,030
Dad, why isn't anyone here?

328
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,840
Did we arrive?

329
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,680
It doesn't look open for business. Did you really make a reservation?

330
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,390
Yeong Sik said we didn't have to make a reservation.

331
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,480
Oh really? Try calling him.

332
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,090
  
   

333
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,030
Your hands must be cold. Oh, it's snowing a lot.

334
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,230
Mu Won, do you have your gloves on?

335
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,660
Yes, we've arrived at the carp-fishing campsite.

336
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,020
What? I see.

337
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,490
Due to the heavy snow, part of their ceiling collapsed.

338
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,940
So they have been closed for business since yesterday.

339
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,500
What do we do now?

340
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,620
They said we can use it and we don't have to pay.

341
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,620
But they turned off the water tank.

342
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,930
So we have to fetch our own water from the mineral springâ€”

343
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,990
Never mind. We're leaving. Let's go.

344
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,720
I don't want to. Let's just camp here, please Mom.

345
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,300
Yes, let's. If we leave now, we won't get home until dawn, and our kids must be hungry.

346
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,640
Mom. Hmm?

347
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,230
Okay. Go Mu Chi, we're only saying yes because it's your birthday.

348
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,480
Yahoo! Hyeong, let's ride the sled.

349
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,290
- Be careful. Check to see if it's frozen. 
 - Okay.

350
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,880
All right. Oh, let go of me.

351
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,310
Hot.

352
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,950
Where is the mineral spring?

353
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,180
Do you see that? They said it's that way.

354
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,570
Ah, over there.

355
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,440
- How is the speed? 
 - Faster, faster!

356
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,470
They're all cooked now.

357
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,570
   

358
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,840
Maybe I should have gone with her?

359
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,400
Go Mu Won! Go Mu Chi!

360
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,740
Stop sledding and come here and eat sweet potatoes.

361
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,030
- Mu Chi, let's go eat sweet potatoes. 
 - Yeah.

362
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:01,230
I'll go to the mineral spring to get Mom.

363
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,970
It must be because this is the countryside, it is pitch black.

364
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,390
What is that?

365
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,320
Honey?

366
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,120
Please...

367
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:35,420
Please let me live. Please let me live!

368
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:41,210
Please don't kill me!

369
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,930
Run away! Quick!

370
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,360
- It's yummy, isn't it? 
 - Yes.

371
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,260
Hyung, sledding was fun, wasn't it?

372
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,010
Let's ride it again.

373
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:13,200
- Get in the car. Now! Now!! 
 - What's wrong, Mom?

374
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,770
Get in the car.

375
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,150
Mom, what's wrong?

376
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,970
Please, please.

377
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,460
Mom? What about Dad?

378
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,910
Where is Dad?

379
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,280
It's Dad.

380
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,110
   

381
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,090
Hide. Hide.

382
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,150
   

383
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:32,040
Mom, why are you crying?

384
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,280
I'm scared!

385
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:41,610
Mu Won, you listen carefully to my words. Okay?

386
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:46,790
There is a small handle under the seat you ate snacks on. If you pull it, it opens up.

387
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,330
Take Mu Chi and hide in there.

388
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,770
No matter what happens, don't come out. You must not make any sound at all.

389
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,700
Do you understand?

390
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,320
- Mom. 
 - Go Mu Won.

391
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,890
Look in Mom's eyes. Mom's eyes!

392
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:08,340
You are the older brother. So you must protect your younger brother, do you understand?

393
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,230
Promise Mom.

394
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,490
Go Mu Chi, you must not make any noise.

395
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,280
Promise Mom.

396
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:42,060
When Mom leaves the car, lock the car doors immediately. Okay?

397
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,480
M-Mom.

398
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,620
Please protect my babies, please.

399
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,250
Lock the doors right away, got it?

400
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,590
Mom...

401
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,090
M-mom...

402
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,440
Mom...

403
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,190
No. No. Please don't.

404
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,430
Please just leave, please.

405
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:41,790
- Mom told us to be quiet, remember? 
 - I can't!

406
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,760
Mu Chi don't!

407
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,420
Mom!

408
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:42,330
Mu Chi, please be quiet.

409
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:59,370
What should I do?

410
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,570
Mu Chi...

411
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,450
 Go Mu Won! Look at me! You know you have to protect your little brother, right? 

412
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,940
 Promise me. 

413
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,250
It's that way!

414
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,650
- What happened? 
 - What are you doing here...

415
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,870
Just tell me what happened!

416
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:11,940
The owner of the camping grounds reported it. The water tank was locked, so he went to unlock it for them and found them.

417
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,210
The husband was attacked by the mineral spring and his wife was attacked in the camping grounds.

418
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,920
But we couldn't find their bodies.

419
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:26,050
- The children? 
 - The older boy is in surgery, in critical condition. The younger boy...

420
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:33,970
But it seems he saw what happened to his mom and brother. He is not in a good state.

421
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,820
Child?

422
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,530
Did you see that man's face?

423
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,970
Huh?

424
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,770
- Come to your senses. Did you see his face? 
 - Why are you doing that to a boy in shock?

425
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,380
All right.

426
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,700
Child?

427
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,680
Ajussi has to catch that son of a bi*ch, that murderer.

428
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,130
That bastard took Ajussi's daughter.

429
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,360
I don't even know if she's alive or dead.

430
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,550
Okay?

431
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,380
So please,

432
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,900
try to remember.

433
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,490
Did you see his face?

434
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,120
Speak!! Did you see his face?

435
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,500
What are you doing? Please take him away.

436
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,780
- He's not speaking properlyâ€” 
 - Hey!

437
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,840
- Let go of me! 
 - Are you all right?

438
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,090
If you didn't see his face,

439
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:00,260
his size? His height?

440
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,240
Please tell me something! Let me go.

441
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,760
 - Kid! Hey! 
 - Come on! 
 - Let go of me! 

442
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,150
 - Really...  
 - Do you remember?

443
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,950
Are you all right?

444
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:32,940
I-I-It's him! I saw him clearly!

445
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:22,700
When did he clean up? My husband is so diligent.

446
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,940
You're awake. Did you sleep well?

447
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,600
You should have awakened me.

448
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,650
I didn't even get to see Professor off. Did he get home safely?

449
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,760
Yes, I took him to his hotel.

450
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,760
Do you want a cup of tea?

451
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,470
Indeed, Bach is the best music for the baby.

452
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,350
I wonder how I would feel.

453
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,910
About what?

454
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,890
If my child had the psychopathy gene.

455
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:30,490
Why would you say such an appalling thing?

456
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,720
I'm just wondering.

457
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,040
If a mother knew that her child was going to be born as a psychopath...

458
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,280
I'm just wondering how that mother would feel.

459
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,650
Aigoo, you are being silly.

460
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,810
Blessing, cover your ears.

461
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,610
Your mother needs to only think and speak about good things for your sake

462
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,340
but she's being naughty, isn't she?

463
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:56,210
I'm sorry, Blessing. Mom was wrong.

464
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,960
I will only have good thoughts from now on.

465
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,240
Why are there sirens at this hour?

466
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,250
Maybe there was an accident?

467
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:18,390
It's coming towards our house.

468
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,470
Stay here for a moment.

469
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:30,980
What is going on?

470
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,710
   
   

471
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,880
- Begin searching! 
 - Yes, sir!

472
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,350
What are you doing right now?

473
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:49,480
Please... What are you doing?

474
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:58,210
Why? Why are you...?

475
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,680
Do you really not know?

476
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,740
Headhunter.

477
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,270
 I-I-It's him! I saw him clearly! 

478
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,270
 Doctor! 

479
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:22,170
Mom. Dad.

480
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,660
 Han Seo Joon? 

481
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,960
Headhunter? Me?

482
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,700
I am so dismayed.

483
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,110
What is the matter, Seo Joon?

484
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:46,520
What is going on? Huh?

485
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:52,480
 Neurosurgeon Han Seo Joon 

486
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,970
Hey kid!

487
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,580
 Doctor! 

488
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,970
If you can't get an arrest warrant, please issue a search warrant immediately.

489
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,390
Why must I wait until tomorrow morning?

490
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:19,010
Will you take responsibility if we miss him like that!

491
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,720
Don't you think that maybe you are rushing? Based only on a little boy's word?

492
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:25,340
I am capable of anything right now.

493
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:29,130
I would believe a passing dog right now.

494
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:37,020
Why are you doing this? Please tell me.

495
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,420
Honey!

496
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,370
Search thoroughly. The murder weapon, the missing corpses.

497
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,480
Make sure to find everything.

498
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,750
Go inside!

499
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,550
Why are you entering our home? Look here!

500
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:55,430
Seo Joon, what is going on?

501
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,460
What is going on?

502
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,880
I don't know what's going on, but I think there's been a mistake. I'm sure it will be all right.

503
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,130
How will you deal with the fallout?

504
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,840
We will not stand for this.

505
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,280
Ji Eun, calm down. You know my friend Attorney Hwang, don't you?

506
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,730
Call him first.

507
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:17,400
Bathrooms, toilets, beds, search everywhere!

508
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,450
Look for the knife.

509
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:38,870
Hello?

510
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:42,330
Attorney Hwang, this is Sung Ji Eun.

511
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:14,430
What a bust.

512
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,050
We didn't find anything.

513
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:28,670
I told you to be a little more cautious.

514
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,640
What is all this, based on one little boy's word?

515
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,330
And does it make sense for a successful doctor to be a serial killer?

516
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,880
Die!!

517
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,740
Hey, hey!

518
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,840
Hey, you!

519
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,430
Die!

520
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:23,850
What is it?

521
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,790
 Go Mu Chi, I'm letting you go since it's your birthday. 

522
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,060
 Promise me. 

523
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,610
Mom.

524
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,080
Mom!

525
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,620
Mom...

526
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,650
- What... is that? 
 - Mommy!

527
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,010
 Headhunter finally caught. 

528
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:33,450
 - I hope you sell a lot.
 - Thank you. 

529
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,450
 In the greenhouse in the backyard of Dr. Han who was revealed to be the "Headhunter," 

530
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:40,210
 two headless corpses were found. 

531
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:43,920
 The corpses are assumed to be the married couple who were killed at a camping site. 

532
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,570
 They are being autopsied by the NFS (National Forensic Service). 

533
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:51,510
They're here! They're here!

534
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:55,700
- Get a picture. 
 - Step aside.

535
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,320
 Do you admit the charges? 

536
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,520
I didn't do it.

537
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,940
What do you have to say about the head that was found in the snowman?

538
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,020
I did not make that.

539
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,870
How that snowman...

540
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:12,310
was in my front yard, I do not know.

541
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:14,060
 Breaking news. 

542
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:19,120
 The arrest warrant of Dr. Han, the prime suspect in the Headhunter case, was dismissed. 

543
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,410
 The court found that the eye witness testimony was lacking in credibility 

544
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,150
 and dismissed the arrest warrant 

545
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,990
 and issued an order to not indict. 

546
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,790
- Oh! 
 - What are you doing?

547
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:58,180
Let go!

548
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,420
It's that bastard!

549
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,400
 - He shouldn't be released! 
 - Please be rational. 

550
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,640
Speak. Speak, I said!

551
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,550
Where is my daughter, you son of a b**ch?

552
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,620
We will make sure you are accountable for this.

553
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,420
Where is my daughter?

554
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,660
Hey, hey!

555
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,470
She's alive, isn't she?

556
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,360
I will beg you on my knees.

557
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,090
Please...

558
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,060
Please.

559
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,240
Please!!

560
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,200
Professor.

561
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,250
Can psychopaths love others?

562
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:46,670
No, they cannot love anyone but themselves,

563
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,200
and they are born that way.

564
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,910
Seo Joon truly loves you, Ji Eun.

565
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,880
I know that.

566
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:01,880
Here he comes!

567
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,800
There he is.

568
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,340
 How did you get the injury on your face?! 

569
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,020
Was the police investigation coercive?

570
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,830
Yes, a detective was violentâ€”

571
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,570
About that,

572
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:20,890
that detective is a bereaved family member of a victim, so his emotions ran high.

573
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:25,940
I will also pray that this case is solved as soon as possible so he can find his daughter.

574
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,540
Did you really not make that snowman in front of your home?

575
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,660
It's true, I did not make that.

576
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,390
I will say this again. But how that snowman

577
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,720
ended up in front of my house, I really do not know.

578
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:40,740
That person called Headhunter, who did such a heinous thing in front of my home,

579
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:45,080
I truly hope that he is caughtâ€”

580
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,800
Ji Eun.

581
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:50,880
Please move aside. Move.

582
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,550
You've suffered a lot of heartache, haven't you?

583
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,800
The misunderstanding was cleared up.

584
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,650
It was you.

585
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:14,480
You made that snowman.

586
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:20,660
Snowman? Did she say snowman?

587
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,830
 Blessing, your dad 

588
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:43,410
 is making a snow family for us. 

589
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:46,130
 Daddy snowman. 

590
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:49,210
 And our Blessing, over there. 

591
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,280
 And that's Mom. 

592
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,470
This is a scoop!

593
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,030
He's a murderer! Look at the picture...

594
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,140
Aish.

595
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,370
 I'm almost home. 

596
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:26,200
 Alright, Daniel. Get some sleep. 

597
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:41,420
 Ajussi, do you know where the Oseong Camping Grounds are? 

598
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:45,380
 Make a left turn up there, and it will take about 10 minutes. 

599
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,450
 Thank you. Travel safely. 

600
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:04,880
 Such good weather for hunting. 

601
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:16,440
My wife is smart, indeed.

602
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,240
Why did you marry me?

603
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,030
I heard that psychopaths cannot love anyone but themselves.

604
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:29,770
That they were born that way.

605
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:34,160
So tell me, why did you marry me? Huh?

606
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,690
When you didn't even love me? Why?

607
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:43,170
Well, you can call it the "propagation of a species."

608
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,510
I needed an offspring.

609
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:51,340
A second generation of me, Han Seo Joon.

610
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:57,510
- You crazy bastard! You crazy bastard! 
 - Arrest him! Now!

611
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:00,690
Arrest him! Throw him in jail!

612
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,230
You bastard! Ahhh!

613
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:26,660
What the hell  do you think you're doing? Open the door.

614
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:33,400
Open the door! Why won't you open it?

615
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,290
Isn't there a key? Go get the key, hurry!

616
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:47,340
Did you... do that?

617
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:51,780
Did you kill her?

618
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:56,940
Did you kill my younger sister?

619
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,670
So she wasn't attacked by robbers that day?

620
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:10,260
You killed her and pretended she was robbed... That's not true, right?

621
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,690
That's not true, is it?

622
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:26,650
A person's life is very tenacious, don't you think?

623
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:33,040
Was it 20 times? All that stabbing,

624
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:38,980
and yet she ran away, even while shedding so much blood. It must have been very painful.

625
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:43,030
So I shouted. "Jennifer,

626
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:45,850
if you don't come out right now, I will run to your house

627
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:51,910
and rip your mother and brother to shreds, and tear off all their flesh."

628
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:56,810
"So make a choice. Come crawling out right now

629
00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:02,530
or see your own family torn to pieces with your own eyes."

630
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:07,620
"One, two..."

631
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,710
Before I counted to three

632
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,100
she struggled as she crawled out from behind the rock, bleeding from head to toe.

633
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:22,490
Seeing that made me laugh so much.

634
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:31,240
Why did you kill her? Why? She loved you so much! So why?

635
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,380
She told me that she aborted my child.

636
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:38,180
She dared to do that without my permission. What?

637
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,700
She did not intend to have any children?

638
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:45,390
Who does that b*tch think she is, to do that to my offspring?

639
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:52,670
What do you think you are doing?

640
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:02,470
Even as she struggled to gulp down her last breaths,

641
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:09,750
she asked me to keep my promise to never touch her brother and mother.

642
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:13,560
And as she begged me, her gaze was so sexy.

643
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:15,750
Quiet!

644
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:55,850
A friend I worked with in England has a lab here.

645
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:59,350
Would you like the test?

646
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,900
   

647
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:29,470
You've come? Hold on.

648
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:35,890
You can go that way.

649
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,850
You can come in.

650
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:53,670
Did you get the result?

651
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,870
No way...

652
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,400
Are you all right?

653
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,460
Please abort this child. Please.

654
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:23,560
I am not a medical doctor. And for you to have an abortion now...

655
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,890
Then what do I do? Do you want me to give birth to a murderer?

656
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:30,210
- It's possible, it's not true. 
 - But you said it was 99% accurate.

657
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:35,130
So you want me to believe in the remaining 1%? When this baby is the bloodline of Han Seo Joon?

658
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:51,920
Hello? Yes, I will go down right now.

659
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:02,570
Ji Eun, I have an urgent guest, so I will go see to it. I'll return soon.

660
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:01,690
You took the test, didn't you?

661
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:08,160
That's what I thought, since you are an expectant mother who came to see the Professor.

662
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:13,700
- Then... 
 - My husband

663
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:20,090
was on the Professor's research team in England. He said he wanted to assist in the experiment.

664
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:26,280
At that time, I was six weeks pregnant, and I decided to support him.

665
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:32,740
The result came a few days later, and my husband told me that nothing was wrong.

666
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:37,010
That our baby was normal.

667
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:41,900
But he had lied to me.

668
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:50,040
The result said that child is a carrier of the psychopathy gene.

669
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:58,510
But my husband hid it from me because I might be shocked.

670
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:12,400
- How many weeks are you? 
 - I just began my 23rd week.

671
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:19,690
Fortunately, you can still have an abortion.

672
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:24,550
You can probably have another child in the future.

673
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:31,120
My husband died last month in an accident.

674
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:39,640
He was trying to save a boy who ran into the street to fetch a ball. Then he was hit by a car...

675
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:46,140
I loved him more than my own life.

676
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:53,920
This baby is... all I have left of him.

677
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,430
My husband...

678
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:05,790
He sacrificed himself for the sake of others. He was someone who could live as a good person, even without laws.

679
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:11,250
There is no way that my child, who is his other self,

680
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:18,160
can be a psychopath or a killer.

681
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,260
So I will give birth to this child.

682
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:32,490
I will give birth to him, and prove

683
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:35,470
that Dr. Daniel is wrong.

684
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:41,150
What will you do?

685
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,130
I wish you luck.

686
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:33,320
 He viciously murdered 20 innocent lives 

687
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:38,030
 and defiled their corpses. At the final trial of the notorious serial killer "Headhunter," Han Seo Joon 

688
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,850
 was sentenced to death, the most severe punishment under the law. 

689
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:44,980
 And so, Han Seo Joon's execution was the final decision of the court. 

690
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:54,860
   

691
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:07,160
   

692
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:13,930
   

693
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:22,940
   

694
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:41,430
- Come in. 
 - Is the seminar preparation going well?

695
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:44,170
Thanks to you. Thanks for lending me your research lab.

696
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:47,790
No need. You helped me a lot back in England.

697
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:51,020
This delivery arrived for you.

698
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:56,290
How did they know you were here? An intense fan of yours?

699
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:59,480
- Work hard. 
 - Thank you.

700
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,890
Who sent this to me?

701
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:39,380
 Black snakes usually eat sparrows, frogs, and mice. 

702
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:43,210
 It's a mouse. 

703
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:04,630
   

704
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:11,080
Class President, are you very itchy?

705
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,360
You should stop drawing and go to the nurse's officeâ€”

706
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,000
Teacher? Teacher.

707
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,940
Well... the rabbit...

708
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,990
Why did you kill the rabbit?

709
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:55,820
I wasn't trying to kill it.

710
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:58,580
So why did you cut the rabbit's belly?

711
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:00,320
It had gotten fat.

712
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,170
What? What did you say?

713
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:08,340
I wanted to know if it was just fat or pregnant.

714
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,740
What?

715
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:14,420
You were curious about that so you did that to the rabbit?

716
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:20,230
But why do you scratch your arm like that?

717
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:25,010
I'm annoyed at the other kids, but I can't work out my frustration on them.

718
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:27,640
So I'm working my frustration on myself.

719
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,420
But there are no kids around right now.

720
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:39,570
I am annoyed by you right now, Teacher. You're looking at me in a strange way.

721
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:41,580
I-I am?

722
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:49,460
Yes, you can go now.

723
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,790
What's wrong with him?

724
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,610
He really did that?

725
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:25,400
Really?

726
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:29,990
His mother is busy with the store, so I came instead.

727
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:35,230
You know Jae Hoon wants to become a doctor when he grows up, right?

728
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:36,870
Yes, that's what he says.

729
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:41,120
We did an IQ test at school last month, and he scored above 160.

730
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,350
Ah, yes.

731
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:50,430
Are there any problems at home?

732
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:54,070
Huh? What do you mean?

733
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:11,600
This is a picture that your son drew.

734
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,200
I asked to see you because I thought it was urgent for him to receive treatment.

735
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,060
Treatment?

736
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:22,610
Are you treating our child as a mental patient because he drew one unique picture?

737
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,940
Did you really

738
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:38,020
cut that rabbit's belly?

739
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:51,700
Yes, Honey? Come home right now.

740
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:55,130
What? Is the store important right now?

741
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:57,980
Do you know what your son did?

742
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:01,220
I am so ashamed right now.

743
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,660
 Yes, let's eat. 

744
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:18,370
Choco, there you are.

745
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,400
What is that, Hyeong?

746
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,650
Ammonia.

747
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,390
I heard all the fish will die if you pour this in.

748
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:57,100
They will die?

749
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:59,960
Don't do that. Don't kill the fish.

750
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,870
Out of the way.

751
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:07,360
Dad loves them a lot.

752
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,330
That's why I am killing them.

753
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:12,400
Hyeong, don't do that.

754
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,960
Those poor fish.

755
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:33,900
Don't tell Dad that I took Choco, and you better not tell him about the fish.

756
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:38,850
Being a tattletale is the worst thing in the world.

757
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:40,760
You know that, right?

758
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:58,430
Jae Min, Jae Hui, Dad is home.

759
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,180
What's going on here?

760
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:12,790
Did you guys do something? You better tell me!

761
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:22,770
Our Jae Min is a good boy, isn't he? Why did all the fish die?

762
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:26,100
"What is that, Hyeong?"

763
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:33,050
"Ammonia. I heard all the fish will die if you pour this in."

764
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:36,420
"Don't do that. Don't kill the fish."

765
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:39,500
"Dad loves them a lot."

766
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:42,670
"That's why I am killing them."

767
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:54,850
This boy...

768
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,380
You bastard. You terrible bastard.

769
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:21,990
Get up, you bastard. Out of my way.

770
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:23,800
Won't you let go?

771
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,010
Out of my way.

772
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,840
Do you want to go see Choco?

773
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,790
Choco?

774
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:08,420
We didn't say a proper farewell.

775
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:21,450
Choco.

776
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:27,430
Close both your eyes and pray that he goes to heaven.

777
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,320
I told you that tattling is a bad thing to do.

778
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:43,160
I didn't say anything. Hyeong,

779
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,350
Hyeong, I didn't say anything.

780
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:48,060
What's more, you are a liar.

781
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,200
You need to be punished.

782
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:15,410
Go home, okay?

783
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:23,140
Die. Die.

784
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:27,160
A boy like you needs to die, you monster.

785
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,580
You shouldn't have been born.

786
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:34,810
I should not have given birth to you.

787
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,620
 Monster... 

788
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:57,620
Do I seem different to you, too, Ajussi?

789
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,390
They tell me that I was always different.

790
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:07,520
That from the very beginning, I was born to be different.

791
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:19,290
They said that I was born as a monster.

792
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:33,710
 That day I prayed to god. 

793
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:39,760
 Please help me to not become a monster. 

794
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:46,940
 A corpse of a female college student was found in a grape farm in Gyeonggi Province early this morning. 
    

795
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:49,440
 On the 5th, the student went for a walk but never returned 

796
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,770
 so her family filed a missing persons report with the police. 

797
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:55,790
 Yet, she was able to return only after her life was taken. 

798
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:58,620
 The police believe that she is a victim of a serial killer. 

799
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:01,360
 and decided to expand the investigation. 

800
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:11,540
 My prayers were not answered. 

801
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:17,920
 And I became a killer, after all. 

802
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:12,980


803
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:24,140
   

804
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:24,890
 Hello. 

805
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:26,940
 He has good character and is good-looking. 

806
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:28,560
 He is well-mannered. 

807
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,150
 You know, that citizens' award or something like that last time, 

808
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:32,900
 he even received that. 

809
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,800
 Elder, elder, really, I... 

810
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,970
 Come and wash up and go. 

811
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,800
 I am really going to get arrested! 

812
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,350
 18, 18! 

813
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:40,920
 Uh Bung Yi, wait! 

814
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,160
 I'll pull your tongue out and make it into a skipping rope. 

815
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,420
 It's not Uh Bung Yi. It's Oh. Bong Yi. Oh. Bong Yi. 

816
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,710
 I'll make this quick for you. 

817
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:49,620
 Have you been drinking? 

818
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,930
 This cop has gone crazy! 

819
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:54,940
 That's right. I've completely gone crazy. 

820
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:58,030
 If you jump from there, your guts will spill out. 

821
01:24:58,030 --> 01:25:00,500
 They'll be splattered everywhere. 

822
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:02,530
 You really jumped? 

823
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:04,420
 Leave me alone! 

824
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:05,620
 Why should I apologize? 

825
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:07,170
 - Why youâ€” 
 - Don't! 

826
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:09,060
 You can't. 

827
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:13,040
 Don't you know that once I smell something fishy, I  don't let it go, like a Pit bull? 

828
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,160
 Get lost. 

829
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:20,130
 The fact that he kept a trophy means that the killer of these two cases is an extremely dangerous psychopath.  

830
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:22,350
 You'll end up failing. 

831
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:24,390
 - What? 
 - You can't kill people. 

832
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:25,250
 A hunt? 

833
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:29,120
 He might be hunting at this very moment. 

834
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:36,050
 There's no church or a cross. 

835
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:38,760
 Or even traces of it being moved. 

836
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:44,230
 It's him. The Headhunter. 

837
01:25:44,230 --> 01:25:47,530
 A monster lives inside of him.
