1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:08,410


2
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,040
   

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,170
   

4
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,220
   

5
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,210
 [Prime suspect is the eldest son who is in elementary school. 

6
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,870
Did you do it?

7
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,910
No.

8
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,770
Did you not see anything on that day?

9
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,440
No, I didn't.

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,740
I didn't see anything.

11
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,880
 God never answered my prayers. 

12
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,610
 And I ended up becoming a murderer. 

13
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,630
 I remember my first murder being clumsy 

14
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,400
 and hard to pull off. 

15
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,660
 However, the exhilaration and excitement from that day 

16
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,270
 was something I could never forget. 

17
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,120
 Earlier this morning, director A was found burned to death  

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,370
 at a boxing gym in Seokjin-dong, Mujin. 

19
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,340
 Director A was found to be the family of a victim, 

20
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,010
 of the Headhunter case, which shook the entire nation to its very core, 25 years ago. 

21
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:30,020
 After that day, I continued to kill. 

22
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,760
 Psychopaths are the result of a gene mutation that arose as society evolved, 

23
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,990
 among which the top 1% are called predators. 

24
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,160
 Just like how lions instinctively prey on rabbits, 

25
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,560
 predators prey on human beings. 

26
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,970
 A fellow human is nothing but prey for hunting. 

27
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,560
 I am a predator. 

28
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,120
 That's how I was born. 

29
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,230
   

30
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,060
 Hey you bastard, stop! 

31
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,470
   

32
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,890
 Stop right there!  
    

33
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,060
Come here!

34
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,840
You bastard.

35
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,250
Hey, you punk!

36
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,610
There you go.

37
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,040
You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.

38
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,440
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

39
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,620
What's wrong with you? Are you going to shoot me?

40
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,890
This cop has gone crazy!

41
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,730
That's right. I've gone completely crazy.

42
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,950
Save me. Isn't there anyone around? Help me—

43
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,490
Be quiet you bastard.

44
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,970
You've killed someone. Why would someone come save you?

45
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,230
Stay still.

46
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,580
I'll make this quick for you.

47
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,040
 Mu Chi, please. 

48
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,420
 Don't do this. 

49
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,250
 You can't let your life get ruined because of him. 

50
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,890
What the hell!

51
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,780
Where are you going?

52
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,320
Come here.

53
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,670
Where are you going?

54
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,860
Hey, hey, hey! Get down!

55
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,720
If you jump off there, I'll be devastated.

56
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,600
All right. Shoot me.

57
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,880
Just shoot me! I'm going to jump off anyway.

58
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,450
Hey, nobody's shooting anyone here.

59
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,880
I was just messing with you. To scare you a little bit.

60
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,330
You were messing with me? You're that guy, aren't you?

61
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,460
The one who tried to kill me as I was running away!

62
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,500
You have a pretty good memory.

63
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,590
Okay. Okay. I'll just arrest you.

64
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,330
I'll arrest you.

65
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,110
Come on down. I'll arrest you. That's it.

66
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,520
I'll only arrest you. Come on, quick!

67
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,130
Come on down.

68
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,450
But you should think this out carefully.

69
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,910
You sexually assaulted those poor sisters.

70
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,230
Then you killed them by beating them with a hammer, so it's obvious what kind of person you are.

71
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,200
But will this stupid country execute anyone? Nope, they never do.

72
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,930
So what are you? Someone who's going to rot in prison until you die.

73
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,520
Not to mention, someone good-looking and delicate like you?

74
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,580
Prisons are filled with all sorts of perverts, you know.

75
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,080
By then, you could beg to die, but no one will help you.

76
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,910
Hey!

77
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,790
Are you really going to jump off?

78
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,550
This bastard, you really don't understand. Is your ear hole your butthole?

79
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,360
Do you think I did all this just to see you die by suicide?

80
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,870
By staying planted in front of your live-in girlfriend's house for two years?

81
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,030
Come down, right now! If you jump from there, your guts will spill out on the ground!

82
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,600
They'll be splattered everywhere! Just think about the people who'll have to clean all of that!

83
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,150
You selfish bastard!

84
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,740
So let's get this done without all that mess.

85
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,140
You stand still right there. I'll shoot you from here.

86
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,910
You'll get shot, then you'll fall and we can wrap this up.

87
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,440
Okay?

88
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,430
Okay.

89
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,670
Gosh.

90
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,570
I should really stop drinking.

91
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,730
Where did he go?

92
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,850
Did he really jump off?

93
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,390
Ah, this bastard. You are of no benefit to my life.

94
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,270
Aigoo.

95
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,060
Hello.

96
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,990
 I was going to pray early in the morning.  And I saw something flashing. 

97
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,690
 So I went to see what it was. 

98
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,670
How can this happen?

99
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,440
She lived struggling, trying to raise her daughter by herself.

100
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,240
Don't you smell alcohol?

101
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,050
Oh my.

102
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,580
It keeps moving.

103
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,700
Stay still, will you?

104
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,080
Stop moving.

105
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,610
Go Mu Chi!

106
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,840
Did you see it? The body keeps moving.

107
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,710
It's fascinating.

108
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,430
Didn't I warn you that I wouldn't let you off easy if you came to my crime scene drunk and caused trouble again?

109
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,310
I'm quite sad to hear that. It's not like we're strangers.

110
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,460
Hyung, this isn't your case. It's mine.

111
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,700
That bastard did this.

112
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,420
Look. You can easily tell that it's him.

113
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,520
- You called him, right? 
 - He kept—

114
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,530
He killed again.

115
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,310
Let go of me. Let go of me, you punk!

116
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,460
Hey, let go. That bastard killed again!

117
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,250
- Just how much did you drink? 
 - It's mine, I said!

118
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,800
No, no, you can't!

119
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,580
This is from the new collection. I haven't even removed the tag.

120
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,650
- Chief Go, keep an eye on him. 
 - Yes.

121
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,760
Hyung, what I'm saying is right!

122
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,820
He's the one behind this!

123
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,890
- He killed again! 
 - I'm sorry.

124
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,930
He kept threatening me to call him if there was a murder case. Gosh.

125
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,830
He's doing an interview.

126
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,130
Stop him. Stop him right now!

127
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,430
 This killing... The boxing gym director who was murdered recently. 

128
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,020
 I am certain that this is the same killer. 

129
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,600
 That guy also killed that woman. 

130
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,430
 He is deeply dissatisfied with that being, up there. 

131
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,630
 If not, perhaps he's an attention seeker? 

132
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,440
 The police have determined that the killer of the boxing gym director and this employee 

133
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,800
 is the same killer who harbors dissatisfaction towards religion. 

134
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,180
 That is how they are pursuing this investigation. 

135
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,990
Did you fail again?

136
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,250
You will grow old and die like this.

137
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,800
I won't let that happen.

138
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,460
Has it been a year already

139
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,840
since you killed that guy who murdered those sisters with a hammer?

140
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,980
You came here and shouted that you would come in here and decapitate me.

141
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,150
But you are still out there.

142
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,580
Why such a rush? You will eventually die.

143
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,880
Just wait a little longer. Never mind these small fry.

144
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,900
I feel like the real thing, a very strong one, is around the corner.

145
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,220
Go Mu Chi.

146
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,850
You'll end up failing.

147
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,310
- What? 
 - You can't kill people.

148
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,560
I can tell by looking into someone's eyes

149
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,920
if they're like me or just a normal person.

150
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,430
I didn't know. Were you an expert in the eyes and not the brain?

151
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,930
To be able to kill, one's eyes must be devoid of everything.

152
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,090
But your eyes are filled to the brim.

153
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,800
With anger, pain,

154
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,590
regret, pity,

155
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,000
and love.

156
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,990
Stop that bullsh*t.

157
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,190
One can't learn it by just trying.

158
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,930
It's something you're born with.

159
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,460
So don't try.

160
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,240
Stop your bullsh*t and just make sure to wash your neck.

161
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,920
Just wait you bastard. It won't take long.

162
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,040
Fine. I'll wait, kid.

163
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,760
Next time, stab me properly.

164
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,990
Not here, but...

165
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,750
Right here.

166
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,030
Some time ago,

167
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,870
I found a Bible at the crime scene.

168
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,260
There was a very impressive verse there.

169
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,780
That verse gave me great enlightenment.

170
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,630
"If a man takes a human life, he should be put to death without fail."

171
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,620
"Anyone who strikes and kills a domestic animal should make compensation for it."

172
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,370
"A fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

173
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,030
Leviticus 24:17-20.

174
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,930
Amen.

175
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,460
All this time, the man up there,

176
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,810
I thought He was always forcing people to forgive, unaware of reality, so I criticized Him a lot. But this made an impression.

177
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,330
So I thought that I should do what He says.

178
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,760
I should pay back what I received.

179
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,900
So I realized that I shouldn't stop at just cutting your head off.

180
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,660
Shouldn't I kill you in front of your child, just like you did in front of my eyes?

181
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,610
So it's the truth, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

182
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,030
It's God's teaching, am I right?

183
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,090
I don't have any children to compensate for it.

184
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,250
Oh, what to do? I saw it myself.

185
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,250
Who do you think you are fooling?

186
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,860
It was obvious to see through your wife. I saw it with my own eyes.

187
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,530
 It's dead. To be precise, 

188
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,760
 I killed it. 

189
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,650
They say the paternal attachment a psychopath has to its offspring is extraordinary.

190
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,480
What's wrong?

191
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,180
Wouldn't you like to show your child how to cut someone's head off?

192
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:55,800
That memory sure lasts for a very long time.

193
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,610
It follows your entire life, it won't matter much if you're sick of it.

194
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,530
Han Seo Joon, just you wait.

195
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:09,490
The pain I suffered, I'll make sure your child

196
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,650
also suffers his entire life from it.

197
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:32,180
 What a surprise. You coming here by yourself. 

198
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,340
 You should have brought our Blessing along. I wanted to see him. 

199
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,900
 It's dead. 

200
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,870
 - What? 
 - To be precise, I killed it. 

201
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,120
 Right after giving birth, I killed it with my own hands. 

202
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,300
 I came to tell you. 

203
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,130
 It was very similar to you, 

204
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,880
 so I killed it. 

205
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,360
 I thought he would become a monster like you. 

206
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,720
 How dare you? 

207
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,820
 Is my child dead? 

208
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,870
 How dare you, you witch! 

209
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,070
You're saying my son is alive, right?

210
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,930
 It's nice if you 

211
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,150
leave a twig when you finish the branches.

212
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,330
I really like the teacher's sense!

213
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,170
After I met you, Teacher, people call me "golden hands" lately.

214
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,550
 Oh, really? 

215
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:35,690
They're called zinnia. In flower language, they mean to miss someone who has left.

216
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Don't you remember me? I've been to your house before.

217
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,750
My house?

218
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,860
Snowman.

219
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,610
Snow...?

220
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,670
You...?

221
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,750
Give me money.

222
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,920
W-What?

223
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,570
 My brother, thanks to you, underwent nine surgeries. 

224
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:10,510
There is another one tomorrow. I can't pay for it, and they say they won't perform the surgery if I don't.

225
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:16,170
They'll... They are just going to let him die.

226
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,990
I-I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

227
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,180
Are you sorry? I don't need your apology.

228
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,840
- I came to ask for your money! 
 - Student!

229
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,330
Hurry, give it to me!

230
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,090
That's not it. Why do we have to live like this?

231
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,200
You live like nothing has happened. Why?

232
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,760
Why? Why is it that we must live this way?

233
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,120
Your husband, the Headhunter! He was said to be a good doctor.

234
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,050
So he would have made a lot of money.

235
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,410
Give me money! Give it to me!

236
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,820
My brother will die without this surgery.

237
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,180
Let's go somewhere else and talk...

238
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,530
Pay my brother's surgery fee, hurry!

239
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,710
 Mom! 

240
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,580
What the heck...?

241
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,720
Oh, I apologize.

242
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,260
Have you gone crazy?

243
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,320
I'm sorry. The bird must have hurt its leg.

244
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,030
It didn't move even though the car was coming closer. I couldn't help myself.

245
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,740
Were you very surprised? I'm sorry, sorry.

246
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,480
You almost died because of that bird, kid!

247
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,820
You're right. I'm sorry. Sorry.

248
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,920
Sorry. Drive safe!

249
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,340
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry! 

250
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,070
Is he kind or stupid?

251
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,250
Right. I ran out of thread.

252
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,350
If I don't practice, my hands will be stiff.

253
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,910
Don't you know it's a banned item?

254
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,700
Besides, medical items are not for prisoners to use.

255
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,270
Bring it to me.

256
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,520
The guards before you never said anything.

257
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,370
Only to become an errand boy for you,

258
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,450
do you think I became a guard just by studying for exams without a double nosebleed?

259
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,680
   

260
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,220
 Don't be scared, Chi Kook. 

261
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,370
 Be quiet! Be quiet! 

262
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,930
Everyone knows who you are. You think you're a king, right? Don't flatter yourself.

263
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,250
All you are is a mayfly whose death date is already written.

264
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,280
Threats won't work on me.

265
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,220
So I told him, "Threats won't work on me."

266
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,470
That's what I told him.

267
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,200
- What is this? 
 - You don't know what's going on because you are a rookie.

268
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,030
Haven't you heard about the retired prison guard who became handicapped after disturbing Han Seo Joon's mood?

269
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,900
He doesn't do anything himself. His followers know what to do.

270
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,760
So bring it to him and pretend you said nothing.

271
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,820
Oh, where are you? Have you eaten?

272
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,460
You're not home yet?

273
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,380
Aigoo, you stay there. I'll come pick you up.

274
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,770
Hello.

275
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,470
   

276
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,280
Please bring the costumes this way.

277
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,170
You packed everything, didn't you?

278
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,930
- Of course. 
 - Even the cards? 
 - Cards.

279
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,110
   

280
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,730
There you go again. Are you Dr. Schweitzer of animals?

281
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,360
Chi Kook is here.

282
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,540
- Hello. 
 - Hi, Chi Kook.

283
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,420
You're like a different person. You look great in uniform.

284
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,830
Thank you.

285
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,890
Throw away that knock-off watch. I am embarrassed for you.

286
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,660
You guys bought me this as a gift when I became a prison guard.

287
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,370
To me, this is the real thing.

288
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,750
It's my fault for letting that dummy order it.

289
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,640
He got conned by a website selling knock-offs, and he calls himself a policeman.

290
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,610
The eagle has a penis. Isn't it obvious that it's a fake?

291
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,670
And he can't distinguish between "R" and "N."

292
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,630
What is Enmani (Armani) anyway? And he paid $1,000 for it.

293
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,440
That's not his penis. It's his leg.

294
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,090
That's all you ever see, Dong Gu. That's why your nickname is "Porn Gu."

295
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,390
But why does he only have one leg? Ba Reum, this is a penis, right?

296
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,540
It's his leg. Oh, my arm is too short.

297
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,090
Stop this! Stop this! Stop!

298
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,310
So how about it? Do you like the job?

299
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:28,740
Well, I'm trying to appear tough, but it's not easy.

300
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,900
Ba Reum, did you pack the sewing box?

301
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,200
- There isn't one? 
 - No.

302
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,420
Oh. I left it at home.

303
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,580
Without the thread and the needle, our performance is a bust.

304
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,290
Keep looking. Gosh!

305
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,440
Will this do? This is surgical thread.

306
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,580
- Yes, that will work. 
 - Yeah, it doesn't matter.

307
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,030
Oh, what a relief!

308
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:50,450
- Hey, did you see the Headhunter? I heard he is here. 
 - Yes.

309
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,490
Let me meet him just once. I even signed up on his fan cafe.

310
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,990
What? I wondered what sh*t-for-brains signed up for things like that. Is it you?

311
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,580
- Sh*t-for-brains? 
 - You only watch movies like "Hannibal," so you think serial killers are cool or something.

312
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,740
Pathetic guys like you are the reason that bastards like them keep appearing.

313
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,360
Didn't you even watch the news?

314
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,490
Some woman struggling to raise her daughter alone was killed after being stabbed 20 times. 20 times!

315
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,380
Those pieces of trash keep acting up like they're something special, because of people like you.

316
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,820
I got it, so stop talking.

317
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,010
Killing a weak, powerless woman after hiding like a rat. This cowardly bug-like bastard.

318
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,800
Oh, fine, I won't ask you then.

319
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,050
Acting like a big shot just because you became a prison guard.

320
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,330
- This punk... 
 - Hey, come on.

321
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,220
Dong Gu gave up on being a civil service worker.

322
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,460
He's writing a movie script, saying he's chasing his original dream.

323
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,760
He said it's about psychopaths, or something.

324
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,140
So he signed up for that fan cafe to do research.

325
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,320
So his film director disease has recurred?

326
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,910
Dong Gu will do well.

327
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,170
Chi Kook, let's have a drink afterwards and make up.

328
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,840
Right.

329
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,710
Can you help for a moment?

330
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,300
- Carry it just a little further, Chi Kook. 
 - Wow, this is so heavy.

331
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,550
Why don't we use the wheels? Why are we carrying this?

332
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,200
It's because of the wheels.

333
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,610
If the wheels break while rolling it on this stone road, our performance will be ruined.

334
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,900
Sorry about this. Just a little more.

335
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,820
- I think it's their exercise time. 
 - Yeah.

336
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:34,370
You know, before I became a prison guard, I thought that death row inmates

337
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:40,120
prayed every day to their victims for atonement in solitary rooms with nothing in it.

338
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,740
That they lived like they were monks.

339
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:47,370
But instead, they eat three meals a day paid for by taxes from citizens

340
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,570
and they laze around every day.

341
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,780
When I see those guys, I sometimes have this thought.

342
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,400
Believing that they won't ever be executed before their natural deaths,

343
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,400
they shamelessly don't bother to atone for their sins.

344
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,720
Seeing them live like they're enjoying easy retirement,

345
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,220
I wonder how dismayed the families of the victims would be if they saw that.

346
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,240
How bitter and resentful they would feel.

347
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,990
But today, for a very brief moment,

348
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:23,990
I got scared by the likes of them. I feel ashamed.

349
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,140
What are you talking about?

350
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:31,060
The needle and thread that I gave you earlier...

351
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,160
They were for him. The Headhunter.

352
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,690
He looks just like us.

353
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,670
Of course. Did you think he would look like Thanos? 
 (T/N: A fictional supervillain appearing in Marvel Comics.)

354
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:01,080
So that means there's a monster in there.

355
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,860
I will teach Na Chi Kook a lesson.

356
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,100
Find someone for me.

357
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,950
   

358
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,300
Such big feet.

359
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,270
   

360
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:07,780
Ah, why isn't this guy coming? Seriously...

361
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:16,160
Why do you ignore my calls? I sent you a bunch of text messages, too.

362
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,600
Congratulations. You've been searching the entire country, and you ended up catching the killer of the sisters.

363
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,100
I heard he died by suicide. But your hard work will still be acknowledged. Right, Detective Go?

364
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,550
Amazing! How did I fail to recognize such a great detective?

365
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,440
Kiss my butt all you want. See if I ever cooperate with you again.

366
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,210
Oh, there's something else to congratulate you about.

367
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,990
You've completely dominated the internet.

368
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,760
"Is this drunken interview with the detective real?"

369
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,310
"This pathetic policeman who only grabs liquor bottles instead of grabbing murderers."

370
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,580
"And he dares to announce that it was because of cold medicine?"

371
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,180
You...

372
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,560
Did I drive after drinking?

373
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,750
And I wasn't even on duty.

374
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,660
Can't police officers drink when they are off-duty?

375
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,740
So about that, is he the same person who killed the boxing gym Director Song Soo Ho?

376
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,170
Don't you know I have bad drinking habits? When I drink, I become a dog.

377
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:11,150
Don't you know that I bite down and not let go like a pit bull once I smell something? That wasn't a drinking habit.

378
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,900
So what is your reason for believing that?

379
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,350
No matter how much I think about it, I can't see the connection.

380
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,400
Different neighborhood, different M.O. 
  (T/N: Modus operandi, a criminal method) 

381
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,630
So what is your basis?

382
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,400
What is it? Tell me.

383
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,130
Get lost.

384
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,290
Hey, hey, Detective Go.

385
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:40,720
Hey, why did you go there after drinking?

386
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,180
- If you're done with work, you should go home and sleep. Why did you go there, you punk? 
 - There's blood on the rice here. Run tests on the blood stains.

387
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,230
Did you hear what I said?

388
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,910
How can you think it's the same killer?

389
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:53,110
Aigoo. Just quit your job as a detective and write a novel.

390
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:57,370
Become a bestselling author, you bastard.

391
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,720
I'm suddenly so sleepy now, hearing this lullaby that I am so used to. I better take a nap.

392
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,740
Aigoo, you troublemaker.

393
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,650
Oh, it's pointless to talk to you. My mouth hurts.

394
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,970
I need to stress less to lose less.

395
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,020
Why so concerned about looks? 
    

396
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,190
   

397
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,250
   

398
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,290
Excuse me.

399
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,200
I am the driver for Village Bus Number 12 in Geumshin-dong.

400
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,070
Uh...

401
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:38,540
Won't you speak properly? Have you seen someone who was standing there?

402
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,990
Yes, it's him.

403
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,930
He was standing at the bus stop when that woman got off the bus.

404
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,130
- I paid attention because it was strange that he was there at that time. 
  - It's true. I wanted to ask her on a date. 

405
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,050
- I am certain. 
 - So I followed her.

406
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:53,240
But she freaked out and ran away. And I have pride, too.

407
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,170
So I just went home. I'm telling you the truth.

408
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,570
Take him away and request an arrest warrant.

409
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,710
I'm telling you, I didn't kill her.

410
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,290
I did not kill her.

411
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,470
- Just come out. 
 - Let me go, please. I did not kill her.

412
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,560
Release me, please. I really didn't kill her.

413
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,320
Wait, I saw you on the news before.

414
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,890
Detective, it's really not me.

415
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,020
You said it was the same guy

416
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,240
who killed that boxing gym director or whatever.

417
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,970
 - Gosh. Just come with me quietly! 
 - I don't want to! 

418
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,560
It's not him.

419
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,800
His feet are too small.

420
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,390
There is an eye witness.

421
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,470
The bus driver?

422
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,470
He just saw him at the bus stop. He didn't see him kill her.

423
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,430
That bastard was convicted of violent rape five times before.

424
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,190
But he was never convicted of murder.

425
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,930
Maybe he tried to rape her but she resisted, so he killed her.

426
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,190
But there is no evidence of rape or resistance.

427
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,200
Go Mu Chi.

428
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,440
- What? 
 - Don't cross the line.

429
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,250
Just investigate your case.

430
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,670
You can't even find a suspect.

431
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,720
I am telling you that it's not him. Gosh, you really don't listen.

432
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,750
So who did it?

433
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,540
You're still here?

434
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,010
Do you have this much time on your hands?

435
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,920
Actually, I am very busy.

436
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,200
Then go do your work, PD Choi Hong Ju is very busy.

437
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,920
I am working right now. Detective Go Mu Chi who is being very uncooperative.

438
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,580
The murder of the boxing gym director is about to be broadcast.

439
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:19,540
But there is no suspect and the detective in charge is being so uncooperative.

440
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,190
This may not make it to broadcast like this.

441
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,130
So work on a new item. Who asked for my case to be broadcasted, anyway?

442
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,520
Like the last case of the murder of the rooftop sisters, you're going to chew me out and make me into

443
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,770
an incompetent police officer. How dare you keep trying to mess up my life?

444
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,920
How can I work on a different story? That would be very humiliating.

445
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,180
I, Choi Hong Ju, the recipient of a Best Picture Award am pursuing this story with my knives out.

446
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:42,700
Shouldn't I, at least, stab a pumpkin with it? Or how about your beer belly?

447
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,340
Go ahead and stab whatever you want to.

448
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,530
I guess it can't be helped.

449
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,780
I better work on a new story since my broadcast is about to go bust.

450
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,150
Yes, good thinking.

451
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,030
There are so many other stories.

452
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,150
I will make sure to watch your broadcast. Fighting!

453
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,470
Then how about this one?

454
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,060
What?

455
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,620
A police officer addicted to illegal gambling.

456
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,420
That hurts.

457
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,290
These days, one of my juniors is doing undercover reports on illegal gambling.

458
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:28,250
I happened to see this while helping him edit.

459
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,300
You're just lucky that my junior doesn't know your face, Detective Go.

460
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,970
Once that makes it to broadcast, Detective Go, you will be immediately...

461
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,110
So, should I do my broadcast on the pillar of society who frequents illegal gambling sites?

462
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:53,460
Or the murder of the boxing gym director in Seokjin-dong, the one I've been preparing?

463
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,240
You can decide and contact me.

464
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,760
PD Choi.

465
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,740
Ugh, you are creepy. You are like a leech.

466
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,010
There are so many murder cases, why are you fixated on this one about the boxing gym director?

467
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,900
You said he was the younger brother of Song Soo Jung.

468
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,100
Isn't that shocking? How can that happen to both siblings?

469
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,840
So I really want to catch this killer if only for the sake of their aged mother.

470
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,270
Is that all?

471
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,070
Is it really about your sympathy for them?

472
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,950
It's not sympathy but responsibility.

473
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,960
Responsibility?

474
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:35,910
Last night Byeon Sun Yeong was killed here from about 12:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m.

475
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,260
Here?

476
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,930
The news said it was at a sewer.

477
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,090
They said Byeon Sun Yeong left work after packing the food left over by the guests to give to her daughter.

478
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,560
I found that bag here.

479
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,540
So that means she was killed here.

480
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,870
And I found the footprints here.

481
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,570
- Footprints? Then is there— 
 - Oh, don't step on it.

482
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,070
So did you find anything?

483
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,410
He's no an ordinary guy, that's for sure.

484
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,270
He had cut off the soles of his shoes.

485
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,980
So even if there is a trace, no one could find a clue.

486
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,490
So why was the body found in the sewer?

487
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,960
Was the victim attacked here, and ran away there where she died?

488
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,790
Look at this.

489
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,120
Those are scratch marks.

490
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:20,090
So she was killed here and her body dragged about 100 meters.

491
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,970
To the sewer.

492
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,300
Why?

493
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,670
I know right. Why?

494
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:32,270
Why did he bother doing that?

495
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,940
The mood is savage. Hurry and move onto the next one.

496
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,420
I'm sweating because I'm nervous.

497
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,820
Oh? My sleeve is ripped at the armpit.

498
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,760
I better use this thread and needle to sew it up.

499
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:05,300
Ow, this rip is pretty big.

500
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,120
Hold on.

501
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,140
I'm hungry. Is there anything I can eat?

502
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,300
There isn't, Mr. Magician.

503
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,120
Then I better at least eat this thread.

504
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,300
What is he doing?

505
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,290
It really disappeared.

506
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,290
Now that I'm full, let's continue—

507
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,830
I'm sorry. Oh, here?

508
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,830
Ohhh...

509
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,040
Aigoo. Aigoo.

510
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,640
You were so good!

511
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,290
   

512
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,750
Have a seat.

513
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,320
What?

514
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,100
Oh, really.

515
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,650
What are you doing?

516
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,510
The body was found in this exact position.

517
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,390
It's an obscene gesture so this is a little embarrassing.

518
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:34,360
Look at where the finger is pointing.

519
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,840
A building. I think it's a church.

520
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,200
The cross.

521
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,530
The killer was giving the finger to the cross.

522
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,750
You said her ring was gone. So maybe her finger was bent when he took her ring off.

523
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,380
Follow me.

524
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,410
Today's highlight. The world-famous magician

525
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,650
David Copperfield would cry if he saw this.

526
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:07,960
I will show you the best magic.

527
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,670
Ah, can someone help me with this one?

528
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,530
- Me, me! 
 - Ah, yes.

529
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,480
Can I put this on you?

530
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,790
- Handcuffs? Such bad vibes. 
 - I apologize.

531
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,890
- All right, fine. 
 - Yes.

532
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,630
This person will disappear like smoke.

533
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,720
Alright.

534
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,250
Sure enough...

535
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,850
Ta-da!

536
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:54,210
I knew it!

537
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,770
Why is he still here? One more time.

538
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,180
Now he will really disappear!

539
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,090
There.

540
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,920
I will open now.

541
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,330
Tada!

542
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,910
- What is that? 
 - What is that?

543
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:28,420
Look!

544
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:33,960
- Uh!  Uh! 
 - What is that? 
    

545
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,390
Okay, come behind me and take a look.

546
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:12,460
When I got here, the corpse's hands were tied behind like this.

547
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,960
- As expected, with the finger pointing. 
 - Wasn't the corpse found burnt?

548
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,600
Even though the corpse was found burnt black, the finger was pointing, meaning the finger bone was bent.

549
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,710
And on top of that, apparently Song Soo Ho didn't even wear a ring, which means that the finger was bent on purpose.

550
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,490
Here, take a look.

551
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,510
The marks from the chair being dragged is under the soot, not on top of the soot.

552
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,560
That means the chair was moved before the body was burned, right?

553
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,620
When I got here, that window was open.

554
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,970
According to the gym members, they never opened that window because the lock was broken.

555
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,590
Then, the culprit opened it?

556
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:49,980
Okay, take a look at where my finger is pointing again.

557
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,660
See?

558
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,120
The cross!

559
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:09,700
Yes, the culprit opened the window and moved the chair so that the cross can be seen from that angle.

560
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,740
So that he can give the finger!

561
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:17,590
Then lit Song Soo Ho's body on fire, as if to show it to the cross.

562
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:21,140
There is another commonality between the two cases, prizes of war.

563
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,360
The toy ring missing from Byeon Sun Yeong's finger?

564
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,760
It was a gift her daughter bought for her from a bookstore for her birthday.

565
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,430
There was nothing taken from Song Soo Ho though, right? I didn't see anything in the investigative report.

566
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,190
There was something we missed.

567
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,900
There is something missing from here.  Find it.

568
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,840
How would I know?

569
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,970
Something precious.

570
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,490
Perhaps those gloves?

571
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,320
They say that even until the day before his death,

572
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,570
Song Soo Ho wore these gloves to spar.

573
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:06,590
His sister, Song Soo Jung, died in the hands of the headhunter on the day she bought those gloves.

574
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:13,460
Because those gloves had that kind of story behind them, he apparently cherished them like his own life.

575
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:20,380
Taking prizes of war means the culprit of these two cases is a very dangerous psychopath.

576
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,790
That kind of human thinks he's hunting other people.

577
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:29,210
Even now, he may be hunting a human somewhere.

578
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,870
Is he dead?

579
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:38,310
What is that! Why?

580
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,380
What on earth?

581
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,510
Chi... Chi... Chi Kook!

582
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:47,980
Help! Please help!

583
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,480
Correctional Officer Na is injured badly.  I think you need to come to the auditorium fast.

584
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,460
Hey, looks like someone got hurt. I will go see and be back.

585
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,020
What in the world? Please help!

586
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,760
Is he dead?

587
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,130
- Please turn the lights on! Lights! 
 - Please turn the lights on!

588
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:09,960
- Doctor!  Doctor! 
 - I've already called the doctor!

589
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:20,750
Dang it!

590
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,590
Please help!

591
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,020
Hey, you!

592
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:34,200
Bring me the needle and thread. You used them during your magic act, didn't you?

593
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,410
Yes.

594
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,220
 Please let me live! 

595
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:51,710
 That's him, the Headhunter. 

596
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,610
D-Don't touch!  Move away!  I said move away!

597
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:57,590
- Why isn't the doctor coming? Please hurry up and call the doctor! 
 - Here, here!

598
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:02,020
- Here! 
 - Hurry, hurry!

599
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,030
- I... It looks like he needs to be moved to a big hospital.
 - There is a lot of bleeding from the brainstem.  Unless treated now, he will die.

600
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:11,090
Ahhh! I am not a specialist in that area so I am not so sure...

601
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,950
Are you going to entrust him?

602
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:18,520
Oh well, I was going to put my rusty hands to work for once...

603
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,790
Please do it for him.

604
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,210
F-Father.

605
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,070
F-Father, don't you know who he is?

606
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:36,020
Let's entrust him. He is the only person here

607
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,800
who can save Chi Kook.

608
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,170
Turn him over.

609
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:55,010
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

610
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:12,770
So, to summarize, a psychopath, who really hates God, religion, or the cross,

611
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,480
hunted down Song Soo Ho and Byeon Sun Yeong mercilessly, right?

612
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,780
No.

613
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,440
- There is a definite motive for murder for Song Soo Ho.
 - A motive for murder?

614
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,680
Song Soo Ho burned to death but according to the autopsy report, there was evidence of multiple fractures

615
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,030
to his skull, ribs, femurs, all over his body.

616
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:38,120
That means he was beaten severely prior to his death.

617
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:43,030
That punk picked the areas where a person would feel the most pain and gave a beating.

618
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:49,030
It would've been incredibly painful since even the cartilage was torn off.

619
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:53,270
 - Please kill me.  
 - It was so painful,

620
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:59,780
that he probably begged to be killed but the punk did not listen to Song Soo Ho's plea.

621
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:06,480
He watched until the end, until the last breath was taken in pain.

622
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,780
The motive for Song Soo Ho's murder is revenge, filled with anger.

623
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,210
Revenge? Do you have any proof?

624
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,420
I found something conclusive.

625
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:46,240
According to the result of analysis, the blood was mixed that of Song Soo Ho's.

626
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,850
You are saying that the blood had dripped from Song Soo Ho's mouth, right?

627
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,000
That's right.

628
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,690
He had placed it on Song Soo Ho's knees. Why do you think he did that?

629
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:58,040
To show Song Soo Ho those passages from the Bible?

630
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,190
Maybe even made him read it himself.

631
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:05,970
 ''An eye for an eye...'' 

632
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,740
Take him over there.

633
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,020
- Right index finger! 
 - That's the severed finger, right?

634
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,790
- Left middle finger! 
 - There is only one finger.

635
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:30,520
- Two fingers were severed. Please find one more and bring it. 
 - I will find it and bring it.

636
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:37,300
After killing Song Soo Ho,

637
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:42,620
he put it back here. Placing it upside down probably was not a simple mistake.

638
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:48,090
He either wanted it discovered or enjoyed watching to see whether it gets discovered or not.

639
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,740
   

640
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:55,300
"A fracture for a fracture, a tooth for a tooth..."

641
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:03,570
According to this, the culprit did to Song Soo Ho exactly what Song Soo Ho did, right?

642
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:07,260
Did Song Soo Ho burn someone related to the culprit to death?

643
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,380
I am not sure about that.

644
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:12,610
Everyone said that Song Soo Ho can't even kill an ant.

645
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,640
No one knows the inner thoughts of a person.

646
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:19,730
Anyway, did you find him, Han Seo Joon's son?

647
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:21,020
What?

648
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,520
I asked you.

649
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,200
Uh, well, I reported it to the station manager,

650
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,030
but he wants to avoid inflammatory issues.

651
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:36,150
I am doing my own search as well anyway.

652
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,720
If you find him, then what are you going to do?  Are you going to harm him instead of Han Seo Joon or something?

653
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,330
I understand how you feel, Detective Go, but do you need to find his son?

654
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:47,810
What crime did the son commit?

655
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,900
"What crime did the son commit?"

656
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,710
Then, what crime did I commit?  At least that punk has a killer for a dad.

657
00:50:55,710 --> 00:51:00,190
My mom and dad were the kind of good people who could have lived properly even without any laws.

658
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:03,590
- No, what I mean is— 
 - I am going to make that punk's son live with

659
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:06,820
what I saw, what I can never forget, that horrible memory.

660
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:13,100
I am going to make that punk's son live with it, too.  That's only fair.  That's what "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" is.

661
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,860
- Detective Go. 
 - What?

662
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:21,100
You talk like that but you would have already found him if you wanted to.  You are not looking for him on purpose.

663
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:26,170
If you kill Han Seo Joon in front of his son, then there will be another Go Mu Chi, but you are going to do that?

664
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:29,180
Yeah, I am going to.

665
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:33,440
I am curious.

666
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,480
Where he is and what he's doing.

667
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:56,640
Why did you save me, why?  Why didn't you just let me follow my baby? Why did you save me?

668
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,320
Soo Ho!

669
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,860
Soo Ho!

670
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,640
If you want to die, next time, here, exactly here, cut it deep.

671
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,970
You have to cut it deeper than two centimeters to make sure or cut the artery.

672
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:20,510
If you want to cut the artery, you should just cut off the arm. That way you die for sure.

673
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:24,510
Doctor, your words are a bit—

674
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:28,720
- How can a doctor say...? 
  - Dong Gu, use words... 
 -  Leave me be!

675
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,530
Apologize right away to that person, you punk!

676
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:38,860
- What do I have to apologize for? 
 - This punk!

677
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,350
No, no, don't do it, Dong Gu.

678
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:43,400
Don't.

679
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,250
If it weren't for the fact that this is a hospital...

680
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:59,110
- My baby, Soo Ho. 
 - I am sorry.

681
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:04,100
- Who's the next patient? 
 - Ah, my baby!

682
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:10,440
I don't know very well,

683
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,380
but the doctor is probably feeling very bad as well so...

684
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:19,690
He probably said that so that you brace yourself and endure it.

685
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,300
Here, patient Na Chi Kook's finger!

686
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:27,750
- Surgery preparation for patient Na Chi Kook! Call the Neurosurgery Department and Orthopedics Department!
 - Where did you find it?

687
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,460
Behind the stage in the auditorium, in the corner.

688
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:33,450
- Thank you. 
 - Guardian, please sign the surgery consent form.

689
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:37,560
They are on their way from the province so I signed the consent form earlier.

690
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,670
They are saying that Doctor Park Gam Soo's surgery will go over the schedule by 30 minutes. What should I do?

691
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:45,190
It will be too late then. Doctor Seong Yo Han!

692
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,440
Yes.

693
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:52,950
I'll start on the surgery so assist me until the manager for the Neurosurgery Department comes.

694
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,640
I will get prepared.

695
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:58,640
Excuse me!  Perhaps a different doctor...

696
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,050
He has a lot of experience with patients with brain damage as well so please don't worry.

697
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:08,150
This punk is bold yet meticulous.

698
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,850
More than anything, he knows a lot about the human body structure.

699
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:16,360
He even knows where to cut to kill with a single cut, or to kill slowly.

700
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:23,050
 - It seems as if he might have studied human anatomy.  
 - Scalpel.

701
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:29,150
 He is very competent with a knife as well. 

702
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:44,310
   

703
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,430
   
   

704
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,410
How is our Chi Kook?

705
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:05,770
The surgery went well but he was in such critical condition, we should wait and see.

706
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:09,280
By the way, the emergency treatment was done very well.  Who's the medical staff at the prison?

707
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,040
Ah, there happened to be a prisoner who used to be a doctor.

708
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,780
- His name is Han Seo Joon. 
 - Han Seo Joon?

709
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,850
By Han Seo Joon, you mean...

710
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:20,670
that headhunter?

711
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:21,900
Yes.

712
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,330
Was he there?

713
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:26,940
It was fortunate.

714
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,500
They caught the culprit.

715
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,990
Really?

716
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,860
Who was it? Who did it?

717
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:49,140
Well... It was one of the inmates who follow Han Seo Joon.

718
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,170
He confessed that he did it to teach him a lesson

719
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:54,580
for disrespecting the headhunter.

720
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,470
We're checking whether Han Seo Joon ordered it.

721
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,280
I've got academy classes to go to today.

722
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,140
I'm hungry. Let's go eat something.

723
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,700
- Uh, what is this? 
 - It's raining.  Give me an umbrella.

724
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,170
- Let's just cross. 
 - Huh?

725
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,050
Come. It's going to rain.

726
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,920
Come quickly!

727
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:00,710
Why won't you pick up?

728
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:06,180
   

729
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,830
 I'll just cross it. 

730
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,160
   

731
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,230
No, don't! Please!

732
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:36,000
- Die! 
 - Stop!

733
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,290
- Grandma, it's me! 
 - Die, you scoundrel!

734
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,170
It's me, Officer Jung.

735
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:43,530
It's Officer Jung. It's me, grandma.

736
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,830
Gosh. What brings you here, Officer Jung?

737
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,620
Goodness, my child!

738
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,440
Come to your senses!

739
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:56,910
My poor baby!

740
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,500
- The puppy...
- What?

741
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,050
The p-p-puppy...

742
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:03,420
He left.

743
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,100
I chased that crappy dog away.

744
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,840
It's gone. It's okay now, baby.

745
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,390
It's all right now.

746
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:14,460
Grandma's sorry!

747
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,540
Grandma's sorry!

748
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,310
Look at her... Gosh.

749
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,170
I'm sorry. I called her but she didn't hear me.

750
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,660
I had no idea it was you.

751
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,550
And your bloody clothes

752
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,720
made me think in a bad way.

753
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:43,700
You're not injured, aren't you?

754
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,220
No, I'm fine.

755
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,000
You must feel terrible.

756
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,720
Your friend will recover soon,

757
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,330
so don't be too heartbroken, alright?

758
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,680
Alright.

759
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,560
Get back safe. I'll get going.

760
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,370
How can you go looking like that? Wash up at my place.

761
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:08,490
No, it's fine. I can take a shower at my place.

762
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,260
You can't go looking like this.

763
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:14,640
What if you run into the old ladies in the neighborhood?

764
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,860
They will have a heart attack and you will be lighting incense above their coffins.

765
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:21,000
- Come on in. 
 - No, it's fine.

766
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,790
- Come in and wash up. 
 - No, it's fine...

767
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:26,160
- But I can wash up at– 
 - Come on in.

768
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,100
Oh, let me help you.

769
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,740
Wow! It looks delicious!

770
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,580
Thank you!

771
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,300
How many times must I tell you

772
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,230
that I was held up making kimchi at Dong Gu's house?

773
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,070
How many times do I have to repeat it?

774
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,330
You were probably enjoying the pork that was served.

775
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:47,040
Look at the way she talks to me.

776
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,960
Whatever! There's nothing bad in me staying here

777
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,850
just to enjoy some pork.

778
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,810
You like to have it alone, don't you?

779
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:56,440
I like boiled pork too, you know!

780
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,450
Gosh.

781
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,070
What's wrong? Why aren't you digging in?

782
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,950
Is it because of your friend?

783
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:19,120
These are the times you need to eat well and be strong.

784
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,600
Because it'll make your friend recover fast.

785
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,080
Have some rolled omelet.

786
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,060
I made it with extra cheese

787
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:31,070
especially for you.

788
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:33,740
I actually don't really like it.

789
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:39,990
Wow! I love how you're enjoying the food. My goodness.

790
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:43,720
Everyone looks the same when they eat. How does he look different? What a bunch of bull.

791
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,280
Okay.

792
01:01:57,930 --> 01:01:59,780
Were you hurt?

793
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,230
This is a big wound. That looks painful.

794
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:10,470
This will get infected.

795
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,650
Why do you care if someone gets hurt or not?

796
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:18,270
- I won't eat. 
 - Hey, Bong Yi.

797
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:22,490
- This naughty girl. Are you not going to eat? 
  - No! 

798
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:25,010
Oh, this poopy girl.

799
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:28,880
Fine, you wench. A wench like you needs to experience hunger

800
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,820
to learn to be grateful...

801
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:34,880
Well...

802
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,540
Well,

803
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:42,720
she's not like that. My Bong Yi may act rude

804
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,810
but she's a very considerate girl.

805
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:49,180
- Eat up. Go on. 
 - Okay.

806
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,300
She's doing that

807
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,930
because she is embarrassed.

808
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:56,710
She is shy, you know.

809
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:58,840
She's shy? Why?

810
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,970
The man she likes is right in front of her.

811
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,700
So, of course,

812
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,200
and the man she likes grabs her hand.

813
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,560
So wouldn't she be embarrassed?

814
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,310
Elder, I don't think that is true at all.

815
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:14,970
But...

816
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,670
Have you thought about it, a little?

817
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,800
What I told you?

818
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,600
Grandmother, I could get arrested.

819
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,630
Please stop joking.

820
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:30,460
All the elders in the neighborhood are misunderstanding.

821
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:33,550
It's not a joke.

822
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:36,050
Think of how young Bong Yi is.

823
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,210
She is only 18.

824
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:40,420
Don't say she is younger than she is.

825
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:43,630
She is 19.

826
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:45,680
And my Bong Yi

827
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,440
may look skinny on the outside,

828
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,580
but she is a glamour girl.

829
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:51,550
Drama, did you say?

830
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:53,900
No, I mean, like this.

831
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,030
Look at me, glamour.

832
01:03:56,030 --> 01:04:01,450
They call it "S-line," don't they? She has curves in all the right places, so they call it "S-line," right?

833
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:03,860
I enjoyed the food. Grandma, I'll be on my way now.

834
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,570
I think I better go.

835
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:07,010
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

836
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:10,260
Put it on.

837
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,350
I'm not just saying this, okay?

838
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:15,320
Please give it a careful thought.

839
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:20,030
 So let's say he killed Song Soo Ho out of revenge. What about Byeon Sun Yeong? 

840
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:23,850
 I didn't sense any emotion from her murder. 

841
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:25,440
 It was random. 

842
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,210
 A pure psychopath, just like the headhunter. 

843
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:32,070
 I think his instincts have exploded. 

844
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:34,610
 Psychopath... 

845
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,550
 Daniel Lee? 

846
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:48,500
 Edmund Kemper shot his grandparents in their heads with a gun 
   

847
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,790
 and brutally murdered them with a knife. 

848
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:53,860
 He wondered what it felt like to kill his grandmother. 

849
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,070
 That was his response when asked about his reason for the murders. 

850
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:59,830
 After his first murder, his killing instincts that had been hidden were awakened. 

851
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:03,320
 For most psychopaths, their instincts remain dormant 

852
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,510
 and explodes at once due to a particular opportunity. 

853
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,930
 The criminal was motivated by revenge, although we don't know for what. 
   

854
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:13,700
 He murdered the boxing gym director due to personal vengeance. 

855
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,110
 And that awakened his murderous instincts. 

856
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:19,650
 After that, he randomly chose the restaurant employee as his victim. 

857
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:24,220
 The time between his murders will decrease, and his methods of killing will become bolder. 

858
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,060
 I think this is just the beginning of his killing spree. 

859
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:32,410
 In fact, he may have killed more than these two victims, but we do not know. 

860
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,030
 Last night, in a redevelopment area in Guho-dong, 

861
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:06,380
 a corpse of a homeless person in his 50s was found. 

862
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,530
 The police are currently investigating. 

863
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:11,180
 The corpse had decomposed significantly 

864
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,730
 so it is presumed that the victim died over 15 days ago. 

865
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:16,440
 Before it's too late, we must not eliminate 

866
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,990
 the possibility that these are victims of a serial killer as we investigate. 

867
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:22,550
 These killings won't stop. 

868
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:25,690
 If these were really the deeds of a psychopath, 

869
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:30,180
 at this very moment, he is hunting for his next prey. 

870
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,890
 I'm not feeling well today. 

871
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:39,200
 So today, I decided to pick easy prey. 

872
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,000
 Someone who is small like that one, 

873
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,570
 and someone you know is weak with just one look. 

874
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,860
 That's a perfect prey. 

875
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:50,740
 Of course, that the killer of the boxing gym director 

876
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,640
and the female employee are the same killer,

877
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,630
remains a hasty deduction.

878
01:06:56,630 --> 01:07:01,380
However, if the killer who killed the boxing gym director of Seokjin-dong

879
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,210
really did also kill the female found in the sewer in Geumshin-dong,

880
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:07,700
that if he really is a psychopathic serial killer,

881
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,560
so that no more innocent people are killed,

882
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,710
we must stop him.

883
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:16,490
One of the biggest serial killers of this era is the Zodiac Killer.

884
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:19,090
In the last letter that he sent to the news stations, 
    

885
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:21,470
this was written:

886
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:26,240
"Please help me. I cannot stop myself."

887
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,790
If the killer is a psychopath like the Zodiac Killer,

888
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:34,690
he may desperately want our help.

889
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:42,760
Thank you, everyone worked hard.

890
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,390
Zorro, where are you going?

891
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:57,460
Zorro, come here.

892
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,920
Where were you, Boy?

893
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,480
I don't think this work suits Police Officer Jung.

894
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,250
I know, right?

895
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:17,470
But that cat looks like it was done by that guy, right?

896
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:19,100
It has no teeth.

897
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,980
I know, it looks like it's been a while since it died.

898
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,590
But it's not happening as often lately, is it?

899
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:26,410
Maybe he moved away?

900
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:28,060
Hey, Officer Jung.

901
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,730
Yes?

902
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,330
If this is the way you act after seeing one dead cat,

903
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:35,730
you will freak out when you see a dead person.

904
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:37,470
I'm sorry, I will try harder.

905
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:39,170
Is this something you can achieve by trying?

906
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:42,400
In the cabinet in the office, there are flyers that are left over.

907
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,130
Hurry and go get those and post them all over the neighborhood.

908
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:51,960
Oh, that turtle, so slow. You better run!

909
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,930
Yes, sir.

910
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:58,450
 On the 13th last week, Miss A did not return home after going for a walk, so her family filed a missing persons report with the police. 

911
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:01,710
 But in the end, she was found as a cold corpse. 

912
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:04,790
How awful, goodness.

913
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:08,250
Girl, make sure to get home early.

914
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,260
How can a high school senior get home early?

915
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:13,500
You are so full of poop.

916
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,440
Eat quickly and wash up. You will be late to Catholic Church.

917
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:20,070
Today is Father Go's last mass at our church.

918
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:22,610
I heard that he was transferred to a church in Irae-dong.

919
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:25,300
I'm busy. I'm going to the library with friends.

920
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,840
Look at you.

921
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:30,550
Someone would think that you were at the top of your class or something.

922
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:36,160
And what if I was? Could you even pay to send me to college?

923
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,440
So do you rank last in your class all the time because you're thinking of me?

924
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,990
Aigoo, such a filial granddaughter. You are like Sim Cheong.

925
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:46,870
I won't ask you to study, but please at least graduate from high school

926
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:50,120
and figure out how to marry Police Officer Jung, please.

927
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:54,090
Don't be so bratty in front of him.

928
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:57,560
I'm so sick of this. Always talking about Officer Jung, every day.

929
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:00,370
Do you even know how much older he is than I am?

930
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:02,930
- What? 
 - Why are you trying to sell me off to such an old man?

931
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:04,230
Old man?

932
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:08,790
What are you talking about? Officer Jung is only in his 20s.

933
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:10,370
Yes, that's very old.

934
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:12,190
Let's be honest.

935
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,460
Where will you find husband material like him?

936
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,540
He's like a peeled chestnut.

937
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:19,470
He's so cute and handsome, isn't he?

938
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:22,420
What chestnut? He's so pale.

939
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:25,130
His kind doesn't require any weapons.

940
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:27,800
One blow of my hand and he is finished, Grandma.

941
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,600
Girl, is that all that's in your head?

942
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,390
Search 50,000 places, see if you can find a better husband.

943
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:38,980
Good-natured, handsome, and well-mannered.

944
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:41,590
And that Good Citizen Award or something?

945
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:43,990
He even won that, I heard.

946
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:47,020
That time I fell trying to chase that pig, Officer Jung showed up

947
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:50,320
and carried me on his back and ran like the wind.

948
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:55,130
If not for Officer Jung, I would be eating in the afterworld now.

949
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,340
So why did he run like the wind?

950
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,640
If he just called 911, they would come.

951
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,610
People have to work their bodies if their brains are dumb. That's how it is.

952
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:05,320
This naughty girl.

953
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,160
They say not to bother even a dog if he is eating! Why are you hitting me?

954
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,530
A dog at least

955
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:13,920
wags its tail and is happy to see you, girl!

956
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:18,350
Talking about Officer Jung, every single day.

957
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,270
Uh Bung Yi. Uh Bung Yi, Uh Bung Yi.

958
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:29,060
Uh Bung Yi, hold on.

959
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:33,630
Pronounce my name properly before I pull your tongue out and use it as a jump rope.

960
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:36,900
It's not Uh Bung Yi; it's Oh. Bong Yi. Oh Bong Yi.

961
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:42,180
I understand. Show your friends at school, and ask them to please contact me if they saw anything.

962
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,730
You still haven't caught him?

963
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:47,030
You guys eat and play with our taxes, don't you?

964
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:51,590
You can't find a crazy guy who kills cats and pulls out its teeth? For months?

965
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:54,840
There aren't any witnesses, so...

966
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,930
And this.

967
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:02,400
If you don't treat it, it will get infected.

968
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:07,880
Mind your own business.

969
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,560
Hey.

970
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,540
Elder.

971
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:26,590
Yes, did my Grandson-in-law call me?

972
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:29,020
Get on, let me give you a ride.

973
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:32,290
Unfortunately, I don't think I can attend mass today.

974
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:36,060
I will take you there and then I have to go see Chi Kook.

975
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,430
Father will be sad.

976
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:41,030
He likes you so much, Officer Jung.

977
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:44,310
But Elder, are you hurt somewhere?

978
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:48,800
No, my leg fell asleep.

979
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:53,220
Hold on.

980
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:59,300
Elder, this...

981
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,420
What's wrong?

982
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:07,420
You fell when you went to get Bong Yi, didn't you? Is that why you came so late?

983
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,420
About that...

984
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:14,920
Bong Yi didn't know that, and thought you were late because you were eating boiled pork.

985
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,160
Don't tell her about this.

986
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:22,000
If she knows I got hurt, she will become concerned. Understand?

987
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:28,470
Elder, try moving it a little.

988
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:29,630
Can you step on this?

989
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:31,350
No, it hurts.

990
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:32,930
Okay, I'm done.

991
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:37,730
I think your bones are okay, but your tendons are stretched.

992
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:40,390
You got hurt here, too.

993
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:43,850
If you don't put antiseptic on it, it will get infected.

994
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:48,360
This is making me upset.

995
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,090
This will sting.

996
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:59,210
Isn't this cute?

997
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:02,120
This is Goat Man. He's the "president."

998
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,330
Very popular among the kids.

999
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:06,630
Elder, if you wear this,

1000
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:10,820
you will become the most fashionable in this neighborhood.

1001
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:13,950
What? A goat makes me... What?

1002
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,390
Going around beating you up?

1003
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:22,510
Next time, I'll go.

1004
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:23,580
Go where?

1005
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,560
I'll go to get Bong Yi when it rains.

1006
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:31,300
So Elder, just stay at home.

1007
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,630
How can I ask you to do that?

1008
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:37,470
You're busy enough with your job.

1009
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:41,230
No. My job is to serve citizens.

1010
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:44,700
Bong Yi is a citizen and so are you, Elder.

1011
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,130
Is that right?

1012
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:51,790
Then, until my leg gets better, I will ask you to help me.

1013
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:54,300
Yes.

1014
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:59,390
But why can't Bong Yi cross bridges when it rains?

1015
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:07,080
About that... My Bong Yi, you see,

1016
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,940
she is afraid of a lot of things, unlike how she looks.

1017
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:16,200
So she's afraid of being swept away by the river when it rains.

1018
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,660
- She's scared... 
 - What?

1019
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:20,720
Oh, really.

1020
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,520
But at that time, Bong Yi...

1021
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,820
 Puppy... 

1022
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,120
 Puppy. 

1023
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,000
I think she mentioned a puppy? What was that about?

1024
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,860
Puppy?

1025
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:37,550
About that... When Bong Yi was little,

1026
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:43,790
she lost her puppy that she had been raising. So she went to look for it.

1027
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,140
Oh, I'll be late.

1028
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:49,920
Yes, let's go, Elder.

1029
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,920
You are the same as him!

1030
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,560
A petition to save him?

1031
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,760
Please let him go and talk. Why are you doing this to our Father?

1032
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,930
The bastard who killed...

1033
01:15:56,930 --> 01:16:00,840
How can you say that you forgive him? On a broadcast?

1034
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:01,850
Who are you to forgive him?

1035
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:04,450
Are you alright, Father?

1036
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:07,890
Sister, please comfort her.

1037
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:10,290
- Okay. 
  - Forgiveness isn't meant for such things. 

1038
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:11,420
 Am I not right? 

1039
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:14,390
Father, do you believe in God?

1040
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:18,490
Why are you like this

1041
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:20,830
Bong Yi, it's been a long time.

1042
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:23,970
So do you believe in God?

1043
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:28,370
Of course. When our hearts are with God,

1044
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:31,100
God listens to our prayers.

1045
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:36,890
When we are suffering, God saves us.

1046
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:41,500
But He didn't. He didn't save me.

1047
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:49,760
So that person you believe in, I don't care for Him.

1048
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,770
Where is it?

1049
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:08,530
What? Today is my day off.

1050
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:12,050
Huh?

1051
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:21,000
   

1052
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:39,440
 Baby girl! 

1053
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,940
 I'll see you next time. 

1054
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:59,790
You're Dr. Seong Yo Han, right?

1055
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:03,860
There is someone who wants to see you.

1056
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:49,130
Song Soo Ho's gloves. Byeon Sun Yeong's ring.

1057
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,330
And you told me that the homeless guy was missing his shoe, right?

1058
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:55,730
We confirmed that the shoe belonged to him.

1059
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:58,230
But whose watch is this?

1060
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:15,000
Number 4440. Visitation.

1061
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:22,550
You said you wanted to see me?

1062
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:31,600
I was curious

1063
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,810
to see how my son grew up.

1064
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:49,820
There is no church, not even a cross.

1065
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:52,960
 No sign of the body having been moved. 

1066
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,020
Stop!

1067
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:24,830
He drew a cross in there and put the finger in...

1068
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:32,320
Let's go.

1069
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:12,550
   

1070
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,330
 At the crime scene 

1071
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:25,760
 boxing gym director A and restaurant employee B who were killed recently 

1072
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:29,720
 and unidentified homeless person C, their personal items were found, causing great shock. 

1073
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,860
 The police have ruled that these are serial killings 

1074
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:37,260
 and will continue their investigation by forming a special task force. 

1075
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:40,660
 Mom told me 

1076
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:46,020
 that there was one more child besides me who was carrying the monster gene. 

1077
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:50,100
 At the crime scene, aside from the personal items of four victims, a men's wristwatch was also found. 

1078
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:54,770
 So the police believes that there is another victim, and taking this into account as they investigate. 

1079
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:58,070
 I was always curious. 

1080
01:22:58,070 --> 01:23:02,360
 What happened to that child? 

1081
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:13,430
 Did he become a predator like me? 

1082
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:18,320
 Or did he become a normal person, different from me? 

1083
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:34,190


1084
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:46,460
   

1085
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:48,870
 Yesterday, I... It's not that, Bong Yi, I— 

1086
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:51,040
 You think I did that because I really like you, don't you? 

1087
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:51,810
 Bong Yi. 

1088
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:56,380
 An adult man was in there. It must have been quite heavy. Go in. 

1089
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:59,290
 Me? Ah, yes. 

1090
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:01,630
 Chi Kook's watch was found at the crime scene. 

1091
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:04,420
 What? Whose watch? 

1092
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:06,040
 What's this? Ouch! 

1093
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:10,200
 I want to learn from you, Detective. Please include me in this investigation. 

1094
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,130
 How did they know? This is still a confidential investigation. 

1095
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,900
 Detective? What is this?
