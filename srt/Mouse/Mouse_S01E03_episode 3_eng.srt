2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,960
   

3
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,610
So the eldest son was on the list of suspects?

4
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,490
Yes.

5
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,700
But he was later removed from the list of suspects?

6
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,140
Yes, the truth is that I found him very suspicious. So unofficially

7
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,020
I even did a lie detector test on him, and he passed without any problems.

8
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,610
Were you not aware that lie detectors do not detect the lies of psychopaths?

9
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,430
What? So are you saying the little kid was a psychopath or something?

10
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,400
Well, that's not what I meant.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,140
I meant that he should not have been eliminated as a possibility since the culprit was never caught.

12
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,640
No way!

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,860
Would an 11-year-old really kill his entire family?

14
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,000
   

15
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,620
 He victimized 20 people and pushed the entire nation into a crucible of fear. 

16
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,560
 The nightmare of the Headhunter murders is being rekindled 25 years later. 

17
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,650
   

18
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,380
   

19
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,920
Oh, where...?

20
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,600
Mi Jeong! Mi Jeong!

21
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,680
Ah! Mi Jeong! Ah!

22
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,940
Ah, Mi Jeong!

23
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,380
   

24
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,550
I've decided on you, you psychopath bastard.

25
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,280
Bok Sil?

26
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,620
Bok Sil, let's eat—

27
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,050
Long time no see.

28
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,740
   

29
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,970
I saw you on TV recently.

30
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,160
Ah, yes.

31
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,520
I received a request for an interview, so I decided to visit Korea.

32
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,690
And I had some personal questions for you as well.

33
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,550
Your son?

34
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,780
Yes.

35
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,010
He grew up very well.

36
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,090
I'm sorry but I need to go back to work at my shop now.

37
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,270
I'm sorry to take up your time when you are busy.

38
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,860
But what happened to the dog?

39
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,120
My son saved its life when it was a puppy and was near death.

40
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,010
My son has had such a kind nature since he was young.

41
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,480
He cannot just pass anyone by, even animals.

42
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,720
Then...

43
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,680
You were wrong, Professor.

44
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,690
   

45
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,530
Yes, PD Choi?

46
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,430
What?

47
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,790
 The personal belongings of boxing gym director A, restaurant employee B 

48
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,780
 and unidentified homeless person C, who were all recently murdered, were found at the crime scene causing great shock. 

49
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,920
 The police have ruled that these are serial killings 

50
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,170
 and will continue their investigation by forming a special task force. 

51
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,240
 At the crime scene, other than the items belonging to the four victims, a man's watch was found, 

52
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,890
 so the police is continuing the investigation presuming that there is an additional victim. 

53
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,730
 Dr. Seong Yo Han, please come to the Emergency Center right away. 

54
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:17,280
 Dr. Seong Yo Han, please come to the Emergency Center right away. 

55
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,640
- Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me.

56
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,510
- Excuse me. 
 - Hello.

57
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,650
May I ask which department Dr. Seong Yo Han works in?

58
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,310
Save him! You had better immediately save our Hyeong-nim!

59
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,750
Hey...

60
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,050
Hey, what did you just do?

61
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,120
   

62
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,510
Hey, you had better do this properly.

63
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,860
I'm quite good with a knife, too.

64
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,940
How dare you threaten a gangster?

65
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,520
This will be faster than getting stabbed in the side.

66
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,800
The carotid artery is in there, so if you got stabbed there, your blood will spurt like a fountain.

67
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,750
So if I pull out this needle at the same time, we can enjoy a double fountain show.

68
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,830
Such an image will leave quite an impression.

69
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,950
Make way, ambulance!

70
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,850
PD Choi Hong Ju?

71
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,920
Oxygen mask.

72
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,220
Begin the aqueous solution IV.

73
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,210
- Please, save her. 
 - Please leave the room.

74
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,440
You cannot be here, please go out.

75
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,320
Get out, hurry.

76
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,830
What happened?

77
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,470
I was investigating the Song Soo Ho case and found her drowning in the village's local reservoir.

78
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,220
You will get a cold.

79
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,750
Wow, you are soaking wet.

80
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,730
The medical treatment went well, but you are aware that she habitually attempts suicide, aren't you?

81
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,660
She will attempt it again soon.

82
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,040
What a rude!

83
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,530
But it's such a relief that you found her, PD Choi.

84
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,570
Don't bother.

85
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,700
Why? Is it smelly?

86
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,790
Yes, it is.

87
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,670
Really?

88
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,910
But I only wore this for 15 days.

89
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,820
 Eat your meals on time and drop drinking already. 

90
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,450
 My poor Su Jeong! 

91
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,620
 Su Jeong! 

92
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,870
 Aigoo, what can I do for my Su Jeong? 

93
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,700
 Aiyoo! 

94
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,320
 You are aware that she habitually attempts suicide, aren't you? 

95
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,640
 She will attempt it again soon. 

96
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,450
- I'm leaving. 
 - Okay! 
    

97
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,670
Oh, Father!

98
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,440
- Did you go somewhere? 
 - Yes.

99
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,300
I went to church to say goodbye because I couldn't attend to your final mass, but you weren't there.

100
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,830
He probably packed food and took it to his little brother again.

101
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,880
Your brother who is a detective?

102
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,150
Yes. How is Chi Kook doing?

103
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,390
Not awake yet.

104
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:12,320
All of the neighbors gathered today to pray for him, so he will awaken soon.

105
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,190
Of course. So when will you move to the church in Irae-dong?

106
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,350
Starting tomorrow.

107
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,450
But I wasn't able to pack everything at the church, so I will return for a few more days.

108
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,420
- Please get in. I will give you a ride. 
 - Let's do that.

109
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,600
- Oh right, Officer Jung! 
 - Yes?

110
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,210
Aigoo, that? What? What was again?

111
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,220
- You said you needed those signatures or something, to increase patrols, didn't you? 
 - Yes.

112
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,680
My husband is home today because it's Sunday, so get his signature.

113
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,110
- Is he? 
 - Yes.

114
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,840
He's not drunk, is he?

115
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,170
Please have a seat, I'll be right back.

116
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,680
Alright, go ahead.

117
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,730
Mu Chi.

118
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,450
I told you not to bring over things like these, didn't I?

119
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,630
How many times have I told you that I severed ties with you?

120
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,860
How can brothers sever ties?

121
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,460
If mom and dad knew we are like this—

122
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,150
How can you be so shameless as to speak of mom and dad?

123
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,620
Mu Chi, please.

124
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:14,390
I've thought about it 100 times, 10,000 times, 10,000,000 times,

125
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,420
but for the life of me, I can't understand you.

126
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,430
How can you forgive the punk who killed mom and dad, and made you this way? How?

127
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,790
You punk. To be honest, I hate you more than that punk Han Seo Joon.

128
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,760
How will you face mom and dad when you die?

129
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,740
 At the scene of the crime, other than the items belonging to the four victims, there was a man's watch left behind as well, 

130
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,840
 so the police are presuming that there is another victim. 

131
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,100
Father! Father!

132
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,730
It's not him!

133
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,800
What are you talking about, "It's not him?"

134
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,240
They say that Chi Kook's watch was found at the crime scene.

135
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,310
You know... that grape farm crime scene.

136
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,750
What?

137
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,690
Whose watch is it?

138
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,710
It's right, isn't it?

139
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,900
How many times do I have to say it?

140
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,990
I am telling you because that punk disrespected our Headhunter, so I just stabbed him.

141
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,010
You had undressed him down to his underwear, so what did you do with Na Chi Kook's clothes?

142
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,510
I said I burned them.  It should be written there, there.

143
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,770
What about the weapon?  You couldn't have burned the weapon, right?

144
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,600
I am not going to tell you. Find it yourself.

145
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,180
So that I can see how competent our nation's police are.

146
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,570
It's probably more like you are not able to tell me, not that you don't want to tell me.

147
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,690
Because you didn't do it.

148
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,520
I am telling you that I stabbed that punk.

149
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,010
Then you are the one who killed all of them: the gym owner, the female employee, the homeless person and the female college student, right?

150
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,660
You sure are skillful, you punk, when you can't even take a single step out of this place!

151
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,860
What are you talking about?

152
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,990
What I am saying is that this watch which belongs to Na Chi Kook, whom you tried to kill, was in the deceased female college student's hand.

153
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,340
How could this watch have ended up all the way there and in her hand?

154
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,090
Does the watch have feet or something?

155
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,540
Wait, are those, in the middle, feet?

156
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:08,250
Do you think that punk, Han Seo Joon, will compliment you if you say you did it?

157
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,660
Just go and kiss that monster's ass, you punk.

158
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,720
- Go ahead and move the patient to the in-patient ward.
 - Yes, Doctor.

159
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,100
- Yes. 
  - Mr. Seong Yo Han? 

160
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,540
- Who is this? 
  - Mr. Han Seo Joon's son? 

161
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,300
There is something I need to speak to you about, in regard to the recent murder cases.

162
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,720
   

163
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,970
Alright, I will see you then.

164
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,900
   

165
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,540
Okay, attention!  We have not been able to find the victim's clothes and the weapon used for the crime yet.

166
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,480
Until now, we have focused the search on the inside of the correctional facility, but from now we will expand the search

167
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,440
to include the inside and outside of this facility, and all areas where visitors can come and go.

168
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,990
We will search again. Begin!

169
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,040
Begin!

170
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,590
Detective, if outside entry and exit were possible, wouldn't he have taken it out immediately that day?

171
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,930
They say outside visitors were searched thoroughly,

172
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:14,260
so it would have been difficult to take it out.  It's highly likely that it's inside here, either hidden or gotten rid of.

173
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,360
Let's say that's what has  happened to the weapon, but why is it so important to find Chi Kook's clothes?

174
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,660
Based on the culprit's murder pattern, up until now, there wasn't a case where the victim was disrobed.

175
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:28,440
The fact that only Na Chi Kook was disrobed means that there is conclusive evidence left on the clothes.

176
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,310
   

177
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,910
Uh, how did you do it?

178
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,910
There is a diagonal mirror in here.

179
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,710
So have a person go inside the space behind the mirror,

180
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,910
- and show the audience the different space that is reflected by the mirror and looks empty. 
 - I got it.

181
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,650
- So, from this space that should have been empty, Na Chi Kook came out, right? 
 - That's right.

182
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,610
That means he was already inside.

183
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,280
An adult male was inside, so it should have been quite heavy.  You didn't notice it?

184
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,170
The magic box itself is quite heavy...

185
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,550
Ah, but even with someone weighing over 100 kilograms inside,

186
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,500
it rolls fine since these wheels are specially made.

187
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,310
- Try going inside it. 
 - Me?

188
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,220
Ah, sure.

189
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,400
 One, two, three, go! 

190
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,410
 Good. 

191
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,550
 You are coming to watch the show later, right? 

192
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,850
 I don't think I can come.  The general affairs section asked me to help with some paperwork. 

193
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,490
 I think Dong Koo would be upset. 

194
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,180
 Let's get together later for a drink, okay? 

195
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,770
 Okay. Do well today. Don't get intimidated. 

196
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,720
 - Okay. Work hard. 
 - Okay. 

197
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,510
 I think that was around noon. 

198
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,790
As soon as I entered, I put it here in this corner

199
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,820
so that it wouldn't get in the way of the members.

200
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,280
Did you leave the box unattended at any time?

201
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,780
Other than when I was on the stage, no. 
    

202
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,140
Then all the other members were together as well.  
   

203
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,130
Ah, we did leave the box unattended while we were having lunch.

204
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,990
Ah, that's right.

205
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,670
- All of you left? 
 - Yes.

206
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,010
They said the cafeteria was about to close so we were told to come down in a hurry. 
    

207
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,520
- I led everyone down and I checked to make sure everyone was present as well. 
 - How long were you gone?

208
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:23,240
Excluding the traveling time, about 30 minutes, since we ate lunch and drank coffee as well.

209
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,170
Aren't there any CCTVs in here?

210
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,120
Since outside visitors use this as a dressing room, there were complaints.

211
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,540
Let's see.

212
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,770
When did the society members arrive at the cafeteria?

213
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,900
Since it was after our correctional officers had their lunch, it was probably around 1:00 p.m.

214
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,050
1:10 p.m. 1:10 p.m.

215
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,050
How about when they are coming out?

216
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,670
Stop! Slowly.

217
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,060
One, two, three.

218
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,270
Stop!

219
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,330
1:40 p.m.

220
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,160
Thirty minutes to eat.

221
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,610
Twenty minutes round trip from the auditorium to the cafeteria, thirty minutes to eat, a total of fifty minutes.

222
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,170
Enough time to move the body to the box after the crime...

223
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,260
Plenty of time.

224
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,700
Victim's navy blue uniform and a knife, a knife!

225
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,730
What is he doing?

226
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,530
What are you doing?  I told you to leave a while ago.

227
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,910
The culprit, you know...

228
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:08,040
I heard that he loathes God so he moved the corpses to where a cross is visible and positioned them so as to give the finger to the cross, right?

229
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,900
But not with Chi Kook, right?  Why is it different only for Chi Kook?

230
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,910
I don't understand that part either.

231
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,260
Come at me!

232
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,870
Hey, get up! Hey!

233
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,140
Come.

234
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,440
Why are you looking at me like that?

235
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,780
Are you okay?

236
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,440
I heard a lot about you from Father.

237
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,990
But this is the first time I've actually met you.

238
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,400
- Are you sure you are meeting me for the first time? 
 - Pardon?

239
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,300
What happened to that bird?

240
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,040
Bird?

241
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,370
 Do you have a death wish? 

242
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,370
Ah, that time!

243
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,590
I am sorry. You were really startled, right?

244
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,430
I still have it at my place. It's almost all healed.

245
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:58,820
It's a damned lucky bird. If it had met someone like me, it would have already been dead.

246
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,340
Father bragged about you so much.

247
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,210
That you are admirable, righteous,

248
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,220
- and an extremely competent detec— 
 - Don't talk about that guy.

249
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,880
That's why...

250
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,340
- I want to learn from you, Detective. 
 - What?

251
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,380
Please let me be a part of this case investigation.

252
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,670
I want to help catch the punk who did that to Chi Kook however I can.

253
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,850
Ah, you said you are a police officer, right?

254
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,970
Yes, I work at the Gudong police substation.  I am still a rookie.

255
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:34,300
Do you think that patrolling a neighborhood is the same as catching a serial killer?

256
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,260
But, when I think about Chi Kook,

257
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,770
I don't think it's right for me to just sit back and do nothing.

258
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,610
- Have you ever met a psychopath? 
 - Pardon?

259
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,670
It's far worse than you can imagine.

260
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:55,670
A nice kid like you can't even imagine, a terrible monster.

261
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,160
Someone like me, who has nothing to lose,

262
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,210
and only has evil left inside, should face those punks.

263
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,740
   

264
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,830
Look at what time it is.

265
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,800
You said you were going to the library, but you went to a comic shop instead?

266
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,970
That's my business.

267
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,950
How is your hand? Is it alright?

268
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,410
Why are your hands so cold?

269
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,770
Do you want to die?

270
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,670
This won't do. Let's go.

271
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,050
Where?

272
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,070
- Let's just go. 
 - Where? Let me go.

273
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,950
Can't we just go at once?

274
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,280
Let me go. Are you crazy? Hey!

275
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,480
Why can't you eat? Scoop it up.

276
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,630
You should eat hot food to make you warmer.

277
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,880
Here, mix it in like this.

278
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,280
Officer Jung.

279
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,990
Officer Jung with an honorific, please.

280
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,270
Or you can call me Ba Reum Oppa.

281
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:22,630
Can I marry you, Officer Jung?

282
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,800
I will do well. I cook well—

283
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,910
I mean, I  will  cook well and I will clean well.

284
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:39,310
If you want me to go out and work and earn money, I will.

285
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,450
Although I can't do that now.

286
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,090
You... Has something happened to you?

287
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,560
Nothing happened, so just answer me.

288
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:04,930
You are like a cute little sister to me.

289
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,000
Hurry and eat.

290
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,010
What a crappy way to reject someone.

291
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,980
Bong Yi? Bong Yi?

292
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,980
  

293
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,350
   

294
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,660
   

295
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,760
   

296
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,010
What about Song Soo Ho's mother?

297
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,240
- They moved her to another room at the hospital. 
 - Ah, I see.

298
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,920
What did you mean when you said that the one who attempted murderer on that prison guard is the murderer of Song Soo Ho?

299
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,620
How did you know about that? That's still a secret investigation.

300
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,750
Did you again...?

301
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,840
- You're here, PD Choi. How about a cup of mixed coffee? 
 - Call.

302
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,090
Look at you. You never even gave me a cup of dirty water before.

303
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,860
Co– Coffee, coffee, coffee...

304
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,980
Where are you going?

305
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,750
   

306
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,180
   

307
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,000
Jo Mi Jeong.

308
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,440
 What's this? 

309
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,600
 Do you want me to get your revenge? 

310
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,910
 Alright. 

311
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:08,170
 When he's out of prison, I'll kill him. 

312
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,370
 It's a promise. 

313
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,920
It must've been that child. But why'd she come?

314
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,600
   

315
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,560
   

316
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,410
   

317
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,430
   

318
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,610
   

319
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,290
Why are you looking up this bastard's name again?

320
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,540
Here you go, PD Choi.

321
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,530
Thank you.

322
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:45,080
That's the last coffee mix we had in here.

323
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,190
Hey! Where'd you get that?

324
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,500
This? It was on your desk.

325
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,160
You rich brat.

326
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,010
That was evidence Jo Mi Jeong's hand was holding when she was found dead!

327
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,750
Gosh, it's hot! You fool!

328
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,510
Hey there.

329
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,820
- Where'd you come from?   - Uh Bung! 

330
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,860
Uh Bung!

331
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,580
Hey, didn't I tell you I'd pull your tongue out?

332
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,240
Oh Bong Yi. It's not Uh Bung Yi.

333
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,410
You weren't the one I was calling.

334
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,720
This bird's name is Uh Bung Yi.

335
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,600
Uh Bung Yi.

336
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,260
Uh Bung Yi.

337
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,650
- What? 
 - Stay still.

338
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,480
- So this is your bird? 
 - Yeah.

339
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,260
No!

340
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,780
- Is it on my head? 
 - Yeah.

341
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,940
Hold still for a second.

342
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,030
It hurt its leg, you see.

343
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,650
I let it fly thinking it was alright, but I think it needs more time.

344
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,170
- Let's go already. 
 - Wait. Wait a minute.

345
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,950
I think Uh Bung Yi likes you.

346
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,070
They say animals can recognize good people.

347
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:36,310
Are you sure it's good people? It's probably more along the lines of cute little sisters.

348
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,830
- Oh, you're upset about what I said yesterday? 
 - Hey!

349
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:47,000
- Bong Yi... 
 - Hey, do you think I really like you?

350
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,240
What?

351
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,420
Just take care of your bird. You idiot.

352
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,030
Bong Yi!

353
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,250
Bong Yi!

354
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,690
 Then on that day, how did Father and the other members end up going to the show at the correctional facility? 

355
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,570
 Were there any new members in your group? 

356
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:24,830
 I was present as a guide for the volunteer group. 

357
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,610
 Ba Reum is one of the volunteers. He said he needed an assistant that day for his magic show, that's how I ended up there. 

358
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,700
We didn't have any new members.

359
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,380
Everyone who was present are new believers, who have all been volunteering for at least a year.

360
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,490
- Besides, there was no one from my group that would have ever done that— 
 - Go Mu Chi!

361
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,040
We need to talk.

362
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,550
Wow, your office has a sofa. Sweet.

363
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,810
We've decided to keep the coffee mix incident under wraps. So you keep your mouth shut about it as well.

364
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,630
But why?

365
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,720
It's evidence that there might be more victims.

366
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,280
Hey, how could you tell that from one coffee mix?

367
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,840
It was in Jo Mi Jeong's hand! That means it must have been something another victim owned.

368
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,740
Didn't you say they were items the victims valued?

369
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,160
Who cares that much about coffee mix?

370
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,100
You never know. There might be someone out there who loves coffee mix.

371
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,510
Cut it out, you punk.

372
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:26,500
I'm doing this for your sake. If word of this incident gets out, you who couldn't properly handle the evidence,

373
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,780
and Detective Shin will be on the chopping block.

374
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,170
Do you understand me, Go Mu Chi? You don't want to quit being a detective, do you?

375
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,660
- That punk, that's why he's called "parachute" (Someone who landed a job through a connection.)! 
 - Be quiet.

376
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,480
Alright, now go and make sure PD Choi doesn't talk about this.

377
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,930
Sorry, I-I'm sorry.

378
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,280
Do you have any more questions?

379
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,980
We're done for today. We'll contact you again in case something new pops up.

380
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,040
Thank you.

381
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,240
Are you alright?

382
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,340
Yes, I'm alright.

383
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,740
Thank you.

384
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,280
Head back safely.

385
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:30,230
Why do a performance for those no-good punks

386
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,420
and end up visiting a police station? It's tiring.

387
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:37,440
Why did you call someone who's clearly unwell? You could have gone to him instead!

388
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,040
You don't know how to be considerate.

389
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,570
Since you're so considerate, you're always thinking about shooting suspects?

390
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,170
Are you done talking?

391
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:50,800
Go Mu Chi, don't you even have any respect for your senior? Don't you even know, by how many years, I am your hyeong?

392
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,690
How many years?

393
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,250
Just because you are older, does that make you a hyeong?

394
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:58,310
- If you are a hyeong, then act like one. You should first be considerate towards someone with physical limitations!
 - Please stop, both of you.

395
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,460
You must have been a married couple in your previous lives.

396
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,450
- This is a list of visitors to the detention center on the day of the incident. Look into them, starting with the ex-convicts. 
 - Okay.

397
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,790
If the fact that the evidence was destroyed gets out, then I might not be able to be a detective anymore.

398
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:26,160
You know, I am not well regarded in many places.  Besides, you are the one who drank it anyway.  So keep it a secret.

399
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,710
Then apologize.

400
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,370
What?

401
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:34,260
"I am sorry that I did not recognize you and I regret it."  Say it.

402
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,670
Then I will keep my mouth shut.

403
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:38,100
What didn't I recognize?

404
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,470
Do you really not remember?

405
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:46,380
- Ah, damn! 
 - Why? You can't do it?

406
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,580
- Let's see, what was the number for that trash reporter Yang? 
 - Okay, do it. Do it.

407
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,560
Tip off, do it.

408
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,250
- Where are you going? 
 - To catch that psychopath.

409
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,920
Oh, detective!

410
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,790
What are you doing here instead of being at work?

411
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:09,800
Dong Gu and I take turns coming here when we can so that Chi Kook's mother can take a break.

412
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,400
They think his finger got severed as he was trying to protect himself from the weapon being swung at him.

413
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,540
Out of the two fingers he lost, they were able to re-attach one,

414
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,040
but the other finger came too late to be reattached.

415
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:32,680
I wonder why he revealed Mr. Na Chi Kook's watch,

416
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,910
when it was obvious the police would be able to double down on him after that.

417
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,250
You're right.

418
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,230
If the culprit had stabbed Mr. Chi Kook that many times, then he must have assumed that he'd killed him.

419
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:48,620
It really is a miracle he's still alive. But for his exact condition, you should ask the surgeon.

420
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,490
Has Dr. Seong Yo Han not come in yet?

421
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,650
Yes. We're unable to reach him.

422
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,120
Then, please give me a call when he comes to work.

423
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,840
Sure.

424
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:07,180
By the way,  could you tell me where Oh Mi Soon's room is? She was brought in yesterday.

425
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,170
What is this? You're making me lose steam.

426
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:27,640
I'm working my ass off to find the guy who killed your son. But look at you.

427
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:37,950
I promised you that I'd catch that bastard no matter what. Shouldn't you be around to see that?

428
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,370
Then why would you—

429
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:46,410
If you do something like this again, I won't catch that bastard. Are you okay with that?

430
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:52,130
Please catch him, Detective Go.

431
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,130
No, I'm not going to catch him.

432
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,150
I'm going to kill him.

433
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,310
So, don't get these thoughts again.

434
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,650
Okay.

435
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:11,810
Make sure you kill him.

436
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,750
 Good job today. See you all tomorrow. 

437
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,940
Thank you!

438
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,090
I've got butterflies in my stomach.

439
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,000
- I'm so excited. 
 - Look at that, she's sleeping again.

440
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,190
- She's sleeping again? 
 - My mom said I shouldn't hang out with her. 
 - Why?

441
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,720
That man's getting out.

442
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,170
Hey, come on!

443
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:37,190
- What should we eat? 
 - Let's have tteokbokki.

444
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,640
I'm so hungry.

445
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,240
We  really all have similar taste!

446
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,800
That's so true.

447
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,020
Oh my!

448
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,800
Officer Jung brought it over so that you could raise it. He said you seemed to like it.

449
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,890
What a funny guy. When did I say I liked this bird?

450
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:31,770
Tell him to take it back. I can barely take care of myself.

451
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:36,480
That hot-headed brat, gosh.

452
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,780
You're a clean freak, huh?

453
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,780
Bong Yi, why did you come to my house?

454
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,660
Is that you?

455
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,710
Yeah.

456
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,880
Your mother is very beautiful.

457
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,770
Did you take bribes?

458
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,270
This is a pretty big place for one person to live in.

459
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:31,970
Well, I bought it using the insurance money I got after my parents passed away.

460
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,040
Do you want something to drink?

461
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,350
Thanks for giving me Uh Bung Yi.

462
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:46,830
You seemed to like her a lot this morning.

463
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,810
So take good care of her.

464
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,100
Ah!

465
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,930
You must've been taken aback by what I said at the  Ox Bone Soup restaurant, right?

466
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,380
Oh, well...

467
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,150
I was just kidding, but I think you took it too seriously.

468
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,700
It was just a joke, right?

469
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,050
I thought you were serious about it. I was so worried that I'd actually hurt you—

470
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,640
Why would I be hurt? Me?

471
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,010
That's ridiculous.

472
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,320
I was really sorry about startling you like that,

473
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,310
so I cooked some food for you.

474
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,780
You made this? Really?

475
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,710
- Try it. 
 - No, no.

476
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,830
- I could eat that myself... 
 - Think about the sincerity with which I cooked this and have a bite?

477
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,770
Ba Reum Oppa.

478
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,740
O-Oppa?

479
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,910
Okay then.

480
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,070
How is it?

481
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,190
- It's really tasty. 
 - Is it?

482
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,650
- What is this? 
 - What would it be? It's stir-fried chicken, of course.

483
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,190
- Ah, stir-fried chicken. 
 - Here, have another bite.

484
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,200
How is the skin so tender? It's really good.

485
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,870
Right? Uh Bung Yi tastes really good, doesn't she?

486
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:05,030
I mean, she looked so cute. How could she be so tender and delicious, too?

487
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,710
- Uh-Uh Bung Yi? 
 - What do you think?

488
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,860
I'm still your cute little sister, right?

489
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,520
Uh Bung!

490
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,220
I told him that chicken was actually you,

491
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,170
and that fool totally bought it.

492
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,350
Boy, I feel much better.

493
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,830
Well, when he gets flustered like that, he does seem a little,

494
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,670
just a tiny little bit cute.

495
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,440
Sir, Sir!

496
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,060
We've got a big problem on our hands. Take a look at this.

497
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,560
 There has been an unbelievable situation where a police officer ate a piece of evidence. 

498
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,800
 It was the evidence found in the vineyard murder case... 

499
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,970
Damn it! Who was it?

500
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:09,520
Who was it? Who snitched?

501
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,140
 Police are suspected of covering up murder case evidence. 

502
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,190
-OB? 
-OBN news?

503
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,940
If it's OBN then it means PD Choi—

504
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,850
H-Hey, don't go blaming someone without proof!

505
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,970
- PD Choi isn't like that. 
 - I didn't like her,

506
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,270
ever since she started coming in and out of here as if it were her house.

507
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,530
So let's say PD Choi did tell them about it. What's wrong with that?

508
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,820
You tell me who's worse? The one trying to cover it up or the one who snitched?

509
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,920
That's why the police are always criticized.

510
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,130
That...That punk!

511
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:43,250
Gosh! She's going to be the reason all of my hair falls out one day.

512
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,600
Wow! Just because I didn't do what she asked, she actually tipped them off?

513
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,090
 The call could not be connected. You will be directed to voicemail... 

514
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:56,080
You're not even going to pick up the phone, Choi Hong Ju?

515
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,420
What are you doing here?

516
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,710
I was worried because I couldn't get a hold of you the entire day.

517
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,660
- Why? Is there something wrong?
 - I'm scared.

518
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:38,000
I'm scared.

519
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,790
- What's the matter? 
 - Just a second.

520
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,380
Let's just stay like this for a while.

521
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,000
 Go out with me, Detective Go. 

522
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,530
 - What? 
 - Let's date. 

523
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:15,240
 You're the only woman I know who'd confess at a murder site. 

524
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,680
 - Anyways, I don't want to. 
 - Don't you want to? Why? 

525
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,280
 You aren't my type. 

526
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,590
 - You're really making me miserable. You didn't even have to think about it for a second? 
 - Yeah. 

527
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:32,430
 You're the worst. You may have a good eye for criminals, but you can't tell what a catch I am. 

528
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,950
 You're definitely going to regret letting me go. 

529
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:04,580
 Did you find Han Seo Jun's son? I am going to make his son live with it, too. 

530
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:10,580
 What I saw, the horrible memory that I can't forget about. I am going to make his son live with it, too. 

531
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:18,880
What are you thinking so hard about?

532
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,590
Well?

533
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,910
 Don't you hate your dad who abandoned you, Han Kook? 

534
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,420
 No, I don't hate him. 

535
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,550
 I am sure he had a reason. 

536
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:16,660
 By chance, your dad might be watching the TV, so is there anything you want to say? 
   

537
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,910
 Dad, I miss you. 

538
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,400
 I love you. 

539
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,880
 When you meet your dad, what is the first thing you want to do, Han Kook? 

540
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,170
 The amusement park. I want to go to the amusement park. 

541
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:35,790
So commendable, that kid, Han Kook.

542
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,610
070...

543
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:43,020
Yes, I want to sponsor Han Kook—

544
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,530
Hello?

545
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:48,750
Uh, why isn't the call going through?

546
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,990
- That's a re-run, you know. 
 - Ah.

547
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,960
   

548
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,240
- Ah, is it a re-run? 
 - Aigoo.

549
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,700
How is it that a guy cries so easily?

550
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,540
Hey, eat some porridge. I went to the fish market and the abalone was very good.

551
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:08,210
Ah, please pack some of that for me, Aunt. I want to take it over to Chi Kook's mom later.

552
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:10,720
   

553
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:25,180
   

554
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,310
Why don't you let this go?  Didn't you get the order for you to stay away from this case?

555
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:00,550
What are you talking about? This is my case—

556
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:04,070
Suspension means you should just go and take a nap.

557
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:07,900
Wait a minute.

558
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,660
Wasn't it you who tipped off the reporter?

559
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,820
Ah, it really is suspicious!

560
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:24,010
Hey Parachute, how is it going?

561
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:25,910
The air is nice there, right?

562
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,650
Me?

563
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:37,540
Why would I be busy when I am suspended? I have lots of time.

564
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,280
Thank you Sunbae for coming all the way here.

565
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,350
What's there to do at the office just sitting around anyway?  I am here to get some fresh air, too.

566
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:47,110
Ah, I really am unlucky!

567
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:50,710
As soon as I get transferred, what is with a murder case?  A murder case.

568
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,260
Didn't you say that it's a missing person's case?

569
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:57,010
It's a murder, we just haven't found the corpse. The higher-ups are keeping it quiet.

570
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,000
The higher-ups?

571
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,380
They say that the missing person is Dr. Daniel Lee.

572
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,850
You know, the Nobel Prize candidate.

573
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,430
As usual, he came to clean before the park opens.

574
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:08,960
Everything was turned off, but this, this...

575
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,000
he said that only this ferris wheel was operating.

576
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:23,240
So he came to look, but it was like this.

577
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,590
But how did you know that the blood was that of Dr. Daniel?

578
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,440
We found a car near the amusement park.

579
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,570
When I looked into it, it was a car Dr. Daniel rented that day through the hotel.

580
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,140
So, the DNA left inside the car

581
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,360
and the DNA of the blood were compared. They were a match.

582
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,610
- But the corpse disappeared, right? 
 - Yes.

583
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,920
The fact that he was at an amusement park at that hour when it's closed

584
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,810
means he met someone secretly.

585
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,690
What is this? It looks like a zipper.

586
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:59,080
It had fallen inside the ferris wheel.  It looks like a zipper from a jacket.

587
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:03,330
When I checked the hotel's CCTV, the doctor wore a suit that day.

588
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:07,360
- It seems like it fell off the culprit's clothes. 
 - Where was the doctor staying?

589
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,880
Evidence.

590
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:15,200
I checked everything but there wasn't any signs of a break-in.

591
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,110
Can I see this again?

592
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,890
Stop.

593
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:48,820
Find this woman and check her call history at this time.

594
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,510
Hello?

595
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:08,790
What is it, Teacher?

596
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:12,480
Are you a bully? How can you do this to a girl's face?

597
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,410
Bong Yi, hurry and apologize. You can get expelled from school for school violence.

598
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:20,370
Teacher, what do you mean expelled?

599
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:24,670
Graduation is so close.

600
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:29,760
Please, please let it go just this once.

601
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:35,960
I'm sorry, child. I'm begging you.

602
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,200
- Please forgive her just this– 
 - Why are you doing this?

603
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:45,670
Please let it go just once.

604
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:49,760
My granddaughter is a poor little thing.

605
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,950
She has a bad grandmother...

606
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:56,170
- Give her a chance, please! 
 - That's enough, Grandma!

607
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:59,180
Shut up, you brat!

608
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,860
Did I teach you to be a bully?

609
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,820
Hurry and apologize. Tell them you're sorry and–

610
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,700
Why should I apologize?

611
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,540
She kept spreading weird rumors about me!

612
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,550
I'm not coming to school. I don't need a school like this.

613
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,700
She's so poor mannered. What a sight!

614
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:30,620
- You... What did you go around blabbing? 
 - Huh?

615
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:35,090
What did you go around blabbing about my Bong Yi?

616
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:39,820
I just said what I heard from my mom... Mom...

617
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,350
What are you talking about?

618
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:47,590
Why you two wenches...

619
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:51,040
- Let her live, that poor thing! 
 - Ah!

620
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,770
Aigoo.

621
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,650
It's nothing. Let's hurry and go home.

622
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,580
What's wrong with your leg?

623
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:12,350
It'll get better if I wet my nose.

624
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:15,480
Hey, what do you want to eat?

625
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,490
What should I make for dinner?

626
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:22,410
- I don't want to eat. 
 - What do you mean, you don't want to eat?

627
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:28,050
Just tell me what you want to eat.

628
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,130
- Do you want some pork belly for dinner? 
 - I said I don't want to eat!

629
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:35,050
Your grandma is offering to cook meat for you and you don't want it?

630
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:37,810
This brat really doesn't listen!

631
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:41,620
What are you going to grow up to be?

632
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,340
I'm like this because I listen too well to what you say, Grandma.

633
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,990
- What did you say? 
 - Am I wrong?

634
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,810
If I didn't listen to you, I wouldn't have gone to get makkeoli for you.

635
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:58,140
Then, I wouldn't have had to experience–

636
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,680
Bong Yi!

637
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,680
Your phone keeps ringing.

638
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,230
   

639
00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:00,110
 The number you are trying to reach is not available at this moment... 

640
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:03,470
What's going on?

641
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:31,160
   

642
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,920
That's right. Only two months left.

643
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,080
You must be so anxious.

644
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:01,370
Don't worry. Your grandma will take care of everything.

645
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,700
You won't even get a day to live as a free man.

646
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:11,480
This is the last one, right? I thank you in advance!

647
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:16,950
Gosh! Officer Jung, why are you carrying this?

648
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:20,280
- Leave it to the workers. 
 - Of course, I should help.

649
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,900
Actually, it's so sad to see you leaving.

650
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,730
I know. We were the last ones to hold out in this neighborhood.

651
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:30,740
Anyway, thank you for helping me when you are already busy with your work.

652
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,300
I'll go help with the final batch.

653
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,970
- Gosh, thank you! 
 - No problem!

654
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,290
Officer Jung.

655
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:39,620
Ma'am.

656
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,760
Ma'am.

657
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,370
Here. Have this.

658
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,150
Yeah.

659
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:48,690
How's your ankle?

660
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:53,270
- I see the swelling went down a lot. You're icing it too, right? 
 - Yes.

661
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:56,120
Oh I told you to change the bandaid every day,

662
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,510
- so that the wound can heal quickly. 
 - Alright.

663
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:02,080
But is today a special day?

664
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,650
You're all dressed up nicely like this.

665
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,180
Huh? Ah, this?

666
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,420
I had to go to Bong Yi's School.

667
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:13,080
Ah, I see. You should always dress up like this.

668
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,720
I'm blinded by your beauty.

669
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,620
However, this ruins the look a little bit.

670
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,360
I'll buy you something prettier later.

671
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:25,190
What? You must be blind.

672
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:28,030
Oh my, I wouldn't trade it for a billion won! Gosh.

673
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,160
This... When my Bong Yi was small,

674
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,120
she made it for me as a birthday gift.

675
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:42,510
Bong Yi must have been nice to you when she was a kid.

676
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:46,560
She would follow me around and hug me, calling me ''Grandma."

677
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,410
How sweet she was.

678
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:52,720
Bong Yi?

679
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,770
I can't really imagine it.

680
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,810
Officer Jung.

681
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:05,560
Can I ask you...

682
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,940
one favor?

683
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:24,490
 If you can't pay the settlement, your granddaughter will end up behind bars without being able to graduate. 

684
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:26,460
   

685
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:33,210
These days it's even hard for young people to find jobs.

686
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:37,470
Who'd want to hire someone as old as you? They'd find it uncomfortable.

687
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:43,400
What? It's only because I'm a little old-fashioned on the outside.

688
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,980
Actually, I'm not that old.

689
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:50,200
When you came in earlier, your legs looked uncomfortable.

690
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,530
Oh, that's because I fell on the stairs while walking up here.

691
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:57,920
I'll be fine in a bit.

692
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,400
I'll only receive half of what the others get paid, okay?

693
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,640
Please do something about it.

694
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,020
Drink this and take your leave.

695
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:09,110
- Where are you going? 
 - To the bathroom.

696
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:11,480
Drink that and leave.

697
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:39,560
This is perfect for Bong Yi's constipation.

698
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,100
I'll be borrowing these.

699
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,330
Gosh! Huh?

700
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:51,780
Here it is.

701
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:57,640
Hello. The lady in charge went to take a dump... Huh?

702
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,060
Really?

703
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,880
Of course! We'll send help right away.

704
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,790
Can I have your address?

705
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:09,290
Sure, tell me.

706
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:13,440
Yes, okay.

707
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,320
One, two, stop. Stop!

708
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,560
Stop, stop!

709
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,790
That's enough for today. You've improved so much.

710
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,980
Good work!

711
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,340
I heard that it wasn't Uh Bung Yi.

712
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:41,940
Are you here to argue?

713
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:47,470
Your grandma was worried because you weren't picking up your phone.

714
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,230
I told her I'd look for you.

715
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:54,500
Just go home and stop making her worry.

716
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,270
Annoying jerk!

717
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,160
Ah...

718
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,620
Since you're a cop, duel with me.

719
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,260
That's good. Come up here.

720
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,710
What?

721
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:16,120
Bong, Bong!

722
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:19,920
Hey, Bong Yi!

723
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:38,630
Ouch! Surrender, surrender. Surrender!

724
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:46,360
I feel sorry for the people of Gudong.

725
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,990
They have a weak cop like you to look out for them.

726
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:53,260
How did you become a cop with your poor physical strength?

727
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,150
Oh Bong Yi.

728
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:59,110
Do you know why your grandma was late coming to pick you up?

729
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,770
I don't even care.

730
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:03,250
I don't want to know about that.

731
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,630
She was rushing out,

732
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:11,400
fell in the rain and sprained her ankle.

733
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,840
You should've seen how swollen it was.

734
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,910
You know how old she is.

735
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:22,280
If you keep acting like this, you're going to regret it once she passes away.

736
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,370
Be nice to her while she's still alive. So you won't regret it later.

737
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,410
Officer Jung.

738
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:33,230
Just mind your business.

739
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:37,730
Oh Bong Yi.

740
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:48,410
Do you really want to marry me?

741
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:56,360
Nonsense. Really.

742
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,860
- Hi. 
 - Who are you?

743
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,450
What do you mean, you called for a housekeeper.

744
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:09,820
The lady who usually works here, said she wasn't feeling well. So I came instead.

745
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,750
Excuse me.

746
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:16,740
Oh, you have a guest over.

747
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,510
Don't worry about me

748
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,910
and do what you need to do.

749
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:26,840
I think my mom sent her to me. She does it sometimes.

750
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,730
I'll leave then.

751
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:30,250
Okay.

752
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:36,120
Wow! Look at this spacious house!

753
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,870
Is this a rental or a lease?

754
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:41,240
Don't tell me you own this place?

755
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,260
My mother must have called you to clean,

756
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,180
but I don't like others cleaning for me.

757
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,770
I'm sorry, but please leave.

758
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:52,600
I'll make sure to clean every surface of the house, making it shine and glow

759
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,760
to the point you slip and slide. So look forward to it.

760
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,390
Do what you need to do and let me do my work.

761
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:04,470
I'll get changed first.

762
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:07,340
Team Leader! Team Leader!

763
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:09,590
Why do we have to submit all the evidence?

764
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,830
Then how do we investigate?

765
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:13,560
Oh, I don't know! They said to submit it and get confirmation.

766
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,830
Does that make sense?

767
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:16,920
Why are you yelling at me?

768
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,120
Gosh, look at that guy.

769
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,460
What a troublemaker.

770
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:24,520
Get up and answer that phone!

771
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,900
Team Leader! Team Leader!

772
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,690
Gosh!

773
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:36,640
Hello. This is Troublemaker speaking.

774
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,690
I found out who spoke to Dr. Daniel on the phone.

775
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,530
Oh, really?

776
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,660
Good job! Tell me.

777
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:49,850
Seong Yo Han? Seong Yo Han?

778
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:53,800
 But if you want to know the details, you should ask the surgeon. Is Dr. Seong Yo Han not here yet? 

779
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,460
Isn't it he Na Chi Kook's surgeon in charge?

780
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:58,820
Hello?

781
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,100
Why are the police asking for me?

782
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:22,510
Gosh!

783
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:26,390
I guess I dropped it while I was cleaning.

784
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:32,890
Pretty, huh? This is what my granddaughter

785
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,720
made for me.

786
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,950
You can stop cleaning and leave.

787
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:40,180
What? Okay.

788
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,680
Wait! Are you going to leave like this? No way, no way.

789
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,900
It's so cold outside.

790
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:50,220
You should wear something warm. Wear this.

791
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:53,370
Here you go. Wear this.

792
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:56,620
Good. Bye.

793
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,920
Aigo, he is so cold.

794
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,460
Gosh! He gave me so much. My goodness.

795
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:19,940
The rich are also very generous.

796
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:27,000
If I had  a little more, I'd be able to pay the settlement fee.

797
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,640
Hello?

798
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,640
Yes, I'm Officer Jung Ba Reum.

799
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,190
Hello, sir!

800
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:49,030
Do you still happen to have Na Chi Kook's finger that never got stitched back on?

801
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:53,830
It's probably at the hospital. I thought it might contain the culprit's DNA,

802
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:55,760
so I asked them to keep it safe.

803
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,800
The team that preserves evidence wants the finger saying it's also considered a piece of evidence.

804
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,940
I'll check right away.

805
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,090
Mr. Seong Yo Han.

806
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,260
Do you know Dr. Daniel Lee?

807
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:20,310
Who doesn't know him?

808
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:22,990
So you don't know him personally?

809
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:26,430
Wait. 010...

810
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,050
Answer the phone.

811
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:37,510
It turns out he called this number.

812
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:39,590
Someone did call me by mistake.

813
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:43,380
So he called you by mistake, and you talked to him...

814
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:46,000
for 3 minute and 23 seconds?

815
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,800
I thought that I hung up right away.

816
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,750
But I guess I didn't.

817
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:53,040
If you're done, I'm going to leave now.

818
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:57,050
What did you do on Monday?

819
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:03,010
I was here to talk to you regarding Na Chi Kook, but you weren't here.

820
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:06,050
I wasn't feeling well, so I couldn't come to work. I'm still on leave.

821
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:07,170
What about Sunday evening?

822
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:10,870
I said I wasn't feeling well. What would I have done? I was at home resting.

823
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:13,620
Do you have an alibi?

824
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:15,910
Why are you doing this?

825
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,450
Dr. Daniel Lee is missing.

826
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:21,600
And we think he was murdered.

827
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,660
I was with a friend.

828
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:29,590
Can you tell me your friend's name and contact number?

829
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:37,690
On the left...

830
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:39,570
You can write it down.

831
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,080
If you have any more questions, I'd like to receive a warrant.

832
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:07,100
Oh, Mr. Seong Yo Han. Mr. Seong Yo Han!

833
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,660
   

834
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:16,300
Thank you for keeping it safe.

835
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:22,340
Something's weird.

836
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:28,360
Officer Jung.

837
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,700
Detective Go.

838
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,780
Where are you off to in rush?

839
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:35,830
This isn't Chi Kook's finger.

840
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:36,630
What?

841
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,200
We went fishing together a week before the incident.

842
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:46,640
And he hurt his finger with a fish hook. There should be a scar on his finger, but it wasn't there.

843
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,600
Are you saying this is someone else's finger?

844
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,750
He purposely left another person's finger?

845
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,380
Then where's Na Chi Kook's finger?

846
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:08,130
I have no idea.

847
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:10,480
- There's a church inside the correctional facility, right?
 - Yes.

848
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,710
The cross!

849
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,790
Detective!

850
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,760
♪ Please tell me– ♪

851
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,670
What's that?

852
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:42,510
While I'm at it let's just clean

853
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:43,940
this place spotlessly.

854
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,060
I should make sure he's pleased.

855
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:48,700
Then he'll let me keep working here.

856
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:49,880
Yes, that's right.

857
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,790
My goodness, what a big place.

858
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,840
Is it locked? There's a key here.

859
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,630
How do you open this?

860
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,790
Hey, you're back.

861
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:41,490
So what do you think? Isn't the place spotless?

862
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:49,330
Look at the time.

863
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:51,950
I should go now.

864
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:54,130
I'll see you.

865
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:07,000
You forgot to take this.

866
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:11,190
   

867
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:19,350
 On the 13th of last month, a female was reported missing 

868
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:21,390
 after having disappeared while she went out for a walk. However, she was found dead... 

869
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:23,290
 My goodness gracious! 

870
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:26,580
My goodness, that was frightening.

871
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:34,880
But I'm doing the right thing. I should help my grandson-in-law get a good performance record.

872
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,260
 Your grandmother slipped in the rain and sprained her ankle. 

873
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,850
 You should've seen the swelling. 

874
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,030
Who is it for?

875
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:56,100
- It's for her. 
 - Oh really? That one's okay,

876
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,590
but what about this one?

877
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:59,280
- This one? 
 - Yes, that one.

878
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,170
How about this?

879
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,900
What do you think about this?

880
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,140
 You're aware of her age, aren't you? 

881
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:08,750
 Keep acting out like this and you'll only regret it once she passes away. 

882
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:11,650
 Be good while she's still alive. 

883
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,860
How much is this?

884
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:18,850
I'll look here.

885
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:19,750
Officer Jung.

886
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:22,330
- What's going on? 
 - I'll explain it later.

887
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:24,140
What...

888
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:35,130
What are we looking for?

889
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:39,250
Father?

890
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,610
Hello, Father.

891
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,810
Officer Jung, let's come back after mass.

892
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:45,250
Detective, let's come back later.

893
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,550
We have no time to waste...

894
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:48,780
Stop this.

895
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,540
What's so important about mass?

896
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:53,550
They killed people! Those pieces of garbage!

897
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:55,950
Will praying erase their sins? Will they go to paradise?

898
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,510
How could you say that?

899
01:14:57,510 --> 01:14:59,320
What's wrong with what I said?

900
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,590
Please be quiet.

901
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:02,910
This won't solve anything.

902
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:04,930
- Detective. 
 - What?

903
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:06,880
What is this?

904
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,540
Get a ladder.

905
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,860
A ladder quick!

906
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,290
 "Drink from it, all of you. 

907
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:37,660
 This is My blood of the covenant, 

908
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:43,830
 which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 

909
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:46,400
 - Remember me and do it."  
 - Detective?

910
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,490
Detective Go?

911
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:58,890
What is it? Is something up there?

912
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:18,620
   

913
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:28,370
   

914
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,500
   

915
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,900
   

916
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:55,990
   

917
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:02,140
It's dark. I can't see anything.

918
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,690
Fatso!

919
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:08,560
Fatso!

920
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,360
Anyone?

921
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,380
He must not be home.

922
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:36,060
Oh my gosh, did he follow me all the way here? What should I do?

923
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:51,110
Is something wrong?

924
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,330
Is it your friend?

925
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:57,300
We found Chi Kook's uniform and the weapon.

926
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,730
Really? Did you find anything?

927
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:03,640
I don't know. They'll let me know once they get the lab results.

928
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,450
   

929
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:19,260
 The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the tone.   

930
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:28,860
I need to step outside.

931
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:31,700
   

932
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,480
Elder!

933
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:44,370
Ma'am!

934
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:46,530
Elder!

935
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,810
Elder.

936
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:15,970
Elder, are you in here?

937
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:19,810
Elder?

938
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,120
Elder!

939
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:27,340
Elder, are you in here?

940
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,160
What... Elder!

941
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,590
Oh, Elder!

942
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,380
Who... Who are you?

943
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,860
Who was that?

944
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:48,140
Is he okay?

945
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:50,960
We need an ambulance.

946
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,300
Please come quickly.

947
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,370

950
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:40,730
 Hey there! Are you hurt? Why are you sitting there? 

951
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:41,430
 Get in. Get in. 

952
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:43,120
 Did something happen in our neighborhood? 

953
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,160
 What a sick psycho. 

954
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,520
 He kills people and takes photos of them too? 

955
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,520
 Just say what I told you to. 

956
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,020
 I think you were right, Sunbae. Something's not right about Seong Yo Han. What should we do? 

957
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:56,360
 So you're saying this serial killer is an exhibitionist psychopath?

959
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,540
 We must find the reason why he chose them as targets for murder. 

960
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,400
 Go Mu Chi. 

961
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,500
 We must find it before the broadcast. 

962
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,520
 Who are you?
