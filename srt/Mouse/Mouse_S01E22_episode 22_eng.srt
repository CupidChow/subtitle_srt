00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,830
   

3
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,520
   

4
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,370
I'm a little disappointed that you couldn't trust me.

5
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,120
How is it?

6
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,140
Do you think you can trust me now?

7
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,370
You have until exactly the end of the broadcast.

8
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,140
If you can't tell me the reason why this child will die,

9
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,550
you'll be seeing a show you'll never forget.

10
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,280
   

11
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,340
   

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,310
 It's given to be living with the anger inside you. 

13
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,770
 And it's probably the reason why I'm living today. 

14
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,100
 The day I came home from confessing that I forgave Han Seo Joon, 

15
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,250
 I slept for hours and hours. 

16
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,320
 After that day, I slept well for the first time. 

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,760
Should I buy some time?

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,790
For the climax.

19
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,500
Even if a criminal takes a hostage and asks for money,

20
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,380
you should never compromise with him.

21
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,290
 Finding the answers to why a killer takes a child hostage, 

22
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,030
 why he kills a person, 

23
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,580
 broadcasting it, 

24
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,340
 and doing it just because they tell you to, is just not right. 

25
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,200
 Listening to a serial killers words 

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,130
 and solving them like a game, then broadcasting it... 

27
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,370
I might not be able to do the broadcast today.

28
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,140
 ...is it really the best way to save a child? 

29
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,380
This is Han Kook's mom, right?

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,480
Excuse me, Detective.

31
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,250
Han Kook's mother.

32
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,380
Please, Detective...

33
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,380
Please do the broadcast.

34
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,740
Please... Please save my baby.

35
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,570
I-I'll do everything.

36
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,940
I'll do everything.

37
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,070
Me too.

38
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,980
Please don't give up.

39
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,520
We have to find the guy that made Chi Kook,

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,100
as well as Bong Yi's grandma, like that.

41
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,680
Take her away.

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,760
Please, Detective, please!

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,360
- Please, oh... my baby... 
 - Please stand up. Doing this won't do–

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,650
Please, just save my baby!

45
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,920
Please... I beg you...

46
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,080
Detective Go...

47
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,580
I can't do anything here. I have to go.

48
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,570
Where are you going to do it?

49
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,610
Welcome!

50
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,830
Here.

51
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,120
Huh?

52
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,740
- Don't you remember me? 
 - What?

53
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,940
I interviewed you back then.

54
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,040
When?

55
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,360
When I was an intern, my first interview was with a high school student who won the Rookie Hero Award.

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,830
The student I interviewed was you!

57
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,660
I remember you kept saying you didn't want to do the interview,

58
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,510
saying your friends did everything but you didn't during the entire interview.

59
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,320
That was Chi Kook, not me.

60
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,930
Oh! But about the student we saved,

61
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,820
I coincidently passed by him not too long ago.

62
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,980
- Where? 
 - We already wasted two days.

63
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,850
We got to hurry. The broadcast is tomorrow.

64
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,340
Okay. Organize the materials according to the victims and let me know right away if you find any links between them.

65
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,050
And for now, exclude Song Soo Ho and Grandmother Kim Got Nan.

66
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,850
Yes, ma'am.

67
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,790
 This will be funner than I expected. 

68
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,170
 How funny that this is the PD that interviewed Chi Kook. 

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,700
Oh, Father!

70
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,200
Eat this together

71
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,140
Why did you make so much japchae?

72
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,280
Don't tell them that I made it.

73
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,090
If he knew, he'd probably not eat it.

74
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,640
Okay.

75
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,040
Officer Jung,

76
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,750
take good care of Mu Chi.

77
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,460
Don't worry.

78
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,100
- I'll be going then. 
 - Okay.

79
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,910
Father!

80
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,570
Yeah?

81
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,300
Do you really not hate him?

82
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,600
I'm talking about Han Seo Joon. Aren't you angry?

83
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,290
He killed your parents,

84
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,580
made you like this; he's a murderer.

85
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,750
Don't you feel any anger towards him?

86
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,790
Why? Did Mu Chi say anything?

87
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,760
No.

88
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,820
I'm just curious.

89
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,470
You can tell me the truth.

90
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,200
How can you say that you'll forgive him?

91
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,010
You're a human after all.

92
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,470
But how would you forgive him?

93
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,960
I pray to the Lord every day,

94
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,410
asking for Han Seo Joon to be saved.

95
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,510
I pray every day.

96
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,130
Bye.

97
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,900
That was your last chance, Go Mu Won.

98
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:29,110
Detective Go, it's 8 o'clock. Two hours before the broadcast.

99
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,940
It's over.

100
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,290
Hello, Father.

101
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,920
Oh, Officer Jung.

102
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,260
What brings you here?

103
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,610
Ah, yes.

104
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,980
I'm wondering if I should send someone somewhere,

105
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,390
and I wanted some counseling.

106
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,530
You're going to send someone?

107
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,190
Ah...

108
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,710
Whether to go or not,

109
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,830
that I don't know.

110
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,200
Huh?

111
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,780
I'll ask you for the last time.

112
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,690
What "for the last time?"

113
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,010
Father,

114
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,560
are you really not angry at Han Seo Joon?

115
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,410
I'm asking if you're really not angry. I mean, he made you like this

116
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,020
and Detective Go Mu Chi is living like that all because of him.

117
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,640
I've already forgiven Han Seo Joon.

118
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,750
"Forgive?"

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,700
I wonder what the answer will be.

120
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,280
I know. There isn't that much time left either.

121
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,910
They'll kill the child if they can't get the answer right.

122
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,540
- He never said that he'll kill the child. 
 - Huh?

123
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,920
He only said that he would kill.

124
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,710
Not specifically the child.

125
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,330
That's right.

126
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,820
It's you.

127
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,960
I will ask you straightforwardly.

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,340
Have you found the answer?

129
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,840
Can you save Han Kook?

130
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,710
 I'll ask you again. 

131
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,470
The answer... have you found it?

132
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,800
Yes, I have.

133
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:18,000
Then, why did the killer choose those specific victims?

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,230
Before I say the answer, I have to check something.

135
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,140
Are you watching?

136
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,910
 You asked us to figure out why you chose these victims, right? 

137
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,460
Before you hear the answer,

138
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,580
prove that you are the one who called me and asked for a broadcast,

139
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,510
and show me that Han Kook is still alive.

140
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,070
 Then the game will be fair. 

141
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,470
 I know you know my number. 

142
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,840
 Then I'll tell you why you killed those people. 

143
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,910
He's really doing everything as I asked.

144
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,610
Detective Go Mu Chi, are there any specific characteristics of this serial murder case?

145
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,910
There are.

146
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,670
A cross was present on all the crime scenes,

147
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,430
and the victims' middle fingers were bent to point at the cross.

148
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,200
The killer is presumed to either strongly despise God or feels extreme repulsion towards Him.

149
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,490
Among the 7 victims of this serial killer case, Song Soo Ho

150
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,940
as well as this elder in her 70s are believed to have been killed

151
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,770
after they discovered the criminal's identity. Except for these two victims, the rest of the victims' murder and attempted murder cases

152
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,820
were initially believed to be random.

153
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,930
But then the killer gives you a call.

154
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,600
 You're right. There is a standard by which I selected my victims. 

155
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,610
He declared himself that those five killings

156
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,920
were not random.

157
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,970
Yes, after talking to the culprit, I completely re-investigated these cases.

158
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,610
After her husband's death,

159
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,350
Byeon Sun Yeong was a single mom who was living a tough life raising her young daughter while working in the kitchen at a bar.

160
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,850
Park Jong Ho was a young man who worked day and night at part-time jobs.

161
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,930
 Hey! Hey! 

162
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,090
This coffee mix was found at the crime scene.

163
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,980
To Park Jong Ho, this coffee wasn't a preferred food.

164
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,830
But a survival tool to overcome sleepiness.

165
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,930
 This culprit took the victims' most precious items as if it were a prize of war.  
     
    

166
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,200
 So he knew very well what this coffee meant to Park Jong Ho.  
    
   

167
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,680
   
   

168
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,230
The only victim who survived, Officer Na Chi Kook, 
    

169
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,920
was said to be a very good and upstanding young man.

170
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,670
 His acquaintances have said that he was never able to ignore injustice. 

171
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:38,040
 When he was in high school, he even saved a citizen who was being assaulted. 

172
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,130
 And even homeless Mr. Kim, whose identity is still unknown, 

173
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,760
 was said to be very popular among other homeless people. 

174
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,520
 His personality was quiet. 

175
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:56,990
 And if he had food, he would share with others. He was a gentle man. 

176
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,280
Yes, this is Sherlock Hong Ju.

177
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,960
Ah, yes!  You guys have been doing great work.

178
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,500
I have some important information regarding the culprit.

179
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,080
Yes, please tell me.

180
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,330
I'd like to speak directly to PD Choi Hong Ju.

181
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,620
- If you can tell me the information first, we'll then have it checked– 
  - Oh, is that so? 

182
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,980
But I need to tell her directly since this is important information.

183
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,020
Then, there's not much I can do.

184
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,870
- All right– 
 - Wait a moment.

185
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,630
You're not kidding, right?

186
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,050
- I'll connect you to her. 
 - Ah, this is a national broadcast, right?

187
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,730
Can you modify my voice?

188
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,810
I mean, if the killer recognizes my voice, it puts me in danger, doesn't it?

189
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,760
Do you have an important tip in relation to this case?

190
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,300
It's not about the case, but I have something to ask Detective Go Mu Chi.

191
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,680
Detective, let me ask you directly.

192
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,780
Do you think you are qualified to be standing in that spot right now?

193
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,590
There are rumors that you frequent gambling places and take bribes from criminals.

194
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,260
Is that correct?

195
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,860
I'm not sure where you've heard of those things, but they're baseless rumors.

196
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,040
Okay, let's leave it at that. Then, what about the rumor that you are a member of one of the bereaved families from the Head Hunter case?

197
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,190
Ah, why aren't you answering? I asked you a question.

198
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,950
 What does that have to do with this case? 

199
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,600
The rumors must be true then.

200
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,220
I've heard that Headhunter cut your mother's head off right in front of you.

201
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,110
It must have been a big shock for you.

202
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,630
Oh yes!  The murderer who killed the two sisters, who jumped off the roof not long ago.

203
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,910
The one who beat the sisters to death with a hammer.

204
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,390
Did he really jump off?

205
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,240
Could it be that you actually pushed him?

206
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
I did not.

207
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,750
I'm just kidding. It's a joke.

208
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,450
It's not like a detective would actually kill somebody.

209
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:56,060
But still, in your mind, you wanted to push him dozens, no hundreds of times. Right?

210
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,940
Looks like you still can't answer.

211
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,340
And what does silence mean? It means acknowledgment.

212
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,390
You're doing this show just because you want to catch him and kill him, right?

213
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,970
You don't really care if the kid lives or dies, do you?

214
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,480
The reason why I'm calling

215
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,640
is because I'm worried. Out of worry, yeah?

216
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,450
You're someone who can't control his emotions when you see a killer,

217
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,520
and now you're doing this broadcast to save someone else's precious child–

218
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,130
 Worry? You worry about yourself, you crazy bastard! You son of a bitch! 

219
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,500
What? Did you just curse?

220
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,690
If you get this upset with a viewer who says something, frankly from the bottom of their heart,

221
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,330
I wonder what you'd be like in front of the culprit.

222
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,870
I mean, when you're supposed to be calm and composed–

223
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,740
Hello?

224
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,220
 This is enough warming up. 

225
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,960
 I need to get started with the real game now. 

226
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,880
 The only reason I am doing this broadcast is to save Han Kook. 

227
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,930
 This broadcast is the only way to save Han Kook right now. 

228
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,370
 Please help us to continue this broadcast. 

229
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,730
 Senior, the delivery has arrived. 

230
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,780
Yes.

231
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:17,420
I am told that an item presumed to have been sent by the culprit just arrived at the studio.

232
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,260
 Do you believe me now? 

233
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,540
 It's exactly when the broadcast ends. 

234
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,660
 If by then, you can't tell me the reason why this kid has to die,  

235
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,840
 then you will see an unforgettable show. 

236
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,220
 The plan needs to work. 

237
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,770
 However, this is insufficient to make any conclusions. So we will ask Han Kook's mother for confirmation. 

238
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,000
Is the child in this video, your son?

239
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,370
Yes, that's my Han Kook.

240
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,270
- Are you sure? 
 - I know my son well.

241
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,970
- He is my Han Kook. 
 - I was told to deliver this here.

242
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,890
 There is another delivery addressed to the detective. 

243
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,720
That's different from what I sent.

244
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,380
 What do you mean? 

245
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,940
That's not the video I sent! It's different.

246
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,250
 I did have a feeling that something was off. 

247
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,670
 The delivery guy! 

248
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,000
 Detective Go Mu Chi has left for a while to fact check. 

249
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,640
 We will continue to answer the calls for any information. 

250
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,440
Stop!

251
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,070
It's a burner phone. Hey you. Where did you pick that item up?

252
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,750
Oh, well... I was told that it was left inside a locker at Shimjeon Station.

253
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,120
- Shimjeon Station? 
 - Yes.

254
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,250
Then, can I leave now?

255
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,790
We will let you go after we confirm this.

256
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,970
I will go and check the CCTV then come back.

257
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,840
Detective Go, you should hurry back. You need to do the broadcast.

258
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,370
- You go along with him. 
 - Yes.

259
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,600
- Call me as soon as you've confirmed it. 
 - Yes!

260
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,550
Stop there!

261
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,230
- Oh! 
 - Th-Th-That's... 
 - It's Han Kook!

262
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,850
He's alive!

263
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,180
What a relief.

264
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,980
- Detective Go, Han Kook was caught on the CCTV. 
   - What? 

265
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,660
According to the CCTV footage, Han Kook left something in the locker.

266
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,360
 - Send me the footage right away.  
 - Yes.

267
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,620
Send this video to this address, please.

268
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,320
I sent it.

269
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,370
- Hey, Dong Koo, I'll go to the washroom for a bit. 
 - Yeah.

270
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,540
- Keep an eye on it. 
 - Yeah.

271
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,490
Thanks to our viewers' active involvement in sharing information,

272
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:00,730
 we were able to find out the identity of homeless Mr. Kim that even the investigators weren't able to. 

273
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,720
 Even the most minor tips can become clues to finding the culprit. 

274
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,450
So you can call the number below or use the live chatting–

275
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,870
   
     
     

276
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:18,690
Gosh, Korean netizens... You really are something.

277
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,540
- You saw Han Kook? 
 - Ah, damn. I finally got through.

278
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,940
 Why the hell did you hang up on someone calling with a tip? So rude! 

279
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,920
 Why didn't you let my call through? 

280
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,200
You're treating a perfectly normal person like a drunkard or a mental patient.

281
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,950
- Excuse me— 
 - Detective Go Mu Chi,

282
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,810
has your anger gone down a little now?

283
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,340
- If you make a prank call during a broadcast, you will be penalized— 
 - It's not a prank call though.

284
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,270
Do I get punished just because I called out of curiosity?

285
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,220
 It's fake, isn't it? The video of the kid you just showed. 

286
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,090
It's obviously fake.

287
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,290
 Fake? This video was actually sent in by the killer. 

288
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,470
It's hard to believe you.

289
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:03,280
I mean, why would the killer go through the trouble of hiding the kid's face by putting the mask on?

290
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,820
Isn't the kid's face covered because he isn't Han Kook?

291
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,830
All right. I will prove to you that this video was indeed sent by the killer.

292
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,540
We have secured the CCTV footage of the person who placed the envelope containing the USB with that video footage inside a subway station locker.

293
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,690
Take a look.

294
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,080
   

295
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,740
Dong Koo, you should go back to the broadcasting station first.

296
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,210
What about you?

297
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,680
Han Kook came here, so there might be witnesses.

298
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,980
Really? Then I'll help you find them.

299
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,580
Hey, look, if we're both here and some problem happens on Detective Go Mu Chi's side

300
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,750
then there's no one to help him. It's better for you to be there.

301
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,140
But still.

302
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,600
Wouldn't being there be more helpful for your script-writing?

303
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,420
- Right? For realism. Research? 
 - Exactly.

304
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,400
Gosh, you're the only one who looks out for me.

305
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,890
But will you really be fine? Your leg is probably hurting.

306
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,470
Don't worry. Head back now.

307
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,090
Anyhow, call me if something happens!

308
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,550
Yeah!

309
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,590
What a bothersome idiot.

310
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,850
This is SBC's Fact Check team, right?

311
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,100
I'm watching the TV right now.

312
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,680
Yes, Kim Han Kook's video.

313
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,150
That's not Han Kook.

314
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,610
About a month ago, I saw him on "Hope for Young Children." 
    

315
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes, yes, yes! When I saw Han Kook on that show,

316
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,750
he had a burn scar behind his ear.

317
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,530
Right, but the video sent by the culprit doesn't have the scar.

318
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,880
Yes, please look into that.

319
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,320
Excuse me. Have you seen this child by any chance?

320
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,700
Excuse me. Have you seen this child by any chance?

321
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,920
It's about time they come.

322
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,890
 Young officer! 

323
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,710
Yes, what's the matter?

324
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,500
First, they stole the footage.

325
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,150
And now they're making a mess trying to pry open the locker.

326
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,540
- Who is? 
 - Come on, quick!

327
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,000
You're interrupting our investigation.

328
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,680
 Hey, hey! 

329
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,990
- I said you're interrupting! 
 - I'm not going to move.

330
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,080
 This is a very important investigation. 

331
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,500
 We just need to check. 

332
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,640
Don't move! Freeze!

333
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,060
Stop!

334
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,260
Freeze! Freeze, I said.

335
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,630
Look! This locker holds important evidence.

336
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:22,050
If you take the evidence, you will be guilty of tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice,

337
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,060
and theft.

338
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,090
This is important coverage for us as well.

339
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,420
If you continue to not cooperate, then I will have to forcefully arrest you.

340
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,670
Please, step aside.

341
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,660
So, the killer made a fake video and sent it to us?

342
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,590
I need to verify the video, but I think you're right.

343
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,300
Why would he do that? Why the hell?

344
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,340
Maybe this is what his plan was from the beginning.

345
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,980
That we wouldn't be able to finish the broadcast.

346
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,330
We're doing this broadcast because he wanted us to. So why would he do that?

347
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,600
The broadcast itself might not have been his goal.

348
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,890
By making the broadcast dramatic like this,

349
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,180
he must have wanted to put himself in the spotlight.

350
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,250
If not that then...

351
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,020
Then what?

352
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,100
What if he set up this entire thing?

353
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,950
- Yes. 
  - Detective Go. 

354
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,750
I stopped the reporters from trying to open the locker next to locker 13.

355
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,320
But there's a USB inside that locker, too.

356
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,000
A USB?  Check what's on it right away.

357
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,790
   

358
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,530
   

359
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,980
- Yes. 
 - Detective, this file seems to be corrupted.

360
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,290
 Nothing is showing up. 

361
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,350
Then, take the USB to Mujin Station. It'll take you five minutes if you go by taxi.

362
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,590
Taxi! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

363
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,440
Thank you.

364
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,690
- Come on. Pick up. 
 - This is driving me crazy.

365
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,820
I'm sending another video your way.

366
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,350
I need you to restore it as soon as possible. As fast as you can.

367
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,160
Yeah.

368
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,260
 Wrap up the broadcast. It's the boss' orders. 

369
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,330
What do you mean? We still have fifteen minutes remaining!

370
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,410
 Everything's a mess because you rigged the broadcast. 

371
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,190
The CEO is fuming!

372
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,800
Don't argue with me. Wrap up the show after the commercial is over.

373
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,030
 Leave one camera running for the closing remarks. Pack up the rest. 

374
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,180
I will direct the remainder of the show. Detective Go will be the host.

375
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,190
    
    

376
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,450
 This game has become quite boring. It should be much more closer. 

377
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:38,450
 All right, Go Mu Chi. Let me give you a hint. 

378
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,330
Can you zoom in here, please?

379
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,220
You can see something there, right?

380
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,520
Detective, I see something in the reflection of the mask that Han Kook is wearing.

381
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,050
It-It's a wall.

382
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:57,770
It's got some pictures and newspaper clippings, but I can't see them properly.

383
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,190
There's a drawing, too. Or is it a cartoon?

384
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,290
Oh, well, it's not a cartoon.

385
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,120
I'll send you a zoomed-in video of what I see.

386
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,020
What is that?

387
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,360
 All right, now go ahead and try to guess, Go Mu Chi. 

388
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:25,090
- I'll head back to the broadcasting station. Call me when it's restored. 
 - Yes.

389
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:30,160
Hello, sir, was Byeon Sun Yeong wearing a hat when she got off work?

390
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,990
Oh, she was?

391
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,860
What was the color of that hat?

392
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,560
Are you sure?

393
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,990
I got it.  The reason why Na Chi Kook's clothes were taken off.

394
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,640
All right, everyone. What is it that you see here?

395
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:02,750
It's hard to say for sure because it's quite decomposed but it looks like an insect.

396
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,390
I've got entomologist Dr. Lee Pil Sung on the line.

397
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,390
Doctor, what is this?

398
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,320
Then...

399
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,130
is it possible that it's a grasshopper?

400
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,520
Oh, yes. I see it's spines.

401
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,700
You can see them under the light brown borderline. It is a black-rimmed grasshopper.

402
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,490
Yes, everybody... What you're seeing right now is a grasshopper.

403
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,790
It was found in the throat of victim Park Jong Ho.

404
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,330
The killer put it in his throat after he killed him.

405
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:36,090
Guys, what comes to your mind when you hear grasshopper?

406
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,890
It's the children's story, '"he Ant and the Grasshopper," right?

407
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,500
The death of these five victims...

408
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,330
   

409
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,860
are related to children's stories.

410
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:05,560
You're watching, right? I'll tell you exactly why you chose those people to be your victims.

411
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,020
Byeon Sun Yeong: Little Red Riding Hood

412
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,410
Park Jong Ho: The Ant and the Grasshopper

413
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,830
Na Chi Kook: The Emperor's New Clothes

414
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,960
Kim Seong Kyu: The Honest Woodcutter

415
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,230
Jo Mi Jeong: The Fox and the Grapes

416
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,330
You're killing people to act out these children's stories!

417
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,690
   

418
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,420
   

419
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,400
Bingo! Marvelous, Detective Go.

420
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,170
You're smarter than I thought. You actually found the reason.

421
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,830
I'm glad you called. Why did it take you so long?

422
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,810
It was quite boring, talking all by myself.

423
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,690
I'm glad you're getting closer to the answer.

424
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,060
I felt the need to congratulate you at the least.

425
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,430
And here I thought you were just putting on a show without actually knowing a thing.

426
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,030
 First, tell me if Han Kook is safe. 

427
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,520
 He's doing quite well. 

428
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,870
 Okay, so let's hear the answer that you found out. 

429
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,560
 I found something interesting in the ending of all the stories you've acted out. 

430
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,090
 All of them have a lesson. 

431
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,330
 "The Ant and the Grasshopper" is about the grasshopper who lazed around all day. 

432
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:16,060
 "The Honest Woodcutter" is about the woodcutter's greed to have every ax beside his own. 

433
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,630
 "The Fox and the Grapes" is a story that warns about the fox's gluttony. 

434
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,630
What about "Little Red Riding Hood?"

435
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,030
 The wolf's lust. It's a warning against lust. 

436
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,490
Then what about "The Emperor's New Clothes?"

437
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:32,400
 It was a mockery of the emperor's arrogance. He didn't even realize he was naked because he was drunk on power. 

438
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,270
Interesting.

439
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:39,100
Lust, sloth, pride, greed, gluttony.

440
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,700
These are the 7 deadly sins from Dante's Purgatory, you bastard!

441
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,570
Oh, that seems possible.

442
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,190
But did the people I killed commit those sins?

443
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,560
They didn't.

444
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,970
Then, why did I kill them?

445
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,300
As to why you killed them...

446
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,500
 Hey, we got the signal. You need to buy us some time. 

447
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,860
You know, right? That my parents were killed by the Headhunter?

448
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,900
So, I know psychopaths very well.

449
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,390
 I studied quite a bit about them, you see. They are really meticulous with everything they do. 

450
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,280
 But you? You aren't like that. 

451
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,120
 You keep leaving traces all around the place. 

452
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,580
Try guessing where you slipped up. Let me give you a hint.

453
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,400
It was about 15 days ago.

454
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,500
 Detective Go Mu Chi, 

455
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,140
are you stalling so that you can trace the location of this phone?

456
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,300
Or are you just rambling on because you can't find the answer?

457
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,110
You don't have much time left. Hurry up if you want to save the kid.

458
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,040
   

459
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,780
Shall we get the show started?

460
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,050
Don't be nervous.

461
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:30,360
Your brother is quite smart. He'll definitely find the right answer.

462
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,150
He wouldn't let you die, would he?

463
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,190
Why you killed them?

464
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,230
I don't know why, but you have a grudge against God.

465
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,070
You kill people then bend their finger so it's facing the cross.

466
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:50,950
You? You've decided to go against everything God preaches, right?

467
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,740
So you thought those who didn't commit the seven deadly sins were sinners.

468
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,860
 A person without lust. A person without laziness. A person without arrogance. A person without greed. 

469
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,480
 A person without gluttony. A person without envy. A person without anger! 

470
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,980
 These are the people you consider sinners! That's why you punished them as you pleased! 

471
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,000
We got a call.

472
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,320
- Just you try to hang up the phone again. 
  - Bingo! 

473
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,040
Indeed you are smart, Detective Go Mu Chi.

474
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,970
- This is why I am your fan. 
 - Byeon Sun Yeong.

475
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:30,540
You killed her because she never fell any temptation and lived only for her daughter. For having no sexual desire!

476
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:35,760
Ah, that stupid wench!  Her face wasn't too bad so what problem did she have with using her body a little?

477
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,370
It would have made her daughter's life more comfortable, don't you think so?

478
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:43,390
 You put a grasshopper down the throat of the diligent Park Jong Ho? You crazy bastard! 

479
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:48,090
That punk wouldn't have died if he lived being more careless. What was the point in living like that?

480
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,230
He died without saying a peep like an ant under my feet.

481
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,870
But it was a lot of fun seeing him resist until the very last moment.

482
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,620
 What did you just say, you bastard? So what about Jo Mi Jeong? 

483
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:07,550
She ate a lot and threw up after the show, but she acted like she didn't gain weight.

484
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:12,690
There's nothing wrong with eating a lot. Her emaciated figure was seriously revolting.

485
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,600
As for Na Chi Kook,

486
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,480
when I saw him acting humble in his interview,

487
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,450
I wanted to kill him quickly to relieve him of his crimes.

488
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:30,280
 And what about that pitiful grandma? 

489
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,520
 Why did you kill the grandma, you bastard? 

490
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,690
Oh, that? She just got unlucky.

491
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,530
Do you think I would have wanted to kill that old lady?

492
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:43,030
They need to fight back and resist for it to be fun.

493
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,400
- It was so boring. 
  - How can you even say that? 

494
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,730
 Did you not think of her family? 

495
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,420
 Can you even call yourself human after doing that? 

496
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,540
- We got a location! 
 - We found it.

497
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,630
- Track it now! 
 - They got a signal. A little bit more.

498
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,550
 Drag it for just a little bit more. 

499
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,640
 He stopped. 123 Seongho-dong. 

500
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,150
Oh boy, we got him!

501
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:13,060
Detective Go Mu Chi, that isn't the question I asked you.

502
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,930
The time is ticking. Why do you think the kid will die?

503
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:22,090
 There was bread next to where Han Kook disappeared. You lured Han Kook with this bread. 

504
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:27,120
 But Han Kook couldn't go home in the end. Even the birds didn't eat this bread. 

505
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,840
Bird?

506
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,860
 Right. You wanted to use "Hansel and Grete"' to prove something regarding one of the sins. 

507
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,560
So what is the child's crime?

508
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,610
 The two remaining sins from the Seven Deadly Sins, envy and anger. 

509
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,010
 Han Kook, don't you hate your father for abandoning you? 

510
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:51,560
 No, I don't hate him. I'm sure he had his own reasons for doing that. 

511
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,150
 Do you want to say something to your father, since he might be watching this? 

512
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:01,380
 Dad, I miss you. I love you. 

513
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,470
 This is what you saw. 

514
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,670
- And so? 
  - The ending of "Hansel and Gretel." 

515
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,210
 The witch who ate children by putting them in a pot and killing them, right? 

516
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,110
 Out of anger. Because she was so angry! 

517
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:18,530
 You wanted Han Kook to be mad at his father for abandoning him. You wanted him to be furious. 

518
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:24,380
 You are about to kill an innocent child for an absurd reason. 

519
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,980
 There you go. I gave you the correct answer. 

520
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,980
 Now stop this shit and let the child go. 

521
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,020
The criminal is inside. He is watching the broadcast while on the phone.

522
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,480
 You think you've become a God, right? I've seen bastards like you. 

523
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,260
 You chose people who didn't commit the seven deadly sins and punished them however you wanted. 

524
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,070
 It's like you've fallen into the delusion that you've become God. 

525
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,850
 But you know what? You are not a god. Heck, you're not even human. 

526
00:34:54,850 --> 00:35:00,860
 You're just a horrible monster. A monster that can never be saved. 

527
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:05,540
 You're worse than trash... So pitiful. 

528
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,490
You're done for!

529
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,910
Nope, you got it wrong.

530
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,660
What should I do, Father?

531
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,820
Your brother got it wrong.

532
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,540
Hey, the answer is anger. I got it right. Where is the child?

533
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,170
We just restored the USB from Shimjeon Station.

534
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,950
Where is the child, you son of a bitch!

535
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,820
You come out right now!

536
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,100
Hello? Hello!

537
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,840
The one who was supposed to be angry isn't Han Kook, it's him.

538
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,400
The sinner who didn't get angry.

539
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,180
F-Father!

540
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:30,580
- Brother. 
  - I told you that if you don't give me the correct answer before the broadcast ends that I would kill him. Time's up. 

541
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,020
- Brother.
  - Does it make sense? 

542
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,500
 The Headhunter killed his parents by cutting their heads off, 

543
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,280
made his body this way, and yet he forgave him for all of it.

544
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:44,560
- It's quite a sight. 
  - Brother! 

545
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,350
You son of a bitch! I'm going to kill you if you lay a hand on my brother! You bastard!

546
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,190
 Did you say anger is a sin? Why? 

547
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:55,260
Not being angry is a sin.

548
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,800
Get angry, at least now. Then I'll forgive your sin.

549
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,700
Brother, do it.

550
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,400
Get angry at me.

551
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,160
Get angry at me. It's me who made you like that.

552
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,630
 When we were in that camping car, when we were young, 

553
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,950
if only I hadn't made a noise you would have gotten caught by that bastard.

554
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,860
 I just watched as you were getting beaten up by that scumbag. 

555
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,990
Brother, I- I made you like that.

556
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:41,890
Brother, I'm sorry. It's all my fault. You forgave him because of me.

557
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:46,230
 So please get angry at me. I beg you. 

558
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,850
Mu Chi,

559
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:53,150
there has never been a moment I hated you.

560
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:56,420
 No, no, hate me! 

561
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,100
 Please, hate me! 

562
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,090
I don't want to see you break down or

563
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:07,860
destroy your life for revenge.

564
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:18,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

565
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,130
Let my brother go. I'm sorry!

566
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:27,170
 I acted out against you without knowing any better. I'm sorry. 

567
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:32,020
 Kill me. Kill me. I'll die instead of him! 

568
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,630
 Please let my poor brother live! Let him live! 

569
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,690
Mu Chi, I'm all right.

570
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:45,310
No matter what happens to me, it will never be your fault. Do you understand?

571
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:49,460
This is your last chance. Be angry. Be furious.

572
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,530
Get furious at Headhunter who killed your parents

573
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:55,990
and at the world that didn't execute him.

574
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,890
Please, Brother.

575
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,490
My beloved younger brother,

576
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,320
I have always...

577
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,890
felt sorry for you.

578
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:19,590
 Please! Brother! 

579
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,970
I'm sorry.

580
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,900
No!

581
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,060
No!

582
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:23,940
M-May the Lord...

583
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:29,250
s-save your soul.

584
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,050
Father!

585
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,900
That crazy psycho!

586
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,460
Ah, this world, really!

587
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,680
Was the Father killed?

588
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,740
That bastard killed the Father.

589
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:10,270
- Sir, please go to the Gudong Cathedral. 
 - My goodness!

590
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:13,450
What happened to the world, really!

591
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:35,810
Excuse me!

592
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,270
Excuse me!  Excuse me!

593
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:39,310
Excuse me!

594
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,530
 Mint. 

595
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:48,770
 That's weird. I killed that man. 

596
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,500
Excuse me.

597
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,360
 This one you're dealing with is not a person. He is a monster. 

598
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,040
 You can lose what you love the most! 

599
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,660
 What I love the most? 

600
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,790
 I've already lost this when I was 8. 

601
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,050
 You saw it. 

602
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,720
 There's nothing else to lose. 

603
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,950
Brother! Brother!

604
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,880
Brother! Brother!

605
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,930
Hey, Mu Chi! Hey!

606
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:40,100
Hey!

607
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,240
Let go!

608
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,980
You!

609
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,070
Brother!

610
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,320
Mu Chi!

611
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,340
 We have just received a video sent by the perpetrator. 

612
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:26,060
 This 3-minute length video, it's a video of Han Kook. 

613
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:31,040
 After an emergency meeting, we decided to show it to the public. 

614
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,490
 When the farmer only gave delicious food to the donkey, 

615
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,880
 the goat started to get jealous. 

616
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,010
 The farmer then killed the goat 

617
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:43,260
 in order to save the donkey. 

618
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,460
   

619
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,550
Goat man, make your choice.

620
00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:00,560
If you want to be saved, you have to kill the donkey.

621
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,100
 If you don't kill the donkey, the goat will die instead. 

622
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,400
Detective Go!

623
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,390
Open the door! You've been like this for days!

624
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:14,470
You'll end up starving to death!

625
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,610
Please, open the door!

626
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:19,220
 Oh please, Detective! 

627
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,590
 Can you at least let me in then? 

628
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,390
Please open the door. We must find Han Kook!

629
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:28,480
Detective Go!

630
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:39,550
It's no fun if you do it like this.

631
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:46,120
Crawl out of there fast so I can have some fun.

632
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,900
It must hurt.

633
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:59,330
How come someone did this to a child's face?

634
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:03,340
No, it's not hurting.

635
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,760
Get some sleep. I'll bring you some things you may need.

636
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,110
Wait up!

637
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:20,460
I think I cut his arm with my knife.

638
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,810
Really? What?

639
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:25,060
Did you cut it or think you cut it?

640
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:30,990
When he was holding my head, I swung my arm holding the knife.

641
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,600
And I felt something.

642
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,390
Where? Which side?

643
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:37,680
Well... It was...

644
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,100
Left side.

645
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,910
I think it was his left arm.

646
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:42,560
Left arm?

647
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,030
Right. I'll tell this to Detective Kang.

648
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,770
Gosh, how dirty.

649
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,280
Are you all right?

650
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,870
I'm fine.

651
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,070
He hasn't even touched it.

652
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:04,010
I heard that if you keep drinking without eating any food, you could die of acute alcohol poisoning.

653
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:06,540
We need to make him eat somehow.

654
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,530
What should I make for him?

655
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:10,130
You really are quite devoted.

656
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:13,560
If you make food for someone who has no will left to live, would he even eat it?

657
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,090
But we should help him eat at least one bite.

658
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,800
What's this?

659
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:25,480
This has got to be it!

660
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,560
Gosh, this guy's boring me.

661
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,200
Go Mu Chi, you need to play with me.

662
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,870
We need to finish the game that we started.

663
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:40,280
Come on out. Crawl out of there already.

664
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,650
Detective!

665
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:47,640
Do you remember when we were gathered at my house, to prepare for the broadcast, you had enjoyed eating japchae along with other food items?

666
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,470
It was...

667
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,210
Actually, Father who had come and given them to me.

668
00:50:55,210 --> 00:51:00,360
 I had lied then since I was worried you wouldn't eat it. 

669
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,040
 This is the last of what was left. 

670
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,070
Whether you eat it or throw it away, it's up to you now.

671
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:21,910
All right, let's see if you can stay holed up in your house even after this.

672
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:53,350
This is the Goatman's end. Detective Go Mu Chi what are you doing?

673
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:56,000
Are you going to give up on Han Kook just like that?

674
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:05,390
If you can't find me in three days, then the entire nation will get to see  Han Kook's lungless corpse.

675
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,660
Keep that in mind.

676
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,290
You've got exactly three days left, until midnight.

677
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:24,300
 Breaking News: The killer has released a video of Kim Han Kook, yet again. 

678
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,120
 The murderer has called Detective Go Mu Chi to the stage again. 

679
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:37,550
 Detective Go Mu Chi is in shock due to the loss of his older brother. The public is left wondering whether he will be able to overcome his loss, and find Han Kook. 

680
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:40,250
It would be better for him to not see it.

681
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,090
I- I couldn't tell him about it.

682
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,790
Ah, but why the hell is that bastard doing this to Detective Go?

683
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:04,250
Why do you think? It's because I'm bored.

684
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:10,640
Bong Yi, I'll have to leave for a while.

685
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,260
He should have seen it.

686
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,510
And well, if he hasn't then I can just let him know about it.

687
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,250
Okay, Go Mu Chi.

688
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,760
Let's get this game started.

689
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,570
What happened to Seong Yo Han's car?

690
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,750
- Did you find it? 
 - We are still looking for it.

691
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,520
We don't have time! We have to find it soon or Han Kook will die!

692
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,330
Do you think we are idling around here? We are all working hard!

693
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:06,360
What's that?

694
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,140
Hey!

695
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:16,750
   

696
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,820
   
   
   

697
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,250
   

698
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:24,060
 Goat's mom, who was filled with wrath, cut open the wolf's stomach  

699
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:31,030
 and took out the corpses of all the babies, then filled the stomach with rocks and sewed it up. 

700
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,490
 One who does not rage is a sinner. 

701
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:40,730
 Gu Mu Won, I will judge you. 

702
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:53,370
Han Kook, Detective Go didn't keep his promise.

703
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:57,890
We need to show that Detective later on

704
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:01,950
that I kept my end of the promise.

705
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,630
 One who does not envy is a sinner. 

706
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:13,620
 The deadline to rescue Han Kook was yesterday at midnight. 

707
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,910
 The experts are predicting that things might not turn out well for him. 

708
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,190
 - The police have not found any clues on the killer...  
 - Yes, Detective Kang.

709
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,090
Detective Go?

710
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,890
Is he not at home?

711
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:25,980
What?

712
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,470
Bong Yi's grandmother's DNA was found at that doctor's house?

713
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,700
 Why was it found in Seong Yo Han's house? 

714
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,720
 What if...? 

715
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,060
 It was Seong Yo Han? 

716
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,890
 And not Kim Joon Sung? 

717
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:44,720
 How did this bastard have these pictures? He knows everything about me. 

718
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:54,540
That mint scent. It was you.

719
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,290
Turns out I killed the wrong person.

720
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:02,490
I did wonder why that idiot Kim Joon Sung kept his mouth shut till the very end.

721
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,890
It was because of you. To save you.

722
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:10,510
Save that child first.

723
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,050
Han Kook, who is right below you.

724
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:17,660
So, you're here to save Han Kook?

725
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:00,860
 The personal items of boxing gym director A and restaurant employee B who were killed recently 

726
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,890
 and unidentified homeless person C, were found at the crime scene causing great shock. 

727
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:08,050
 The police have ruled these cases to be part of serial killings. 

728
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:12,520
 They will continue their investigation by forming a special task force. 

729
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:21,800
 A men's wristwatch was also found at the crime scene, aside from the personal items of four victims... 

730
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,120
 My mother told me, 

731
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:29,490
 that there was another child besides me, who had the monster gene. 

732
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:33,420
 As I lived, I was always curious. 

733
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,710
 About what happened to that child. 

734
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,280
 Did he become a predator like me? 

735
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,230
 Or if he became a normal person, unlike me. 

736
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:07,860
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 🐭  The Mouseketeers 🐭 @Viki.com 

737
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,030
   

738
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:25,760
 In the end, God did not listen to my prayers. 

739
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:31,760
 And I ended up becoming a murderer.
