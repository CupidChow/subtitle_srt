2
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,260
   

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,360
   

4
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,950
Scalpel!

5
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,430
Don't feel wronged.

6
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,300
This way, you'll be alive again.

7
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,820
   

8
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,860
Hi, Bong Yi. I just sent you a photo.

9
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,860
 Could you check if that's the doctor? 

10
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,500
Oppa, this is the man who operated on you.

11
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,390
How did Han Seo Joon operate on my head?

12
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,510
Why?

13
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,620
   

14
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,350
   

15
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,530
   

16
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,010
   

17
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,490
   

18
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,390
   

19
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,390
F25-17S-EX...

20
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,000
What is this?

21
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,820
   

22
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,960
F... Woman...

23
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,590
M is a man, that's right.

24
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,350
And the numbers after are... the victim's ages...

25
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,950
Then the numbers that follow indicate the order in which the victims died?

26
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,050
The order of deaths were...

27
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,600
The order of deaths...

28
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,890
   

29
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,420
Kim Hyun Sik was kidnapped before Joo Mi Hye was though...

30
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,360
 SEX... 

31
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,550
What does SEX mean now?

32
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,320
Pinky finger... hole...

33
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,200
Dot.

34
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,340
 S-E-X... 

35
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,570
Is it short for something?

36
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,710
 Animal testing identification is used to identify each animal during testing. 

37
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,890
A hole is placed in the ear of a mouse to indicate that it has finished being tested on.

38
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,710
 Ear tag, ear punch, experiment... 

39
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,360
 Subject of Experiment... 

40
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,860
Subject / Experiment...

41
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,280
Subject, S, Experiment, EX...

42
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,130
Short for Subject of Experiment.

43
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,730
Song Soo Jeong, F (Female), 25 years old, 17th subject of experiment.

44
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,000
Subject of experiment.

45
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,240
Did he put a hole in her finger since she didn't have an ear?

46
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,410
To a person...

47
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,350
What kind of experiment was he doing on a person?

48
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,500
 It's impossible to gain a sense of smell due to brain injury. 

49
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,350
 There is just one way, though. 

50
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,350
 It would be possible if you switch out the frontal lobe where the olfactory bulb is. 

51
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,390
Switch out the...

52
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,300
- frontal lobe? 
  - What did you do to the mouse's head? 

53
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,250
 If you let it live, you'll end up like that snake. 

54
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,920
 Are you okay with that? 

55
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,010
 There's a bad brain inside this mouse. 

56
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,190
Bad brain inside it...

57
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,780
 You seem different. Not like how you were before. 

58
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,580
 Were you inside the psychopath's head or something? 

59
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,620
 What is this feeling? 

60
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,490
That's why, inside my head,

61
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,520
there was Seong Yo Han's memory...

62
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,350
Did you really

63
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,300
put Seong Yo Han, that murderer bastard's brain into my head?

64
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,440
Huh?

65
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,320
You found out sooner than expected. How boring.

66
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,780
Headhunter. The nickname people gave me...

67
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,620
I like it, too.

68
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,100
So the reason you took the heads of the victims after killing them was...

69
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,380
I killed them and opened their heads while their bodies were still fresh, and...

70
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,560
Everything was perfect.

71
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,380
The murders and the experiments.

72
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,550
Success was right in front of my eyes, but unfortunately,

73
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,860
- because of that little kid... 
  - Die! 

74
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,300
What is it? What's going on?

75
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,270
He was arrested for the charges of murdering Woo Jae Pil.

76
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,220
He killed Woo Jae Pil?

77
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,330
Why! In the end, you...

78
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,000
Crazy bastard! Why would you?

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,380
- What are you going to do with your life now? 
 - Sunbaenim!

80
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,460
Mu Chi! Mu Chi! Hey!

81
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,990
Sunbaenim!

82
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,950
Mu Chi.

83
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,750
Because of that kid, I ended up in here.

84
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,500
Don't look at me like that.

85
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,250
I've only sacrificed a few heads of human beings for the sake of humankind.

86
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,720
Every achievement requires trivial sacrifices, don't you agree?

87
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,700
Trivial?

88
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,790
A person's life is trivial?

89
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,620
Thanks to those sacrificed people, you are sitting there right now.

90
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,850
No! It's a lie!

91
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,630
What happened?

92
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,590
What do you mean, Detective Go killed Woo Jae Pil?

93
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,520
Let's talk outside.

94
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,250
He killed Woo Jae Pil in order to kill Han Seo Joon?

95
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,090
To go to the prison where Han Seo Joon is?

96
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,470
I've been on edge about it all this time, and he ended up causing this mess.

97
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,530
That was the reason. The reason he pushed you away.

98
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,760
He knew he would end up a murderer after killing Han Seon Joon.

99
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,570
He knew he couldn't drag you with... No.

100
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,000
He realized he can't do that.

101
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,830
That day, it was the day when he was going to confess to you.

102
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,910
You're going to bleed out of your eyes that way. Stop pushing it.

103
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,520
Hey. Oh, you got a nosebleed! A nosebleed!

104
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,730
You're like a high school student prepping for a college entrance exam. You've been awake for three days.

105
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,890
Get some sleep. I'll keep a lookout.

106
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,140
Those sisters got sexually assaulted and killed with a hammer.

107
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,470
How can you sleep when you think about their parents?

108
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,430
I will make sure to catch that bastard and lock him up.

109
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,850
- What is this? 
 - Oh! Hey!

110
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,750
What are you doing? Why go through my stuff?

111
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,020
Are you going to confess to PD Choi?

112
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,040
No.

113
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
Yeah, right!

114
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,790
Even a passing dog can see in your eyes how you feel about her.

115
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,970
Is it that obvious?

116
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,110
Very much. Completely.

117
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,340
When are you going to confess to her?

118
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:41,080
Tomorrow. She offered to buy me dinner for helping with her report.

119
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,550
I thought this would be my chance. What if she turns me down?

120
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,300
Hyung, seriously, I'm so nervous.

121
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,910
Feel this.

122
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,620
Hey, the great Go Mu Chi, who never even gets nervous in front of murderers.

123
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,860
Wow!

124
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,240
The power of love!

125
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,560
But isn't today the day of PD Choi's report?

126
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,500
What are you doing during a stakeout?

127
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,860
Then don't watch it.

128
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,640
 I have found peace in my heart.  
    

129
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,800
 I don't suffer from nightmares anymore. 

130
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,700
 After repenting and receiving forgiveness from God, I can't feel this comfortable. 

131
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,790
 These days, I am able to sleep very well. 

132
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,490
No... N-Now that I think about it, this is all captured on the black box.

133
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,800
I'm going to be disciplined for my negligence.

134
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,580
That's right.  Since today's his mother's memorial day, he might show up.

135
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,280
He might be wandering in this neighborhood, so I'll take a look around and come back.

136
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,890
 Now, 

137
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:02,420
 for the comfort of the bereaved families who suffered because of me, 

138
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,040
- Peace at heart? 
  - I will pray every day. 

139
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,600
Sleeping soundly now?

140
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,420
For me... For me, it's still like hell every day.

141
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,170
I have nightmares every day.

142
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,870
Son of a bitch!

143
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,030
 After repenting to God and asking for forgiveness, he has peace at heart. 

144
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,480
Why is he still alive?

145
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,590
Why haven't you been executed?

146
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,080
Aish!

147
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,370
 Have you found peace in your heart too? 

148
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,490
 We have met the victim's family and requested an interview. 

149
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,910
If the country doesn't do it, then I will do it.

150
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,900
I will kill you with my own hands.

151
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,420
I am going to kill you.

152
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,690
 Go Mu Won started studying theology at a late age. 

153
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:54,190
 He filed a petition to free Han Seo Joon from the death penalty. 

154
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,260
 Forgiveness made him live. 

155
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,020
No!

156
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,720
I'm telling you to run away. Run away.

157
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,820
I'm going to die!

158
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,940
Are you crazy? Are you crazy?

159
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,280
Come to your senses! Come to your senses Go Mu Chi!

160
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,360
If you try to stop me again, I'm going to kill you first.

161
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,500
You should've let him get fired. Why did you take him to the Evidence Storage Team?

162
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,640
Why did you have to take him to a team that provides guns?

163
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,560
You took him intentionally, didn't you?

164
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,980
You knew Mu Chi would do that and used that pitiful guy, huh?

165
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,610
You expected him to take revenge instead of you for your daughter.

166
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,100
You crazy guy. Stop it. How dare you rebel against your senior?

167
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,230
That's not right.

168
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,710
I'm sorry. He usually can't handle drinking. He's upset because of Mu Chi.

169
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,530
No. He's pitiful, so what to do?

170
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,240
   

171
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,890
Yes? I think it's a big shock.

172
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,550
   

173
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:10,580
 Well, it's CP (Cerebral Palsy). The location of the hemorrhage must've been rather tricky, but you did great work. 

174
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,320
 The patient's current condition is good as well. I understand she's a patient of Doctor Gary. 

175
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,280
 Precisely. Fifteen years ago, when she was 5 years old, she was diagnosed with CP by Doctor Gary. 

176
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,750
 Well, you're in good hands now. We'll take good care of you. 

177
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,710
 If you need anything, anything at all, don't hesitate to ask. 

178
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,690
 Are you the one reading this book? 

179
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:55,930
 Levodopa? This is a dopamine deficiency supplement. 

180
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,570
 Who gave you this? 

181
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,930
 That's strange. Where did you get that? 

182
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,210
 - There was only a man cleaning the rubbish bin.  
  - A cleaner? 

183
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:10,300
 I agree doctor. 

184
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,570
 Do you know why the professor asked me to do the surgery that you were supposed to do? 

185
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,600
 Your patient, Emma. 

186
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,470
 Nobody thinks she died by medical accident. 

187
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,490
 You killed her, didn't you? 

188
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,040
 What do you mean? 

189
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,100
 Doctor Gary's investigating. It's not long before the mask you're wearing comes off. 

190
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,280
 You've noticed? 

191
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,370
 Was I too careless? 

192
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,590
 Should I give a real performance then? 

193
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,150
 I guess you don't want to believe me. Well... 

194
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,770
 then go see it for yourself. 

195
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:41,310
 As you know, this patient was diagnosed as cerebral palsy by Dr. Gary at the age of five. 

196
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,030
 And has lived relying on a wheelchair. 

197
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:50,920
 From now on, I will show you a miraculous magic of this lady getting up. 

198
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,680
 Impossible! 

199
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,640
 Woah! Woah, woah! 

200
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,430
 Wow, wow. 

201
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:30,090
 This patient considered herself to have cerebral palsy for 15 years. 

202
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,670
 Wait! Are you implying that I misdiagnosed? 

203
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,330
 That's right. Misdiagnosis. 

204
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,780
 This patient is rare. This is a patient with a lack of dopamine in the body. 

205
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:49,120
 Due to a GCH-1. The mutation located in chromosome 14. 

206
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,060
 - It's called Segawa syndrome. 
 - Segawa syndrome? 

207
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,220
 I saw a book in the patient's room. 

208
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,310
 The congenital CP patients also have intellectual disabilities. 

209
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,530
 But it wasn't shown from this patient. 

210
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:09,550
 The symptoms of CP had features of worsening in the afternoon. 

211
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:15,370
 Accordingly, I made the patient take half a tablet of levodopa three times a day 

212
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,900
 to replenish the dopamine deficiency. 

213
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,810
 The results are as you can see. 

214
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,830
 Thank you Seo Joon. You gave me the chance at life. You're my savior. 

215
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,670
 I'm not the one you should be thankful to. 

216
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,600
 But him. 

217
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,540
 Daniel is in charge of that ward. He just got off. 

218
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,250
Oppa!

219
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,270
- Oppa. 
 - Jennifer.

220
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,460
Why did you come out?

221
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,920
Oppa. I walked 400 steps on my own today.

222
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,860
Wow, you did so well. The medicine is working well.

223
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,530
- Let's go in and take medicine. 
 - Oh right, what happened to that patient?

224
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,140
The one who was suffering from the same illness as me.

225
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,720
We're giving her this medicine in secret. Cerebral palsy? How could doctors not recognize it?

226
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,750
- Let's go in. 
 - You should tell them about it.

227
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,570
 He's the one who identified that this patient has Segawa syndrome. 

228
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:42,390
 If it wasn't for him, she would have been in a wheelchair, for her lifetime. 

229
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,590
 Thanks to him, Dr. Gary, who questioned who I was, quit that hospital. 

230
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:53,250
 And I was able to clear my name from being accused of killing the patient. 

231
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,490
 Excuse me. 

232
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,630
 It's a present. I am not in a position to do anything for you. 

233
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,520
 - There are tons of mice in our neighborhood. 
 - Why are you giving me that? 

234
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,430
 The school contacted me about whether I would be interested in working at the genetic research lab. 

235
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,360
 They said I can start attending school again. It's all thanks to you. 

236
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,300
 Thank you! 

237
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,170
 I'm the one who's thankful. 

238
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:30,880
 You were the greatest work that helped me hide my identity. 

239
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,230
 It's at my lab. 

240
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:41,060
 It's a place never before seen by anyone. 

241
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,500
 When you open that door, you'll open the Pandora's box. 

242
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,310
 But what kind of test are you doing with the mice? 

243
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,280
 Brain transplant. 

244
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,890
 - Really? 
 - The brain is connected by an amazing neural network, 

245
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,430
 so it's impossible to make contact with the nerve itself. 

246
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,050
 And I'm trying to connect the brain's complicated neural network. 

247
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,660
 I'm also looking for a way to prevent immunorejection once the transplant is done. 

248
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,300
 Why are you taking on that challenge? 

249
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:30,970
 Isn't it interesting that an entire person's life is contained in the mere 1.4 kilograms of the brain? 

250
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,600
 I can change that person's life, too. 

251
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,370
 This is what God is. 

252
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,050
 What else does a God do. 

253
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,850
 God? 

254
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,580
 What's your dream? 

255
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:52,020
 Me? I want to find good genes. 

256
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,820
 I want to find a good gene 

257
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,670
 and make a world without war or crime. 

258
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,960
 The senior researcher of our lab is Korean, 

259
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,680
 and he wants to make that kind of Utopia. 

260
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,810
 How about looking for bad genes? 

261
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,950
 You can stop crime itself by finding people with bad criminal genes. 

262
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,970
 It will become a world without crime then. 

263
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,260
 That's true. 

264
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,050
 Then I'll look for bad genes. 

265
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,820
 Fine! Let's make sure to fulfill our dreams. 

266
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,570
Where was it?

267
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,180
Do you have confidence? The confidence to know the truth?

268
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:46,230
 After killing Jennifer, I came back and became the best neurosurgeon in Korea. 

269
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,090
 While I was in high spirits being called the star doctor, 

270
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,990
 I had forgotten about my dream for a moment. 

271
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,640
 Daniel.  
    

272
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,440
 Until that punk turned the world upside down. 

273
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,530
 I had mentioned it without much thought. 
   

274
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,410
 How dare he invade my realm of God? 

275
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,300
This kind of stuff won't do. It just won't!

276
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,940
You haven't eaten yet. Have you?

277
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,410
Would you like to have some meat with me?

278
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,490
M-Meat?

279
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,280
If it's smoked ribs... Smoked ribs.

280
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,630
Smoked ribs.

281
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:21,830
 I needed a brain, a real human brain. 

282
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,160
We'll enter now.

283
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,980
Did something happen?

284
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,400
 - Detective Ko!  
  - Tell us what really happened! 

285
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,300
   

286
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,150
Ajusshi?

287
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,460
   

288
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,460
   

289
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,090
   

290
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,750
   

291
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,880
 Everything was perfect. 

292
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,810
 I was nearly successful in performing a brain transplant, too. 

293
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,730
 This Han Seo Joon's child, 

294
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,340
 was soon to be born too. 

295
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,080
 But I got a call from Daniel. 

296
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,430
 He's coming to Korea. 

297
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,150
 Wasn't work in England difficult? 

298
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,920
 Oh, at first it was very hard. 

299
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,630
 You were a mere prop to be used in my act. 

300
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,900
 To someone with inferior genes like you, 

301
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,430
 I can't give up the divine realm that I had dreamed of. 

302
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,390
 I became anxious. 

303
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,080
 I needed prey immediately. 

304
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,570
 If I could run one final experiment... 

305
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,520
 Two... 

306
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,590
 Three... 

307
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,500
 Three brains. 

308
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,700
 That was all the ingredients I needed 

309
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,240
 for my final experiment. 

310
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,710
 I'm going! 

311
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,900
 How is the speed? 

312
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,060
 - Faster! 
 - Where's the spring? 

313
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,160
 You see that over there? If you go there, you should find it. 

314
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,160
 P-Please don't kill us! 

315
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,820
 Run! Now! 

316
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,660
 No! 

317
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,250
 Everything was perfect. 

318
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,190
 In the past year, I'd killed nearly twenty people. 

319
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,640
 I made no mistakes during that time. 

320
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,180
 I was convinced it was a perfect murder... 

321
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,020
 Mom! 

322
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,590
Just wait... Han Seo Joon.

323
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,150
Detective Go Mu Chi killed the culprit in the Knot Incident.

324
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,770
Look at this guy.

325
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,630
You actually did it, kid.

326
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,940
You better keep your neck clean.

327
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,270
I must meet him.

328
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,400
There's something I need to say to him. There's something I must say to him!

329
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,930
- Ah, I just said you can't! 
 - But please!

330
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,510
 How can you have surgery on my head? You're on death row! 

331
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,840
 Was it the day after your accident? 

332
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,030
A guest came looking for you.

333
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,650
I'm officer Jeong Ba Reum.

334
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,690
 It was a very special guest. 

335
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,340
You remember me, don't you?

336
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,820
Of course, Officer Jeong Ba Reum.

337
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,780
I got the report that you were reinstated.

338
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,100
I'm glad to see you're well.

339
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,490
But what brings you to me?

340
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,340
You should have something to say to me.

341
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,030
Please get in.

342
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,940
This was your brain at the time of the accident.

343
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,780
And this... is Seong Yo Han's brain.

344
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,450
The damage to the frontal lobe was too great.

345
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,500
So we extracted Seong Yo Han's frontal lobe and grafted it onto yours.

346
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,990
But how did you know that Han Seo Joon knew how to do brain transplants?

347
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,110
On the day after your accident...

348
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,240
an anonymous tape was sent to me.

349
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,250
 Shoot this side, damnit! 

350
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,510
 Stop shaking the camera! 

351
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,320
This footage...

352
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,000
where did you find it?

353
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,120
I'll cut straight to the point.

354
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,510
Were you successful?

355
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,050
Your son crushed the skull of another young man.

356
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:50,430
The injury was so severe that there was nothing anyone could do about it.

357
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,730
But if a brain transplant were possible...

358
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,670
If it were possible?

359
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,160
I'm considering doing it.

360
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:08,410
I didn't see you as that kind of person, but you're quite dangerous.

361
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,980
What makes you confident enough to trust this procedure to me?

362
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,470
Surely, you wouldn't be ignorant of who I am?

363
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,150
He's already fated to die if we leave him alone.

364
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,830
Then what will I get in return?

365
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,560
If I do this procedure...

366
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,380
No, if I save that young man,

367
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,110
what will you do for me?

368
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,650
What would you like?

369
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,850
Give me freedom.

370
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:46,210
I've been locked up for 30 years. And my body is feeling cramped.

371
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:51,680
Truthfully, allowing talent such as mine waste away for the rest of my life like this

372
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,070
is a waste of national skill too.

373
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,720
Wouldn't you say?

374
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,930
Then in exchange, I'll save that young man.

375
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,090
You made sure to keep it confidential, right?

376
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,020
This is a closed ward, so it's a controlled area from outsiders.

377
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,170
It's all over if what happens today is leaked.

378
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,620
Don't worry.

379
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,570
Although there are a minimum number of medical staff ready for surgery,

380
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,860
they don't know what kind of surgery it is.

381
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,840
Are you saying the condition of saving me was a pardon?

382
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,820
No.

383
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,960
You can't?

384
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,920
Why?

385
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,920
I heard that no president goes against your advice, isn't that right?

386
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,860
I am merely the Chief of Staff who assists the president.

387
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,880
Even if I have the right to do a pardon,

388
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,520
I cannot accept Han Seo Joon's condition.

389
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,680
Okay.

390
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,880
Failed negotiation.

391
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,960
I request this favor.

392
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:02,890
Please. Save a young man's noble life.

393
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,590
This will be your only chance for you to make an atonement.

394
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,670
The whole country wants this.

395
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,370
Please save him. Jung Ba Reum.

396
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,490
An atonement.

397
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,580
An atonement?

398
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,630
Atonement?

399
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:31,410
Do you think he should receive a pardon for saving me?

400
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,020
But why does it have to be Seong Yo Han's brain?

401
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,720
Due to an issue with the move, we couldn't use the brain we had prepared.

402
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,620
Just then, I got a call that Seong Yo Han had died from acute respiratory arrest.

403
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,440
So with the consent of his biological father, Han Seo Joon—

404
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,260
You consider criminals worthy to be a legal guardian?

405
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,090
This is obviously a criminal act.

406
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:56,080
If I had to make an excuse, I couldn’t abandon the desperate wishes of the people.

407
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,390
It must have been for you guys to maintain power.

408
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,090
Because if I died, it would've affected the upcoming presidential election.

409
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:06,270
I can't do anything about how you feel, but I sincerely thought that losing a good young man like you

410
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:10,480
is taking away the citizens' hope.

411
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:17,150
If it weren't for the chief's decision, you would be dead right now!

412
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:22,370
She even kneeled down in front of Han Seo Joon to save you!

413
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,320
Will it be okay to let him go like this?

414
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,120
- If he tries to do anything– 
 - He won't be able to reveal anything.

415
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:37,850
Do you think he'll reveal to the world that he has a killer's brain in his head?

416
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,460
About Han Seo Joon,

417
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,590
why do you think he suddenly changed his mind?

418
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,870
What do I need to atone for?

419
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:02,620
For a lion hunting on a few rats?

420
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:17,450
After saying that, why would he say he'll do the surgery?

421
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,240
 Where did you get this video from? 

422
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,980
 Someone sent it anonymously. 

423
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,460
 You somehow survived? 

424
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,720
 I saw that only the part with Han Seo Joon's interview was erased from the documentary. 

425
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,830
 I was a little curious. 

426
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,010
What was it that he wanted to confirm?

427
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,950
Possibly...

428
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,530
No, there's no way he knows.

429
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,660
I should've killed him back then. Back then.

430
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,030
   

431
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,000
 The interview time is exactly 10 minutes. 

432
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,530
   

433
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:31,010
That's right. It's that girl. Park Hyun Soo.

434
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:35,960
So, the reason why you made that document...

435
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,650
Was your goal to kill me?

436
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,010
How fun.

437
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:48,460
Because of the documentary she filmed, a civil servant ended up getting killed.  Ha!

438
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,040
Oppa!

439
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,610
- Bong Yi. 
 - What happened?

440
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,770
I'm sorry. I had a situation–

441
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,120
No. Did Mu Chi Ajussi really kill the killer?

442
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,750
What do you mean? Who did Detective Go kill?

443
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,870
- Yeah? 
 - PD, what does this mean?

444
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,030
That Detective Go Mu Chi killed Woo Jae Pil?

445
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,730
He confessed. There's the testimony from the police who were on the scene too.

446
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:30,030
When the police arrived at the scene, Detective Go was holding the murder weapon.

447
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,810
- But, there is something strange. 
 - What is?

448
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:40,260
If he was holding a gun, then he should've shot the gun. Why did he use a scalpel?

449
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,130
Where is Woo Jae Pil's body?

450
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,140
There are no sign of defense marks.

451
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,940
When someone attacks you, you would instinctively resist.

452
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,920
Why didn't Woo Jae Pil resist?

453
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,370
I can sense anger from this wound.

454
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,850
If Detective Go murdered Woo Jae Pil, his motive would be

455
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:14,580
to get into the detention center where Han Seo Joon is, not because he's angry at Woo Jae Pil.

456
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,820
The deep wound in the neck indicates the intention of killing.

457
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,720
Overkill. He's already dead but he keeps getting stabbed.

458
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,130
The person lost control because of tremendous anger.

459
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,450
If it were Detective Go, he would've stabbed a vital spot at once.

460
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:35,820
Could you please sign here?

461
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,070
The police came and took all the footage with Detective Go Mu Chi.

462
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,660
We wanted to see a different part.

463
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,330
What is that?  The thing that's shining.

464
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,320
I will try to enlarge it.

465
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,110
 How, to the hospital...? 

466
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:33,260
The body isn't really visible.

467
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,060
Just a moment.  There must be another footage.

468
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,260
I think I know who the criminal is.  I'll be going first.

469
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,740
I'm going to see my baby.  I'm going to see my baby. Huh?

470
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,670
We're going to go see our baby.

471
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,030
Let's go see our baby, huh?

472
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,430
Honey, wait a moment.

473
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,350
I was about to...

474
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,280
I'm on my way to turn myself in.

475
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,320
If you arrest me here, my wife will be scared.

476
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,770
I was frightfully greedy.

477
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,840
The punk who did that to my kid,

478
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,210
I was hoping that Mu Chi would kill him for me.

479
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,680
I don't expect understanding.

480
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,880
Where is your daughter's grave?

481
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,520
We caught you, Sunbae!  Come out quickly!

482
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,750
- What are you saying? 
 - Be quiet and come out quickly.

483
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,580
If it weren't for Officer Jung...

484
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,230
Officer Jung?

485
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,370
Yes. He went to Team Leader Park to catch the criminal.

486
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,120
- How did that rascal officer know? 
 - About what?

487
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,060
How did he know that Team Leader Park's wife killed him?

488
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,230
His wife killed him?

489
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,950
Jung Man Ho!

490
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,000
Why are you in front of my daughter's grave?

491
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,760
This is not your daughter, Officer.

492
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,710
What are you saying?

493
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,670
The child buried in here...

494
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,630
What are you saying?

495
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:27,450
It's my daughter.

496
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,360
My daughter.

497
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,850
My Soo Jin!

498
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,430
This person... Why is Jung Man Ho...?

499
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,920
The ponytail holders Park Hyun Soo had on

500
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,090
when she was kidnapped by Han Seo Joon,

501
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,000
two of the same ones were found.

502
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,590
With the hair in the hair bauble found on the remains,

503
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:37,590
the DNA test confirmed that it was Park Hyun Soo.

504
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,240
However...

505
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,960
As soon as Woo Jae Pil admitted to killing Park Hyun Soo,

506
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,540
Jung Man Ho, who was like a brother to him unexpectedly

507
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,180
stabbed Woo Jae Pil in a fit of rage.

508
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,520
Why?

509
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,890
Why did Jung Man Ho

510
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:58,280
kill Woo Jae Pil?

511
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,400
Why did he kill him?

512
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,810
 At the thought of my daughter... 

513
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:10,480
 Mr. Jung, you don't have a daughter. 

514
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,390
If it wasn't a lie.

515
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,640
If he really had a daughter.

516
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,320
1994 Gu-Ryeong City.

517
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,390
Wasn't there a girl among the missing children?

518
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,130
Just a moment please.

519
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,860
Right here.

520
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,190
   

521
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:25,280
What are the names of this child's parents?

522
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,360
She only had a father, and his name was Jung Man Ho.

523
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,300
My Soo Jin!

524
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,610
Soo Jin!

525
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,630
 Wh-What are you doing right now? 

526
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:46,280
 S... So Jae Pil is 

527
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,750
 the killer? 

528
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,120
 - Soo Jin! 
 - Dad! 

529
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,360
 W-Why is that... 

530
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,570
 Emergency; emergency... 

531
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:18,010
 A male with a weapon is creating a disturbance on the first floor of Mujin Hospital. 

532
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,380
 It's not true, right? 

533
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,670
 My Soo Jin... 

534
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:35,130
 It isn't so, right? 

535
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:36,980
 But... 

536
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,500
 Why was my Soo Jin's necklace on the knife that came out of your house? 

537
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,300
 Why was that there? 

538
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,320
 Tell me! 

539
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,080
 Why are you closing your eyes? 

540
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,930
 Open your eyes. 

541
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:57,150
 Open your eyes and tell me, okay? 

542
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,420
 That's right. 

543
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,260
 At that time, 

544
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,510
 as much as me, no. 

545
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:06,440
 You looked even harder for Soo Jin than I did. 

546
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,380
 The police are also on their feet searching. 

547
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,670
 We'll find her soon. 

548
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:13,200
 - I'll go up there and hand them out. 
 - Yes, Hyungnim. 

549
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:17,650
 You looked even harder for Soo Jin than I did. 

550
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:19,960
 Tell me. 

551
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,830
 Tell me that child isn't my Soo Jin. 

552
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:26,420
 Please.  Please! 

553
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,520
 I'm sorry. 

554
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,660
 Man Ho. 

555
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,200
 What? 

556
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:48,480
 What... are you apologizing to me about? 

557
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,310
 What are you sorry about? 

558
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:53,900
 I struggled with the guilt my whole life. 

559
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,720
 Just believe that. 

560
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,630
 What? 

561
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,910
 What did you say, you bastard? 

562
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,690
 Die!  Die! 

563
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,480
 Die!  Die! 

564
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,750
 Soo Jin! 

565
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,140
But... About your daughter...

566
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,740
They're doing the DNA test again.

567
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,590
We'll know when the test is done.

568
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:26,300
Whether the child from that grave is my Hyun Soo or Jung Man Ho's daughter.

569
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,440
Anyway, you worked hard.

570
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,240
Ah, well...

571
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,870
- Ah, but. 
 - Yes?

572
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:40,600
How did you know that the culprit was Jung Man Ho?

573
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,700
Well...

574
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,180
It was by chance, while I was looking through the CCTV footage.

575
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,290
Ah...

576
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,050
I see.

577
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,790
Please go in.

578
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,210
If I say that I discovered this there,

579
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:12,140
will the fact that Seong Yo Han's brain is in my head...

580
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,860
Officer Jung!

581
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,700
Yes, PD Choi!

582
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:26,520
Thank you for catching the criminal.

583
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,290
But why are you saying thank you?

584
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,310
Because Detective Go is being released?

585
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:42,710
I think Detective Go will resent me a lot.

586
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,160
I'll be going.

587
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,670
Wow, Guard Gu.

588
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:56,800
You look like a different person all dressed up.

589
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,060
I put some care into it.

590
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:02,940
I'm having dinner with my In-laws today.

591
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,440
You haven't had the wedding ceremony yet,

592
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,170
but you naturally call them your In-laws.

593
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,670
Those are the good times.

594
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,760
Ah, but about that ahjusshi Mr. Kim...

595
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,870
I heard that he came here unfairly.

596
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,560
Well, everyone thinks that way.

597
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,180
What can you do? Even the Supreme Court ruling was already made.

598
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,250
 Fight incident! Room 3 Ma 28. Fight incident! 

599
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,910
 - The prisoner is making a fuss with a sharp object.  
 - Room 3 Ma 28?

600
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:28,340
 Please dispatch the mobile patrol team! 

601
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:35,140
Hey, I told you not to side with that bastard.

602
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,260
He killed 10 innocent women, but why are you taking that bastard's side?

603
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,180
- Huh? 
 - Put him down.

604
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,320
Put that down, right now!

605
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,520
Please calm down.

606
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,850
Everyone knows!

607
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:51,080
That it wasn't this guy's doing!

608
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,930
Please stop harassing him!

609
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,300
No. No!

610
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,610
- Let go! Let go! 
 - Stay still!

611
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:11,220
 Thank you for catching the criminal. 

612
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,140
Does Dong Koo really not know?

613
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,810
Do I actually like her?

614
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,090
That scared me!

615
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,880
- Aigoo, Jung Ba Reum. 
 - Sheesh, alcohol.

616
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,150
You're Ba Reum. Definitely Jung Ba Reum.

617
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:30,510
Hey, why did you drink so much?

618
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,080
Did you fight with Seul Gi again?

619
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,380
Hey, what's that?  Did you get hurt?

620
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,550
Ah, that gangster. You know that gangster?

621
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,190
Yeah, the one who keeps harassing that ahjusshi Mr. Kim?

622
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:45,790
That gangster's underling was harassing the ahjusshi Mr. Kim again,

623
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:48,970
and he ended up cutting the arm of another inmate who was trying to stop him.

624
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,940
- It's that person's blood. 
 - Yes.

625
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,770
He came in because of an assault fatality, but he's a good person.

626
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,230
It happened while he was trying to catch the guy who assaulted his daughter.

627
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,010
Aigoo

628
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,730
- Did he get hurt badly? 
 - Fortunately, he wasn't hurt badly.

629
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,210
However,

630
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:08,340
Mr. Kim, at that age,

631
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,520
took down that bastard who was waving his weapon.

632
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,130
What was I doing at that moment?

633
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,810
I stayed still.

634
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,480
I was so scared,

635
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,000
because I thought I would get hurt.

636
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,870
Hey, you're human. Of course–

637
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:32,000
Chi Kook wouldn't have been a coward like me.

638
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,210
Chi Kook.

639
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,200
Sheesh, I'm late!

640
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,770
You should have awakened me.

641
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,480
- I'm going. 
 - You're going already?

642
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,180
- Yes! 
 - See you.

643
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,810
Ah.

644
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:06,160
 In order to confirm the facts, the police have gotten permission from the victim's family. 

645
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,530
 They have decided to collect the DNA directly from the buried remains and consult the National Forensic Service. 

646
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:15,180
 All attention is focused on authentication of whether the buried remains are those of Miss A. 

647
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:20,850
 Because he can't drag you into his unhappy life of a killer when he kills Han Seo Joon. 

648
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,400
 No. He decided that he couldn't do that. 

649
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,720
 That day... That was the day that he was going to confess that he liked you, PD Choi. 

650
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,860
I'm sorry.

651
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,310
When I asked you to find Han Seo Joon's son,

652
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:49,000
what's the reason why you pretended not to know anything?

653
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,700
Because you thought I would do something to your lover?

654
00:55:54,470 --> 00:56:00,640
If you cared even the tiniest bit about me, you wouldn't have dated that murderer's kid.

655
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,040
I'm sorry, Go Mu Chi.

656
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,510
Why, of all people, was it Seong Yo Han?

657
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:13,390
I mean, there are men all over the place.

658
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:16,190
But why, of all people, was it Seong Yo Han?

659
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:18,710
What about that bastard were you so crazy about?

660
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:22,850
- Because he's similar. 
 - He's similar? To whom?

661
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:30,060
He's a lot like me.  That's why I was drawn to him.

662
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,200
How are you alike?

663
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,160
Did you kill people like that bastard?

664
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,200
Is that how you're alike?

665
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:50,330
Get lost. You're ruining the taste of the alcohol.

666
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,900
Ah, don't touch me!

667
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,180
Don't put your hands on my body!

668
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:22,960
 The culprit who killed Mr. A, who was named as the suspect of the Knot Killer case, 

669
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,100
 was found to be Mr. B, who is not presently a detective, but the best friend of Mr. A. 

670
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:32,260
 It is presumed that the deceased Mr. A killed Mr. B's daughter, who had gone missing twenty six years ago. 

671
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:35,640
 After investigating the exact motive of the crime against Mr. B, 

672
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,730
 the police said they plan to apply for an arrest warrant. 

673
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:50,930
 The injured student almost died.  Why did you do that to your friend? 

674
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:55,720
 Friend?  Who says I'm friends with the Headhunter's son? 

675
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,530
 Whose son? 

676
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:06,410
    

677
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:15,170
 Oh? Hey! No! No! 

678
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:18,170
 Let go.  Let me go! 

679
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:22,360
 Are you suffering more than those people? 

680
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,140
 The families of the victims that your father killed. 

681
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,490
 Those people are holding out too. 

682
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:33,160
 So you live and show it to them 

683
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,630
 that you're different from your father, that you're not that kind of a person! 

684
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,410
 Quick, quick, quick! 

685
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:53,860
 Oh, easy, easy! 

686
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,090
 She got bit running from a dog while reporting on a cult in Samcheok. 

687
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:01,830
 - You stubborn fool. 
 - Ouch, that hurts! 

688
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:07,320
 - You won't die from this. 
 - Don't you know? There are people who've died from dog bites too! 

689
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:11,360
 Have I seen you before? 

690
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:16,040
 Don't you remember me? 

691
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,700
 Wow! You don't even recognize the person that saved your life. That's quite upsetting. 

692
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:23,440
 I'm Choi Hong Ju. Current affairs Producer at OBN, Choi Hong Ju. 

693
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:37,500
Thank you for today.

694
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,720
 The killer of Mr. A, who was suspected to be the culprit of the Knot Killer case, 

695
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,290
 was found to be A's friend,  
 - I'm back.

696
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,940
- Oh! 
  - not a detective. 

697
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,550
Our Nation's son Officer Jung, you're quite amazing!

698
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:14,710
- I heard you were the one who caught the killer. 
 - Oh, well, I can't really take all the credit.

699
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:18,160
- Officer Nam, let me do that. 
 - Oh, you don't need to.

700
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,250
We can't have the Nation's son do it. I should do it instead.

701
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,890
No, no, I'll do it.

702
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:26,410
Excuse me.

703
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:30,520
The man living above us cursed my sister out and even followed her to the front of our house.

704
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,140
Who knows what would have happened if he'd really entered our house.

705
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:36,030
I did go out and check with that man.

706
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:38,970
But he said he was at his house the entire time.

707
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:43,310
- So are you saying that I'm lying? 
 - No, it's not that.

708
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:48,100
Oh, door cams are quite popular these days. So, how about you install a CCTV?

709
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,930
We live hand to mouth. We don't have that kind of money.

710
01:00:54,100 --> 01:01:00,040
We will patrol that area more often from now on. Got it, Officer Jung?

711
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,700
Yes, well, we will certainly try our best.

712
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,780
Officer Jung, are you alright?

713
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,780
Is something wrong?

714
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,680
Excuse me.

715
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,990
 I've refilled the side dishes. Make sure you don't skip your meals. Here's a picture of you from kindergarten that you wanted last time. 

716
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,930
It wasn't me after all.

717
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,530
It's not my memory, it's Seung Yo Han's.

718
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,580
   

719
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:49,670
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

720
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:51,770
Is Officer Jung Ba Reum...

721
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:55,980
Oh, he didn't look well, so Chief told him to go home and rest.

722
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,900
Oh, I see. Thank you.

723
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,720
Yes.

724
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:22,680
 There's a bad brain inside this mouse. 

725
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,540
 If you let it live, it might bite and kill you too. 

726
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,230
Bad brain...

727
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,590
Seung Yo Han's brain...

728
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:51,840
Be quiet. Be quiet I said!

729
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:06,480
Detective, what are you doing here at this hour?

730
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,880
You punk. What are you?

731
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:15,310
What are you?

732
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,250
Why did you drink so much?

733
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:23,080
Darn. Did someone tell you to catch the killer?

734
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,000
Hey, you moron.

735
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,410
How much longer are you going to whine?

736
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:32,920
It's so childish.

737
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,210
What?

738
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,770
This bastard!

739
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:44,110
What do you even know? Have you seen your family die?

740
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:47,670
Did you have to see your family die in front of your eyes–

741
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:07,370
All of this is because of you, Go Mu Chi.

742
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:09,090
   

743
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,520
 The father's cross necklace and Bong Yi's grandmother's brooch were right here. 

744
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:15,310
 But when I came back with Officer Nam, they had disappeared. 

745
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:19,780
 Officer Jung, don't you think you're too obsessed with the idea that the real culprit for the Seung Yo Han's case is someone else? 

746
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:23,220
 That bone's congestion is the crucial evidence of strangulation. 

747
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,370
 Officer Jung, did you graduate from medical school? 

748
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:28,970
 You jerk. You forgot about my wedding. 

749
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:33,250
 Damn it! Why did I miss this? It's very stable. 

750
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,570
 That's something only an expert can do. The real culprit was somebody else. 

751
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:41,980
