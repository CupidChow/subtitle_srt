2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,910
   

3
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,720
   

4
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,520
 It's almost the due date so when you have contractions, 

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,810
 take a taxi and come immediately. 

6
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,130
 Okay. 

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,640
 It's been one month since Han Seo Joon was arrested, 

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,160
 and the police haven't been able to find the other victims' heads aside from the couple from the campsite, 

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,650
 so the investigation is facing difficulties. 

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,120
 The rare killer who has killed at least 20 victims, 

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,190
 then cut off their heads, 

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,000
 was Headhunter, Han Seo Joon. 

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,420
 He is still exercising his right to remain silent. 

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,590
 As if he is toying with the police. 

15
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,970
 Authorities said they will not stand by and watch... 

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,710
 Excuse me! What are you doing? 

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,090
 - What are you doing to the child?  
  - Let go!  

18
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,390
 - What are you doing? What are you doing? 
 - You can't do this! 

19
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,940
 Stop her! 

20
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,550
  - No!   
   - Please come out!  

21
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,710
 No! You can't! 

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,700
 You got checked up, didn't you? What are you going to do? 

23
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,930
 You shouldn't give birth. You should never give birth. 

24
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,430
 Never! You should never give birth! 

25
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,260
 - What are you doing? Let go!  
  - You can't. You can't! 

26
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,150
 You should never give birth! 

27
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,230
 No. You can't! 

28
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,520
 She took medicine to die together. 

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,840
 What is the child's crime? 

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,670
 If she wants to die, she should die by herself. 

31
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,550
   

32
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,730
Mr. A, the suspect in the knot murder case, 
    

33
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,600
died after being attacked by an acquaintance during treatment.

34
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,750
There is no public prosecution,

35
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,390
so we are closing the investigation of the case.

36
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,800
Oh?

37
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,320
Are you okay?

38
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,110
What's wrong with your hand? Did you get hurt?

39
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,470
Ah, my hand got stuck in the door.

40
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,890
Wash up and come out.

41
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,040
Hey, did you do this?

42
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,550
Yes.

43
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,010
Ah, we could just eat out.

44
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,460
It's okay.

45
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,590
Ah, thanks for the food.

46
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,320
It's not much.

47
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,680
Ah, this is good.

48
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,510
Hey, about yesterday...

49
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,570
Did we fight?

50
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,150
I remember coming to your house but I don't remember anything after that.

51
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,390
As soon as you saw me, you grabbed my collar,

52
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,750
You were swinging your fists, so had to unintentionally overpower you...

53
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,270
- I'm sorry. 
 - No, it's okay.

54
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,740
Why are you sorry? I should be sorry.

55
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,440
I should quit drinking.

56
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,930
That's true. You should quit drinking or else you'll really die.

57
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,810
It's okay. I won't die.

58
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,450
I won't die until I kill that bastard.

59
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,700
I understand your feelings, but

60
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,880
Han Seo Joon is someone who already received a death sentence.

61
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,470
So what? He is completely fine and alive!

62
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,810
He is eating and sleeping well.

63
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,030
If the country doesn't do it, then I should do it!

64
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,070
Who is going to do it then?

65
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,560
Ah, damn it! Why am I so unlucky?

66
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,470
I chased someone for a year for a hit-and-run,

67
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,150
but he jumped off a roof and dies in front of my eyes.

68
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,840
I shot a gun and killed someone, but only got disciplined for one year.

69
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,670
There is someone to kill, but someone else beats me to it and kills him first.

70
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,030
Why are things so twisted and complicated?

71
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,620
It's not because you're unlucky,

72
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,570
but because Priest Go is protecting you.

73
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,950
Detective, I keep remembering things from before my accident.

74
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,550
In my memory, Priest Go

75
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,480
was only worried for his younger brother.

76
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,070
He always seemed heartbroken and affectionate toward you.

77
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,850
Don't get water on your hands or it'll get worse.

78
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,230
- Oh, Bong Yi? 
  - How is your hand? Is it okay? 

79
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,390
Yeah, it's okay.

80
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,230
 No, don't kill him. No. Don't kill him. 

81
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,610
 Hit him. Hit him. Kill him! 

82
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,210
 Kill him! Kill him! 

83
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,690
 Hit him! Hit him! Kill him! 

84
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,240
 No! No! 

85
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,610
 Huh? 

86
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,980
 - Oppa.  
  - Bong Yi. 

87
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,860
 Oppa, your hand. What's wrong with your hand? 

88
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,370
 Ah. I... 

89
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,180
 M-My hand got caught on the door. 

90
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,640
 And Detective drank a lot of alcohol. 

91
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,400
 So I... I fell down while trying to support him. 

92
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,170
 Ah, you dummy! 

93
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,530
 You should've gone to the hospital first! 

94
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,090
 Let's hurry up and go to the hospital. 

95
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,340
 Remember what the doctor said. 

96
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,910
 Be careful until your bones are in place. 

97
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,570
Okay, I got it.

98
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,970
 There's a bad brain inside this mouse. 

99
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,960
 If you let it live, it might bite and kill you too. 

100
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,260
A bad brain would

101
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,520
bite and kill.

102
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,120
But... Why are you so quiet?

103
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,550
I thought by now the world would be in turmoil.

104
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,110
The world's first brain transplant success.

105
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,160
In Jung Ba Reum's head,

106
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,180
the brain of a serial killer entered.

107
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,360
In the end, did you decide to keep quiet about it?

108
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,130
I'm disappointed.

109
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:38,630
Just like Daniel, I wanted to get the attention of the world.

110
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,520
I think

111
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,950
there is a problem.

112
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,610
I almost killed a person.

113
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,170
Just what is

114
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,770
happening to me?

115
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,810
Huh?

116
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,910
I had transplanted the frontal lobe

117
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,480
of a highly aggressive rat

118
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,790
into the head of a gentle rat.

119
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,260
The gentle rat

120
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,110
gradually became violent.

121
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,770
In the end, it...

122
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,680
Are you afraid? That you'll become like that?

123
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,820
I am also curious.

124
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,780
You are the first human I have  done a frontal lobe transplant for.

125
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,920
Of course, that doesn’t mean your entire frontal lobe has been replaced.

126
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,790
Only the damaged area was partially transplanted.

127
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,520
But I hope your nature

128
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,250
will not be taken over by Yo Han.

129
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,220
I am sincere about this.

130
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,920
Detective Go, I'm sorry. For a moment—

131
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,310
How did it go?

132
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,980
It was Jung Man Ho's daughter. It wasn't Hyun Soo.

133
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,600
Then, then what about my Hyun Soo?

134
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,190
Huh?

135
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,410
- Team leader! 
 - Team leader!

136
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,900
Hyungnim!

137
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,710
So many people are looking for me today.

138
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,860
I like this special treatment.

139
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,550
I get to have two visitors in a day.

140
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,690
Why didn't you tell me?

141
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,800
Why didn't you say that those remains weren't Hyun Soo's?

142
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,030
I never said it was her.

143
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,970
Where is she?

144
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,950
Where is Hyun Soo buried?

145
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,270
Where did you abandon her?

146
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,480
I'm not sure.

147
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,200
It's been so long I don't remember...

148
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,820
You don't remember? You don't remember!

149
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,110
My wife has been trapped in time ever since

150
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,260
you took our child 25 years ago, but

151
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,130
with that snout of yours, you say you don't remember my Hyun Soo!

152
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,010
Before you care about my snout,

153
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,640
you should have watched your tongue.

154
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,400
You—

155
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,340
Right, sorry.

156
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,980
No, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

157
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,370
If you want me to pull out my tongue, I will.

158
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,480
Please let me bury my Hyun Soo in a sunny place

159
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,450
with my own hands, okay?

160
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,840
How bothersome. I told you I don't remember.

161
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,090
Hey, you son of a bitch! I'm going to kill you!

162
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,580
You bastard! I'm gonna kill you!

163
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,950
Where is my daughter? Let me go!

164
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,090
Let me go! Aish, hey!

165
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,520
 Let go! Let go! 

166
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,560
 I'm gonna kill this crazy bastard— I said let go! 

167
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,800
 Let me go, you punks! Let go! 

168
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,100
You will regret

169
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,990
shooting at Yo Han.

170
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,320
Yes. I'm already regretting it.

171
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,510
If I knew he was your son,

172
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,550
I would have killed him after killing you.

173
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,120
I really, really

174
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,110
regret it.

175
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,000
You don't have an immune rejection and you are adjusting just fine.

176
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,580
- Is there a problem? 
 - It's that...

177
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,950
I remember Seong Yo Han's memories

178
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,770
like they are my own.

179
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,690
Also, I've gotten more aggressive.

180
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,090
I'm wondering if maybe I'm becoming like Yo Han.

181
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,750
That is why

182
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,230
we didn't want to tell you who the donor was.

183
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,130
You started showing these symptoms

184
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,250
after hearing that the transplanted brain was Yo Han's, right?

185
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,390
Yes.

186
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,710
- Oh, but— 
 - Transplanted patients

187
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,360
often believe that the donor's personality and habits have been transferred.

188
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,820
And I believe it's even more intense for you

189
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,790
since you received a brain transplant.

190
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,250
I'll prescribe you some medicine, so make sure you take it.

191
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,010
Looks like you're the first freelance police officer in Korea, huh? 
    

192
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,930
Even if the Chief told you to take it easy,  isn't it this too much?

193
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,410
- I'll do it. 
 - Never mind. Just plant these saplings outside.

194
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,660
We need some pictures of the stations for some flyers, and the Chief thinks the garden is too flat.

195
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,380
- Oh, all right. 
 - Oh, wait! Wait up!

196
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,480
Take those to the evidence team first. There's a piece of evidence missing in Kang Min Joo's murder case.

197
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,050
Oh, really? Yes, sir.

198
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,370
- I'll be right back. 
 - Go ahead.

199
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,800
Detective Go.

200
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,200
Detective Park?

201
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,670
 I'm leaving a piece of evidence of Kang Min Joo's case. 

202
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,320
   

203
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,930
This is just psychological.

204
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,250
I'll be fine.

205
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,810
What are you doing?

206
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,180
A piece of evidence from Kang Min Joo's murder case was missing, so I brought it in.

207
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,640
But, what were you doing on my computer?

208
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,340
Oh, I was looking for Bong Yi's grandmother's brooch.

209
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,260
She was wearing it on the day of the incident, but the police didn't return it.

210
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,130
Bong Yi really wants it back.

211
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,690
Oh. I saw it wasn't in the evidence box, so

212
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,240
I was looking at the computer to check if it's in the inventory.

213
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,230
- The brooch? 
 - Yeah.

214
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,020
I'll look it up.

215
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,720
Right, I'll be going then. Please contact me if you find the brooch.

216
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,900
   

217
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,240
There is no brooch.

218
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,230
- Here. 
  - Suspect A, a former police officer was the suspect in the Knot murders. 

219
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,060
 He worked at a friend's moving company and raised a son by himself after retirement. 

220
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,430
 He is known for having a good reputation. 

221
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,870
 You witch. 

222
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,270
Why come here again to turn people's lives upside down?

223
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,160
Please, get out of this neighborhood!

224
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,630
If you're uncomfortable seeing me, you should get out.

225
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,300
- It's your fault for having a son like him. 
 - What? You witch—

226
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,770
- Move out right now! 
 - Let go of me or–

227
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,660
- Ahjussi? 
 - This Ajumma, really... I'm interested in the Bible these days.

228
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,730
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth". If you do this again,

229
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,850
I won't let it slide, elderly or not.

230
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,480
Where are you going, Ahjussi?

231
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,260
Why lie to me? You hurt my feelings...

232
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,740
Mother,

233
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,680
that girl grew up really pretty.

234
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,710
Let go of me! Why did you come here?

235
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,650
I heard you asked Officer Jung to find your grandmother's brooch.

236
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,440
I went to the hospital to tell you about it, but you had already left!

237
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,770
Can't you get some nutritional supplements and rest for a few days?

238
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,030
Don't you know my life is not easy?

239
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,770
So did you find the brooch?

240
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:13,380
I didn't. And it's not even on the evidence list, so she must have dropped it somewhere.

241
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,300
Maybe?

242
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,160
What are you doing, Ahjussi?

243
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,550
Don't you know Kang Duk Su was released? I can't believe you came back here.

244
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,770
Of course, I know. All the country does.

245
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,340
How far is Kang Duk Su's house from here?

246
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,900
He doesn't live here now.

247
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,490
His mother lives here. How do you know he's not going to come around?

248
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,210
So what? Do I run away because I don't know when he'll come?

249
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,910
Where should I go then? Should I go out and live on the street?

250
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,010
Do you think I wanted to come back to this horrible neighborhood?

251
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,300
My grandma and I ran away then lived in an empty house located in a redevelopment area.

252
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,040
This is the only house I can live in on Korean soil.

253
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,300
This house that my dad built.

254
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,750
Let's go to my house for now.

255
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,480
- For now, just take what you need— 
 - I don't want to! Why should I go to your house?

256
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,520
Who do you think you are? Are you my father?

257
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,980
Right, I'm not your father.

258
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,030
Have you been eating properly? You just eat ramen, right?

259
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,260
I eat pretty well.

260
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,450
It's you who should eat properly.

261
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,520
I'm leaving, you punk.

262
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,880
- Ah! About Woo Jae Pil... 
 - Yeah?

263
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,750
Did he work at a moving company? I heard it on the news.

264
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,940
Yes, he worked in a team for a moving company. Why?

265
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,370
That hand wasn't of someone who worked at a moving company.

266
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,960
It had a soft touch.

267
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,410
It wasn't the hands of someone who labored outside.

268
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:04,200
Oh! When he covered my mouth, I felt something cold.

269
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,680
- Something metallic. 
 - Metallic?

270
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,350
 A ring? 

271
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,130
Well, I'm not sure.

272
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,080
No, Oh Bong Yi said he had soft hands.

273
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,210
And Woo Jae Pil left the police and worked at a moving company. He couldn't have soft hands.

274
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,740
Right, but Detective, can I talk to you later? Today I'm...

275
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,960
You saw him in person!

276
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,670
They used to treat you like a baby and call you the Nation's son, but now they're making you do this with an injured hand!

277
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,280
Should I call a reporter to take pictures?

278
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,070
Stop it, Detective. Why are you doing this?

279
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,370
I already feel uncomfortable with Officer Nam as it is.

280
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,990
Hey, wasn't the Chief, but Officer Nam who ordered you to do this?

281
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,930
You should take care of your sick colleague...

282
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,910
Oh please, it's alright. Why are you doing this?

283
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,990
Hey, I'll do this then. Sit for a bit. I'll do this right away.

284
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,980
You just need to plant all this, right?

285
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,150
Why are they doing this all of a sudden?

286
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:55,960
I really hate this pretentious behavior.

287
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,640
Detective Go, do you have the photos?

288
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,200
The photos of the scene when the remains of Park Hyun Soo, I mean, Jung Soo Jin were found.

289
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,060
Woo Jae Pil confessed that he personally buried Jung Soo Jin's remains, right?

290
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,350
Look. I'm right handed, so I hold the shovel's grip with my right hand,

291
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,580
guide it with my left and dig like so.

292
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,230
Then when the shovel hits the floor, the left end bears the weight of the force,

293
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,820
and the left side gets dug up a little deeper than the right. But look here.

294
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,960
Someone who's left-handed should dig in the opposite direction of that, but this one is the same as the one I dug, right?

295
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,500
You're right. It should be in the opposite direction because Woo Jae Pil is left-handed and you're right handed.

296
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,460
Woo Jae Pil is definitely left-handed.

297
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,590
So is there a different person who dug the hole?

298
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,950
I got it. The reason why he dug the same way I did. A cast.

299
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,230
He had a cast on his left arm, so he had no choice but to dig with his right.

300
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,900
Because he had a cast, he wouldn't have a way to tie the knot with only one hand.

301
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,300
- Then there's another left-handed person who tied the knot on Jung Soo Jin's hand. 
 - Do you remember?

302
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,030
The knot that was tied to Jung Soo Jin's remains.

303
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,270
 - It's almost as if a child tied it.  
 - He said it was awkwardly done.

304
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,470
A child... A child...

305
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:18,530
At the time, Woo Hyeong Cheol's age was... 12.

306
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,070
He was in 5th grade.

307
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:27,060
But Woo Hyeong Cheol's alibi during Hong Na Ri's time of death was definite.

308
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,170
That's what we need to solve from now.

309
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:35,030
Around the time of Hong Na Ri's death, Woo Hyeong Cheol was at that house replacing the security grills.

310
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,440
Were you at home the whole time during the installation?

311
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,740
Of course. Tsk! Quiet!

312
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,110
Oh right. I took Simba briefly to the hospital.

313
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,350
And was Lawyer Woo here when you returned?

314
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,170
He was just finishing the installation.

315
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,730
How long were you gone?

316
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,360
Twenty minutes?

317
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,130
If you get on the freeway, the animal hospital is right there.

318
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,700
Twenty minutes...

319
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,200
What was wrong with him?

320
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,390
- 20 minutes... 
 - He had a stroke.

321
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,600
They said it was because of low blood sugar.

322
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,680
They asked if I was feeding him xylitol. I only fed him dog food. 
  (T/N: A sugar-free sweetener added to some foods.) 

323
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,950
I wonder if he ate something off the street when I was walking him...

324
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,210
 It's certain that he fed something to the dog 

325
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,470
 in order to secure his alibi. 

326
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:37,000
Now! The time it takes from that villa to Hong Na Ri's house by car is 8 minutes exact. Round trip is 16 minutes. Next.

327
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,770
- You ready? 
 - Yes. 
 - Next, the throat.

328
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,770
- I'm doing it. 
 - Yes. You're choking me.

329
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,330
It's a little tight.

330
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,420
Hey, it's too tight!

331
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,510
 Tighter, even tighter! 

332
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,990
 More! 

333
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,910
 It should feel very good. 

334
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,370
Ah! You son of a bitch!

335
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,660
That was too tight!

336
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,630
Hey, you only needed to pretend to choke me! What am I supposed to do if you actually choke me so tightly, you bastard?

337
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,530
Hurry and untie my hands. Untie my hands.

338
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,170
Hands.

339
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,500
Damn, it took longer than 20 minutes.

340
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,440
In order to murder here then go all the way back to the villa is too far.

341
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,050
Hey, are you okay?

342
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,320
- Yes. Are you okay? 
 - Huh?

343
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,860
- I thought I was going to die, you punk. 
 - I-I'm sorry.

344
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,340
- Ah, I'm so dizzy. 
 - The round trip from that villa to Hong Na Ri's home is 16 minutes.

345
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,750
Tying her up and killing her would take 5 to 10 minutes. Altogether it's around 20 minutes. So the minimum time is 20 minutes.

346
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:05,660
But Hong Na Ri would have fought back, so if he subdued her first, then cleaned up afterward, it's over 20 minutes.

347
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,970
20 minutes is not enough.

348
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,890
You look under the weather since earlier. Hurry eat and get some rest.

349
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,250
Yes.

350
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,530
- At any rate, you've changed a lot. You keep surprising me. 
 - How so?

351
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,200
I mean before you hurt your head,

352
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,480
I guess you could say this line of work didn't really suit you?

353
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,770
But now, it feels like you can look into the mind of the murderer.

354
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,850
Yeah. How can someone change so much?

355
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,430
Maybe I should get brain surgery too?

356
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:46,000
What do you mean I changed?

357
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,760
That was hot, damnit! Hey, I was complimenting you!

358
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,300
You're really sensitive today!

359
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,160
- I'm sorry, Detective. 
 - Hey, I burned the roof of my mouth because of you.

360
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,920
- Go and get me some beer. 
 - Yes, sir.

361
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,870
Punk...

362
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,180
Here.

363
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,690
Hey, Auntie! Why isn't the beer  cold?

364
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh, I wanted to cool down my bone broth and I didn't have room.

365
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,210
I took it out, and just now put it back in the fridge.

366
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,450
- What's that? 
 - Look, it's still cold! You're so fussy.

367
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,710
Fuss– You have to have beer completely cold for it to taste good!

368
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,370
I'm not having this! Put it back, damnit.

369
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,930
Rude piece of–

370
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,040
W-What did you just say?

371
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,160
M-Me? I didn't say anything.

372
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,610
You just said something to me.

373
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,430
Detective! Detective, I found it!

374
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,900
The riddle of Woo Hyeong Cheol's alibi on the day of Hong Na Ri's murder.

375
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,330
Have a safe trip.

376
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,280
It's cold, so hurry back in.

377
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,960
- How are you doing, sir? 
 - Yes?

378
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,160
Did you finished your father's funeral without a problem?

379
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,740
Yes, thanks to you. But what brings you here?

380
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,010
- Your hand is smooth. 
 - I'm sorry?

381
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:29,930
You're relieved that your father took all the blame before dying, aren't you?

382
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,870
What are you trying to say?

383
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,840
Your father is quite naive.

384
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,280
He must've thought that if he died instead, the guilt would make his son finally come to his senses and live a good life.

385
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,150
Look here!

386
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,650
But what can you do? I'm an expert when it comes to folks like you.

387
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,660
Criminals like you can't stop killing people.

388
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,740
You didn't do it of your own will, you see? It's an addiction, that's what.

389
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,920
You psychopath!

390
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,580
Then explain my alibi at the time of Hong Na Ri's death first.

391
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,230
Before more people die like you say!

392
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,780
A few days ago,

393
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,850
I shit blood.

394
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,270
After drinking rotten milk.

395
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,280
But that milk was in the fridge the whole time and the expiration date was good, too.

396
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,930
But how did it go bad?

397
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:14,090
But the house that I drank the milk at, was Hong Na Ri's home.

398
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,730
Yesterday, I was going to drink some beer at a local supermarket.

399
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,490
But my beer was warm!

400
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,970
So I said some harsh words to the store owner. Why is the beer so warm?

401
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,640
She was trying to cool some bone broth, so she briefly took out the beer to put the pot of broth in the fridge.

402
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,000
After looking at that broth, our smart Officer Jeong thought of the answer.

403
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,110
It's the thing that cannot go in the fridge.

404
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,580
The night you murdered Hong Na Ri wasn't that night.

405
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,530
At the time the fridge was set to one degree.The window was shut tightly so the room temperature was 27 degrees.

406
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,500
At that temperature, the corpse should've begun to decompose even after one day,

407
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,930
but because you put her in the fridge, it wouldn't decompose even after 2 days.

408
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:24,160
In order to secure your alibi, you picked out the closest applicant's home to Hong Na Ri and had the grill installed there.

409
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,560
And through the documents, you found out that the applicant had a dog.

410
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,540
And you prepared some poisoned food to feed the dog.

411
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,640
 Mr. Lawyer, I'll be right back! 

412
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,790
 O-Oh, yes! 

413
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:38,150
 As the owner ran out with her dog according to plan, you went straight to Hong Na Ri's home. 

414
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,620
 After taking her body out, you contacted her husband to come home. 

415
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,900
 Could you come home right away? 

416
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,050
Why? Because you needed to secure your alibi.

417
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,840
Before it rots, you needed the body to be discovered.

418
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,420
And you just needed to hurry back to the installation site and finish your work on the window guard.

419
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,750
 Mr. Lawyer, 

420
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,900
 - I'm sorry. My baby suddenly got sick. 
 - Is he okay? 

421
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,870
On the day you secured  your alibi,

422
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,700
you merely needed to pull her body out so 5 minutes is plenty.

423
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,880
Three days before her body was found,

424
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,740
on the 5th, your schedule was empty from 4 to 6 o'clock.

425
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,880
You got off work early at 4 on the 5th because you claimed you weren't feeling well.

426
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,590
It takes 30 minutes to get from your job to home. But it turns out Hong Na Ri's place was on the way.

427
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,560
But CCTV footage shows you arriving home an hour after you left.

428
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,260
There's an extra 30 minutes!

429
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:33,110
The very 30 minutes needed to kill Hong Na Ri and clean up afterwards.

430
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,720
Are you the fantastic duo?

431
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,320
Why don't you start a business writing novels? It seems to suit you better.

432
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,790
Should we do that, Officer Jung?

433
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,970
Ah, but I feel like documentaries suit me better than novels.

434
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,870
- I like documentaries too. 
 - Should we show him this?

435
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,640
The DNA discovered in the fridge,

436
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,050
it matches Hong Na Ri's by 99%. You see this, right?

437
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,150
Did you bring an arrest warrant?

438
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,630
Then bring an arrest warrant first.

439
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,980
Because of the two of you, I am late to work. I will go now.

440
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,350
Hey, why is it so late? Check how far we are from getting the arrest warrant.

441
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,140
I don't need an arrest warrant, you bastard.

442
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,150
- Are you looking for this? 
 - Hey!

443
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,820
I took them out when you were sleeping.

444
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,680
Hey, give it! Hurry up and give it to me!

445
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,670
Ah, no! You can't do this, Detective!

446
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,210
Give it to me, you bastard!

447
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,250
Ah, stop right there!

448
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,040
- Hey, you bastard! 
 - Detective!

449
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,230
You are under arrest for murdering Kim Yeong Hee, Kang Min Joo and Hong Na Ri.

450
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,830
- Anything you say from now will be used as evidence against you. 
 - How did you know to come here?

451
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,350
What do you mean how did he know? You didn't request  an arrest warrant,

452
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,850
so I asked Detective Shin for this favor.

453
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,280
Hey, you bastard. Officer Jung!

454
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,620
Detective. He protected you this time, too.

455
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,280
Priest Go.

456
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,180
Re-operate?

457
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,460
Yes, I want to get another surgery. The medicine doesn't seem effective.

458
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,690
That's impossible.

459
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,860
At that time, Seong Yo Han died from cardiac arrest.

460
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,630
He had his brain removed right before his cranial nerves died. There's no brain to transplant now.

461
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,570
Still, there must be a way.

462
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,910
Please look for it. Okay?

463
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,830
I even have hallucinations now.

464
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,500
I am really scared that something will really happen.

465
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,230
Even if we find a donor brain, we can't do surgery anymore.

466
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:35,230
If by any chance this gets out to the world, we all have much to lose.

467
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,400
It's dangerous now.

468
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,010
Everyone?

469
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,900
Do you think that you and I are losing the same things?

470
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,770
I can lose myself!

471
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,480
I can be consumed by Seong Yo Han, that killer!

472
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,540
If anything happens to me, it's all of your fault.

473
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,520
You better be ready to take responsibility when that happens.

474
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:19,480
 A new suspect in the knot murder case is currently being investigated by the police.  
    

475
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,140
 The new suspect is found to be the son of the deceased suspect A. 

476
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,860
 - And there is attention to how the investigation will proceed in the future.   
 - I understand, Director.

477
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,420
  The police had requested an arrest warrant for suspect A.  
    

478
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:36,080
  and have decided to conduct a re-investigation of the knot murder case. 

479
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,210
This is Choi Young Sil.

480
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,830
I have favor to ask of you.

481
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,370
   

482
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,340
You. You're young but your stomach is coming out already.

483
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,610
What is this?

484
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,270
Please let me off this time.

485
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:19,040
Here, take this and eat it.

486
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,820
Her mom is an alcoholic.

487
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,980
She got divorced and only drinks alcohol all day.

488
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,600
- Does she live in this neighborhood? 
 - Yeah.

489
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,430
She must not go to school either. She's always right next to her mom.

490
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:42,750
After hearing the news about that beast being released, the house where kids are raised have already moved.

491
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,380
The girl's mom must not know that guy came here.

492
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,780
W-Who is coming?

493
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,350
Did you not know?

494
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,500
Omo, you didn't know, huh? Kang Duk Su came.

495
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:59,100
No, why did the police... Shouldn't they let you know first?

496
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,790
I'll go now. 
    

497
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,110
Hey, kid!

498
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,230
I won't take it from you.

499
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,040
Here.

500
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,110
Eat it with this. If you only eat bread, you'll get indigestion.

501
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,020
- What is your name? 
 - It's Yoo Na.

502
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:37,130
Yoo Na. Unnie will take you home. Let's go.

503
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,010
Yoo Na.

504
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,140
Yoo Na. Here.

505
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,170
Take this inside and eat it in your room.

506
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,880
Go in.

507
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Please move. As soon as possible.

508
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,130
Move? Who are you that you come to someone's house and say that?

509
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,100
Kang Duk Su came back to this neighborhood.

510
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,810
So what do you want me to do?

511
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,310
I will take care of my daughter.

512
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,330
Hey, you can move.

513
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,070
Mother...

514
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,110
You are a mother. Are you not worried about Yoo Na?

515
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,870
I told you I will take care of my child.

516
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,440
Who is this young girl coming here...

517
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,760
Who are you to tell me to move or not? Why pry so much.

518
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,120
I am Kang Duk Su's victim.

519
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,250
Do I have the right to pry then?

520
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,510
You are Yoo Na's guardian.

521
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:07,100
Protect her. Don't just drink.

522
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,030
Oppa?

523
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,680
Oppa.

524
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,200
♫  Too late to start to love  ♫

525
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,970
Bong Yi.

526
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,560
Nothing will happen to me, right?

527
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:52,090
I... I will be okay, right?

528
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,000
♫  Now I wanna be back   ♫

529
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,800
Of course.

530
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,130
It'll be okay.

531
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,460
Nothing will happen.

532
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:12,720
♫  What I want most now is you in my heart  ♫

533
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,300
Why? Why are you doing that, huh?

534
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,500
Why was it dismissed?

535
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,440
Be quiet, man. Because of insufficient evidence.

536
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,110
No, Hong Na Ri's DNA came out of the refrigerator. What other evidence do you need?

537
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,130
Then, what should I do?

538
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,970
If you want to chain him down, you should have found solid evidence.

539
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,390
I'm telling you that it's that bastard!

540
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,920
 The application for an arrest warrant for the new suspect, A, has been dismissed.  
    

541
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,760
 Criticism continues over whether it's a hasty investigation by the police– 

542
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,310
Aish...

543
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:57,080
Don't just blow your nose, but look for evidence so they can't move. 
  (T/N: Don't just be angry, but find solid evidence that they can't oppose.) 

544
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:04,070
- What is that? 
 - It's the notebook that Kim Yeong Hee's mother gave me, but there isn't much in it.

545
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,100
   

546
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,870
I think I've seen the woman next to Kim Yeong Hee somewhere.

547
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,920
Where did I see her?

548
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,150
I can take this, right?

549
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,900
Do you have something to say?

550
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,110
No.

551
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,720
Hey, do I not know Detective Go? What is it?

552
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,280
It's nothing, really.

553
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,990
Do you think you can take someone in? For about a month?

554
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,920
- Who is it? 
 - It's a dongsaeng I know. Don't ask more about it.

555
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,240
- No, I can't. 
 - If one month is too much, for a week–

556
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,100
I don't want to.

557
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,120
Aigo.

558
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:18,530
Who is it that he's like that? He's not someone who asks for something like that.

559
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,100
   

560
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,100
 The call could not be connected...  

561
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,900
Ahjusshi, are you alright?  Why are you so quiet when your body is big?

562
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,530
I'm sorry.  What should I do?

563
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,680
- Ouch. 
 - Sheesh.

564
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,800
Be gentle.

565
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,390
Woo Hyeong Cheol was released. Be careful when walking alone at night, you little rascal.

566
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:44,760
When I fought him, he wasn't very strong.  You saw my skills, right?

567
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,500
It looks like you learned a lot of fighting instead of studying like you were told to.

568
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,810
Here, take this.

569
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,640
What is this?

570
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,710
Who is Sung Ji Eun, and why would they send such a large sum of money every month?

571
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,050
Ahjusshi, are you a gigolo?

572
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,950
No, you don't have a gigolo's face.

573
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,980
What's wrong with my face, kid?

574
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,320
With that much, you should be able to get a studio.

575
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,440
If possible, you should get one in my neighborhood.  Or I can look with you.

576
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,460
I don't want to.  Why should I accept this money from you?

577
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,660
Take it!  I'm not just giving it to you. I'm lending it to you.  It's not my money.

578
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:31,220
No. It's not something that will be resolved by running away and avoiding it.

579
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,460
I want to overcome this here.

580
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,190
And If I run into him,

581
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,510
I'll make  him  avoid  me .

582
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,960
Okay, got it. You really don't listen.

583
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,620
But you have to contact me first if anything happens.  Got it?

584
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:01,900
This little kid really is all grown up now.

585
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,310
Ah, about Ba Reum Oppa.

586
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,000
Is something going on with him?

587
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,230
- Why? 
 - It just seemed like he was worried.

588
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:16,950
Yes, it seems like his condition isn't good lately.  And he's become overly sensitive.

589
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,630
Please help...

590
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,870
so that nothing happens to me.

591
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,610
Seong Yo Han.

592
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,970
Don't let me change into that monster.

593
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:08,950
Please...

594
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,800
Protect me, God.

595
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,350
Please.

596
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,460
Ah yes, Detective Shin.  What's the occasion?

597
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,840
 What do you think?  I called to relay some  good news. 

598
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,560
I think you're going to get transferred to the Evidence Storage Team.

599
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,580
 Should I call you Detective Jung, now? 

600
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,430
Is that so?

601
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,500
I should call Detective Go to thank him.

602
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,000
No, no. You should be thanking Kang Sunbaenim. 
    

603
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,660
Detective Kang?

604
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,520
So that you can stick right next to Detective Go–

605
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,190
Truthfully, Kang Sunbaenim is the one who cares the most for Go Sunbaenim.

606
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,620
Anyway, congratulations!

607
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,110
Just a moment.

608
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,150
Yes?

609
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,370
Yes, Sunbae.

610
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,120
A murder case?

611
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,950
 Yes, I'll be right there. 

612
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,660
He claimed himself as a deity. Did he really resurrect or something?

613
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,180
Officer Jung,

614
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,130
they found Seong Yo Han's signature at a murder scene.

615
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,430
His signature?

616
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:56,330
 The finger and the cross. I need to go– 

617
00:46:56,330 --> 00:47:00,530
Detective, I'll go too.  Send me the address.

618
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,840
 What a nutcase. I can't believe they copied this. 

619
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,920
I knew something like this would happen when they started talking about a Seong Yo Han Fan Club.

620
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,450
First, confirm the identities of the fan club kids.  Then find the identity of the victim.

621
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,930
- Yes. 
 - Sheesh.

622
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,210
 The site is stable. 

623
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:37,320
 It's the work of a professional. 

624
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,140
 The mint scent. 

625
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:51,290
 When I tumbled with that guy, I smelled mint. 

626
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:55,740
 It's that guy's scent.  But why is his scent here? 

627
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,730
 No way. 

628
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,360
Has the victim's identity been released?

629
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,490
Yes, a 17 year old girl, a high school freshman, and she lived with her grandfather.

630
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,510
Everyone pay attention!  Is this all the men we have right now?

631
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,620
Yes.

632
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,890
We're giving a brief of today's case as a simple murder case.

633
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,820
Be careful not to let it leak to the public that it's some kind of  Seong Yo Han copycat crime.

634
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,030
But, why?

635
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,410
As you all know,

636
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:26,880
one year ago, the entire nation watched that murder on a live broadcast, and are suffering from mass trauma.

637
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,660
They're finally starting to forget it,

638
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:32,010
so let's not arouse fear because of a copycat killer.

639
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:36,570
We were instructed to investigate this privately. It'll be a headache if reporters pick up a scent.

640
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:39,710
Watch your mouths and tell this to others who aren't here.

641
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,590
Yes.

642
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,990
That's right, the brooch.

643
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,880
Detective, did you find the grandma's brooch?

644
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,110
It's not here.  She must have dropped it somewhere else.  I told Bong Yi.

645
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,480
Please show me the picture of Seong Yo Han's basement.

646
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,570
Why Seong Yo Han, all of a sudden?

647
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,620
Please show me quickly.

648
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,030
Sheesh, really.

649
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,980
Let me.

650
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:22,420
Show me the video that the culprit sent during the broadcast.

651
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,900
Okay.

652
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,230
Sunbae! Oh–

653
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:30,590
Hey, why are you here?

654
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:33,500
Officer Jung was here.  He must have told you everything already.

655
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,420
About what?  Why is he like this?

656
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,020
 It's different.  Then the person who sent this might not have been Seong Yo Han. 

657
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,960
 Then... There's a  possibility that the culprit wasn't Seong Yo Han. 

658
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:48,270
 Yes! I only remember hitting him, not killing him. The hitter doesn't have to be the killer. 

659
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:52,320
 If the real culprit of Seong Yo Han's case is someone else, then the brain transplanted in my head is not the brain of a serial killer. 

660
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,040
Hey, tell me in detail.  What signature?

661
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,120
Some crazy bastard imitated the Seong Yo Han case.

662
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,650
I don't think it's a copycat crime.

663
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,400
I think the real culprit is someone else.

664
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,570
Take a look.

665
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,610
The two basements are different, right?

666
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,250
This basement isn't the one in Seong Yo Han's house.

667
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,470
It does seem like it.

668
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:11,880
Places look different if you move the furniture around.

669
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,770
No, Detective, take a look. It's not just the furniture location.

670
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:15,660
It does seem like it's not.

671
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:19,820
Bong Yi's Grandma's brooch  wasn't in the evidence, and neither was the Priest's necklace.

672
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,980
Seong Yo Han would collect items from the victims after he killed them.

673
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,010
But why weren't Grandma's brooch and the Priest's necklace found?

674
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,640
What Officer Jung is saying does make sense.

675
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,710
Hey, then what about Professor Daniel and Han Kook?

676
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:32,510
Those two haven't been found either.  If he left them there, then we wouldn't have found them.

677
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,530
That's true, but–

678
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:37,730
If Seong Yo Han isn't the culprit, then why was the picture of Byeon Sun Yeong's dead body found in his basement?

679
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,990
Then why would Seong Yo Han smash your head?

680
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:44,270
If he's not the culprit, then why would he try to kill you by hitting you in the head with a hammer?  Explain that!

681
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,710
What Sunbae is saying is right.  Officer Jung, your imagination is very–

682
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,790
Th-That is true, but do you remember that mint scent I told you about?

683
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,920
The mint scent that I smelled when I fought with the guy who killed Grandma.

684
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,160
I smelled it at the murder scene.

685
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,250
Hey, you can find mint scented shampoo, body products, and perfumes all over South Korea!

686
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,920
But, the–

687
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,180
Why do you want Seong Yo Han to not be the culprit?

688
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,120
Are you saying that I shot and killed an innocent person?

689
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,910
Is that the conclusion that you want?

690
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,900
- That's not it– 
 - Go, you jerk. You come here suddenly...

691
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,870
Get lost!  Go!  Go to your station.

692
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:14,460
- What Officer Jung is saying makes sense– 
 - Go!  Get lost!

693
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,460
Are you not going?

694
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:26,760
 What do they take the evidence storage team for? Aish. 

695
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,810
If there's a case, you should bring the evidence right away.

696
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:32,010
Must I come here to collect them myself?

697
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:34,860
Where is it?  Is that it?

698
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,190
Yes, that's it.

699
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,550
Are you sure this is it?

700
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,490
Ugh, I can hear you raging from outside.

701
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:43,640
You're having a blast being on the Evidence Storage Team.

702
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,560
Did they get burned alive?

703
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,360
 No, they were burned after they were killed. 

704
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,200
This is Officer Jung Ba Reum from Pyeongan Police Station.

705
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,240
A suicide case?

706
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,840
Why aren't they coming?

707
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,260
I'll see if 911 arrives, so stay here.

708
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,480
Mint scent?

709
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,900
It doesn't make sense that a person who hung herself

710
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,820
would try to loosen the rope by putting in her fingers so she wouldn't choke...

711
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,050
 If that's the case, someone put the rope around her neck 

712
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:54,310
 and her fingers got stuck because she tried to get out before they tightened it. 

713
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:55,980
 It's murder. 

714
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:01,300
Also, the rest of her fingers were taken out aside from her middle finger.

715
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:06,650
After she died, someone intentionally took out every other finger except the middle finger.

716
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,740
Why? Why?

717
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:15,790
-  Their middle finger was bent toward the cross.  
 - Perhaps...

718
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:04,260
I think he's right...

719
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,920
I've been thinking about it and what Officer Jung was saying makes sense, too.

720
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,900
Hey, what do you mean it makes sense! You gullible Parachute.

721
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,740
That damned "Parachute!" I am just saying that it doesn't hurt to hear Officer Jung out.

722
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,590
Hey, go. I'm busy.

723
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,300
Yeah, Officer Jung?

724
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,630
Huh?

725
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,720
- What came out? 
 - What is it?

726
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,310
It's true. I'm telling you.

727
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:29,890
The priest's cross necklace and Bong Yi's grandma's brooch were definitely here.

728
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:33,500
But when I brought Officer Nam, they disappeared.

729
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,540
Yes. I was surprised to hear what Officer Jung said,

730
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,630
but it wasn't here.

731
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:42,140
So, the only person who saw the priest's necklace and the grandmother's brooch was Officer Jung, right?

732
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,580
- Yes. 
 - And you fell off the chair and hit your head?

733
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,630
I saw it before I hit my head.

734
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:51,440
Detective. The suspect definitely took it.

735
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,570
So what Officer Jung is saying, the suspect set it up and came back to take it?

736
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:57,010
Why?

737
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,590
Ah, Officer Jung. Don't you think you're a little too obsessed with the story that there's another culprit for Seong Yo Han's case?

738
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,750
Detective Shin, I'm telling you that they were here.

739
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:07,160
Let's check the CCTV.

740
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,450
 It seems like you left your wife and went somewhere nice? 

741
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,170
Check the CCTV at the entrance.

742
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:14,900
I already checked, but it's a fake.

743
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,520
Definitely. They were definitely here.

744
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,830
Are you sure it's murder?

745
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:21,740
What about the identity?

746
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,010
Owner of an illegal decadent business massage parlor?

747
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:25,880
Team Leader. Please request a watch for Woo Hyeong Cheol.

748
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,010
What the hell are you talking about?  You don't do anything legally.  No, I won't.

749
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,220
Ah, that. Actually...

750
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,920
 There was another culprit. 

751
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,760
 Okay, I will catch that punk myself 

752
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,480
 and prove that Seong Yo Han's brain that's been inside my head is a normal person's brain, not a killer's. 

753
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:59,590
From the start of the alley to here, takes three minutes for an adult to walk.

754
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:04,680
And... Waited here and dragged her away,

755
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,060
which means he already knew that Kim Jin Ah would be coming this way.

756
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,890
Then, he is someone who knew where Kim Jin Ah lived...

757
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:16,530
Or someone who stalked her for a long time, or visited her house at least once.

758
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,160
Yes, Detective?

759
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,540
Yeah, where are you? You're not at your desk.

760
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,390
Ah, I came out to figure something out.

761
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:28,220
What is the matter?

762
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:32,760
I have something to tell you.  Let's talk in person.  Hurry up and come here.

763
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,650
What's this?  Does he have OCD or something?

764
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:42,800
Ah, this makes me feel uncomfortable. This kind of stuff makes me uncomfortable.

765
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:58,960
He really is trying hard to prove Seong Yo Han's innocence.

766
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,490
 They were mother and daughter. 

767
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:06,900
 And she was on very good terms with her daughter as well.  It was a good mother-daughter relationship. 

768
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,930
 She was close with Sun Yeong. 

769
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,160
It's her!

770
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,530
Yes, as Yeong Hee was quitting her job, she referred Hye Won to work here.

771
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:26,450
Where is she now?  Miss Park Hye Won.

772
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,490
It's been almost a year since she quit working.

773
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:33,820
She had a hard time after what happened to Sun Yeong, then she said she was getting married...

774
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,860
Getting married?  With whom?

775
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:40,160
I think she mentioned that he is a lawyer.

776
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,930
A lawyer.

777
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:45,140
 She texted and moved out in a hurry about a year ago. 

778
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:49,320
 She said that she will be going abroad to live and asked me to take care of everything. 

779
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,330
 She didn't come to collect the balance. 

780
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:54,840
 So I called her a few times but I couldn't get in touch with her. 

781
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:57,670
 She was the type to question the maintenance fee down to pennies. 

782
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,560
 I got a text message from Hye Won. 

783
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,930
She told me that she will be going abroad to live so she won't be able to stay in touch for a while.

784
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:04,440
When was that?

785
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,340
Almost a year ago, I think.

786
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,740
Just a moment, please.

787
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,660
Ah, it was.

788
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,900
But, it was a little strange.

789
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,230
Hye Won is not someone who paid attention to correct spacing of words.

790
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:22,010
Something about her writing seemed unfamiliar.

791
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:26,170
What?  There is no record of departing the country?

792
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,140
Okay.

793
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,900
Bastard.

794
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,630
He killed Park Hye Won, too.

795
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:38,500
But, how did Woo Hyeong Cheol know that Park Hye Won worked at that bar?

796
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,020
Take a look at this, please.

797
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:43,160
 This is the broadcast program that Woo Hyeong Cheol appeared on.  
    

798
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:58,550
 I think it would be better for me to investigate all this and refer them then pass them on. 

799
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:25,650
As I thought.  If she had struggled to get the rope off while alive,

800
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:29,550
there is no way that only a single clear line of trace would have been left on this dusty banister.

801
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:32,360
That would mean that she was killed then hung.

802
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:37,260
And the fingers were set up afterwards in order to make it look like a suicide.

803
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:40,360
Then, strangulation was the cause of death after all.

804
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:43,390
How did I miss this?

805
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,990
Detective Shin, did the autopsy results of Kim Jin Ah come out?

806
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,970
Are you saying this woman was Woo Hyeong Cheol's fiancée?

807
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,460
She was an orphan without any relations so no one knew that she was missing.

808
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,130
I think everyone thought that she was living abroad.

809
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,530
Why did he kill Park Hye Won?

810
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:05,780
Woo Hyeong Cheol, as the representative for the Seong Yo Han law suit,

811
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:09,700
saw Park Hye Won who testified as a reference witness  for Byeon Sun Yeong.

812
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:13,900
And found out that Park Hye Won worked at the same business that Byeon Sun Yeong worked at.

813
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:18,470
Then, what about Kim Yeong Hee?  Did he kill Kim Yeong Hee because she is Park Hye Won's friend?

814
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,460
Kim Yeong Hee worked at that business before.

815
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,430
She quit then referred Park Hye Won.  That's why he killed her.

816
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:24,840
What in the world was the reason?

817
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:30,620
This bastard, according to his shitty standard, is chastising women who are not modest.

818
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:34,330
He saw Kang Min Joo as a gold digger when he saw her going to a motel with a man.

819
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:38,090
And he witnessed Hong Na Ri, whose divorce was not finalized, with another man.

820
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:41,350
Then, why did he try to kill Oh Bong Yi?

821
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:46,020
Woo Hyeong Cheol represented Kang Duk Su at one point, although he resigned and another lawyer took over.

822
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,400
So, Woo Hyeong Cheol probably has all materials on Kang Duk Su's victims.

823
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,450
The fact that Oh Bong Yi is Kang Duk Su's victim

824
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:55,840
and the standard by which Woo Hyeong Cheol killed the women have no commonality.

825
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,440
But, why didn't he display the bodies of Park Hye Won and Kim Yeong Hee?

826
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,510
At first, he didn't have the confidence.

827
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:04,820
Then, as he gained confidence,

828
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,770
he started displaying the bodies.

829
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:14,680
We have to find the missing bodies of Park Hye Won and Kim Yeong Hee or find the murder weapon.

830
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:19,150
For now, that's the only sure way to catch that punk.

831
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:28,790
We should start with the people around Woo Hyeong Cheol—

832
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,960
 Yes, Aunt. 

833
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:38,640
I'm going home first.

834
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:45,520
   

835
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:57,730
- I would like the prescription, please. 
 - Sure.

836
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,780
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

837
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:09,570
Let's go.

838
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,540
- Mr. Attorney, please come in. 
 - Yes.

839
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,440
You must've suffered emotionally.

840
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:27,160
Police and their harassing of innocent people...

841
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,530
The iron you asked for.  I had a hard time getting ahold of them.

842
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:33,530
How's your wife's morning sickness?

843
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:35,670
It's gotten much better.

844
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,640
Earlier, wasn't that PD Choi Hong Ju?

845
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,160
Yes, it was.

846
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,630
Is that right?

847
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,580
I thought she was single.

848
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,160
You know how there are tabloids circulating after Seong Yo Han died,

849
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:49,980
that the killer Seong Yo Han and Choi Hong Ju were dating.

850
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,960
I actually tipped off a reporter I know.

851
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,140
 I heard it myself, while out drinking. 

852
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:59,450
 There are so many guys out there.  Why him? 

853
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,590
Is that so?

854
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,180
Wait, you found acetone?

855
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:10,530
Acetone easily vaporizes into the air.

856
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:13,220
So even small sparks can catch fire in an instant.

857
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:17,460
Acetone isn't a dangerous material like hydrochloric acid, so it's easy to buy in large quantities.

858
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,950
Isn't the cause of death strangulation?

859
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:27,460
No. If he choked her there would be a fracture in the hyoid bone or cartilage even if it's a burnt body,

860
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,480
But this body had no fractures at all.

861
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,380
Well, if she'd been strangled with something wider, like a towel,

862
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,880
then there could have been no fractures.

863
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,480
Could you please check if there was any congestion?

864
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:52,890
Officer Jung.

865
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:54,870
Con... Con– What?

866
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:57,540
- Congestion. 
 - Oh, congestion, what's that?

867
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,860
Oh that... See, if somebody is strangled,

868
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:05,780
their jugular vein gets compressed, stopping blood flow to the heart which causes the face to turn red.

869
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:09,540
Because of the carotid artery that circulates through the face and the skull, there can be blood congestion in the face.

870
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,350
The facial congestion soon causes congestion in the skull. So, the centrum bone in the skull gets congested as a result.

871
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,130
That bone's congestion is the decisive evidence of strangulation.

872
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:21,270
Woah.

873
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,080
Officer Jung, did you graduate from medical school?

874
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,690
No, I didn't graduate from college.

875
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:28,200
What? How do you know all of that so well?

876
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,590
Aren't all of those technical terms?

877
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:32,580
Oh that...

878
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,230
I just happened to know about it.

879
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:40,440
You just know about it? I guess you're smart.

880
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:45,640
It's because Seong Yo Han was a doctor.

881
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:49,530
So I killed Jae Pil Hyung when he hadn't actually committed any crime?

882
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:53,490
Woo Jae Pil probably knew everything his son Woo Hyeong Cheol did.

883
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:58,800
Why would Hyeong Cheol do that to my Su Jin?

884
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,160
Do you have something you could tell me about Woo Hyeong Cheol?

885
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,970
Something that could be a clue?

886
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:07,960
 Hyung Cheol's mother tried to commit suicide along with Hyeong Cheol.  
    

887
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:11,910
 So there were ambulances coming to the neighborhood and it was all chaos. 

888
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,590
How did she end up with a murderer?

889
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:17,220
Oh yes, not long before that happened,

890
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:21,120
I heard Hyung Chang Su had taken Hyung Cheol's mom to Guryeong.

891
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,550
Hyung Chang Su did?

892
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:25,480
Hyung Cheol's uncle. He used to live in the same neighborhood.

893
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,230
He probably still lives there.

894
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:30,550
Officer Jung. 
    

895
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:32,350
What you said was right.

896
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:35,370
In the centrum, it's faint, but there is indeed congestion.

897
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:38,820
So as you said, someone did strangle this person.

898
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:42,600
I didn't consider strangulation as a cause of death because I had found ash in the bronchial tubes.

899
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,760
If it weren't for you, Officer Jung, I might've completely missed it.

900
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,470
Wow Officer Jung!

901
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:48,800
I'm amazed.

902
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,280
It snowed heavily that day.

903
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,890
I took her to a hotel.

904
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:57,060
I was waiting in the car.

905
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,470
 Gosh, it's cold. 

906
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:02,190
She met somebody in the lobby.

907
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:04,530
It seemed like she was pleading with him.

908
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:08,390
After my sister returned from there she seemed very anxious.

909
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:12,280
Then she asked me to take her to Seoul again, so I took her.

910
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,090
Was it the same hotel?

911
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:18,630
I think it was some research center.

912
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:22,680
Anyway, after returning from that trip she became completely absent-minded.

913
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:27,590
She said she would die along with Hyeong Cheol and she took pills. She ended up jumping off of a building later on.

914
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:30,510
What are those flowers for?

915
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,630
Oh, they are hydrangeas.

916
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:36,790
My sister used to like those purple hydrangeas a lot.

917
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:38,880
But still, Hyeong Cheol, that sweet boy,

918
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:43,090
would visit her grave from time to time.

919
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,820
But all of them aren't purple, some are blue.

920
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,460
Lime needs to be sprinkled on the soil in order to get the purple flowers to bloom.

921
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:56,030
There was probably not enough lime this time.

922
01:06:56,040 --> 01:07:00,860
Those blue hydrangeas indicate the soil is acidic.

923
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:07,770
Wait a second. Isn't it acidic due to excess iron content?

924
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:09,580
That's right.

925
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:15,720
Hey you! Get away from there!

926
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,450
Get away! You're ruining all the flowers!

927
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:24,150
Please step aside. If it's iron, it could very well be a metal weapon.

928
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,720
Excuse me.

929
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,290
I'm with the police.

930
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:39,710
Has your granddaughter ever run away from home?

931
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:43,260
My Jin Ah ran away a year ago,

932
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,910
and spent time with other guys who'd run away.

933
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:49,470
It did make me quite upset. She only just

934
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:52,870
got back and was trying to get back to normal...

935
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:55,960
Elder,

936
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,960
is it possible that your granddaughter came back home

937
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,330
because someone persuaded her to do so?

938
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:05,540
Of course! That wonderful man

939
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:09,230
made Jin Ah see reason, and brought her back home.

940
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:15,240
I see. Is that wonderful man

941
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,400
this person?

942
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,720
Oh yes, that's right. It's this young man.

943
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,570
   

944
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:23,220
 - Feel free to call me anytime.  
  - Who is he? 

945
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:26,590
 He's giving free counseling to runaway teenagers. 

946
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:29,060
 He convinced many of them to return home. 

947
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:36,890
Where is Woo Hyeong Cheol right now?

948
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:40,510
Damn it... We lost him. There was an accident.

949
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,120
Goddammit! I told you to keep a close watch on him!

950
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:48,130
Put Woo Hyeong Cheol on the wanted list right away and trace his phone and car!

951
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:53,540
 Runaway teenagers and hookers... 

952
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:58,240
 He killed women who he didn't consider to be up to his own standards. 

953
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,760
 Who would be his next target? 

954
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,170
Why couldn't I reach you the entire day?

955
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:04,020
Hey Dong Koo.

956
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:10,580
I sent you the script for my wedding tomorrow. You haven't even seen it. I called you so that I could give you your suit and you didn't even pick up your phone.

957
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,800
Oh, right. Tomorrow's your wedding.

958
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,840
Oh, so my wedding is tomorrow?

959
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:19,910
Hey, come on! Do you want to die? Now go open the door. Quickly.

960
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:40,310
   

961
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:47,020
I bought this for you because you said you didn't have a suit.

962
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:50,440
You jerk. You actually forgot when my wedding was.

963
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,720
- Sorry. 
 - Let me take a look.

964
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:58,870
Wow! You look different now in a suit. You actually look really good.

965
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:00,660
Why are you taking a photo?

966
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:05,440
Stay still. Okay!

967
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:11,020
Why hasn't Seul Gi read any of my messages? She hasn't been answering any of my calls either.

968
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:15,060
 It's still not too late for you. You should rethink your decision to marry Seul Gi. 

969
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,280
 She really wants to be successful as an actress. 

970
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,450
Hey, where's Seul Gi's house? Where is it?

971
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:30,360
Choi Hong Ju! Choi Hong Ju!

972
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,640
What's the matter?

973
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,860
Dong Koo got into a fight with his junior and got booked by the police.

974
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:42,950
Wh-Why? Is he very injured? Where is he right now?

975
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:45,050
If you could just let me in for a minute I can tell you the entire story.

976
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,360
Yes, sure.

977
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:50,660
Please come in.

978
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,610
What's the matter?

979
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:06,640
Oh, what a relief. I just–

980
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:53,690
Seul Gi! Seul Gi! Are you in there?

981
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:57,920
Call 911 and go to the security office and get a plier. Quick!

982
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,350
Are you awake?

983
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,080
I should've killed that girl, but it got ruined because of you.

984
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:27,750
 I have to keep getting him to talk. He won't kill me while he's talking. 

985
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:34,990
- You killed them all, huh? 
 - Yeah

986
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,910
I killed them all.

987
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:39,720
Why did you kill them?

988
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,850
What's your reason?

989
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:44,010
Reason?

990
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:52,860
I'm judging them. Those lustful women.

991
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,510
Judging all of them.

992
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:57,310
 Did you have fun today? 

993
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:58,880
 Yes. 

994
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,800
 How can you look so pretty smiling? 

995
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,820
 I wish I had a pretty daughter like you, Soo Jin. 

996
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:08,310
 - Don't buy everything with this.  
  - Yes. 

997
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:09,970
 Come by often. 

998
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:12,650
 - Thank you!  
  - Okay. 

999
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,230
 Soo Jin! 

1000
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:19,210
 Dad! 

1001
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:22,560
 Oh, Hyeong Cheol! I'm a bit busy right now so I'll call you later. 

1002
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,790
 Dad! Soo Jin is... 

1003
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:30,070
 I think Soo Jin is dead! 

1004
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:43,600
 I learned how to tie a mountain rescue knot in Boy Scouts. 

1005
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:49,470
 I-I made a mistake while practicing that. What do I do? 

1006
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,450
I shed some tears and he believed me.

1007
01:16:55,450 --> 01:17:00,430
 Twisting my left hand slightly to the right, putting my right hand up. 

1008
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:04,560
My acting must have looked real.

1009
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,510
Your father must have really wanted to believe it was a mistake.

1010
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:15,150
 Honey... Somehow... I think Hyeong Cheol, to Soo Jin– 

1011
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:17,680
 What? What? What? He said it was a mistake! 

1012
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,370
 What are you thinking of right now? 

1013
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:24,800
   

1014
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,430
During that time, the whole country was focused on the Head Hunter case.

1015
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:32,550
Your father was thinking of a trick. Getting the same clothes and shoes as Park Hyun Soo.

1016
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:37,000
It probably wouldn't have been hard to get the DNA from the detective in charge of the case either.

1017
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,510
Even if the body was found, it was made to look like Park Hyun Soo's to confuse the case.

1018
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:43,600
No...

1019
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,150
I told you that it wasn't my dad's idea, but my idea. My idea.

1020
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:49,630
You killed your mother too, right?

1021
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:55,050
She must have given Doctor Daniel, who's out of business now, a piece of my hair.

1022
01:17:55,050 --> 01:18:00,460
That man said this... That I was born as a psychopath.

1023
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:05,230
 Why did you kill Soo Jin? 

1024
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:09,590
 Because she resembles you. She has similar dimples and 

1025
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:13,010
 even resembles your short pinky finger. 

1026
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:18,870
 She's your daughter, isn't she? You cheated with Man Ho Ajusshi, didn't you? 

1027
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:20,650
 What? 

1028
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:24,500
 Is it not true? If not, never mind. 

1029
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:44,520
 Don't worry. I'll come with you. 

1030
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:53,290
 No! 

1031
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:56,150
 No! 

1032
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:59,270
But Park Hee Won said that girl was no different from her mother.

1033
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:02,590
Even then, she dares to be my bride?

1034
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:05,830
That's why I killed her. Vulgar and wasteful ones.

1035
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:07,900
I judged them in the name of God.

1036
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,200
Then what about other people?

1037
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,790
Who?

1038
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,250
Oh Bong Yi?

1039
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:23,800
Do you not know?

1040
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,540
Hey, you son of a bitch. Why do you say that?

1041
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,690
You're talking bullshit!

1042
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,610
You crazy bastard!

1043
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:44,270
Song Soo Ho. Jin Seong Gyu. Byeon Soon Yeong.

1044
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:47,830
Jo Mi Jeong. Bong Yi's grandma. Why did you kill them? Why?

1045
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:51,910
What are you talking about? That was Seong Yo Han.

1046
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:53,640
Don't lie! You did them all!

1047
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:56,170
Seong Yo Han was turned over and died as your scapegoat, just like your father.

1048
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:59,130
In order to not get caught, you made it look like Seong Yo Han had killed them.

1049
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:01,910
As if it wasn't you who committed the murder. Isn't that right? Right?

1050
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:03,480
What are you imagining?

1051
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:08,510
You've become totally crazy after receiving brain surgery.

1052
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:11,140
Don't lie! You did it all.

1053
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:15,360
You were also the one who took the priest's cross necklace and grandma's brooch!

1054
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,120
Isn't that right?

1055
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,310
It was Seong Yo Han.

1056
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:51,120
It was Seong Yo Han.

1057
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:19,540
 Kill him! Kill him! You have to kill this kind of guy. 

1058
01:21:22,930 --> 01:21:24,880
 That's it! More! More! 

1059
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,250
 More! More! 

1060
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,270
Huh?

1061
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:08,380
What do I do? I think he's dead!

1062
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:12,150
How are you feeling?

1063
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,830
You!

1064
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:21,590
Isn't it thrilling?

1065
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:23,930
The feeling of killing someone.

1066
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:44,160
