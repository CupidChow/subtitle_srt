1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:08,570


2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,150
   

3
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,690
   

4
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,980
God! May God

5
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,430
save you.

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,850
How do I look?

7
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,890
I asked you to not make me a monster.

8
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,770
I begged.

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,380
But you completely ignored my prayer.

10
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,080
And you call yourself God?

11
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,820
From now on, I am a God.

12
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,630
Those humans who follow your crap,

13
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,140
I am going to get rid of all of them.

14
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,540
   

15
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,560
   

16
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,580
   

17
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,270
Father!

18
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,090
It's over here!

19
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,430
They're coming out.

20
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,370
Is it the same person?

21
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,570
It's a female, a female.

22
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,710
   

23
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,920
Excuse me. Excuse me!

24
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,760
Excuse me!

25
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,260
 Mint... 

26
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,900
Excuse me.

27
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:21,490
That bastard knew that we would go to the Irae-dong church.

28
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,930
 The way I see it, this guy is not a human being. He is a monster. 

29
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,760
 You can lose what is most precious to you. 

30
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,340
 Something that is most precious to me? 

31
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,480
 I already lost everything when I was eight years old. 

32
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,470
 You saw it too Ahjussi. 

33
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,790
 I don't have anything more to lose. 

34
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,020
Hyeong! Hyeong.

35
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,090
Hyeong. Hyeong!

36
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,770
Hey, Mu Chi. Hey, come here.

37
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,320
Mu Chi!

38
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,150
Let go!

39
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,500
Hyeong!

40
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,770
Mu Chi!

41
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,900
 Just now, the Fact Check team 

42
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,940
 received a video delivered from the criminal. 

43
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,700
In the three minute video, we are able to see Kim Han Kook. 
    

44
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,900
After an urgent meeting,

45
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,460
we have decided to reveal this video.

46
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,020
 When the farmer only fed the donkey yummy food, 

47
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,190
 the goat got jealous. 

48
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,370
 He stole your spot. 

49
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,980
 How about it? You hate him, don't you? 

50
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,950
 You want that child to disappear, huh? 

51
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,570
 Say it. You are jealous of that child. 

52
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,580
 I brought him here since you didn't answer. 

53
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,500
 How does it feel now that you see him in person? 

54
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,640
 Good kids don't lie. 

55
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,400
 Just say it. Then I will get rid of that child. 

56
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,380
I am not jealous.

57
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,460
So hurry up and send him home.

58
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,200
 You bastard. It's a crime not being jealous. 

59
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,900
 You are a pitiful person, Ahjussi. 

60
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,550
 So the goat came up with a plan 

61
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,580
 for the donkey to be disliked by the farmer. 

62
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,410
 The goat whispered to the donkey. 

63
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,550
 "You must be tired from working all day, aren't you? 

64
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,900
 Collapse as if you got sick. 

65
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,380
 Then you will be able to rest peacefully." 

66
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,700
 The donkey, while pretending to fall to the ground like the goat  told him to, 

67
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,800
 ended up with bruises all over his body. 

68
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,190
There was this bread next to where Han Kook disappeared.

69
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,600
'Hansel and Gretel.'

70
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,270
Wrath against the witch who ate the children.

71
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,410
Wrath against the father who did not look for him.  Wrath!

72
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,420
 The worried farmer visited the veterinarian to ask about treatment, 

73
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,960
 and the veterinarian answered. 

74
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,890
 "Make a potion from a goat's lungs and feed it to the donkey.   Then it will regain its health." 

75
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,220
 Goat man, choose. 

76
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,910
 If you want to live, you must kill that donkey.  
   

77
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,140
 If you don't kill the donkey, 

78
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,160
 the goat will die. 

79
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,560
 The reason why the kidnapper wants to kill Han Kook is, 

80
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,610
 unlike the fable 'The Goat and the Donkey,' 

81
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,340
 he did not envy or get jealous. 

82
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,030
 On the other hand, our Fact Check team has confirmed that 

83
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,510
 the child who was held captive with Kim Han Kook, 

84
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,530
 returned home safely. 

85
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,230
 Experts have cautiously 

86
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,830
 predicted that the probability of Kim Han Kook being alive is not high. 

87
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,970
 That is all. 

88
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,130
How is Detective Go Mu Chi?

89
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,990
They forcibly injected him with sedatives.

90
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,220
I heard that they were barely able to bring him here.

91
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,040
Now we will say our final farewell

92
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,900
to Father Go Mu Won, Marcelino.

93
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,940
 My fellow citizens, 

94
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,440
 I stand here with a heavy heart. 

95
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,670
 An innocent life being mercilessly killed 

96
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,540
 was broadcasted to the entire nation. 

97
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,300
 To the citizens who are still paralyzed 

98
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,150
 by the shock and fear, 

99
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,840
 I would like to apologize. 

100
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,100
 So that there will not be any more victims, 

101
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,450
 all investigative manpower will be brought 

102
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,080
 to do everything possible to apprehend the culprit as quickly as possible. 

103
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,540
 I was told that a corpse presumed to be Dr. Daniel has been found. 

104
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,190
 Once again, to the bereaved families... 

105
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,240
- Is it for sure? 
 - Not yet.

106
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,720
Since it was in the water for a long time, it's been badly decomposed.

107
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,590
 So that this terrible sacrifice will not occur any more, 

108
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,440
 in the very near future, 

109
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,900
 I will have a preventive measure against violent crimes prepared 

110
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,500
 so that all citizens may live in a world without crimes. 

111
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,940
 I promise you this. 

112
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,670
In God's mercy, may he rest in peace.

113
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,820
Amen.

114
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,390
   

115
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,580
Detective!

116
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,560
Please open the door. How many days has it been already?

117
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,580
 You will starve to death like this. 

118
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,660
 Please open the door. 

119
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,260
 Please, Detective Go. 

120
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,540
 I am asking you to let me see your face. 

121
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,510
Yes?

122
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,090
Ah, she woke up?

123
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,310
There is no major damage to the cornea,

124
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,570
and the cuts missed the nerve so there shouldn't be a problem with your hands either.

125
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,810
Did they catch that punk?

126
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,070
No.

127
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,960
Did you see his face?

128
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,060
I'm so stupid.

129
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,480
The first thing I should have done is to look at his face.

130
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,830
If you did, he probably would have killed you.

131
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,180
Excuse me, Doctor.

132
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:58,060
Have we, by any chance, met each other before?

133
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,300
Bong Yi. Oh Bong Yi, are you alright?

134
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,210
- Yeah. 
 - How can you go there by yourself so fearlessly?

135
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,140
Because the guy who killed Grandma was there.

136
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,660
So you go there by yourself?

137
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,120
Just because you took some martial arts classes, you went to fight a murderer by yourself?

138
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,780
- How can you take a murderer so lightly? 
 - So what!

139
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,760
He killed the priest, so should I do nothing?

140
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,540
After seeing that, should I just watch?

141
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,330
If Elder saw you getting hurt like this, how much...

142
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,060
What about Detective Go?

143
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,800
How is he doing?

144
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,260
How do you know Detective Go?

145
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,670
Are you alright, Student?

146
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,330
You've come.

147
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,080
If we were only a little bit later, it could have been a disaster for you.

148
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,930
Everyone was going to Irae-dong.

149
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,580
How did you know to go to Gudong Cathedral?

150
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,500
 Sir, please take me to Irae-dong Cathedral. Quickly! 

151
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,670
I was on my way to the Irae-dong Cathedral, too.

152
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,780
 Grandma, I am going to kill that guy. 

153
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,010
There were the same candlesticks in my Grandma's photo.

154
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,990
They are the candlesticks in Gudong Cathedral.

155
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,070
 Uh, Ajussi, please take me to Gudong Cathedral. Quickly! 

156
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,790
You should have reported it first.

157
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,940
I did. But they said the candlesticks in cathedrals are all the same.

158
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,440
But thanks to your report, at least your life was saved.

159
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,280
Did you see anything?

160
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,590
It was so dark.

161
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,350
And he splashed melted candle wax in my eyes.

162
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,230
Then you didn't see anything?

163
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,250
Well, he was very strong.

164
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,020
Do you remember anything else? Anything at all?

165
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,100
Ah, he was not left-handed.

166
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,280
He wasn't left-handed?

167
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:11,150
When he attacked me, he was definitely left-handed. And the knife that was plunged into the roof of the church

168
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,490
was definitely done by someone left-handed, too.

169
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,310
No, he wasn't left-handed. He was definitely right-handed.

170
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,020
Do you remember anything else?

171
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,180
Oh, that...

172
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,660
Oh... I'll think about it some more.

173
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,350
Alright. If you do remember anything else, contact us.

174
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,290
Take care.

175
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,620
I'll go visit Chi Kook since we are here.

176
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,180
 The call was not connected, so you will be connected to voicemail... 

177
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:04,040
Yo Han, I'm in Mujin because of work and I came to visit you, but you're not answering the phone.

178
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,320
   

179
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,500
It must hurt.

180
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,320
How can someone do this to a child's face?

181
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,860
No, it doesn't hurt.

182
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,850
I made a promise with Elder.

183
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,700
Promise?

184
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:54,360
She asked me to look in on you once in a while if she were no longer around.

185
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,530
And I promised her that I would. So if anything happens to you,

186
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,740
I will be too ashamed to face Elder.

187
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,090
Get some rest.  I will go pack some things you might need and bring them for you.

188
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:19,600
Oh, right. I think that I cut his arm with a knife.

189
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,030
Really? Which is it? Did you cut him, or you just think you did?

190
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,950
Well... He was holding me by my hair,

191
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,910
and I wildly swung my arm while holding a knife, and I think I brushed against something.

192
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,900
- Where? Which side? 
 - That... I was...

193
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,240
Left side. I think it was his left arm.

194
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,860
Left arm.

195
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,410
Alright, I'll make sure to tell Detective Kang. Get some rest.

196
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,620
Left arm...

197
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,430
 Die! Die. 

198
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,970
 A boy like you should die. You monster. 

199
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,550
I should have killed him then. Back then...

200
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,820
Are you alright?

201
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,140
I am fine.

202
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,670
Who is that?

203
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,770
I don't know. But I don't think she feels well. Let's go, we will be late.

204
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,670
Oh, sure.

205
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,330
So this fake Han Kook was Han Kook's younger brother with a different mother?

206
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,510
- Have you met with this boy? 
 - Yes, but he didn't see anything.

207
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:02,150
He was playing in front of his home and someone covered his mouth from behind. And when he woke up, he was in front of his home again. Nothing else.

208
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,910
Was anything left at the scene of Priest Go's death?

209
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,650
The other victims each had some sort of related item left.

210
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,100
Follow me.

211
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,740
Did Detective Go see this, too?

212
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,540
At that time, he was not in his right mind. I didn't know how to tell him about this.

213
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,580
I didn't know, at first.

214
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,570
The priest... There was something strange about his body.

215
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,770
Detective Go is still in the same state, isn't he?

216
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,960
I am so afraid he might decide to do something rash.

217
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,410
What are you doing?

218
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,250
Hey!

219
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,030
Dong Koo?

220
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,430
Dong Koo?

221
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,740
I was taking a dump, then a sudden thought came to me.

222
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,560
He knew that we were making a fake video

223
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,820
so he made his own fake video, too. So how did he know?

224
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,030
My Conan-sixth sense tells me, wiretap.

225
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,700
- Wiretap? 
 - Yeah.

226
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,620
Of course, there is no way that the surveillance equipment is still here.

227
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,670
You were gone so much because you were nursing Bong Yi, so he probably cleaned it up when you weren't home.

228
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,700
But how would that murderer know where my house is?

229
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,720
All he had to do was follow Detective Go and PD Choi. It would be so easy to find out where your house is.

230
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,950
That's right.

231
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,380
Dong Koo, you're not going around blabbing about this elsewhere, are you?

232
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,910
Hey, how can you think I would do that?

233
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,320
Maybe... PD Choi?

234
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,010
It's not because any of us blabbed. Think about it.

235
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:59,220
We decided to do the broadcast no matter what and made the video only an hour or two before the broadcast.

236
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,400
And during that time, we did not meet anyone or talk about it with anyone.

237
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,890
Maybe he really is spying on us?

238
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:19,810
 It's been 10 days since he was kidnapped from a theme park in Mujin, and his location remains unknown. 

239
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:26,020
 The police are thoroughly searching the homes of his friends and Shimjeon Station  
    

240
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,510
 but it appears that they have not made progress. 

241
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,110
He hasn't touched any of the food.

242
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:54,200
I heard that if you keep drinking without eating any food, you could die of acute alcohol poisoning.

243
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,620
We have to feed him somehow. What do I make for him?

244
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,340
You really are very devoted.

245
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,820
If you make food for someone who has no will left to live, would he eat it?

246
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,340
But we should help him eat at least one bite.

247
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,070
What is this?

248
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,610
- Oh, this is it. 
 - What?

249
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,320
Wow, this...

250
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,390
I had this.

251
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,120
Detective? When we were at my house to prepare for the broadcast,

252
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,040
you enjoyed eating japchae and other foods.

253
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,240
I didn't make all of that.

254
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,370
Father Mu Won brought that to me.

255
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:12,640
 I lied to you because I thought you wouldn't eat it. 

256
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,280
 I asked Father why he made so much 

257
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,650
 and he said that you love japchae, and he wanted you to eat it for a long time. 

258
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:29,710
And he left out the carrots because you don't like them.

259
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,970
 This is the last one left. 

260
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,970
You can eat it or throw it away. Do what you want to.

261
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,700
I'm sure that Father would not want

262
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,120
 you to be like this. 

263
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,850
 Breaking news. The culprit has released another video of Kim Han Kook to the public. 

264
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,900
 That's how it ends with the goat man. 

265
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,270
 Detective Go Mu Chi, what are you going to do? 

266
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,920
 Are you going to give up on Han Kook like this? 

267
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,360
 If you can't find me in three days 

268
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,290
 the entire nation will get to see Han Kook's lungless corpse. 

269
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:27,180
 You've got exactly three days left, until midnight. 

270
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,350
Han Kook! Han Kook!

271
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,900
 The murderer has called Detective Go Mu Chi to the stage again. 

272
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,530
 Detective Go Mu Chi is in shock due to the loss of his older brother. 

273
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:41,400
 The public is left wondering whether he will be able to overcome his loss, and find Han Kook. 

274
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,460
Eat slowly. You'll get indigestion.

275
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,530
Hyeong!

276
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,460
It's a bit bland, isn't it?

277
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,660
No matter how hard I try, I can't achieve the same taste as Mom.

278
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,780
Hyeong,

279
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,720
I'm sorry.

280
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,880
It's because of me.

281
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,730
Because of me...

282
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,270
It's not because of you.

283
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,990
Back then and now.

284
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,710
It's not because of you.

285
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,550
What are you doing?

286
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,390
I'm taking my ID and gun, obviously.

287
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,590
What the heck?  Don't you remember handing in your resignation?

288
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,090
It hasn't been processed yet, right?

289
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,470
They probably didn't have the time to process it.

290
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,290
- Oh about that– 
 - Let me know when it's accepted and I'll turn in my gun then.

291
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,670
Look here, you bastard–

292
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,210
Do you think I became a police officer to cover for you? You punk!

293
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,940
Oh! I don't think they make this model any more.

294
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,500
You maintained it well.

295
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,840
You must like cars.

296
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,590
Kim Joon Sung's last call before he died

297
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,680
was to you, Seong Yo Han.

298
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,240
You used to talk at least once a day.

299
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,440
Why didn't you contact him for a week?

300
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,930
The day of the last call, Joon Sung said he was going on a trip, so I thought he was abroad.

301
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,830
He was the only one person who provided an alibi for you

302
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,470
on Dr. Daniel's missing case...

303
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,710
And he was killed?

304
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,700
I said that I was home that day.

305
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,420
So then you were home at the time of Professor Daniel's disappearance.

306
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,600
And you were at home when Kim Joon Sung, who gave you an alibi, was murdered.

307
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,980
You must be a homebody.

308
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,730
Yes.

309
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,130
I really like to be home.

310
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,680
   

311
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,420
   

312
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,590
   

313
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,430
   

314
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,490
What is this?

315
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,880
   

316
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,610
Then where did this grandmother get this picture?

317
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,480
The bag is missing.

318
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,820
What is this?

319
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,540
 - Exactly! It's not like I can report to the police for yogurt theft. 
 - Excuse me. I... 

320
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,020
Welcome!

321
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,080
Why are you opening someone else's refrigerator?

322
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,970
I'd like to see the security camera.

323
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,310
Ah, actually that grandmother

324
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,990
did come to our place to find work.

325
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,040
But I just sent her away.

326
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,760
Who would hire an elderly person like that as a housekeeper?

327
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,820
Then you should have said so back then.

328
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,100
Why did you pretend that she had never come here?

329
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:49,530
Well... When I got back from the bathroom, she had left.  That's the truth.

330
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,680
What time was it?

331
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,630
What time did the grandmother come here?

332
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,660
Oh, regarding the phone number I just sent,

333
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,670
between 4:10 p.m. and 4:20 p.m.,

334
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,470
please check the caller's ID addresses.

335
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,140
Quickly!

336
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,200
   

337
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,360
Officer Jung!  What are you doing here?

338
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,260
Oh, this is really a high pass.

339
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,280
But why are you here?

340
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,910
There's an album that Chi Kook used to listen to frequently.

341
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:23,450
I couldn't find it anywhere at home, so I was wondering if it was in the office.

342
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,770
Ah, that one. I know it.

343
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,700
He used to listen to it whenever he had a break. The jazz album?

344
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,400
Oh, you know it?

345
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,170
But... What about it?

346
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,030
I want to let Chi Kook listen to it.

347
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,160
What?

348
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,140
It was left to Chi Kook by his father.

349
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,300
His father really like that singer.

350
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,940
And he recorded this CD when he went to this singer's concert in Korea.

351
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,810
Chi Kook used to get up immediately while sleeping when he heard that music.

352
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,770
So maybe it can help him.

353
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,770
   

354
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,550
Thank you.

355
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,300
You seem familiar.

356
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,250
Is that so?

357
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,080
Since my face isn't unique.

358
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,030
You know the Information Center for Housekeeping Land near Gudong Station, right?

359
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:51,010
You called there between 4:10 p.m. and 4:20 p.m. on the fifteenth, which was last Friday.

360
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,620
Yes.

361
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,550
I needed someone to clean.

362
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,050
But this is Gangcheon.

363
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,570
Why did you call an agency in Mujin City?

364
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,790
Who did you talk to?

365
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,880
It was someone older.

366
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,430
So then, did that person come here?

367
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,890
No.

368
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:13,600
Normally they would send the same lady here.

369
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,260
On that day...

370
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,750
Excuse me for a minute.

371
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,730
It's past my Bokshil's meal time.

372
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,040
I need to feed him.

373
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,930
I've seen her somewhere.

374
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,130
   

375
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,840
 They're called zinnia. 

376
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,990
 In flower language, they mean to miss someone who has left. 

377
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,870
 Give me money! Give it to me! 

378
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:26,230
 My brother will die without this surgery. 

379
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,330
   

380
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,570
 She was Han Seo Joon's wife. 

381
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,100
 You've been sending money every month after that. 

382
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,900
Han Seo Joon.

383
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,410
I found your son.

384
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,130
You got an official document from Mujin Police Station, right?

385
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,330
Yes, just a moment.

386
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,300
   

387
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,510
 You changed names. 

388
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,120
 That's why I couldn't find you. 

389
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,520
   

390
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,750
Seong Yo Han?

391
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,440
What, Parachute?

392
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,790
Sunbae, are you all right?

393
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,530
You weren't answering your phone so I was worried.

394
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:36,340
Have you checked Seong Yo Han's family relationship?

395
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,530
More than that, Kim Joon Sung was killed.

396
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,960
 Seong Yo Han's friend. 

397
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,490
What?

398
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:47,700
I just searched all over the house.

399
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,120
Ah, here.

400
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,610
There are also signs of a severe beating.

401
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,970
Like he was being tortured.

402
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,090
Have you met Seong Yo Han?

403
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,050
Yes. Apparently,

404
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,860
he said Kim Joon Sung was on a trip so he didn't call him for a week.

405
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,660
We found his plane ticket to Switzerland one day after the murder.

406
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,570
And we checked all the luggage.

407
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,210
Sunbae, I think...

408
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:12,310
he waited for Kim Joon Sung to try to escape overseas to kill him.

409
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,950
Estimated time of death, 8:10 p.m. on the 28th.

410
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,170
If that's the time,

411
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,430
it was the day I held a press conference.

412
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,970
The time that bastard called me.

413
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,730
 We investigated thoroughly. 

414
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,990
 There weren't any ties between the victims. 

415
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,180
 But what if... 

416
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,460
Sunbae!

417
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,220
Seong Yo Han only has a mother.

418
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,980
She owns a flower shop in Gangcheon. Her name is–

419
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,200
Seong Jin Ah.

420
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,120
How did you know it?

421
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,240
 Detective Go, you like being on TV. Don't you? 

422
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,660
 What was the program on which you wrongly said that I chose my victims randomly? 

423
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,460
 Find the reason I killed the child and say it on that TV show. 

424
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,150
 I decline a drunken broadcast. Be serious. 

425
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,950
 After all, a person's life is on the line. 

426
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,400
 If you don't say the correct answer, as soon as that broadcast is over, right on the dot, 

427
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:36,590
 I will kill him where everyone in the country can see. 

428
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,200
Han Seo Joon,

429
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,380
he killed my mother and father.

430
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:58,430
As if that's not enough... his son killed my brother?

431
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,560
Just you wait.

432
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,120
I'll kill you first,

433
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,080
then I'll go to prison to cut your father's neck.

434
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,820
The fact that no outsiders are suspects means it is someone who works here.

435
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,950
That makes no sense.

436
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:35,380
Exactly. There's no way he would be so reckless in his workplace.

437
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,950
First, let's meet some of Na Chi Kook's workmates.

438
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,300
All right. This way, please.

439
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,580
- PD Choi! 
 - Officer Jung, what are you doing here?

440
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,610
- Oh, I came to get some of Chi Kook's things. 
 - Oh.

441
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,230
- Are you here for an interview? 
 - Yes.

442
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:53,060
Since there are no outside suspects,

443
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,790
I came to meet some of the internal workers.

444
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,820
Oh, yes.

445
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,080
And the people who didn't write their names in the guestbook?

446
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,650
If you don't write your name in the guestbook, you can't go in.

447
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,520
But we passed through.

448
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,960
We didn't bring our ID Cards, so Mr. Kim gave us a ride in.

449
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,410
My car is registered.

450
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:15,120
If you enter with an employee's vehicle, can you pass without signing your name?

451
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,330
There's an ID double-check at the reception.

452
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:22,200
But if you enter by the employees' entrance, your name may not be registered.

453
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,930
Then let's check this list one more time.

454
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:37,210
This is strange. Then who came to the infirmary that day?

455
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,110
Who?

456
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,880
You know, that day when Officer Na got hurt...

457
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,990
 Correctional Officer Na is injured badly. I think you need to come to the auditorium fast. 

458
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,490
 Yes, I'll go immediately. 

459
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,000
 Hey, looks like someone got hurt. I will go see and be back. 

460
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,650
 I should go too. It's almost time to work. 

461
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,280
I'm sure there was someone else there.

462
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,210
Where is this doctor?

463
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,410
   

464
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,300
Guard!

465
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,350
I-I can't breathe!

466
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,720
I quit doing this a long time ago.

467
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,520
How come a detective makes a decent person do something like this?

468
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,600
When you last caught me, you told me not to do this again.

469
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,430
You're doing something good to save people.

470
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,770
- Done? 
 - Yeah.

471
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,950
Thanks, you can go.

472
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,410
 It looks like a zipper. 

473
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,670
 It had fallen inside the ferris wheel. 

474
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:41,300
Here.

475
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,140
- Did you heard about it, right? 
 - What?

476
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,900
This.

477
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,910
You found this in there and threw it away, then reported it to me. Didn't you?

478
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,820
- No. 
 - What do you mean? Seong Yo Han isn't dumb.

479
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,080
Would he really leave important evidence in a place like this?

480
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,920
You know if you took this from his house without a search warrant, it won't be accepted as evidence.

481
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,460
You know, from a psychological point of view–

482
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,650
I didn't bring it out, you jerk!

483
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:04,350
Hurry up and get the search warrant.

484
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,780
Sunbae! Right now, this–

485
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,620
Hey, you bastard. What are you going to do if Han Kook is in there?

486
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,380
What are you going to do if we find Han Kook after he's dead?

487
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,810
We don't have time. We only have one more day.

488
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,270
Ah, okay!

489
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,230
Ah, whatever.

490
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:25,730
There are dumb criminals who throw out important evidence like this.

491
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:28,310
Maybe he just wanted to get caught.

492
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:32,980
Hey Parachute, I mean Detective Shin. Thank you.

493
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,330
When your father runs for President, I will give him my precious vote.

494
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,000
Gosh, I'm so grateful.

495
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,490
Anyway, once we can confirm this blood belongs to Dr. Daniel,

496
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:45,070
the search warrant will come out.

497
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,950
Right.

498
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:54,470
I don't think there's anything wrong.

499
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,900
Was his name Seong Yo Han?

500
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,610
What?

501
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,830
How do you know Yo Han?

502
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:03,760
Did he come here that day?

503
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,890
The day of the accident with the rookie officer.

504
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,160
How did you...

505
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,190
Doctor!

506
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,410
I'm sorry to interrupt during treatment, but could you come and see a guest?

507
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,410
Okay.

508
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:20,310
Wait a moment.

509
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:32,510
Sung Ji Eun. You sneaky brat.

510
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:35,770
Someone came here the day of Officer Na Chi Kook's accident, right?

511
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,990
Ah, that day my colleague came by.

512
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:41,860
He said that he had something to tell me and insisted on coming,

513
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,040
so I told him to come. But then he said he left his ID somewhere.

514
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,450
So I went to near where he was, and we came in my car.

515
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:51,120
Why didn't you tell the police that?

516
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,030
That day, I forgot about it.

517
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:58,340
And it's not like Yo Han could be the culprit.

518
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:02,990
- Who? 
 - Oh, it was Seong Yo Han.

519
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:07,130
Seong? Seong Yo Han?

520
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:09,790
Seong Yo Han! Wasn't he the doctor who did Chi Kook's surgery?

521
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,040
Yes, I heard he did that.

522
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,380
 I'm scared. I'm scared. 

523
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:22,770
Detective Kang, that day that Chi Kook got hurt, there is someone whose name was left off the list of visitors.

524
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:41,050
Oh, Detective Shin. How is the search warrant going?

525
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,060
What? Not yet?

526
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:48,290
Aish. I got it.

527
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,020
 Why is PD Choi here? 

528
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,180
- A wiretap? 
  - There is no way that the surveillance equipment is still here. 

529
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,820
 You were gone so much, so he probably cleaned it up when you weren't home. 

530
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,850
I must have gone crazy.

531
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,490
When did you arrive?

532
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,130
It was that punk. Seong Yo Han.

533
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:39,850
 If you find him, then what are you going to do?  Are you going to harm him instead of Han Seo Joon or something? 

534
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,580
 Do you need to find his son? 

535
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,170
 What crime did the son commit? 

536
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:46,870
Choi Hong Ju knew who Seong Yo Han is.

537
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,830
Is something wrong? Coming without notice.

538
00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:00,430
Nothing, I just missed you.

539
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,490
Let's first go down.

540
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,270
Okay.

541
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,270
   

542
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,520
Please, drink it.

543
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,230
Thank you.

544
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:55,710
What is your schedule for dinner tomorrow?

545
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,420
Hm?

546
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,240
Oh, it's alright.

547
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,300
Why? Is something wrong?

548
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,570
I'll tell you tomorrow. Everything.

549
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,330
Everything?

550
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,410
Oh, right.

551
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,350
Excuse me a moment.

552
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:19,600
Are you all right, Detective?

553
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,950
- I'm a bit busy... 
 - A search warrant for the suspect just came out.

554
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:24,810
Search warrant?

555
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:30,580
- Who is the suspect? 
   - They are heading out in 30 minutes so if you want the exclusive, hurry up and come. 

556
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:34,600
I have to go.

557
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,100
I'm sorry. I'm a new driver.

558
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,530
There's no need. Please just go.

559
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,540
Ey, why are you like this?

560
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,180
It's because I was reported as a hit-and-run before.

561
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,580
Please wait. I called the police so they'll come soon.

562
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,400
I told you that it's okay.

563
00:53:58,430 --> 00:53:59,890
- Hello. 
 - Yes, hello.

564
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,120
I wasn't paying attention so I hit the car in front.

565
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,310
It's fine.  I can leave, right?  I have some pressing business to attend to.

566
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,570
Yes.

567
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:11,470
Excuse me, but I think I heard some noise coming from the passenger seat.

568
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,330
It kind of sounded like a child groaning.

569
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:14,210
Why?

570
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:18,770
I think you should check on it, in unsettling times like these.

571
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,180
What is that there?

572
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,870
I am on my way to volunteer for medical service.

573
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:28,700
They are my clothes and medical supplies.

574
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,400
Could you bring it out and open it up for us please?

575
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:36,010
Why are you asking me to open my suitcase when you are here for a car accident?

576
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:39,200
As you are probably aware, the entire country is on alert because of a killer.

577
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,490
- Please cooperate. 
 - No, I do not want to.

578
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:46,460
If you do not cooperate, you need to accompany us to the police station.

579
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,860
 You knew who Seung Yo Han is? 

580
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:23,750
 Why aren't you answering your phone? 

581
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,960
 Ah, I am sorry.  The battery is dead.  What about the search warrant? 

582
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,740
 - It was denied. 
 - Denied? Why? 

583
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,470
 They say the blood on the shoes is not Dr. Daniel's. 

584
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:34,590
 - It's not Dr. Daniel's blood? 
 - No. 

585
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:38,790
 They compared it against all the victims' blood but none of them matched. 

586
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,560
 Then whose blood is it? 

587
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,940
 We don't have time.  Why don't we just break into the basement and bring Han Kook out? 

588
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,420
 No, no, no! 

589
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,660
 What if Han Kook's not in there and I am wrong again? 

590
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,520
 I already lost my brother because of my reckless behavior. 

591
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:00,930
 If we enter prematurely and he catches on, then he might kill Han Kook before the time is up. 

592
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,730
 And on top of that, if that punk gets rid of all traces of evidence before we save Han Kook, 

593
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:08,560
 even if we catch him and put him away, he will eventually be able to weasel his way out. 

594
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,810
 Then what are we supposed to do?  The warrant was denied, too.  There is no way to do this.  No way. 

595
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:16,690
 After today, this will be even more... 

596
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:21,670
 If we can't go in, we just have to make that punk bring him out. 

597
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,280
 What? 

598
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:31,570
 PD Choi, a search warrant for the suspect just came out. 

599
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:35,740
 They are heading out in 30 minutes so if you want the exclusive, hurry up and come. 

600
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,810
 What are you talking about? 

601
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:42,210
 You... You said that your girlfriend lives around here, right? 

602
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:46,070
 Tell her to hurry up and bring her car.  Let's cause a fender bender. 

603
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,010
Please open it quickly.

604
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,840
As soon as Han Kook is safe, I will kill you myself.

605
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:14,430
Han Seo Joon, after I kill your son,

606
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,310
I will be coming to kill you.

607
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:40,300
Yea.

608
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,240
Han Kook is not there.  I said he's not there.

609
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,070
What? He's not there?

610
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,770
Are we done?

611
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:50,050
I am in a bit of hurry.  It's okay for me to leave, right?

612
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:02,350
Come to think of it, I think the sound came from the trunk.

613
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,970
Could you please open your trunk?

614
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:07,300
I ask for your cooperation.

615
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,730
Are you satisfied?

616
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,010
What happened?

617
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:52,950
We don't have much time left!

618
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:02,230
Hey, you follow that punk's car.

619
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:04,640
I said follow his car!

620
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:27,620
   

621
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,070
   

622
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,290
What? You lost him? Ah, damn!

623
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:33,660
Team Leader, please track the location of a car.

624
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,490
Hurry!

625
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:59,740
They say that the wound tissue on the band aid is not Han Kook's DNA.

626
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:04,110
But just in case, we are comparing it against the DNA of other victims.

627
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,340
Detective Go, why did you lie to me?

628
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,920
What is the reason you told me that a search warrant was issued?

629
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,350
You... You knew everything. Didn't you?

630
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:23,200
That Seong Yo Han is Han Seo Joon's son.

631
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:28,340
So that's why you said that, "What crime did Han Seo Joon's son commit?"

632
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,020
You knew everything, yet you and he...

633
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:38,340
You... Do you know what kind of bastard he is?

634
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,560
What are you talking about?

635
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,180
What happened with Seong Yo Han's car?  Did you find it?

636
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:53,400
We are still looking for it.

637
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,240
We don't have time!  We have to find it!  Han Kook will die!

638
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,130
Are we idling here? We are all working hard!

639
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,160
What is that?

640
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,100
Hey!

641
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,530
   

642
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:41,060
   

643
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,410
   
   
   

644
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,760
Why? Why is my brother's stomach...?

645
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:58,520
   

646
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,030
It came out of his stomach?

647
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,240
 Goat's mom, who was filled with wrath, 

648
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,180
 cut open the wolf's stomach and took out the corpses of all the babies, 

649
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:15,100
 then filled the stomach full with rocks and sewed it up. 

650
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:21,490
 One who does not rage is a sinner. 

651
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:25,890
 Father Go Mu Won, I will judge you. 

652
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:52,690
   

653
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,930
 The deadline to rescue Han Kook was yesterday at midnight, 

654
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:03,160
 and there is only a small chance of him still being alive. 

655
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:06,840
 The police still have not found any hints on the suspect. 

656
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,570
 - So this case still is unresolved.  
 - How upset his mother must be.

657
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,910
   

658
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,130
Yes, Team Leader. The results have come out.

659
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,140
Yes, alright.

660
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:14,160
About the blood on Seong Yo Han's shoes,

661
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,930
it matches the DNA found on the body that was thrown in the water.

662
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:18,860
- Hey, it is this bastard. 
 - Huh?

663
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,280
I'm saying it is Seong Yo Han. I just got a call from the NFS.

664
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,020
The DNA on the Goat Man's bandaid is the same as Oh Bong Yi's grandma.

665
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,350
Hurry up and get a warrant.

666
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:31,020
You should have called before coming.

667
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,630
What is it that you want to say?

668
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:41,330
What is wrong, my son?

669
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,510
You already knew about it, right?

670
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,530
About what?

671
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:56,320
That your son is a killer.

672
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:17,500
Bong Yi!

673
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,630
Oppa.

674
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,470
Ah, my hand!

675
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,320
Be careful.

676
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,950
This won't do. Get on my back.

677
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,300
Why?

678
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,340
Don't be stubborn and let's go to my house.

679
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,750
- Oppa. 
 - Huh?

680
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,660
It's nothing.

681
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:14,060
   

682
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:25,240
 Twenty missed calls from Team Leader Bok 

683
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,740
This is what I used.

684
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:33,150
Use this just for tonight and I'll wash it for you tomorrow.

685
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:43,760
I need to feed Uh Bung Yi.

686
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,910
Ah, then I'll get your clothes and bring it here too.

687
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:49,850
I'll be back.

688
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,720
Yes, Detective Kang.

689
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:19,740
Detective Go? Is he not at home?

690
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,970
What?

691
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:26,420
You found Bong Yi's grandmother's DNA at that doctor's house?

692
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:35,220
- Search through everything! 
 - Yes!

693
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:09,980
 The call cannot be connected...  

694
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:16,900
Hurry, hurry.

695
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,700
Hurry.

696
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,560
   

697
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:39,030
   

698
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:41,670
Hello?

699
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:46,580
Ahjussi! That person is here.

700
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,140
What?

701
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:50,220
 Where are you right now? 

702
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:52,850
Oppa.

703
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:08,790
Oppa!

704
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:09,790
Hurry up and go.

705
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:12,010
I don't want to. Let's go together.

706
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:13,600
I'm going to definitely catch him.

707
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,940
With my own hands, that punk who made Elder like that.

708
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:18,400
I'm going to definitely catch him.

709
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,610
But, still.

710
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:23,070
Hurry up and report this. Hurry!

711
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:24,930
Hurry and go!

712
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,800
Stop! Stop! Stop!

713
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:58,290
- Ahjussi! Ahjussi! 
 - Bong Yi.

714
01:15:58,290 --> 01:15:59,560
Ahjussi, hurry.

715
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,730
Ba Reum Oppa. Ba Reum Oppa is...

716
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,920
Ahjussi.

717
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:41,880
   

718
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:46,980
   

719
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:38,000
It's quiet now.

720
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:23,920


721
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:33,080
   

722
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:37,320
 Hey, Kwon Deok Soo. If you do that one more time, I'll kill you. 

723
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,720
 Evidence Storage Team. They might even acquire guns.  

724
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:44,210
 Haven't you found Han Kook yet?  

725
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:47,090
 I'm sure that they switched cars here. 

726
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:49,980
 You will not be saved even after you die. 

727
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:51,890
 Then give me more team members. 

728
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:54,070
 How will I do this myself? 

729
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:56,020
 You scout them by yourself. 

730
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:59,230
 Don't ever lose hope.
