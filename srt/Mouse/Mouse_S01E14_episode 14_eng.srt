1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:10,450


2
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,230
   

3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,650
   

4
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,720
   

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,570
   

6
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,830
   

7
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,040
   

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,070
     

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,610
   

10
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,490
    
    

11
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,790
   

12
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,140
   

13
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,680
   

14
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,730
It's over there. I think he went over there.

15
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,010
You think you're something, don't you?

16
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,820
Did you grab that concept because you wanted to kill someone?

17
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,110
You're just a psychopathic serial killer, you bastard.

18
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,840
Don't hide and come out!

19
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,240
Come out, you bastard!

20
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,090
 Mr. A, who was sentenced to five years in prison   
    

21
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,140
 for assaulting a rapist while trying to rescue his stepdaughter, 

22
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,790
 was found murdered shortly after he was released. 

23
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,430
 Mr. A was sentenced to 5 years in prison for assault back in 2016. 

24
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,310
 A while ago, an anonymous video arrived at our press office.  
    

25
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,430
 There can be some shocking scenes, 

26
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,430
 but a more shocking truth will be revealed to the world. 

27
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,180
 Please save me. 

28
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,140
 I did it. I killed them all. 

29
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,070
 I was the one who killed all the women from Suseong. 

30
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,130
 The women who disappeared from Suseong Middle School. 

31
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,620
 There is a big rock on the mountain behind the school. 

32
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,300
 I buried them all there. 

33
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,830
 The items from the dead women are all buried there. 

34
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,100
 Since I confessed like this, 

35
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,570
 please save me. 

36
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,620
 Please save me! 

37
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,050
 Please save me! 

38
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,220
Ajussi!

39
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,790
Ah, no. No!

40
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,980
Don't die. Don't die!

41
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,060
Ajussi, your innocence has been proven. Why are you trying to die?

42
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,250
Bong Yi.

43
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,910
Bong Yi, what's the matter? Huh?

44
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,300
 You think you're something, don't you? 

45
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,950
 Did you grab that concept because you wanted to kill someone? 

46
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,080
 You are just a psychopathic serial killer, you bastard. 

47
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,280
 I'm a killer. 

48
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,460
 I killed a person. 

49
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,180
I...

50
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm not what you think I am.

51
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,030
Oppa.

52
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:25,090
The shape is the same one that came out of the victim's body from the Suseong serial killer case.

53
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,720
"Eye for an eye."

54
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,340
"Tooth for a tooth."

55
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,170
What happened?

56
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,560
I had a question that I missed from the last interview,

57
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,850
so I went to see him today after I heard he was getting released.

58
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,970
   

59
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,030
 Oh? PD, what are you doing here? 

60
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,990
 Ah, I coincidentally saw you leaving while I was covering another inmate. 

61
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,560
 - You must've been released? 
 - Yes. 

62
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,530
 Ah, where are you going? 

63
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,670
I was doing an interview nearby...

64
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,900
 Ah, Suseong. I'm going to stop by my mother's grave. 

65
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,790
He suddenly asked me to take him to his mother's grave.

66
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,940
 I have to go there for work anyway. Get in. I can take you there. 

67
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,360
 Ah, yes. Thank you. 

68
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,290
I had to do an interview, so I had no choice but accept his request.

69
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,340
 That's where the 10th victim of the Suseong serial killer was found. 

70
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,810
 -  It's not in this direction.  
   - Ah, is that so? 

71
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,450
 I must've gone the wrong way. Is it okay if we take a little more time? 

72
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,200
 Sure, why not. All I have is time. 

73
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,090
 Ah, you must be hungry? There's a plastic bag down there. You can take it out and eat it. 

74
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,330
 Ah, yes. Thank you. 

75
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:10,620
 Why? Are you reminded of that time? 

76
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,770
 What are you... 

77
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,870
 It was you, you bastard. 

78
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,140
How can you go by yourself?

79
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,640
 How did you know? 

80
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,220
 I wanted to live nice. 

81
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,010
 Why do you keep messing with me? 

82
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,220
 Live nicely? 

83
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,770
 You can't kick that habit. 

84
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,120
 What? 

85
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,560
 This bitch. 

86
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,470
Did you see him?

87
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,270
I couldn't see anything.

88
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,830
At that time, I was unconscious with a gag in my mouth.

89
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,710
Oh, Officer Jung. Lee Jae Sik is going to be released today.

90
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,900
They say the release time is delayed due to internal circumstances.

91
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,230
I have to get an interview. Can you tell me Dong Gu's number?

92
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,490
Ah, yes, I will send it to you right now.

93
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,790
If PD Choi is in danger,

94
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,870
 I need to speed things up. 

95
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,790
 In the video, Mr. A's confession turned out to be true. 

96
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,000
 At the mountain behind Suseong Girls' Middle School, the police found the victims' belongings. 

97
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,400
 The video from the killer who murdered Mr. A cleared 
 Kim Bong Cheol's name, who was unfairly accused this whole time. 

98
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,630
 The murder of the true suspect of the Suseong serial killer case, 

99
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:59,070
 referred as Judgement Man or Dark Hero, has gained an enthusiastic response from the people. So the Blue House... 

100
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,900
 The President said that personal revenge is an unforgivable serious crime 

101
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,650
 that has been disrupting our Constitutional state lately. 

102
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:11,000
 During the investigation, the President has ordered that all efforts should be devoted to arresting the criminal. 

103
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,480
I don't feel good.

104
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,460
Why am I so depressed?

105
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,960
Last time, it felt refreshing.

106
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,980
 You're just a psychopathic serial killer, you bastard. 

107
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,310
 I... I'm not what you think I am. 

108
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,900
He's like that because of me.

109
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,960
He's doing this because of me.

110
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,560
 Did you like Mu Chi Ajusshi? 

111
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,590
 I confessed to him, saying we should date. 

112
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,090
 But, I was rejected within a second. 

113
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,130
 It wasn't good timing. 

114
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,710
 It was right after Detective Go decided to kill Han Seo Joon. 

115
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:18,000
 He didn't want to make me unhappy, so he pushed me away. 

116
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,340
Oppa feels the same way. Just like Ajusshi.

117
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,020
Get out.

118
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,700
This is the neighborhood I lived in when I was young.

119
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,320
Come over here.

120
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,720
What is all of this?

121
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,320
As a Christmas present,

122
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,920
you said you wanted to have a hideout?

123
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,140
Huh?

124
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,060
Your father had prepared this as a surprise Christmas gift.

125
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,210
The day you woke up at dawn. That day was Christmas, right?

126
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,630
You said your fatherâ€™s whole body was soaked with rain and sweat.

127
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,840
And there was mud and grass on his pants.

128
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,840
The reason was because of this. Your father.

129
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,550
This... He was making this?

130
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,460
I didn't even realize.

131
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,640
What am I going to do?

132
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,710
I feel so bad.

133
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,690
What do I do about my dad?

134
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,580
- It's okay. 
 - What do I do? My poor dad.

135
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,310
Next is the Groom's entrance.

136
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,330
Please give a warm round of applause.

137
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,880
The Groom is now entering!

138
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,580
Wow!

139
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,550
Are you feeling good?

140
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,950
Next, the star of today, the Bride will enter.

141
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,240
Detective Shin Sang pursued her for five years!

142
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,610
Today, he's finally marrying her! Bride, now enter!

143
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,420
I'm sorry, Dad.

144
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,490
Oh... Why?

145
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,980
How did he get out? Didn't he need a formal trial?

146
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,880
He received a special leave.

147
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,230
If it wasn't for that person, he wouldn't be standing there right now.

148
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,620
 Ajusshi, your innocence has been proven! Why are you trying to die? 

149
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,480
 Damn it! 

150
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,800
 Wait! Wait! 

151
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,440
 Look! Look at this, Ahjussi! 

152
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,410
   

153
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,510
 Over here! 

154
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,460
He saved him. He saved them both.

155
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,160
That man.

156
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,740
Auntie!

157
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,620
Just because I haven't come by for a couple of days, how could you make such a mess of the place?

158
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,570
What would you do without me?

159
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,770
You're not angry at me anymore?

160
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,500
You didn't tell Hoon Seok off too much, did you?

161
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,210
Your uncle got transferred to the US branch. We've decided to go together.

162
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,720
Really? That's great. When?

163
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,720
He needs to go right away for the handover process.

164
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,850
There are so many things to get done, but my heart is the one feeling anxious.

165
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,890
We have to put the house on the market and pack, too.

166
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,250
Anyway, I feel bad for you, Ba Reum.

167
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,260
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

168
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,960
Oh, it's this late already?

169
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,820
I need to get going.

170
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,060
I left Hoon Seok with the neighbor.

171
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,550
Auntie.

172
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,330
By chance...

173
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,590
that kitten, couldn't Hoon Seok take it and raise it?

174
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,130
He really liked it last time.

175
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,310
Let's do that then. He'll be lonely in a foreign country, too.

176
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,910
It'll be nice for him to have a friend.

177
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,460
Yes.

178
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,710
   

179
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,850
 The call cannot be completed, and you will be forwarded to voicemail. 

180
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,900
 He didn't want to make me unhappy, so he pushed me away. 

181
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,460
If he pushes me away, I'll just pull him back to me.

182
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,420
   

183
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,710
   

184
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,680
Oh, hello?

185
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,260
Oppa, I'm in Unnam-dong to gather material for a report, but the best burrito place is here.

186
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,430
 Should I bring you some? 

187
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,180
 Do you want to have lunch together? 

188
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,090
I'm busy. I'm working out of town on assignment.

189
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,430
I see. When are you coming back?

190
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,320
It's okay. I have time to wait.

191
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,170
Don't wait for me. I'll be late.

192
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:18,500
I'm really okay. I can wait.

193
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,390
What do you mean you're okay?

194
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,370
Okay then, Oppa.

195
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,370
I'll go home then.

196
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,740
But Oppa...

197
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,590
Whether you're the Oppa I know

198
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,230
or you're not the one I know, it doesn't matter to me.

199
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,260
Whoever you are or what kind of person you are,

200
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,860
I just like you.

201
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,250
I only wanted to tell you that.

202
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
I wanted to tell you in person.

203
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,490
I ended up saying it over the phone.

204
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,070
I'll hang up.

205
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,590
Did you two fight?

206
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,670
What's the matter? You liked her so much that it was annoying.

207
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,940
She'll be unhappy if she's with me.

208
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,350
She can't afford to be unhappy anymore.

209
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,380
Why are you thinking that way?

210
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,920
Why would Bong Yi become unhappy with you?

211
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,350
She's waiting to see you right now.

212
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:29,540
Hey, I don't know why you're having those types of thoughts,

213
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,750
but there was a time I thought that way.

214
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,450
Had I accepted that confession, what would have happened to me?

215
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,590
Would my life have turned out differently?

216
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,580
Have a family, kids, and planning out my retirement...

217
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,210
Dreaming about a job...

218
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,570
Would I be living that way?

219
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,390
Do you regret it?

220
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,950
Regret?

221
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,520
Regret...

222
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,540
I can't stop now. I have to just keep going.

223
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,960
There's nowhere for me to return to either.

224
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,700
Don't do something you'll regret, punk.

225
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,810
 That's right. My life might change. 

226
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,390
 If I'm with Bong Yi, 

227
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,590
 I might be able to return to the Jung Ba Reum I used to be. 

228
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,240
Oppa?

229
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,280
Tomorrow,

230
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,370
do you want to have dinner together?

231
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,450
You're not busy?

232
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,370
I'm not busy from now on.

233
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,860
 The burrito place you wanted to go to, let's go together. 

234
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,030
Hurry home so you don't catch a cold.

235
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,660
 I'll overcome it for certain. 

236
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,220
 Bong Yi, give me the strength. 

237
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,850
 Please protect me. 

238
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,480
 Bong Yi, marry me when you're of age. 

239
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,200
   

240
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,520
Thank you! I'll work hard!

241
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,370
Best of luck.

242
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,670
Oh, Oppa, you're here?

243
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,400
 There's traffic, so I think it'll take another 10 minutes. 

244
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,140
Okay, call me when you get here.

245
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,240
I knew it when you came to work all dressed up.

246
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,200
Oh, it must be a nice time for you.

247
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,900
Yes?

248
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,730
Oh, a report?

249
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,130
It's that little kid. That annoying kid.

250
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,670
Annoying?

251
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,570
That detective kid?

252
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,960
Make it quick and hang up.

253
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,090
Well, the thing is, that doesn't really suit our program.

254
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,100
Try contacting Animal Farm instead.

255
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,410
What? Do you know what time it is right now?

256
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,660
Go home quickly! Your mom will be worried!

257
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,370
Seriously...

258
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,540
He's in the lobby.

259
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,820
He must've come to complain after blocking the bulletin board.

260
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,390
He's a nourished kid.

261
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,280
Detective Go Nam?

262
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,110
   

263
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,770
My wrong choice...

264
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,870
 Am I doing the right thing by using him this way? 

265
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,300
 Yeah, it's right to end it this way. 

266
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:05,850
So, you want to relieve the grandmother's resentment because of your classmate, right?

267
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,250
You're so cool?

268
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,570
Like a detective.

269
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,410
On that note,

270
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,030
I will tell you the reason why I came.

271
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,090
What is it?

272
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,320
I figured it out. The cat murder.

273
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,570
Oh, really?

274
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:22,220
Wow, you're like a detective. Who is it?

275
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,200
Hey, it's important how I knew rather than who it is.

276
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,910
It's the mentality of Go Nam.

277
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,320
That's right. How did youâ€“

278
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,090
How did you know?

279
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,440
I found the evidence.

280
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,830
Clear evidence! I have it.

281
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,770
Evidence?

282
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,430
But, from now it's serious.

283
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,890
The truth is more shocking than the cat murder.

284
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,450
There is only one truth.

285
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,980
Bong Yi!

286
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,420
Oppa!

287
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,070
Say hello. This person is Detective Go Nam.

288
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,820
Nice to meet you.

289
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,620
Date?

290
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,460
Then I can't get in the way, Writer Noona.

291
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,450
Later...

292
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,220
Kid.

293
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,840
   

294
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,940
You have to take your bag.

295
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,140
Go Nam, get back safely!

296
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,370
Who is that?

297
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,010
He came to give a tip.

298
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,280
Ah, there must be a rumor that his classmate's grandma is killing cats.

299
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,100
So that classmate became an outcast.

300
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,420
But he said that he found the suspect.

301
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,930
He found evidence, too.

302
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,810
Wait a moment.

303
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,310
Yes?

304
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,710
Ah, I have a dinner appointment right now.

305
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,720
 It's important. Come right now. 

306
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,630
What... Hello?

307
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,190
Why? Is it the office? Is it important?

308
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,470
Yeah.

309
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,470
Ah, then let's eat dinner next time.

310
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,730
I ate cake a while ago, so I'm not that hungry.

311
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,780
I think I'm a little indigested too.

312
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,170
I starved myself all day to eat dinner with Oppa, so I almost died from hunger.

313
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,260
It's time for 'Amazing Saturday' rebroadcast.

314
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:37,810
Why does Ahjusshi Shin Dong Yeop always hear wrong? His ears shouldn't be useless.

315
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,750
 Writer Noona, I have something to say.  Is it possible to meet up tomorrow? 

316
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,080
So cute.

317
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,060
   

318
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,300
 I hope you come alone. 

319
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,030
Alone?

320
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,600
- Oppa.
 - Is your indigestion better?

321
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,170
Yes.

322
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,740
I'm fine.  The indigestion is all better.

323
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,630
That's a relief.

324
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,190
I'm sorry about today.  Let's eat something delicious tomorrow instead.

325
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:37,230
Even if your digestion is bad, eat something before you go to sleep.  Okay.

326
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,670
 A date?  Then I shouldn't interfere, Writer Noona. 

327
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,270
What are you thinking so hard about?

328
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,790
What did you call me about?

329
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:01,310
The next prey.  You can think of him as the biggest predator.

330
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:08,990
I've been thinking... There's a supporter, isn't there?

331
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:14,500
Did that supporter give you this person's DNA and ask to have them killed?

332
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,340
I heard that you were adopted in England when you were young, and you grew up there.

333
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,190
And now, you're officially dead.

334
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:28,640
There's no way you could have acquired the equipment and materials required for all this on your own.

335
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,290
Who is the person helping you?

336
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,360
You don't need to know.

337
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,940
You're a very mysterious person.

338
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,660
Why is a world class genetics professor

339
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,640
hiding in a place like this?

340
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,860
Why are you living in hiding, pretending to be dead?

341
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,770
You're being chased by someone... aren't you?

342
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:00,420
When it's the right time,  you'll get to know everything.  Just wait.

343
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,040
The right time...

344
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:10,410
I don't know when that time will be, but I'll wait.

345
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,970
Don't give these things to me anymore.

346
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,870
I'll decide... who I'll dispose of.

347
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,160
Of course I know him.  Go Nam is the problem solver at this school.

348
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,130
He even caught the guy who was stealing my shoes.

349
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,260
But class isn't over yet.

350
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,960
It's over.

351
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,460
Hello, Hyung!

352
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,630
Oh, you're here?  Just a moment.

353
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:52,540
Why are you working here every day?  You should take it easy.

354
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,040
Work hard!

355
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,730
Aigoo, Grandma!  Hey, get out!

356
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,610
Grandma!

357
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,000
Gosh, what's with that granny?

358
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Aigoo, Grandma!

359
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,410
Oh! Sheesh, Writer Noona.

360
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,850
I told her to come alone.

361
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,020
Is he already done with class?

362
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,180
Why isn't he answering his phone?

363
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,700
By chance, do you know Myung Go Nam?

364
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,990
I saw him in the hallway on my way out.

365
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,940
Ah, you did?  Thank you.

366
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,800
Oh, Go Nam.  Where are you?

367
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:04,230
 Noona, sorry... Sorry... 

368
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,120
Did our paths get crossed?

369
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,920
Get out of the way!

370
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:26,930
Four cats.  Four cats.

371
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,600
My Go Nam!

372
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,170
I can't live if something happens to my Go Nam.

373
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,680
I'm going to die if anything happens to him!

374
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,120
 Today we will be talking about the unfortunate accident regarding a kid detective, 

375
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,460
 who was on an investigation in order to clear a classmate's Grandma of false charges. 

376
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,260
The kid detective, as the cabinet in the cafeteria shook,

377
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,260
the undiluted cleaning solution that was on top fell down.

378
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,120
And he sustained burns on his entire body.

379
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,350
 The school did not lock the doors to the cafeteria. 

380
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:12,070
 If they wanted to, anyone could have gone in. 

381
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:15,510
 However, the school is still avoiding responsibility. 

382
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,380
That's strange.

383
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,060
- Excuse me? 
 - That doesn't seem like a simple accident.

384
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,970
   

385
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,480
- They said the container that was on top spilled when this cabinet fell over, right? 
 - Yes.

386
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,620
If that was really the case, due to the momentum of the cabinet the cleaning solution would have spread a lot further.

387
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,380
- But take a look at this. 
 - The bleached area is quite small.

388
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,870
Then it was directly over his head.

389
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,930
They poured it on the child in order to kill him.

390
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:46,860
What kind of jerk would do that kind of horrible thing to a child?

391
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,260
We should catch him. To see what kind of psycho bastard he is.

392
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,280
 Grandma! 

393
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,850
Hey, Grandma!  Hey!

394
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,480
 Grandma! 

395
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,170
   

396
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Oh, Bong Yi. About that footage of the cafeteria that was broadcast, when was it shot?

397
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,500
Okay, the morning after Go Nam's accident?

398
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,290
Okay, I got it.

399
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,520
- I'm going to check the CCTV. 
 - Okay.

400
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,500
By chance, did someone straighten up or clean up after the accident?

401
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,500
No. The cafeteria was shut down right away and the cops told us not to touch anything.

402
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,790
- Nobody touched anything. 
 - Oh, is that right?

403
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,430
Just a moment please.

404
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,480
They came after PD Choi filmed.

405
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,780
Why did they come back and touch the items on the shelf?

406
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,700
It's mine.

407
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,180
- That's evidence.  Give it to me.  Elder. 
 - It's mine.

408
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:36,090
Elder, which way is home?

409
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,570
Oh, Officer Jung!

410
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,130
Hey, it's been a long time.

411
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,840
Don't you remember me?  We worked together at the Gudong Station.

412
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,720
Officer Kim?

413
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,440
You remember me!

414
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,410
I heard that you couldn't remember since you had surgery.

415
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,220
No, almost all my memories have returned except for my childhood.

416
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,140
That's a relief.

417
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,050
Grandma, did you go to school with a packed lunch again?

418
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:03,680
Ah, she says that her granddaughter didn't take her lunch,

419
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,270
so she takes an empty container to her every day.

420
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,230
The kids all eat the cafeteria food at school.

421
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,640
Well, I don't know where she lives.

422
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,950
Let's go, Grandma.  I'll take you home.

423
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,250
Let's go.  This way.

424
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,970
Let's go.

425
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,560
Sheesh, what is this?  It's a fake camera.

426
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,530
Why was this put up when it doesn't even work?

427
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,250
The Grandma's condition looks very bad.

428
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,470
A while ago, she was carrying a dead stray cat

429
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,700
and went all around the neighborhood.

430
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,740
So everyone whispered behind her back that the senile Grandma fed cats pesticides and killed them.

431
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,680
Ah, it's that Grandma.  The one Go Nam was talking about.

432
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,190
You heard about it?  But, like Go Nam said, I don't think that the Grandma would do that.

433
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,370
Do you remember?  In Gudong, for a time, there was that bastard who went around killing cats.

434
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,830
He would kill them and pull out their teeth.

435
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,160
Ah!

436
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,650
I think he came to this neighborhood.

437
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:20,810
The cat that the Grandma was carrying around, it didn't have any teeth because they were all pulled out.

438
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,420
The teeth were gone?

439
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,270
Attempted murder?

440
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,250
Here, look at this.

441
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:32,250
How is this a stain from something that fell and spilled? It was poured from above on purpose. Wasn't it?

442
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,090
- You investigated this half-heartedly, didn't you? 
 - Half-heartedly?

443
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:39,740
Ah, seriously! Who are you to tell us what to do when it's not your case?

444
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,260
You're the one who didn't look at the traces on the floor properly! How dare you give me that attitude?

445
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,750
I understand, so we'll go check.

446
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:51,240
This is an attempted murder case, so turn in the evidence immediately.  Understand?

447
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,980
Ah, seriously!

448
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,770
But back then, that Grandma said they saw them in the cafeteria.  The person running away.

449
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:08,560
How can you believe the words of an old person with dementia?  Even if we investigate, it can't be used as evidence.

450
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,850
But still, when she was talking to us, she was clear headed.  And her statement was very detailed.

451
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,490
Don't do a thing. Why are you making a big deal out of this?

452
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,910
How could someone do that to the child?

453
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,070
He's a wonderful young man.

454
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,220
   

455
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,490
 Four cats. 

456
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,660
 The items were all skewed to the right side. 

457
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,560
Officer Kim.  Who put up these flyers?

458
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,100
Oh, those? A street-kitten dad from our neighborhood.

459
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,940
A street-kitten dad?

460
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,860
- Welcome. 
 - Excuse me.

461
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,460
I'm a police officer.

462
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,470
I wanted to ask you about the terrorist attacks at Nari Elementary School.

463
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,270
Well, I already made a statement to the police.

464
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:56,590
I wanted to hear some more about it.  Please tell me about the situation at the time.

465
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:02,780
My store supplies the school with meat for meals.

466
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:08,280
On that day, as usual, I was unloading the meat from the truck.

467
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,270
I was so surprised that I went running right away.

468
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,480
 - Go Nam. 
 - Don't! You'll get hurt! 

469
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,830
In case that woman might get injured,

470
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:19,060
I pushed her aside, covered him with my clothes then lifted him and ran right out.

471
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,950
The owner of the butcher shop at the three-way intersection.  The one who ran with Go Nam on his back...

472
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,470
 Move aside! 

473
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,900
Welcome! What can I get you?

474
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,010
I want to have a meat party with my friends.  What would be good?

475
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:45,670
A meat party is nice.  Take your time choosing from here.

476
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,020
What is this meat over here?

477
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,910
Ah, the chuck meat?  When you put chuck meat in your mouth, it melts.

478
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,980
But since the part it comes from is small, it's a bit expensive.

479
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,290
If the number of friend is large, you should go with pork.

480
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,570
To me, pork is more delicious.

481
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,010
 Hemispatial neglect? 

482
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,490
 What is that? 

483
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,730
 If you sustain an abnormality in your right parietal lobe, 

484
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:33,520
 then you may not be able to respond to visual, tactile, or auditory stimuli on the other side of your brain. 

485
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,160
In serious cases, among the food in a dish,

486
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,400
they would only eat the food on the right side.

487
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,220
They would only put makeup on the right side and shave only the right side.

488
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,240
Ma'am!

489
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,790
- Oh my. 
 - Hello.

490
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,690
What brings you here? Aren't you on duty?

491
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:01,340
I was in the area for an investigation, so I stopped by to see how Chi Kook is doing.

492
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,430
Sorry. I haven't been able to come lately, right?

493
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,880
It's okay. You're busy anyway.

494
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,550
Chi Kook, Ba Reum is here.

495
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,000
I got this CD back from the detention center, along with Dong Koo.

496
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,300
Chi Kook's father used to like this music.

497
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,610
Oh, that's right.

498
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,060
I guess you remember those things.

499
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,130
It seems like you're healthy.

500
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:42,220
Chi Kook will wake up soon too.

501
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,500
Wait a minute.

502
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:56,380
Oh my, my little puppy,

503
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,630
I need to pack his lunch.

504
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:15,750
I heard you saw me running away.

505
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,420
Why did you do that?

506
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:25,050
I always pack the leftover fat for you.

507
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,340
How ungrateful of you to snitch on me.

508
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:33,810
Meat... She likes meat.

509
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:41,030
It doesn't matter. Who would listen to a grandma that has dementia?

510
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,390
I'll pack you some.

511
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,100
Huh?

512
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,560
This was here all along.

513
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:01,080
Do you know how much I looked for this?

514
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,030
   

515
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,970
The nurse let me borrow this.

516
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:19,230
Chi Kook, do you remember this song?

517
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,260
My memories from high school are coming back.

518
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,950
We listened to this song so many times when we went camping.

519
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:36,380
Yesterday, Dong Koo came and said that Chi Kook came in his dream.

520
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,500
Dong Koo? For what?

521
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,470
One day, Chi Kook brought his girlfriend over.

522
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,120
Yes.

523
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,420
 Pesticide? 

524
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,730
 Everyone said that the old Grandma killed the cats with pesticides. 

525
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,870
 It's the cleaning solution from the cafeteria. 

526
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:40,210
These keys. Did he steal them from the granny?

527
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,700
 He rummaged through the shelves. That means he was looking for something. 

528
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:56,520
Could it be these keys? What are they?

529
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,430
 The cat that the Grandma was carrying around didn't have any teeth because they were all pulled out. 

530
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:04,350
 He said that he found the suspect. He found evidence, too. 

531
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:09,220
 The cat's teeth. Go Nam knew that these were cat's teeth. 

532
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,250
 That's how he knew the cat killer was Kim Byeong Tae. 

533
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,650
 Knowing that Kim Byeong Tae tried to kill the child? 

534
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:19,560
Just because of the cat, he went as far as to kill a child?

535
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:24,350
Ah, what is this key for?

536
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,120
It was the key to the music box.

537
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,580
What's this?

538
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,310
 What were they burning? 

539
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,310
   

540
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,390
   

541
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,500
   

542
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,720
 Hwang Min Ji, 6 year old child, dead from burns all over her body. 

543
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,100
 The victim's friend, a mentally disabled child, 

544
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,900
 pointed towards part-timers who worked at the gas station. 

545
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:45,420
 However, the mentally disabled child's statement was deemed unreliable. He was eliminated from the list of suspects. 

546
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:50,340
 Min Ji testified that the criminal was wearing red-colored clothes before dying. 

547
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:56,040
 Due to inconclusive evidence or motive to find Han Soo Cheol guilty,  
    

548
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,550
 he was excluded from the suspect list. The case ended up as an unresolved case. 

549
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:04,150
She was being adopted but after that case,

550
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:08,550
she kept being called to the station for testifying due to which her adoption got canceled.

551
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:13,100
The reason for the dismissal was that she kept saying unnecessary things which annoyed people around her.

552
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:17,150
She has been living here since then.

553
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:20,700
As I was investigating, I read that she has a mental disability.

554
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,360
Oh no, Angela has a hearing disability.

555
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:28,920
That's why her pronunciation isn't great but intelligence wise she has no problems at all.

556
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:35,680
However, seeing that communication is impossible for her, the police seem to have decided it's an intellectual disability.

557
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,050
Angela!

558
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:54,650
No. Oppa isn't coming. He won't keep his promise.

559
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,150
He will come.

560
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,780
- Oppa isn't coming. 
 - Don't worry. Okay?

561
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,100
It's just that he's taking some time.

562
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,100
What's the matter?

563
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:08,330
- I think Michaela has been hurt. 
 - No.

564
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:12,670
- Oppa isn't coming. 
 - Last year, her Oppa visited her twice.

565
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:17,430
On his second visit, he must've promised that he'd take her from here the next time he came.

566
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,770
But that guy... Gosh, that guy...

567
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:24,150
"That guy?"

568
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:26,060
Never mind that.

569
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:33,640
 Do you remember what you told the policemen a long time ago? 

570
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,310
 Can you tell him that? 

571
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:47,620
 The police? No matter how much I tell them, they never trust what I have to say. 

572
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:51,930
You can trust me.

573
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:56,300
Can you put your trust in me and tell me?

574
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,550
When I was young...

575
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:06,640
- I'm sorry. 
 - You are doing this on purpose, aren't you?

576
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,820
- No. 
 - Don't you know numbers? 
 - I know numbers.

577
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:15,620
Hey, just go and do your job.

578
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,930
Oh.

579
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,960
Customer! I'm sorry.

580
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,020
My employee keeps making mistakes in calculations. Now that I've seen your face well,

581
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:29,340
when you come here next time, I'll give you an automatic car wash for free. Sorry. Here.

582
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,710
- Two people? 
 - What kind of bastard messes with young children?

583
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:41,140
Crimes against children are all done by psychopaths. Child murder, child sexual assault, child abuse. All of these.

584
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,440
Bastards who have given up on being human.

585
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,140
 Two days ago, in an elementary school cafeteria in Mujin, 

586
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,650
 "A" suffered severe burns from a cleaning solution spill. 

587
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:54,960
 Go Nam! 

588
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,880
If only that wench hadn't shown up, that little kid would have been dead now.

589
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:14,660
He will wake up. Don't you worry about it.

590
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,140
Will our boy be fine?

591
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,580
Both of them are predators.

592
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,290
Son of a bitch.

593
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,630
- Thisâ€“ 
 - He suffered serious burns.

594
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,860
He couldn't have screamed if it's this serious, right?

595
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,060
Of course, he couldn't have. With his respiratory tract in that state.

596
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:38,430
 I heard a kid screaming his lungs out in the cafeteria. 

597
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:41,710
This freaking scumbag.

598
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,190
Who the hell are you?

599
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,900
Untie me right now. What are you doing?

600
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,890
You want to have all the fun to yourself?

601
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:04,630
- I want to have some fun too. 
 - Damn it.

602
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:07,660
Save me! Save me!

603
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:12,680
As Go Nam went around trying to clear his classmate's grandmother from her unfair false accusation,

604
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,070
he saw this.

605
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:20,140
And he realized it was cat teeth at once.

606
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:25,930
He went to the police station and told them, but no one would listen to a child.

607
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,890
So he went to the broadcasting station.

608
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,260
 Oh! Sheesh, I told her to come alone. 

609
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:07,100
 The granny was quite clear-minded when she saw you. Even when she gave her testimony to the police. 

610
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:11,510
If only the police would have listened to her and checked at least once.

611
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:15,950
- You would have been arrested right away. 
 - Spare me! Please spare me! Please!

612
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:18,760
But there is one thing I don't understand.

613
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:25,740
Why would you try to kill that child just because he found out that you kill cats?

614
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:30,810
 Where did that little kid hide it? 

615
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,250
The secret behind this key.

616
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:41,090
That music box. The Pandora's box.

617
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:47,670
In 1999, near the school where you and Han Soo Cheol used to go,

618
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:50,900
there was a case of animal abuse where a dog was burned to death.

619
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,250
In the end, the culprit wasn't caught.

620
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:58,880
The police didn't investigate it seriously either because it was just an animal, not a human.

621
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,680
After that, you started becoming bolder.

622
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,770
Killing animals wasn't as fun for you anymore, so this time it would be a person.

623
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,840
 Min Ji is my friend. 

624
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,770
 A young child at that. 

625
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:09,870
 Min Ji. 

626
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,980
And you took this photo.

627
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,730
To reminisce about your murders.

628
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:21,920
But Go Nam took the keyring and saw this picture.

629
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,270
So you had to kill Go Nam.

630
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:29,770
Before he could tell the broadcasting station and the police.

631
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:38,990
That was only a drop. But the pain was unbearable, wasn't it?

632
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:41,170
Then what do you think those kids went through?

633
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:46,420
You can't even imagine the pain their parents must have felt losing their young kids, can you?

634
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,020
Because psychopaths like you can't feel emotions.

635
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:52,160
You can't even imagine the pain others feel.

636
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,790
That's why you need to go through the same thing.

637
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:59,560
Because it's an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

638
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:05,000
   

639
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:31,400
Kim Byeong Tae.

640
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:53,920
Huh?

641
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,680
Kim Byeong Tae was murdered.

642
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,120
It's that bastard's doing.

643
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,080
He couldn't have gotten that far. Search through all of the nearby alleyways. Hurry up!

644
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,720
Detective Kim go that way. Detective Park, you go that way.

645
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,650
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

646
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,030
You were the detective in charge of the May 1999 gasoline terror case, right?

647
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,780
I've just sent you a photo.

648
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,150
Could you check it for me? Quick.

649
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,970
- It's the suspect, right? 
  - Yes, that's right. 

650
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:56,200
What about the guy next to him?

651
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,940
 A friend that used to work with him at the gas station. 

652
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,380
Han Soo Cheol is also in danger.

653
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,100
Check if Han Soo Cheol is alive right now.

654
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,960
Right away! Hurry up!

655
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,100
Wait a minute.

656
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:08,280
Just listen to what I have to say! Wait.

657
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,370
I don't know anything about it. I really don't!

658
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,690
Why would I kill somebody?

659
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:17,220
Hey! It wasn't me!

660
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:22,220
   

661
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,840
   

662
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:06,700
Hello?

663
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,650
Yes, who is this?

664
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:12,770
What? Who are you?

665
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:15,000
Soo Cheol, is that you?

666
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,340
Kim Byeong Tae?

667
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:27,530
How come you called me? You know my new number?

668
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:29,340
I did?

669
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,860
I didn't call you.

670
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,250
It's the truth!

671
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:36,540
That's just how we ended up talking to each other over the phone. We decided on meeting sometime later.

672
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,040
And that was the end of the call.

673
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,430
So were you on a phone call with a ghost or something?

674
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,120
Ah, this is driving me nuts!

675
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,410
Oh, right. I have an alibi for last night.

676
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,140
- Who is it? 
 - The employee at my gas station.

677
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,440
You can go and check.

678
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,230
Excuse me.

679
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,910
Yes?

680
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:02,840
He's right.

681
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,950
That employee told me he was with you.

682
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:10,140
That means I'm completely cleared of these false charges, right?

683
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,350
Take these off then. Hurry up.

684
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,040
Too bad for you, though.

685
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,040
That employee has a mental disability.

686
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,730
You know, right? That his testimony wouldn't work.

687
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:23,010
A long time ago, you were set free because of the same loophole. It's quite ironic.

688
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:25,490
You can't escape this time.

689
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:27,510
I didn't do it.

690
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:29,960
It's not me!

691
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:37,230
It's his doing. Lee Jae Sik, the guy who killed Kang Duk Su.

692
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,890
No way. But all of the evidence is pointing to that guy.

693
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:45,130
What kind of a fool would kill a person and leave all of the evidence in their office?

694
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:48,470
The real killer planned all of this.

695
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,530
Is that so?

696
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:53,660
But there's one thing I don't understand.

697
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,490
Why didn't he kill him too?

698
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,030
That's right.

699
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:11,280
Kill him. Kill him.

700
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,720
He burned someone's precious daughter to death and feels no remorse. Are you just going to let him be?

701
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,640
There must be a way to make him pay for his crimes without having to kill him.

702
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,770
 Seong Yo Han is disappearing from my head. 

703
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:26,580
 I'm going back to myself, 

704
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,670
 back to being Jung Ba Reum. 

705
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:33,680
 If someone had killed Han Seo Joon the same way  
    

706
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,630
 he had killed his victims, what would I have felt? 

707
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:39,080
   

708
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,900
 Would I have been happier than I am now? 

709
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:54,750
It's Hyung's birthday today.

710
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,430
Oppa!

711
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:01,300
There you are.

712
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,970
What was it you wanted to say?

713
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,500
Bong Yi.

714
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,440
Yeah?

715
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,560
I'm...

716
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,170
a little sick.

717
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,810
Where? Does it hurt a lot?

718
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:32,260
But you know what, somehow I feel like I might get better.

719
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:36,060
Today, I saw such hope.

720
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:43,670
So will you wait for me until I fully recover?

721
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,250
I'll wait.

722
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:52,130
I can wait.

723
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:56,700
It might take a very long time.

724
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,100
I don't care about that.

725
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:03,250
I'm going to wait for you until I'm a gray-haired grandmother.

726
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:08,140
So you can't dump me later on just because I'm old.

727
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:15,110
â™«  Tonight I regret letting you go  â™«

728
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:19,850
Should we go down to the countryside to live together when I get better?

729
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:22,400
I'll be an officer in the countryside.

730
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,660
Sounds nice.

731
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:35,230
â™«  What I want most now is you in my heart  â™«

732
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:38,710
â™«  Heart  â™«

733
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:53,310
You didn't have to come up here. You're a busy man after all.

734
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:57,610
I'll be seeing you only two years from now. Of course, I had to see you off.

735
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:02,240
Hoon Seok, did you name the cat?

736
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,080
Yeah, Toto!

737
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,000
It's the name of the puppy

738
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,460
in the Wizard of Oz. Toto.

739
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,970
Toto?

740
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:13,140
Wow! You've chosen such a cool name!

741
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:18,040
Hoon Seok, if there's something you're unsure of as you raise Toto, you can go to Kitty Cafe.

742
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:18,840
You say it too.

743
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,210
- "Kitty Cafe?" 
 - Yeah.

744
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:24,640
You can ask at the Kitty Cafe. You'll find a lot of information there.

745
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,370
But wouldn't Toto's mommy be sad? She won't be with Toto anymore.

746
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:37,880
She'll be fine because she trusts that you will raise Toto well.

747
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,730
We have to get on the bus. Let's go Hoon Seok.

748
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:42,730
- Take care. 
 - Yes.

749
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:56,380
Mom, who's that man?

750
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,920
Nobody. Let's go.

751
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,160
Say bye to Hyung.

752
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:10,480
 Breaking news. 

753
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,540
 Child A, who was recently 

754
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,620
 found with cleaning solution spilled all over him, 

755
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:20,330
 suffered severe burns all over his body. Battling  death, 

756
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:24,380
 he miraculously overcame the crisis and is in recovery. 

757
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,840
 Meanwhile A... 

758
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:02,240
Ta-da!

759
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,570
Are you having a birthday party?

760
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,740
With mom and dad?

761
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:35,680
Leaving me out?

762
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,740
 Let's not see each other again. 

763
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:39,750
 Let's not see each other for the rest of our lives. 

764
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:44,680
 To be honest, I hate you more than that bastard Han Seo Joon. 

765
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:49,380
I'm sorry, Hyung.

766
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,940
I'm really sorry.

767
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:01,500
I miss you, Hyung.

768
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,570
Mom.

769
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,950
Dad.

770
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:10,970
I miss you.

771
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:28,730
Bong Yi. I made a reservation at a great place for tomorrow night.

772
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:33,070
Alright. See you tomorrow.

773
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:34,910
Yeah.

774
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:50,580
What brings you by, Detective?

775
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,770
Let's have a drink.

776
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:59,920
Detective, is something up?

777
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,340
It's my brother's birthday.

778
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:08,010
I was just craving alcohol, and then as I was drinking Soju,

779
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,370
I thought it was really pitiful.

780
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:13,170
And then you came to my mind.

781
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:15,140
That's why I came.

782
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:17,580
I'm glad you did.

783
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:22,770
I've heard you treated my brother really well.

784
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:29,350
What did I do? The Priest took care of me very well.

785
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:35,310
The Priest talked about you so much.

786
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,530
Always worried about you.

787
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:45,140
Do you know why I hated my Hyung and did not see him?

788
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:48,500
Isn't it because he forgave Han Seo Joon?

789
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,850
No.

790
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:52,700
That was just an excuse. Han Seo Joon.

791
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,110
Because I was uncomfortable.

792
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:58,920
He became like that because of me.

793
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,310
He lured Han Seo Joon to save me.

794
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:07,820
When I saw his uncomfortable body, I felt like going crazy.

795
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:10,140
Because of my guilt.

796
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,280
I'd rather not see him at all.

797
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,490
To be comfortable. For my heart to be relaxed.

798
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:22,320
The Priest knew as well.

799
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:27,180
It's not because you hated him, but because you were sorry.

800
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,080
Should I show you a picture of him when he was young?

801
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:39,750
Oh, the Priest's necklace.

802
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:42,290
Ah, that's right. I told you before that my brother had the same thing.

803
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:43,230
Yes.

804
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:46,070
He was always wearing this.

805
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:48,000
My mom must've made two of them.

806
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,650
But he didn't have this.

807
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:52,370
It's small and hard to see but look.

808
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:54,570
- It's my Hyung. 
 - Wow.

809
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:55,980
It's pretty, isn't it?

810
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:57,100
Yes.

811
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,860
He was smart since he was a kid.

812
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,770
He studied well too.

813
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:07,650
The two of you look the same since you guys were young.

814
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:10,090
Oh, is that so?

815
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:12,970
Ah, you must have a lot of memories.

816
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:18,570
I don't have any siblings, so it's a shame.

817
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,380
Hey, Officer Jung.

818
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:26,530
Yes?

819
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:28,830
Do you want to be my younger brother?

820
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:29,910
Younger brother?

821
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:35,400
Yeah. I want to be a Hyung like my Hyung was to you.

822
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,420
You are by yourself.

823
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:39,180
Yes.

824
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:47,400
Please do so, Hyung.

825
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,530
I like it.

826
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:51,700
My dongsaeng, Jung Ba Reum.

827
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:55,620
Hey, let's cheer to becoming brothers.

828
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,350
Today, let's drink. Here, cheers.

829
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:59,020
Cheers!

830
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:02,970
Let's drink and go!

831
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:30,940
Hey, where's the restroom?

832
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,840
Restroom.

833
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,010
That's weird.

834
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:01,250
Hyung's necklace is gone.

835
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:06,840
 Oh, the Priest's necklace. He was always wearing this. 

836
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,620
Did it get mixed up with other evidence?

837
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:25,800
Was this knife always like this?

838
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,360
Isn't this blood?

839
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,700
He left something precious.

840
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:05,370
I compared the blood on the knife with Oh Bong Yi's blood sample and Seong Yo Han's blood sample,

841
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:08,060
but they don't match.

842
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,500
Then who's blood is it?

843
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:14,350
Just in case, please return it to the system and see if there's a match.

844
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:23,230
But when did I get this scar?

845
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,090
Good morning.

846
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:30,910
Ah, I want to confirm the evidence.

847
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:37,560
You gave it to the Evidence Storage Team? Okay.

848
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,430
- Ah, Bong Yi. 
 - Yes?

849
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:44,960
Will you go meet Team Leader Park Doo Suk from the Evidence Storage Team?

850
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,360
I have something to confirm for the evidence from Kim Byeong Tae's case.

851
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,430
Yes. I understand.

852
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:51,560
Did the results come out?

853
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,200
It's weird. That blood is Kang Duk Su.

854
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,310
What? Kang Duk Su's blood?

855
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:01,470
Why did Kang Duk Su's blood show up

856
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,470
on that knife?

857
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,700
Hyung.

858
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,580
Mu Chi Hyung.

859
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,220
Oppa!

860
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:07,120
Bong Yi.

861
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,310
This?

862
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:16,280
Ah, this. Do you remember this? Right before your accident, you gaveâ€“

863
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:23,930
Were you wearing this necklace the day you met Go Nam?

864
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:28,290
 Only one truth. 

865
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,560
 That... 

866
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:34,400
 This? It's pretty, isn't it? 

867
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,640
 The Oppa that I really like made this for me. 

868
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,350
 Oppa? 

869
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:42,410
  - He's coming.   
   - Oh.  

870
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:43,290
 Bong Yi. 

871
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:45,440
 That kid found out 

872
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:49,190
 that these are cat's teeth. 

873
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:54,440
 But this cat looks like it was done by that guy, right? 

874
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,180
 It has no teeth. 

875
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:59,080
 Show your friends and tell them to report it if there are any witnesses. 

876
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,480
Oppa, what's wrong? Are you okay?

877
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:04,300
Oppa. Oppa!

878
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,880
This...

879
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,780
Why is this in my house?

880
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:04,750
 From tomorrow, everything breaks. 

881
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:07,480
 Now, goodbye forever. 

882
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:15,260
No. No, you can't.

883
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:16,550
No.

884
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:17,370
Move.

885
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:18,580
I said move!

886
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:20,510
I said move.

887
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,540
No. Don't open it.

888
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,310
I'm telling you to not open it, please.

889
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:50,260
No. No.

890
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:39,290
It was me.

891
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:42,910
It wasn't Seong Yo Han.

892
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:46,060
But it was me.

893
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:06,100
   

894
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:10,460
 Ba Reum, Chi Kook woke up! 

895
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,890
 He regained consciousness. 

896
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:15,740
What?

897
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:26,900


898
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:38,320
   

899
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,720
 Chi Kook is awake. Let's go in. 

900
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:43,320
 How do I look? 

901
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,870
 I asked to not make me a monster. 

902
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:49,280
 I begged. 

903
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:53,770
 But you completely turned away from my prayers. 

904
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:56,780
 Then what kind of god are you? 

905
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:59,390
 From now on, I'm a god. 

906
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:05,610
 The people who believe your bullshit and follow you, I'll judge them.
