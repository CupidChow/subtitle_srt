2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,050
   

3
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,500
Aigoo.

4
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,850
Officer Jung is

5
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,960
number one. Eh?

6
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,820
Aigoo.

7
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,520
Ommo.

8
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,990
   

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,660
 Sometimes I go on an unexpected hunt. 

10
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,610
 This unlucky woman ended up seeing something she should not have. 

11
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,240
 And unavoidably became my prey. 

12
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,680
 Prey, until it takes its last breath 

13
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,410
 must vigorously struggle and resist. 

14
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,660
 But this victim doesn't look like it has any strength to resist. 

15
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,280
 So this hunt is boring and not fun at all. 

16
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,700
 What should I do? 

17
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,620
 My baby. 

18
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,840
   

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,620
Seonbae, did you find anything? 
    

20
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,720
Not yet.

21
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,920
Seong Yo Han has a friend who will testify that he was at home

22
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,190
on the day Professor Daniel went missing.

23
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,530
- Try meeting with him. 
 - Yes.

24
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,700
Something is up with Seong Yo Han.

25
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,090
Did you find anything?

26
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,580
No, very clean.

27
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,580
I should have found it before it began to rain.

28
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,490
- What about the finger found in the wine cup? 
 - It is Na Chi Kook's finger.

29
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,690
Then who does the other finger belong to?

30
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,380
Yes, Team Leader?

31
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,460
Is that so? I'll be right there.

32
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,460
I think we found the owner of the other finger.

33
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,530
Thank you.

34
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,850
- You brought your car, right? 
 - Yes.

35
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,440
Hurry and follow me.

36
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,130
They said that until two years ago,

37
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,870
that this was a clothing factory operated by a religious organization.

38
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,910
What brings you here?

39
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,410
What happened?

40
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,630
They said that this person has been dead for about 10 days.

41
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,240
He didn't show up to work for 10 days, but no one was looking for him.

42
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,410
What a heartless world.

43
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,560
There is something in his throat.

44
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,280
What is that?

45
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,440
 Well, I am not sure since it has decayed so badly. 

46
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,800
 Homicide alert. Homicide alert. 

47
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,640
   

48
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,310
 I see. Please give me a call as soon as Officer Jung wakes up. 

49
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,420
I hope nothing bad happened.

50
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,290
What?

51
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,220
There's a student over there.

52
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,800
Student, are you sick or hurt? Why are you there?

53
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,220
Can you give me a ride just across this bridge?

54
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,200
Yes, hurry and get in.

55
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,520
You will catch a cold.

56
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,900
   

57
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,630
Thank you.

58
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,230
This is new car. I just got it last week.

59
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,460
- The seats are leather, so they shouldn't get wet. 
 - Hey.

60
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,900
Damn...

61
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,600
Why were you crouching there in the rain?

62
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,960
- My grandma wasn't answering my phone calls. 
 - Oh no.

63
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,900
So that's why you stayed there when it's raining so hard?

64
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,760
You're not a child.

65
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,180
- Please let me off here. 
 - Here?

66
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,270
Hold on. I think I have

67
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,650
an umbrella in the trunk.

68
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,890
Oh, here.

69
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,070
Thank you.

70
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,330
Use this.

71
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,870
Be careful on your way, student. Go straight home!

72
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,790
So she lives in this neighborhood.

73
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,340
Why? Do you know her?

74
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,000
Hurry and go.

75
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,960
That was a limited edition umbrella. There are only 100 of them in the world.

76
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,610
I should have asked her to return it to me after she uses it.

77
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,970
I heard your parents had you after trying for 10 years.

78
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,620
They must have been so happy at that time, not knowing their child was such an immature snob.

79
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,010
Anyway, I wonder who got attacked this time?

80
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,660
Why won't she answer my phone calls?

81
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,750
Is she so angry?

82
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,970
Ajumma!

83
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,480
Has something happened in our neighborhood?

84
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,600
We don't know. We came out because of those siren sounds.

85
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,200
Judging by the many police cars that have come,

86
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,740
this is a murder case.

87
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,600
This boy. It's because you've only been watching strange things after giving up on the civil service exam.

88
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,190
How can you treat your son this way when he is the future Hitchcock?

89
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,620
I will go to observe a fresh crime scene.

90
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,860
- I will go first, Madam Jang. Bye Bong Yi.
 - Okay.

91
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,640
Oh my! I can't believe I enjoyed eating seaweed soup after giving birth to a child like that!

92
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,880
Oh right, Ajumma! Have you seen my grandma by any chance?

93
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,800
I haven't.

94
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,730
I just noticed that she's not here with us.

95
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,100
Oh, she must have gone there.

96
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,420
You know that she even goes looking for a house on fire when it's just mosquito repellent burning!

97
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,530
I will be going now.

98
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,500
You go and see, too!

99
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,130
This bastard.

100
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,760
He even kills elderly people now?

101
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,340
There is a burn mark on her hand.

102
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,390
It looks like she put a fire out with her hand.

103
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,510
What was it that you gripped like this in your hand until your last moment?

104
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,420
 My baby, unfairly treated. 

105
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,260
 It will be alright, Grandma. 

106
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,690
 Oh, Sir. I am the one at fault. 

107
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,010
 Please take me instead and let my baby live. 

108
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,840
Why did you chase us here, too?

109
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,850
Darn it!

110
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,790
- What?  What did you say to me just now? Are you saying– 
 - Ahhh!

111
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,860
What's wrong, Seonbae?

112
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,740
Seonbae, do you know her?

113
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,040
Why do only the pitiable people have to die every day?

114
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,000
That crazy jerk! What's wrong with him?

115
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,460
I didn't know.

116
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,720
What happened?

117
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,790
Hey!

118
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,320
Ajussi?

119
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,180
Don't go inside.

120
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,220
Why not?

121
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,810
The reason is...

122
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,610
Come talk with me for a bit.

123
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,890
Let me go.

124
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,250
- Bong Yi, just for a moment. 
 - Let me go, Ajussi!

125
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,160
Let me go!

126
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,330
Let me go.

127
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,680
Let me go! Please let me go!

128
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,860
 I feel so sorry. What should I do! 

129
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,440
- Just a moment, please.  Here— 
 - Let her go!

130
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,600
Let her go. Please come here. We have to confirm that she is family.

131
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,450
Stop!

132
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,100
Are you going to show a child her grandmother in this state?

133
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,770
- But we have to confirm the victim's identity— 
 - Out of my way!

134
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,420
Grandma.

135
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,950
Why is my grandmother lying there?

136
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,840
- Ajussi. 
 - Get going.

137
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,440
- Why is grandma there? Ajussi. 
 - Get going.

138
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,140
- Sorry, hold on. 
 - Ajussi.

139
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,730
- Go already! 
 - Grandma!

140
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,050
- Calm down. 
 - Grandma!

141
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,700
Get going!

142
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,880
- Let me go! Grandma! 
 - Bong Yi!

143
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,770
Grandma!

144
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,570
Grandma!

145
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,070
   

146
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,670
Where is he?

147
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,990
What happened?

148
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,530
The patient needs to rest—

149
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,220
Out of my way.

150
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,700
So what happened?

151
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,350
Because of me...

152
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,670
If only I answered Elder's phone call...

153
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,110
Come to your senses. Look straight into my eyes.

154
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,820
Look at my eyes, you punk!

155
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,170
You have to tell me every single thing you saw. That's how we can catch him, okay?

156
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,540
So...

157
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,080
while you and I were at the prison,

158
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,210
Elder must have continued to call me.

159
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,330
But I didn't know, and only saw her calls when I arrived at the station.

160
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,610
   

161
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,690
 The call was not connected— 

162
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,910
 I saw that guy on the news who killed that student. What should I do? 

163
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,820
   

164
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,530
 Why aren't you answering your phone? 

165
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,980
 Officer Jung, I am so scared. I can't think of anything I can do. 

166
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,450
 I'm on the bus. When you hear this, come to the general store. I brought a photo. 

167
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,540
 Elder! 

168
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,280
Unfortunately, the general store was closed, of all times. 
  Ajumma? 

169
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,850
So I called Elder right away.

170
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,540
It's a redevelopment zone, so everyone had moved away and the alley was completely empty.

171
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,570
 Elder? 

172
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,500
But I heard Elder's cell phone ring.

173
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,640
I thought that was strange.

174
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
 Elder, are you here? Oh! 

175
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,230
 El-Elder! 

176
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,130
 Oh, oh, Elder! 

177
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,900
His face? Did you see his face?

178
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,940
 Who are you? 

179
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,630
It... It was so dark, and he jumped out so suddenly.

180
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,410
Anything else? It can be anything. Think! Anything that could be a clue!

181
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,850
Ah, he was left-handed!

182
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,820
Left-handed?

183
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:30,410
So it's definitely him, isn't it? You said that guy was left-handed, too.

184
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,420
 The culprit is left-handed. The knife is plunged at 1 o'clock. 

185
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,820
 That's an angle that's only possible if he used his left hand. 

186
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,790
 He is definitely left-handed. 

187
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,520
Something else?

188
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,670
Anything else?

189
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,500
When I tussled with him, there was a particular scent.

190
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,010
A scent?

191
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,060
What scent?

192
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,580
Mint! I smelled mint.

193
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,210
What brings you here without any notice?

194
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,050
Oh, I happened to be in Mujin for a flower show.

195
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,550
Your maid must be very skilled. There isn't a speck of dust in any corner.

196
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,090
Please stop sending me maids. I am uncomfortable with unfamiliar people coming into my home.

197
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,750
You didn't eat yet, did you?

198
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,730
You should not skip meals.

199
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,360
I put the clothes you had taken off in the washing machine.

200
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,440
Was there a new emergency patient on your way home from work?

201
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,560
Why did you choose to be an emergency room doctor of all the different types of doctors?

202
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,730
You get covered in blood every day.

203
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,420
That's a nice scent.

204
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,600
You never used products with scent in them.

205
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,990
It looks like my son has someone in his life.

206
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,660
Are you considering marriage?

207
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,570
I want to see my grandchild soon, too.

208
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,920
I will raise your child for you.

209
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,220
Just thinking about it is horrifying.

210
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,950
What?

211
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,710
A third generation of Han Seo Joon?

212
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,790
Yo Han...

213
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,720
Did you see that grandma today?

214
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,560
Were there any unusual things that she said or did?

215
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,590
Was there anything strange about her?

216
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,770
Elder... This afternoon...

217
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,760
She argued with her granddaughter and she was upset. Aside from that...

218
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,510
Did she say if she was planning to go anywhere?

219
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,120
I think she said she was headed home.

220
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,360
What do you mean, "you think?" Think properly!

221
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,090
Don't give me sloppy answers!

222
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,460
What do you think you are doing when he is injured?

223
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,950
Oh...

224
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,170
- I had some questions for him regarding the investigation. 
 - Thank you for your hard work.

225
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,460
We were told to take him to a private room in order to protect the witness.

226
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,090
Take care of yourself. I'll come back.

227
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,420
 At around 8:00 p.m. tonight, in an empty house in Gudong Village, a redevelopment zone, 

228
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,840
 a woman in her 70s was found deceased after having been stabbed several times. 

229
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,460
 The police consider this case to be part of the recent serial killings. 

230
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,260
 And there is another new victim, assumed to have been killed by the same killer. 

231
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:27,730
 He was found after having been dead for 10 days at a clothing factory that had been run by a religious organization. 

232
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,310
 So the number of victims of this serial killer has increased to six. 

233
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,920
 Someone like you should die! 

234
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,730
 You monster! 

235
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,770
 You should not have been born. 

236
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,100
 I should not have given birth to you! 

237
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,130
 What can I do about all these sins? 

238
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:14,660
 A police officer who was hit by a car while chasing the culprit was transported to a hospital and he is receiving treatment. 

239
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,400
I'm sorry, Aunt

240
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,560
and Uncle.

241
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:34,430
Becoming a policeman when it doesn't suit your personality at all...

242
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,470
Honey, I'll spend the night here.

243
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,430
Yes, do that.

244
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,870
Dong Koo said he's coming to spend the night here.

245
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,960
I'm alright, so please go home.

246
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,590
Okay, I'll come by early tomorrow morning.

247
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,270
♪ What should I try making today? ♪

248
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,540
Did he get hurt? He isn't someone who would wear bandages with cartoon characters on them.

249
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,600
   

250
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,620
 - Calm down. You cannot go in there. 
 - Out of my way! 

251
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,790
 - You cannot go in. I told you! 
 - Out of my way! 

252
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,800
 Hey, hey! Hey! Let go! 

253
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,230
Hey, you moron. How can you

254
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,950
- call yourself a police officer? 
 - Get out! 
 - Let go!

255
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,830
Why? Why?

256
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,120
Why didn't you answer my grandma's phone calls? Why?

257
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,590
Why didn't you answer her calls?

258
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,260
Grandma died because of you.

259
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,050
Because of you, my grandma... Let go of me!

260
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,120
So you find him! Find the bastard who killed my grandma!

261
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,620
You find him, you bastard!

262
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,830
Bring my grandma back to life, please.

263
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,630
Please... My grandma... Bring her back.

264
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,250
 Bring my grandma back to life! 

265
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,050
My... My... My grandma!

266
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,720
 My grandma!! 

267
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,180
 The nightmare of the Headhunter case that had terrorized the entire nation 25 years ago has come alive again. 

268
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,760
 During these past two months, there have been six victims of a serial killer. 

269
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,090
 But the police have failed to identify even the outlines of the culprit, 

270
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,610
 leading to the fear and mistrust of the citizens. 

271
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,850
I've seen this somewhere before.

272
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,150
 When I was going to my early morning prayer service, I saw a light flashing. 

273
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,880
Light flashing, she said?

274
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,130
A camera flash?

275
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,090
This pervert psycho.

276
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,920
He killed someone and took pictures?

277
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,200
So where did this grandma get this picture from?

278
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,190
What do you mean there is no CCTV?

279
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,480
This was a redevelopment zone for a long time.

280
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,930
So everyone moved out. There are only a few households who are still living there.

281
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,960
Please get the black box videos from all of

282
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,710
the cars that were parked in the area that day. Get me all of them that have recorded that grandma.

283
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,500
Among the households that are left, no one has a car.

284
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,240
It's a dead neighborhood, so hardly any cars ever go there from elsewhere.

285
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,380
Oh, her. It's that grandma.

286
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,290
Where did she get on the bus?

287
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,740
Yes.

288
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,760
Examine all the CCTV videos of the subway and buses near the Gudong area.

289
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,800
See if that grandma is on any of them.

290
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,030
I'm sure we will find something.

291
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,250
 I see. 

292
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,560
Hey, Officer Jung!

293
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,150
Detective.

294
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,260
What are you doing here?

295
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,520
Looking for the guy who killed Grandma.

296
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,980
Detective, were you just at the bus company, too?

297
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,550
Look at the way you are now. Won't you go home already?

298
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,210
I have to find him.

299
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,400
Maybe he was filmed on that CCTV. Let me confirm it.

300
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,060
Hey, hey! Officer Jung!

301
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,540
Where did you go?

302
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,280
I get this is an old building. But it's unbelievable they don't have any CCTV.

303
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,110
I'll look up here, so you go to the hospital.

304
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,510
She died because of me.

305
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,000
So I'm going to catch him no matter what.

306
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,890
Oh, hello. I'm with the police. Do you have CCTV?

307
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,670
Have you seen her?

308
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,070
I haven't seen her.

309
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,440
Excuse me. I'm with the police.

310
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,030
I know nothing.

311
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,770
Hello.

312
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:59,020
I'm with the police.

313
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,430
Welcome.

314
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,740
- Oh, excuse me. I'm with the police. 
 - Oh, yes, yes.

315
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,280
By any chance, did this elder come here yesterday?

316
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,020
Did something happen?

317
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,820
You know there was a murder in this neighborhood, right?

318
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,390
Oh, yes. Aigo, then was it this grandma?

319
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:30,570
We checked the CCTV, but please confirm she entered this alley.

320
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,790
Oh, she didn't come here.

321
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,120
If anyone who comes here recognizes her, please contact the police.

322
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,420
Exactly! It's not like I can report to the police for yogurt theft.

323
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,070
Excuse me. I...

324
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,170
   

325
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,470
Who was that?

326
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,760
Do you know about the murder in this neighborhood?

327
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,410
He came to ask if that old lady came by.

328
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,870
Oh, really?

329
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,360
This grandma? Is this the grandma?

330
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,490
Yes. Why?

331
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,530
She was the one who stole the yogurt yesterday!

332
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,890
Gosh, let me report this.

333
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:21,190
Are you crazy? What if they discover we hire illegal immigrants?

334
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,280
Let's just leave it like this.

335
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,150
Let's not mess things up.

336
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,070
But someone has just died!

337
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,710
Shut up! Do you want to close our business?

338
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,090
Got it.

339
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,450
Get in. I'll take you to the hospital.

340
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,100
What?

341
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,340
Oh, it's nothing.

342
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,140
It's messy, right? Just ignore it.

343
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,640
Yes.

344
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,500
Your leg is hurt. Why are you working so hard?

345
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,250
Please have a drink. Thank you.

346
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,450
Gosh. She wanted him as a grandson-in-law.

347
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,610
 - And it looks like he really is.  
 - My condolences.

348
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,200
- Thank you.
  - He took care of everything regarding the funeral 

349
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,180
even though he is injured.

350
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,460
I feel so sorry for Bong Yi.

351
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,300
I believe she doesn't have any other relatives.

352
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,920
I've already searched through these alleys,

353
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,720
but I could have missed something.

354
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,930
Team 1, visit the offices in this building again.

355
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,420
Team 2, go through every single place connected to this alley.

356
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,110
Team 3, go through the end of this alley until the street across from it. Move!

357
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,050
Yes, sir!

358
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,410
Please, rewind this footage at the very bottom here.

359
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,840
Yes.

360
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,800
I heard you prepared grandmother's grave.

361
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,250
I wouldn't have minded a cremation. This must've cost a lot.

362
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:52,180
I spread my parents ashes in the sea.

363
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,510
Even if I want to cry, there's no place to go.

364
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,110
Then,

365
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:05,820
you worried that I wouldn't have a place to go if I wanted to see grandma?

366
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,560
Your grandma doesn't drink.

367
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,200
You're wrong.

368
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,130
My grandma liked makgeolli so much.

369
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,470
I...

370
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,310
The last time...

371
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,060
The last time I talked to her,

372
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:12,110
I said something

373
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,110
I should have never said!

374
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,890
 I'm like this because I listened to you so well. 

375
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,700
 What did you say? 

376
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,600
 If I hadn't listened to you, I wouldn't have gone to buy you makgeolli. 

377
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,080
 Then that kind of thing would not have... 

378
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,440
Grandma...

379
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:44,020
I'm going crazy whenever I think about that.

380
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,360
Grandma.

381
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,600
Grandma, I was wrong.

382
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,280
I'm– I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

383
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,690
Grandma, I was wrong.

384
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:18,860
I'm– I'm really sorry.

385
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,220
Don't worry.

386
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,480
I asked Dong Koo to feed him every day.

387
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,360
You should sleep. Try not to think of anything.

388
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,160
Hurry, let's go in.

389
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:45,560
 Great! Did you enjoy eating pork wraps by yourself? Don't you know I like it too? 

390
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,450
 - What can I cook for dinner? 
 - I won't eat dinner. 

391
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,230
 Won't you eat? Tell me everything you want to eat. 

392
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,260
 Would you like to have pork wraps for dinner? 

393
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,950
 I said, I won't eat! 

394
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,840
What? This is rotten.

395
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:06,010
Bong Yi, what are you doing? Bong Yi, I said it is rotten!

396
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,660
What's wrong? What is it? Stop eating!

397
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,710
Don't do it! Don't eat it! Seriously!

398
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,340
Let go.

399
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,780
Aigo.

400
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:48,030
My poor baby. What now? What now?

401
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,170
What should we do?

402
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,100
Grandma.

403
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,680
Grandma.

404
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,280
My grandma...

405
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,280
Grandma!

406
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,580
Grandma, don't worry.

407
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,370
There's someone who protects me.

408
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,860
No, not this.

409
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,380
Hey, did you get anything?

410
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,920
- No, not yet. 
 - Aish, I even let you carry out a search–

411
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,340
Oh, what is it?

412
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,150
You let him carry out a search when he is still suspended?

413
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,800
Gosh, shut up.

414
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,660
Did you check the visitor list at the prison?

415
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:35,900
Yes. I checked the visitor list of that day and there is no one suspicious.

416
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,150
- Are you sure? 
 - Did you check everyone?

417
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,190
Didn't you leave anyone out?

418
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,530
If you don't believe me, check it again yourself!

419
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,520
I just asked if someone was left out!

420
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,810
What's wrong with you two, huh?

421
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,540
You were so close in the past.

422
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,040
Yes?

423
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,570
Oh, CCTV? Was the granny in it?

424
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,400
Send it to me right now.

425
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,010
Hey, did you get something? Huh?

426
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,890
I'm with the police. By chance, have you seen this old woman before?

427
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,960
No, I haven't.

428
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,330
I'm with the police. Have you seen this old woman before?

429
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,970
I'm sorry. I don't know.

430
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,420
Yo Han. The police came looking for me.

431
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,820
- What should I do? 
 - Just say what I told you.

432
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,840
You're Kim Joon Sung, right?

433
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,880
I'll ask you a few questions. You know Mr. Seong Yo Han, right?

434
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,340
Yes, he's a friend of mine.

435
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,800
Where were you last Sunday evening until dawn?

436
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,340
Last Sunday evening...

437
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,120
Yo Han wasn't feeling well, so I'd gone to his house.

438
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,280
He wasn't feeling well.

439
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:27,560
Where's my phone? Ah, I must've left it behind in my car again.

440
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,970
-I 'm sorry, but could I borrow your phone? 
 - Sure.

441
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:35,980
Thank you! Wow, this is a new model.

442
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,220
I've heard this one has amazing features.

443
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,180
   

444
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,160
 Did the cop go? Did you tell him what I told you to? 

445
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,150
He's not picking up the phone.

446
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:09,430
Maybe it's because it's the new model, but even the sound quality is amazing!

447
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,020
I'll call you again if I have more questions.

448
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,970
Hey, Yo Han.

449
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,200
No, I didn't call you.

450
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,930
Sunbae. Sunbae, I think you were right.

451
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,950
Something's not right about Seong Yo Han. What should we do?

452
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,590
Why bother asking?  Break open Seong Yo Han's car door and check the black box.

453
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,240
- Find out where he was at that hour. 
 - That's illegal.

454
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,660
If I cause trouble, my father's political career ends.

455
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,120
He's running for the  Presidency next year.

456
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,100
Ah, is that right?  Then, you shouldn't be discussing with me who doesn't have a distinguished father.

457
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,630
I am busy doing an illegal investigation so I will hang up now.

458
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,810
Yes, I am with the police. By chance, have you seen this grandmother?

459
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,000
I am with the police.

460
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,490
By chance, have you seen this grandmother?

461
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,490
- I am with the police. 
 - Okay.

462
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:11,730
- By chance, have you seen this grandmother? 
 - This person?

463
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,140
- Ah, what is it? 
  - Where are you?  Hurry up and come in. 

464
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,410
- I am busy. 
 - I said hurry up and come in, now!

465
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:33,030
Gosh, seriously!

466
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,970
Ah.

467
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,810
I am investigating without sleep or food. Why is he ordering me around?

468
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,170
What? Why would I?

469
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:16,350
That serial killer is saying, "Go Mu Chi, try to catch me!" So everyone is focusing on what you have to say.

470
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,660
The entire nation is focusing on what you have to say.

471
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,280
I... I got fired, didn't I? Ah, I am suspended, right?

472
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,410
Investigation briefings should be given by you, the team leader.  How could you make a low-ranking officer like me do it?  That's low.

473
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,150
It's the Chief's order, so what am I supposed to do?

474
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,350
- Should I get fired for disobeying the order! 
 - Ah, damn!

475
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:45,390
So why the heck did you blabber about serial killings or whatever on the broadcast,

476
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:48,780
and become that punk's target? Geez!

477
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,340
Hey, you have plenty of time until 8:00 p.m., so sit here and prepare the investigation briefing.

478
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,700
Don't think about going anywhere.

479
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,850
- I didn't even get to eat! 
 - I will bring a meal to you!

480
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,390
Gosh!

481
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,850
Han Kook!

482
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,820
- Ma'am, we will rest for a bit and go on one more ride then start. 
 - Sure.

483
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,570
- Mom. 
 - What is it?

484
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:34,490
Buy me that, the goat man bread. I am hungry.

485
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:40,400
Hold on for a little bit longer. The broadcast staff said they will buy us a meal later.

486
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,560
Ma'am, could you come here for just a bit, please?

487
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,400
Ah, sure.

488
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,700
Stay here. Mom will be right back.

489
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,400
 Today at 3:00 p.m., Kim Han Kook, who appeared on OBN Hope for Children 

490
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,280
 and tugged at the heartstrings of all citizens, 

491
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,990
 went missing while filming at an amusement park.  
    

492
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,540
Aigoo.

493
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:59,220
Go Mu Chi, get up. Get up, Go Mu Chi.

494
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,180
This... You just have to read  it exactly as written.

495
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:08,410
The public sentiment is not good.  No matter how much the reporters blabber, don't lose your temper, okay?

496
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:11,430
Look at your hair!  You did sleep for quite a while.

497
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:15,810
You can't make any mistakes.  This is a live broadcast, okay?

498
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:18,840
- Do you understand?! 
 - Yeah, I got it.

499
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,720
- I am hungry. 
 - Ah, this.

500
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,990
 Fortunately, at the crime scene of the last victim, 

501
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:53,800
 Gudong neighborhood 70-something-year-old woman, 
 

502
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,390
 and CCTV footage were collected, so we are hard at work investigating. 

503
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:04,660
 Through the victims' belongings left at the greenhouse murder scene of the female college student, 

504
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:09,690
 the aforementioned cases were ruled to be serial murders committed by the same culprit, and the investigation is proceeding accordingly. 

505
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:12,430
 The police, taking into consideration the importance of these cases, 

506
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:18,280
 are investigating for a criminal motive, relationship with the victims and whether or not there is an accomplice, or an accessory to the crimes. 

507
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,570
The investigation is being carried out in various ways, in all directions.

508
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,890
Please excuse the fact that we cannot disclose any more specifics as the information is classified.

509
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:29,220
There will not be any separate Q &amp; A time for today's investigation briefing.

510
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:34,780
We will arrest the culprit as soon as possible. We're doing our best for the safety of our citizens. This concludes the briefing.

511
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,210
There have been six innocent victims in the past 2 months!

512
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:42,520
Until now, what progress has the police made?  Were the police idling?

513
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,080
Please understand that I cannot respond to any questions as the investigation is still in progress.

514
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,680
 The culprit left you a message at the murder scene of the female college student. 

515
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,900
 Why did he choose you, Detective Go Mu Chi, to leave the message for? 

516
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,980
Why don't you ask that punk? I am dying to know, too.

517
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:01,140
You said that these are a psychopath's random murders.  Is that still valid?

518
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,770
You said there are six victims of serial murder, but aren't there seven?

519
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,880
 There was a tip that the attempted murder of the correctional officer was also committed by the same culprit— 

520
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,820
Now, that's classified—

521
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:13,700
He infiltrated the correctional facility and attempted to murder a correctional officer.  Can you still say that this is random?

522
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,470
Are you sure that there are no ties between the victims?

523
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,240
Could it be that the investigation is headed in a completely wrong direction?

524
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,530
Now, now. We investigated thoroughly.

525
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:25,680
There weren't any ties between the victims.

526
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:35,650
But what if the victims don't have a commonality...

527
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:40,220
- There is none, but what? 
 - If there was still a standard by which he selected the victims...

528
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,670
   

529
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,760
   

530
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,790
   

531
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,780
- Who are you? 
  - You are Detective Go Mu Chi indeed. 

532
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,890
 You were wrong once, but you were still pretty splendid. 

533
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:12,650
What? Then...

534
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,650
 You are correct. There is a standard by which I selected my victims. 

535
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:18,920
 - So why did I choose that child?  
 - What?

536
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,700
 Why will that child die? What did he do wrong? 

537
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,250
- You damn... 
  - Detective Go, you like being on TV, don't you? 

538
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,360
 What was the program on which you wrongly said that I chose my victims randomly? 

539
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:32,200
 Find the reason I killed the child and say it on that TV show. 

540
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,560
 I decline a drunken broadcast. Be serious. 

541
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,250
 - After all, a person's life is on the line.  
 - What did you say, you psycho bastard?

542
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,190
 If you don't say the correct answer, as soon as that broadcast is over, right on the dot, 

543
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:46,910
 I will kill him where everyone in the country can see. I promise. 

544
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:48,560
Hel–

545
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:55,010
- Who was it? 
 - Who did you call a psycho?

546
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,150
- Who did you speak to on the phone? 
 - Was it the culprit?

547
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:01,150
 You are correct. There is a standard by which I selected my victims. 

548
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,510
 So why did I choose that child? 

549
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:08,550
 Why will that child die? What did he do wrong? 

550
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:11,710
So who does this bastard intend to kill now?

551
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,750
 - Kim Han Kook is...  
 - Aigoo.

552
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,400
What chaos.

553
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,750
Serial killings, kidnapping children. Geez.

554
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,620
 ...he came to Korea to find his father. 

555
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:26,850
 As this kind of story became known, there have been warm wishes offered. 

556
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:30,470
 No clues have been found at the scene. 
   

557
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:31,460
Perhaps...

558
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,730
 Why did I select that child? 
   

559
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:38,030
 Why will that child die? What did he do wrong? 

560
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:43,190
The kidnapper called Han Kook's mother and demanded a ransom for his life.

561
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:48,540
It's a typical kidnapping done for money.

562
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:55,230
But, "price for his life?"

563
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:56,940
Don't they usually call it the "price for his body?"

564
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,800
That's the usual term but the culprit said, "the price for his life."

565
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,620
How much did he demand?

566
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:07,760
He didn't tell us the amount yet.

567
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:11,270
The call was recorded, right?

568
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:16,540
 Pay the price for his life by Friday, at 11:00 p.m. sharp. 

569
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,050
 If you don't, Han Kook will die. 

570
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,050
"Friday, at 11:00 p.m. sharp."

571
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:33,190
 Detective Go, you like being on TV, don't you? What was the program on which you wrongly said that I chose my victims randomly? 

572
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:36,010
 As soon as that broadcast is over, right on the dot... 

573
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,850
Friday, at 11:00 p.m.

574
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,450
When Sherlock Hong Ju's broadcast ends.

575
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:43,400
Do you think it will help the investigation for you to go on the broadcast as you request?

576
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,490
The most important thing is to save this child's life, Commissioner.

577
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:50,340
I don't know. Do you think he is still alive?

578
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,890
I am certain that he is still alive.

579
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:55,860
The child has to be kept alive in order for this guy to maximize showing off his existence.

580
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,750
"Bind, torture, kill."

581
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,900
He ties them up, tortures them, and kills them.

582
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,150
He called himself the BTK Killer.

583
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:05,170
He began by killing a family of four in 1974.

584
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,330
And he killed at least 10 people over 30 years.

585
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:10,050
As if to mock the police, he kept sending letters

586
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,330
and items that belonged to the victims to broadcast stations.

587
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:16,070
A characteristic of psychopaths who commit serial killings

588
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,340
is their desire to boast about their brutal crimes

589
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,570
and their desire to reveal their existence.

590
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:22,820
It's a type of exhibitionism.

591
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,250
Also, we must do this broadcast in order to catch this guy.

592
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:29,910
The BTK Killer, who diligently hid his identity as a killer as he led the life of a civil service worker,

593
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:33,820
was finally caught after 30 years due to a letter that he sent to the media and the police.

594
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,410
He had left his genetic material on that letter.

595
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,150
He left his genetic material on the letter?

596
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:41,990
He didn't do it on purpose. He was so intoxicated by his exhibitionism that he made a fatal error.

597
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,930
It's true. I heard this from Professor Daniel while preparing my previous program.

598
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:51,120
These types of psychopaths are so vain that sometimes they make absurd mistakes.

599
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,040
Yes, that is how the Headhunter was caught 25 years ago.

600
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,710
He killed over 20 people in one year, and left behind no witnesses, not even a single clue.

601
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:02,640
But with a family of four who rode in a camping car,

602
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:14,390
he mistakenly thought that they were a family of three. Because he didn't deal with the youngest child,

603
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:17,210
he finally got caught and arrested.

604
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:21,660
He made a crucial mistake because he was so deeply immersed in his vanity.

605
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:25,750
Change the slide for me.

606
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,240
His exhibitionism is reaching its climax right now.

607
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,320
If I lure him on stage just like he wants, there is a high probability that he will get easily trapped.

608
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,020
Then he will definitely make a fatal mistake.

609
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:41,320
He is dreaming of cinematic crimes. So we do a cinematic investigation.

610
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,130
And if the investigators climb onto the public stage,

611
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:47,230
there is a high probability that we can obtain information about him that we do not yet know.

612
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,940
So this broadcast will be of great help to the investigation.

613
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,160
In any case, do you think you can find the answer?

614
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,310
There are only four days left.

615
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,170
I will make sure to find it.

616
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:02,250
If we are doing a broadcast because the culprit wants us to, the negative public opinion will be severe.

617
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:07,270
And so the preparations must be top secret.

618
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,520
Please entrust this to me, Commissioner.

619
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,640
Chief of Police!

620
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:24,780
Alright, let's give it try.

621
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:39,490
Police Commissioner and the station director?

622
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,900
Detective Kang?

623
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,590
- What is it? 
 - What do you mean?

624
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,600
Oh, don't play dumb.

625
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,090
Why would the station director of OBN pay us a visit all the way here?

626
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:04,400
And with the Commissioner, too? Both with such serious looks on their faces?

627
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,770
Do I look like your spy, Reporter Ahn? If you want to know, find out for yourself!

628
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,160
Hey, Detective Kang!

629
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,830
   

630
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,290
   

631
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,740
A total of seven victims have been killed in this case. Song Soo Ho was killed due to rage. He's an exception.

632
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:11,610
The grandma from Gudong was killed because she took a photo from him, and he was afraid his identity would be revealed. She's an exception.

633
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:16,300
I previously said that the other five victims were randomly selected. But now I don't think that.

634
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:22,200
So we must find the reason that he selected these five to kill before the broadcast.

635
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,040
Let's meet with their bereaved families and the local people again.

636
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,910
If we look into the characteristics of the victims some more, I'm sure we will find a commonality.

637
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,890
How long have you known Na Chi Kook?

638
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:32,750
We were friends since 10th grade.

639
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,470
Then you must know him well. Tell me about him.

640
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,280
It can be anything, whatever you think of.

641
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,190
But why? Is this related to catching the culprit?

642
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,700
- About that— 
 - Ba Reum!

643
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,450
Detective, look what's on the news.

644
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:55,750
 I will replay the phone conversation between Detective Go Mu Chi and the killer, an exclusive from SBC. 

645
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,540
 This conversation was not edited. 
   

646
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,830
 Why will that child die? What did he do wrong? 

647
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,340
 Detective Go, you like being on TV, don't you? 

648
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,470
 What was the program on which you wrongly said that I chose my victims randomly? 

649
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:10,220
 Find the reason I killed the child and say it on that TV show. 

650
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:13,880
 I decline a drunken broadcast. Be serious. 

651
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,070
Ah, damn!

652
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:18,120
 The shock does not stop here. 

653
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,400
 We've learned that the Special Task Force of the Mujin Police 

654
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,310
 are currently preparing a top secret broadcast. 

655
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:27,410
 If they are preparing a broadcast at the demand of a serial killer 

656
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:30,190
 and allowing themselves to be manipulated, is that the best that the Korean police can do? 

657
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,710
 The power of judgment belongs to all of you. 

658
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:33,040
Are the contents of the phone call true?

659
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,480
Are you really preparing a broadcast?

660
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,550
Officer, are you really doing what the killer asked you to do?

661
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:38,040
Detective! 
    

662
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,670
- Please speak to us! 
 - Please tell us!

663
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:42,790
Detective!

664
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:44,010
Detective, please tell us!

665
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,810
What do you mean?

666
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,900
He wouldn't just keep the kid alive would he?

667
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,940
Go Mu Chi.

668
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,940
Do you remember me?

669
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,840
 Did you see that guy's face? 

670
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,870
 Speak! Did you see his face? 

671
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,330
I don't remember you.

672
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,650
Don't do that broadcast.

673
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:25,140
Lieutenant Park Doo Suk, why do you think I continue this dirty rotten detective work?

674
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:31,150
Because I intend to catch Han Seo Joon and kill him with my own hands.

675
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:35,520
The guy who killed my mom and dad, and your child, too.

676
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:41,130
In order to do that, I have to catch this psycho bastard who is just like Han Seo Joon, and get sent to prison where he is.

677
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:45,890
So even if everyone in this world opposes me, you shouldn't Ajussi.

678
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:52,410
Do you know why Han Seo Joon killed my child?

679
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,880
Because I didn't know what kind of guy Han Seo Joon was

680
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:01,210
and acted arrogant against him on a public broadcast.

681
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:02,910
So you shouldn't do that.

682
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:07,510
The way I see it, this guy is not a human being.

683
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:09,470
He is a monster.

684
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:13,820
If anything, he is a worse monster than Han Seo Joon. He's definitely not less of a monster.

685
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:17,250
Is that so? That's even better.

686
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,860
If I'm going to fight someone, I might as well fight someone like him.

687
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,020
Can't you understand what I'm telling you?

688
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:26,020
You can lose what is most precious to you.

689
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:31,310
Something that is most precious to me?

690
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,660
I already lost everything when I was eight years old.

691
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,930
You saw it too Ajussi.

692
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,570
I don't have anything more to lose.

693
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,810
The killer threw bait, and the police took the bait.

694
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,990
If a criminal takes a hostage and demands money,

695
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,880
you should never negotiate or compromise with them.

696
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,840
A murderer takes a child hostage

697
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,010
and demands for his reason for killing to be found and put on a broadcast?

698
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,970
We cannot tolerate the police doing what they are ordered by a criminal.

699
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:07,350
But to be realistic, there is no other way, is there?

700
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,910
He demanded for the answer to his question be revealed on a broadcast.

701
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,630
Is there any assurance that the answer can be found?

702
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:14,370
What if the answer is incorrect on the broadcast? Doesn't that put the child in more danger?

703
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:16,140
Is there anything more important than life?

704
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:20,530
I believe saving the child by finding the correct answer should be the priority.

705
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,470
By trusting the word of a psycho killer,

706
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:25,620
should we solve a riddle like this is a game and say the answer on a broadcast?

707
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:28,300
Is this really the best that our nation and our governmental authority

708
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,160
can do to save this child?

709
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,120
Save Han Kook!

710
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,770
Save him! Save him!

711
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,450
The Commissioner ordered us to stop this.

712
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:53,550
- But— 
 - You must already know that public opinion is very negative.

713
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:57,850
If the broadcast fails and the child dies,

714
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:00,220
then there is no escape.

715
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:06,680
It's not that I don't know how you feel.

716
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,380
Let's try finding another way.

717
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,240
   

718
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,650
What is this, you punk?

719
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:34,370
Hey, are submitting a letter of resignation like this?

720
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,600
To cover for you, do you know how much I...?

721
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,900
Are you happy now?

722
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,150
Detective, a comment please!

723
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:47,980
Please share your thoughts with us!

724
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:51,250
- How's the case going? 
 - Detective!

725
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,000
- Detective! 
 - Is the boy alive?

726
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,940
- Detective, please say few words! 
 - Is Han Kook alive?

727
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:01,770
Detective!

728
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:05,750
The Special Task Force will use another method to find Han Kook.

729
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:10,300
- Detective, please speak to us! 
 - Please tell us more!

730
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:27,210
This patient was released this morning.

731
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:32,880
The doctor tried very hard to stop him from leaving, but the patient was very stubborn.

732
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,180
   

733
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:50,780
   

734
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,190
   

735
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:55,130
Welcome.

736
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,520
You've worked hard. Come on in.

737
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,110
What are you doing?

738
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:11,600
I think the broadcast will be killed.

739
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:34,000
Excuse me, Detective.

740
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:37,180
What brings you here?

741
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:41,970
Han Kook's mother.

742
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:46,960
Sir...

743
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,030
Sir, please do the broadcast.

744
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:53,300
My baby. Please save my baby.

745
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,160
I will do anything.

746
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,750
I will do anything. Sir, please.

747
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,520
Did you guys bring her here?

748
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,670
I feel the same.

749
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:03,570
Please don't give up.

750
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:08,730
We have to catch the guy who did that to our Chi Kook and Bong Yi's grandma, don't we?

751
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:10,140
Take her away now.

752
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:13,460
Sir! Sir, please!

753
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:16,010
- Please, Sir! 
 - Please get up. I can't do it just because you do this.

754
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:20,660
Save my baby, please.

755
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:24,400
Please, please, save my baby.

756
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,140
Please.

757
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,280
Let's do it, Detective Go.

758
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,060
Let's do it. I will do whatever I can to make the station director agree to it.

759
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,860
Let's give it a try.

760
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:36,380
Thank you! Thank you!

761
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,550
Thank you!

762
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,110
Please get up now.

763
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:42,060
Please... Please...

764
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,180
Please.

765
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:44,580
Detective Go!

766
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,690
Please, please, Sir.

767
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,280
I can't do it here. They will force us to leave.

768
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,510
So where will we do it?

769
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:03,380
Welcome.

770
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:06,740
Over here.

771
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,220
It's okay.

772
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,900
- Don't you remember me? 
 - Huh?

773
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,000
I interviewed you that time.

774
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,160
About what?

775
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:25,470
My first interview when I was a newbie was about a high school student who received the Hero Award.

776
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:28,940
Officer Jung, you were the student I interviewed back then.

777
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,770
He gave me such a hard time, not wanting to do the interview.

778
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,900
He kept saying that he did nothing. It was all thanks to his friend.

779
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,510
He only talked about that throughout the interview.

780
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,930
It wasn't me. It was Chi Kook.

781
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:40,980
What? That student was the prison guard Na Chi Kook?

782
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,150
I saw the broadcast back then, and Chi Kook said it was all due to me.

783
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:48,530
That's how he is. He is excessively modest, shall we say?

784
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,520
That is true.

785
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:54,470
But the person that we rescued then?

786
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:56,340
I saw him recently by chance.

787
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,710
Where?

788
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,630
- Well— 
 - We've already lost two days.

789
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,880
It's the day before the broadcast. Let's hurry.

790
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,610
Hurry.

791
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,370
   

792
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,740
They are all from different areas and of different ages.

793
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:20,900
What is the commonality between them?

794
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,320
Why did this bastard select these victims?

795
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,780
Yes, Detective?

796
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,720
Hello, it's me.

797
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,850
Did you figure out what the thing that was in his throat was?

798
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,580
An insect.

799
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:48,010
Father!

800
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,960
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

801
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,420
The neighborhood feels empty now that you're gone.

802
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:55,940
How do you like the new church? The building is nice, isn't it?

803
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,350
Of course, I still miss Gudong.

804
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:02,770
I will come and move my things from the church next week. We can see each other again, then.

805
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:04,590
But what is all this?

806
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:07,070
I made a few things, including japchae.

807
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,900
Please eat it together.

808
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,270
Why did you make so much japchae?

809
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:16,760
My brother Mu Chi always liked japchae since he was young. So please enjoy it for a long time.

810
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:20,340
I didn't put the carrots in. Mu Chi doesn't like carrots.

811
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:25,850
And don't tell Mu Chi that I made the food.

812
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,300
If he knew, he won't eat it.

813
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:31,080
Okay.

814
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,120
Officer Jung,

815
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:39,350
please take good care of Mu Chi.

816
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:46,540
Nothing particular about Byeon Sun Yeong and a insect came out of Park Jong Ho's throat.

817
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,470
Na Chi Kook was found with his clothes removed.

818
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:51,570
On Mr. Kim, the homeless man, a hatchet, the murder weapon, was found.

819
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:54,960
Jo Mi Jeong's body was found in a greenhouse at a grape farm.

820
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,740
Did you make this, Officer Jung?

821
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,290
Yes.

822
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,860
- It's so tasty. 
 - It is. It really is.

823
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,070
Oh, thank you.

824
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:09,770
You don't seem suited to be a police officer anyway. You should quit and become a chef.

825
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,440
Sure.

826
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,770
I will consider that.

827
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,910
We're all done eating, right?

828
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:20,740
We won't find the answer here, so let's begin meeting with the victim's friends and acquaintances.

829
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:24,180
Will you be alright?

830
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,570
Of course.

831
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:28,550
I told you to stay home.

832
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:30,280
I will be fine.

833
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,960
I am Detective Go Mu Chi.

834
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,580
 Byeon Sun Yeong was in her early 30s. 

835
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:37,480
 She worked in the kitchen of a drinking establishment. 

836
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,860
 Park Jong Ho, mid-20s, a temporary employee with a subcontractor. 

837
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,800
Do you recognize this person?

838
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,000
 Mr. Kim, estimated to be in his 50s. 

839
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,090
 Homeless, still unidentified. 

840
01:06:56,810 --> 01:07:02,310
 Jo Mi Jeong, a college student in her early 20s, a YouTuber who made mukbang videos. 

841
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:06,470
 Na Chi Kook, in his mid to late 20s. 

842
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:12,320
 A guard at Mujin Prison. The only survivor is currently unconscious. 

843
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,580
8:59 p.m.

844
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:56,940
Right. From the start,

845
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:01,090
it wasn't important to find how these victims were connected.

846
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:06,360
We have to find this guy's criteria for selecting these people.

847
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,410
So I must think about it from his perspective.

848
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:11,770
From his perspective...

849
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,280
The standard by which he chose this victim...

850
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:33,500
Alright, 5 seconds left, VCR.

851
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,640
Three, two, one.

852
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,600
Cue!

853
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,630
   

854
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:41,370
   

855
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:45,130
   

856
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:47,760
   

857
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,050
I am Sherlock Hong Ju, PD Choi Hong Ju.

858
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:55,610
Sherlock Hong Ju had planned to air a story about the current state of illegal diet drugs, according to the last week's preview.

859
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:58,920
But today, we will air an emergency live broadcast.

860
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:04,380
I am sure that you already know about the phone conversation with the serial killer that made news throughout the nation.

861
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:08,940
 The culprit demanded a program be broadcast by using a child's life as collateral. 

862
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:14,490
 Many were opposed to this, and we also planned to not air this broadcast. 

863
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:17,910
 But we received a desperate plea from Han Kook's mother 

864
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:21,910
 and we could not ignore her plea. 

865
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:28,410
 So we decided to participate in his show. 

866
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:33,200
This is Detective Go Mu Chi, the lead detective of this case, whom he had chosen.

867
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:07,730
It looks like it's been 3 or 4 days since he passed away.

868
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:27,820
The 28th.

869
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:32,880
If it was 8:10 p.m. on the 28th,

870
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,480
that was when Sunbae Go was holding the investigation briefing.

871
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,360
So did he kill Kim Joon Sung

872
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,910
and call Sunbae Go from here?

873
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:53,260
Let me ask you directly, Detective Go Mu Chi. Did you find the answer?

874
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:56,910
Can Han Kook be saved?

875
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:00,550
 Let me ask you again. 

876
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:04,540
Did you find the answer?

877
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:07,820
I did.

878
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:20,480
So why did the culprit select those victims?

879
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,150
Before I say the answer, there is something I must confirm.

880
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,150
You're watching now, aren't you?

881
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:37,140
 You asked me to say why you selected these victims, didn't you? 

882
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:44,390
If you want to hear it, whether you really are the one who called and asked me to do a broadcast,

883
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:47,940
and whether Han Kook is alive, you must prove those two things.

884
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:51,870
 That will make the game fair, won't it? 

885
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,220
 You know my number, don't you? 

886
01:11:55,220 --> 01:12:00,930
Then I will tell you accurately why you killed those people.

887
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:56,700
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 🐭  The Mouseketeers 🐭 @Viki.com 

888
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:04,930
   

889
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:07,800
 My only purpose for doing this broadcast is to save Han Kook. 

890
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:11,110
 This broadcast is currently the only way Han Kook can be saved. 

891
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:15,840
 I've just been informed that an item was just delivered to the studio that is presumed to be sent by the culprit. 

892
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,650
 We request that minors and those who have health conditions avoid viewing this program. 

893
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:22,430
 Na Chi Kook... Na Chi Kook... 

894
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:24,560
 It's not Na Chi Kook. 

895
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,290
 I found the commonality among the victims. 

896
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:28,940
 So stop and reveal yourself, you bastard. 

897
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:31,100
   

898
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,560
 Never mind a god, you are not even a human being. 

899
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,740
 You are a monster who can never be saved. 

900
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:38,350
 We received information that Han Kook was seen. 

901
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,670
 Let me go. Let me go! 

902
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:41,980
 Turn that off right now, you crazy bastard! 

903
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:44,680
 It's upsetting that you can't trust me. 

904
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:47,920
 How about it? Will you trust me now?
