1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:11,960


2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,190
   

3
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,790
   

4
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,890
 Aish. 

5
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,940
 I needed an offspring. 

6
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,810
 A second generation of Han Seo Joon. 

7
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,190
 If this child becomes like Han Seo Joon... 

8
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,490
 No. No! 

9
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,800
 In the end, 

10
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,540
 I decided to give birth. 

11
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,750
 I'm scared. 

12
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,480
  I saw a monster.  

13
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,070
 What if my child 

14
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,190
 becomes a monster like that child. 

15
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,940
 What should I do? 

16
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,110
   

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,780
   

18
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,470
Who is this?

19
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,000
Where is that child? Where is the child?

20
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,050
Who?

21
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,810
That detective has your grandchild.

22
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,410
He said if you don't hand his daughter over, he'll kill the child.

23
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,830
Where is she? Hurry and tell me!

24
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,560
Grandchild?

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,750
How do I have a grandchild? You said you killed our blessing.

26
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,820
After you gave birth, you killed him with your own hands.

27
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,870
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

28
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,780
Please. He said he'll kill our Yo Han's child.

29
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,800
Tell him to do whatever.

30
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Whether he kills him or not.

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,660
Don't be like this. Don't be like this. Please.

32
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,870
Please. Please tell me where she is.

33
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,020
He's your bloodline.

34
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,390
Bloodline, you say?

35
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,090
He's a child that isn't related to me.

36
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,790
What?

37
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,880
 The whole country wants this. 

38
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,500
 Please save him. Jung Ba Reum. 

39
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,870
 My hands are slowly getting stiff. 

40
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,720
 This is the music I enjoyed listening to before our blessing was born. 

41
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,390
 I need to check. 

42
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,190
 Tell the Chief that I changed my mind. 

43
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,230
Just a moment.

44
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,790
 I'm sorry, Yo Han. 

45
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,800
How betrayed you must feel.

46
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,320
I made you grow up as that monster's child.

47
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,700
If I didn't make that decision back then.

48
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,140
You and your family would've lived happily.

49
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,610
 You dare fool me? A wench like you? 

50
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,040
Jung Ba Reum. I should've killed him with my own hands.

51
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,790
That monster is my child? I'm a crazy wench.

52
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,460
 As expected, 

53
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,140
 it was Jung Ba Reum. 

54
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,020
 Then I need to save him. 

55
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,880
 Han Seo Joon's 2nd generation. 

56
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,220
We need a live brain.

57
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,020
What are you talking about? What do you mean a live brain. You didn't say that before.

58
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,390
Also, where can we get a live brain?

59
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,420
There is one.

60
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,660
Seong Yo Han's brain.

61
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,780
What?

62
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,280
Seong Yo Han's vitals are back to normal.

63
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,880
He's recovering right now.

64
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,770
How many people in the world

65
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,200
expect Seong Yo Han to survive?

66
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,100
Even so, he's your son.

67
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,130
Shouldn't I do something good?

68
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,070
Our Yo Han would want to atone, even if it's like this.

69
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,870
Even so, how could you...

70
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,100
Then let's give up on this surgery.

71
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,100
Excuse me. Wait a moment.

72
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,040
Living... A living child.

73
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,700
You took his brain out?

74
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,810
Our Yo Han...

75
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,340
You didn't know? While pretending to be a terrible mother,

76
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,700
you didn't even notice that?

77
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,160
Then.

78
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,570
HEY!

79
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,870
You killer!

80
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,490
Save my son. Save my son!

81
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,330
What's the matter? I saved your son.

82
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,570
Jung Ba Reum.

83
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,320
This is in return for what you did to me.

84
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,060
Sung Ji Eun, you're the one who killed Seong Yo Han.

85
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,600
Let go! Let go of me!

86
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,440
Before Na Chi Kook's accident, you drew all the prisoner's blood because of an AIDS patient, right?

87
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,540
Yes. But what about that?

88
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,310
The day Seong Yo Han came here, the blood drawn was here, right?

89
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,270
Wait a moment.

90
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,750
Guard Na's accident date...

91
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,470
Ah, yes. The next day we moved the blood to the inspection center.

92
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,080
Was there any problem with Han Seo Joon's blood?

93
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,470
Han Seo Joon?

94
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,570
Ah. Wait a moment.

95
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,000
I was notified by the inspection center there was contaminated blood that wasn't testable.

96
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,120
Han Seo Joon is on that list.

97
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,910
What does it mean by impossible to inspect?

98
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,600
Well, it can be contaminated by foreign substances or the blood amount is too small.

99
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,380
You left this room the day Seong Yo Han was here, right?

100
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,340
Yes. There was an emergency situation so I had to leave.

101
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,790
  He came to get Han Seo Joon's blood?  

102
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,900
Seong Yo Han isn't Han Seo Joon's child. 
    

103
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,510
Then what is this?

104
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,980
He brought a hair strain and asked to see if it matches the blood.

105
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,380
   

106
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,820
 Don't cry, Oppa. Don't cry, Oppa. 

107
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:30,090
 Jae Hee, it's only the two of us in this world. 

108
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,400
 Huh? 

109
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,710
 You're the only family I have 

110
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,310
 left in the world, Jae Hee. 

111
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,090
 In this world, 

112
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,050
 there are only the two of us. 

113
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,950
 Oppa has something to do. 

114
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,880
 Once I finish it, I'll come for you. 

115
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,120
 Oppa and Jae Hee, let us both live a happy life. 

116
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,830
 I really hope 

117
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,030
 your essence is not devoured by Yo Han's. 

118
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,040
 I am... 

119
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,330
 I am Han Seo Joon's son. 

120
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,950
 Han Seo Joon knew I was his son. 

121
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,180
 So in order to save me, he– 

122
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,910
 Did you put that bastard Seong Yo Han's brain in here? 

123
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,640
 You need to be kind and 

124
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,070
 live well. My baby. 

125
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,380
 She must have seen it. 

126
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,400
 My poor Bong Yi. What to do? 

127
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,470
You dumped me. Why the heck are you hugging me?

128
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,280
Why did you come here?

129
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:25,690
Mu Chi Ahjussi knows you killed Kang Duk Su.

130
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,620
I think he noticed it. I came to tell you this.

131
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,450
I told him myself.

132
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,130
Really?

133
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,090
Then I came for nothing. I came to tell you this.

134
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,290
I'll be going then.

135
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,410
No, it's not.

136
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,440
He must not be the only person who has a scar on his arm.

137
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,260
It's not him, it won't be him.

138
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,590
It's not...

139
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,890
 I saw a monster. 

140
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:07,220
 I saw it pushing his own mother out of the window. 

141
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,840
 And I couldn't say anything. 

142
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,710
 I couldn't even report it to the police. 

143
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,870
 So before a tragedy like this occurs, 

144
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,720
 we must end it with our own hands. 

145
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,200
 What do you mean? 

146
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,230
 Have a strong heart.
 (T/N: Be prepared.) 

147
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,790
 Watch him closely. 

148
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,490
 If you think he can turn into a monster, 

149
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,660
 kill him. 

150
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,680
 My baby... 

151
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,930
 Please, take good care of him. 

152
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,470
Seong Yo Han!

153
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,030
- Hello. 
 - Oh, aigo!

154
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,360
   

155
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,760
Was the baby found?

156
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,030
What? What do you...

157
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,160
Is there– Is there any missing person report for a baby?

158
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,760
- A missing person report? 
 - Yes.

159
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,190
There isn't. But yesterday, there was a traffic accident when a woman was holding a baby.

160
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,720
By any chance, can I see the CCTV footage?

161
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,950
Here. Please, zoom in.

162
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,710
   

163
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,430
And the baby?

164
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,760
You don't need to worry. There were no injuries.

165
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,230
 However the child's guardian is in critical condition. 

166
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,790
 She was worse injured while trying to protect the child. 

167
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:34,140
Mom... Mom.

168
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,720
I'm sorry.

169
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,630
I'm sorry, mom.

170
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:03,620
Mom, are you listening?

171
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,090
Mom...

172
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,930
Mom, I'm really sorry. I am.

173
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,930
I left Hyun Seok alone.

174
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,560
I was scared.

175
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,820
Because of me, because of me he was–

176
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,460
I didn't have the confidence to see you and dad.

177
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,200
I missed you so much.

178
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,730
Mom.

179
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,380
Mom.

180
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,570
   

181
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,860
Hello?

182
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,100
I'm sorry, Eun Chong's mom.

183
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,930
He took... He took the child.

184
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,700
Who?

185
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,270
What?

186
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,570
Dad... Don't, don't!

187
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,300
Eun Chong...

188
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,000
Are you the child's mother?

189
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,330
Yes.

190
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,040
I apologize.

191
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,630
My wife is really sick.

192
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,260
That's why she took the baby.

193
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,500
I'm really sorry.

194
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,840
If you want punishment,

195
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,470
I'll take it for her.

196
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,890
Eun Chong...

197
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,370
 Dad... 

198
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,740
Eun Chong.

199
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,010
Seong Yo Han came to get Han Seo Joon's blood. Not to kill Na Chi Kook.

200
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,300
If it's not Seong Yo Han...

201
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,540
 We whined together and carried it to the front of the concert hall. 

202
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,980
How could you move the magic box to the concert hall?

203
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,070
An unconscious, slouchy adult man.

204
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,180
 There we talked about this and that and said goodbye. 

205
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,710
If the magic box was here in the first place...

206
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,780
 I saw Chi Kook leave and brought the box inside. 

207
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,830
What if he was put inside the box and was dragged from here?

208
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,030
 There is a diagonal mirror in here. 

209
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,740
 So have a person go inside the space behind the mirror... 

210
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,630
- Everything is Jung Ba Reum's statement. 
  - As soon as I entered, I put it here in this corner... 

211
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,230
What if Jung Ba Reum was lying to me?

212
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,660
 Ah, we did leave the box unattended while we were having lunch. 

213
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,970
Why would Jung Ba Reum lie? He has no reason to lie.

214
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,310
 To Chi Kook, I... 

215
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,070
What if it was Jung Ba Reum who did it?

216
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,420
 Kim Joon Sung said he dug into the Finance Team 3. 

217
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,750
   

218
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,100
Finance Team 3? There are only two teams.

219
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,550
What?

220
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,010
What are you doing? It doesn't suit you.

221
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,090
Then what should I do? Chief said he'll do something if he sees me.

222
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,120
I'm banned from going 100 meters near Mujin.

223
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,800
Then why did you do that to him?

224
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,890
But...

225
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,280
It's not Officer Jung, right?

226
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,800
Even from a psychological point of view, Officer Jung is...

227
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,950
Ah, that can't be the case.

228
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,810
Hey, about that.

229
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,430
Never mind.

230
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,700
What? Not saying it, I dislike this the most.

231
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,500
- Hey, be quiet. Did you bring it? 
 - I didn't bring it.

232
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,070
You know, right? It's illegal to take the evidence outside.

233
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,100
My dad's presidential election is the day after tomorrow. Well, it's already done.

234
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,480
 The cut of the sole is the same. 

235
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,970
 The size is the same. 

236
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,710
   

237
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,370
   

238
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,080
Resignation? And through the mail?

239
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,060
- This rude bastard, until the very end... 
 - Mu Chi caused a scene

240
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,060
and Detective Lee resigned too.

241
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,330
I think we need to look into Jung Ba Reum properly.

242
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,030
Quietly, before and after the time of the accident of Kang Duk Su, Lee Jae Sik, and Kim Byeong Tae,

243
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,250
check Jung Ba Reum's every move and what he did every second.

244
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,750
Okay.

245
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,370
I really miss him.

246
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,770
I really missed Yo Han's child.

247
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,100
I'm sorry.

248
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,170
You know, right?

249
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,540
What kind of pain your son lived through.

250
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,320
The fact that he was Han Seo Joon's son,

251
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,310
you know he tried to commit suicide, right?

252
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,690
 Also, there is something you need to know. 

253
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,100
 What is it? 

254
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,110
 Han Seo Joon's son is Jung Ba Reum. 

255
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:39,840
 - What are you talking about? 
 - The garnet that my mom made herself, 

256
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,420
 Jung Ba Reum was wearing it. 

257
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,540
But how...

258
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,480
 Maybe the moms... 

259
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,400
You just watched Yo Han live in pain.

260
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,610
With your mouth shut.

261
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,110
I won't be like you.

262
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,850
I won't let my child

263
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,060
live as a falsely accused murderer child.

264
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,210
I'm going to turn things back

265
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,060
with my own hand.

266
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,020
When you left that day, I was disappointed.

267
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,010
I am happy to see you again.

268
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,300
Ah, what happened to your child?

269
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,530
Did your father kill him?

270
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,930
My father is different from a monster like you.

271
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:56,550
I'm disappointed. I guess your dad is very different from you.

272
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:02,180
Well, if you nitpick, you're on my side.

273
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,950
 Hyun Soo, you go first. 

274
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,000
 - Hurry. 
 - I don't want to. I can't leave you. 

275
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,960
 This might be your last chance. 

276
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,920
 Unnie will follow you quickly. You trust me, right? 

277
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,970
 In case we are caught again, 

278
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,340
 let's leave this here. 

279
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,620
You managed to get out.

280
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,250
I thought you were trapped there and starved to death.

281
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,040
   

282
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,700
 - I didn't do it. 
 - The fact that the victim's head came out of Musan, 

283
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,970
 what do you think about it? 

284
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,360
You... That day, you should've killed me.

285
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,820
If that was  the case, Go Mu Chi wouldn't want revenge and your child right now

286
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,700
wouldn't be a child without a father.

287
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,870
Aren't you curious why I visited you?

288
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,140
Han Seo Joon.

289
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,300
I'm going to kill you

290
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,870
in the worst way.

291
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,750
How?

292
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:02,830
Look forward to it. It'll be more than you imagined.

293
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,120
More than I imagine?

294
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,520
 Finance Team 3? There are only two teams. 

295
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,190
 You have a message. 

296
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,820
 Yo Han, it's Joon Sung. About the thing that you asked me to look into. 

297
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,940
 I'm really scared. I think I made a mistake. 

298
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,310
 It's an organization called OZ. 

299
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,870
   

300
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,230
   

301
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,330
   

302
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,460
   

303
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:21,580
No. It can't be.

304
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,530
How could it be Jung Ba Reum?

305
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,060
It's just the same shoe size.

306
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,650
Is there one or two people with the same shoe size?

307
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,030
No.

308
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,070
I just need to find evidence that it's not Oppa.

309
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,110
I'm going to find it.

310
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,480
 Why did they say Seong Yo Han killed my grandma? 

311
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,720
 It's because of a photo. 

312
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,760
 The photo she held onto until the very end. 

313
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,680
 A photo? 

314
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,350
 Grandma took a photo from Seong Yo Han's house. 

315
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,010
 When I checked, it was a photo of Jo Mi Jeong's body. 

316
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,550
Bong Yi!

317
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,240
Ah, it was here.

318
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,070
Go Sunbae must've put it here.

319
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,250
Bong Yi, come in.

320
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,280
What did you say you were looking for?

321
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,050
The picture my grandmother

322
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,410
was holding in her hands on the night she died.

323
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:09,610
Then... Here it is!

324
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,470
Sunbae also spent some time looking at it.

325
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,080
Your grandmother got her hands burned because she was holding this.

326
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:36,720
 - Here. 
 - Because of this. Because grandmother saw this button, 

327
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,150
 he got scared he would be caught. You bastard. 

328
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,540
What? What's wrong?

329
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,370
No, nothing.

330
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,580
I still haven't gotten my grandmother's brooch yet.

331
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,500
Come out! Come out, you monster!

332
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,060
Jung Ba Reum! Jung Ba Reum!

333
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,500
   

334
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,430
 - Did you pick the cat's name? 
 - Yeah. It's Toto. 

335
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:46,770
 It's the name of the dog in "The Wizard of Oz." 

336
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,640
 If you have questions about raising Toto, ask on Nyang Nyang Café's page. 

337
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,990
   

338
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,570
   

339
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,640
   

340
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,200
 Mom went to granny's. Jeju granny. 

341
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,960
   

342
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,460
- Mom! 
 - Yeah, Hoon Seok–

343
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,390
Hyung is here, mom.

344
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,630
Hoon Seok, I have something to talk to your mother about, so let's play later.

345
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,330
Let's play now.

346
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,520
Hoon Seok. Go play at Seung Ho's.

347
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,640
Hmm, I got it.

348
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,920
Hyung, you can't go. You have to play with me later.

349
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:08,260
What are you? Who are you? Huh!

350
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,670
Seung Ho isn't at home.

351
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,550
What's your identity?

352
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:41,550
I am an ex-fencing player of the National University who was recruited.

353
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:47,650
After entering the company through personal interviews, I learned there was a private organization called OZ in there.

354
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:52,840
I applied to it. My first assignment

355
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,100
was to meet you, Jae Hoon.

356
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,530
My predecessor was Song Soo Ho.

357
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,930
But after killing your family by accident when trying to protect you,

358
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:32,010
suffering from guilt, he quit. So I urgently assumed the task.

359
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:36,200
 Are you Jae Hoon? 

360
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,850
 Oh, my poor nephew. What to do? 

361
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,440
 Who are you? 

362
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,050
 I'm your aunt. Your mom's little sister. 

363
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,370
 I was living in the USA so I heard about it late. 

364
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:59,090
 Aunt. My heart hurts so much. 

365
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:06,830
 Don't worry. From now on, you'll live with me. 

366
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:12,610
It was my job to observe and report every and each one of your actions.

367
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:17,790
You even changed my social security number while pretending to transfer me to your family.

368
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,170
 It's so funny. Are you sleepy? 

369
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,990
 - You better go to bed. 
 - Yes. 

370
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,170
 Have a good night. 

371
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,270
 Oh, so fun– 

372
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,440
I was scared so I made you independent early.

373
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,550
Then I got married and had Hoon Seok. However,

374
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:28,010
I could have never imagined you would meet Hoon Seok on the street.

375
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,500
My mom was in critical condition and I was in a hurry.

376
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,290
When I discovered Hoon Seok was at your house,

377
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,900
I was so scared of what you could do to him.

378
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,860
I went to pick Hoon Seok up right away.

379
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,250
 My son is at Jung Ba Reum's house. I'm afraid he'll do something to him. 

380
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,430
 You can't. If you go now, you'll ruin everything. 

381
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:48,590
 Are you crazy? What if he kills my son, huh? 

382
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:53,700
 Let me go! Let go! 

383
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,720
 Why are you here without talking to me first? Huh? 

384
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,100
 Do you know I spent all night looking for you? 

385
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,720
I quit my job that day.

386
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,480
They told me to say I was moving to the USA.

387
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,370
I truly am in 'The Truman Show.' 
  (T/N: Name of a movie.) 

388
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:18,520
When I was chasing Seong Yo Han, they deliberately hit me with a car.

389
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,340
So I didn't meet Seong Yo Han?

390
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,570
They knew Dr. Daniel had talked to Seong Yo Han.

391
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,280
If you met Seong Yo Han and he told you everything,

392
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,050
they feared all their plans would be in vain.

393
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,680
That's why...

394
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,480
Without knowing this, I tried to kill Seong Yo Han...

395
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,340
Even if you didn't try to kill him, even if that detective didn't shoot him,

396
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,260
Seong Yo Han would have died in their hands anyway.

397
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,070
I heard them saying they arrived late.

398
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:53,280
And that they quickly left the scene after Seong Yo Han was shot.

399
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:58,010
How come someone goes this far?

400
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,850
This someone has a strong belief.

401
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:06,720
I also used to believe in that.

402
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,530
Belief?

403
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:41,070
At first, he picks his victims close to where he lives.

404
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:45,050
Then he starts to go further and further away.

405
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,170
Even traveling long distances to commit crimes.

406
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:52,720
Because he gets more confident. At that time, Jung Ba Reum used to live here.

407
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,860
Jung Ba Reum lost his memory after the brain surgery, right?

408
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:01,040
That's why he forgot his memories of being a serial killer.

409
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,580
However, the instincts remained the same.

410
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,540
 Anyway, you changed a lot. It keeps surprising me. 

411
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,140
 Seriously, Officer Jung. Before you hurt your head, 

412
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,430
 should I say, this job doesn't suit your aptitudes? 

413
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:19,160
 But now, it's like you can read the killer's mind. 

414
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,450
What if it really isn't Seong Yo Han...?

415
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:25,000
If it's not Seong Yo Han...?

416
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,730
 Then I killed the wrong person. 

417
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,490
No, no way. It can't be.

418
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,550
Then why Seong Yo Han was trying to kill Jung Ba Reum?

419
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,020
He was a witness to his murder, so he went to kill him!

420
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,870
Why did he go to Jung Ba Reum's house?

421
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,580
 Where is Han Kook? 

422
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:50,100
 Yes, Han Kook. Where is Han Kook, you bastard? 

423
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,170
At that time, Seong Yo Han tried to tell me something.

424
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,780
 What? 

425
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,130
Hwa.

426
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,880
Mi.

427
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,740
Chi.

428
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,950
Hwa-Mi-Chi?

429
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,050
They say it's a girl?

430
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,020
Ah, I really hope it's a girl.

431
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,560
Okay, I will call you back in a little while.

432
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,090
Did you check Jung Ba Reum's whereabouts on the day of the crime?

433
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:27,820
Yes, I confirmed all his alibis.  On the day of Kang Duk Su incident, he was with his little cousin.

434
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,010
As to the other cases, confirming is a bit...  I would think he was at home.

435
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,830
You would think?

436
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,290
Aren't you going to check on them properly?

437
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:38,610
Hurry up and go check on all the CCTVs near Jung Ba Reum's house and comb them through thoroughly.

438
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,020
Yes, Sir.

439
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,700
They installed a CCTV here.

440
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,980
Ah, I think I just need to check that one.

441
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,390
Ah, it's still illegal though.

442
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,940
The primary is not far away.

443
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:09,100
But there seemed to be a big difference in the number of votes with the first place.

444
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,880
Okay, I will just check.

445
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:26,500
Where would he have moved the CCTV video to?

446
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,850
I saw it somewhere before.

447
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,610
   

448
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:11,230
Why?

449
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,070
Why is Kim Joon Sung's notebook at Officer Jung's house?

450
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:23,240
There wasn't a notebook at the crime scene though.

451
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,000
Where did Detective Kang and Team Leader go?

452
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,440
They went to the province in a hurry.

453
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,240
The son of the first eyewitness in the Kang Duk Su's case

454
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,770
died in a car accident but they said something seemed strange.

455
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:40,110
Oh, is that right?

456
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,660
Just a moment.

457
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:47,510
 Your call cannot be completed so it will be forwarded to the voicemail. 

458
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,570
 Your call cannot be completed so it will be forwarded to the voicemail. 

459
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,330
 Your call cannot be completed so it will be forwarded to the voicemail. 

460
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,160
What is going on?

461
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,510
What's with children's books?

462
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,090
   

463
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,970
Yes, this is Detective Shin at the Special Unit.  I need forensic analysis of a notebook.

464
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:37,960
 There is a backlog so I think you will have to wait a while. 

465
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,090
 I will give you a call as soon as I am done. 

466
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,110
Okay, I understand.

467
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,060
   

468
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,030
 Who's there? 

469
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,580
I am with the police.

470
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,030
Ah, yes.

471
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,900
Did anything strange surface when you were tearing down this house?

472
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,940
No, there wasn't.

473
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,770
That guy asked as well.

474
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,800
- Who did? 
 - He was asking if we saw anything here.

475
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,480
He seemed like the owner of the house as well.

476
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,120
Just a moment, please.

477
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,100
Perhaps, was it this person?

478
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,890
Ah, yes, that's right.  Ah, that's right!

479
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:24,530
That "Nation's Son."

480
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:25,820
What did he do here?

481
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:30,220
He stood still here as if he was a bit out of it.

482
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,200
At the basement.

483
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,000
The basement?  There was a basement?

484
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,800
Yes, over that way.

485
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,310
It was a basement with a door that opens upward.

486
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,950
I need an insurance, too, you know.

487
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,030
I kept them for Hoon Seok.

488
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,030
   

489
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:33,380
   

490
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:42,130
 Investigation report prepared by Song Soo Ho in 1995. 

491
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,980
 When Sung Ji Eun was attacked by a robber, 

492
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,420
 his face was exposed while trying to save the unborn baby. 

493
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,670
 Make sure to have that baby. 

494
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:52,310
 Exchanged places with the person in charge of Kim Hee Jeong. 

495
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,800
 Song Soo Ho took charge of Kim Yeong Hee. 

496
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,730
 It is concluded with 100% certainty that Jung Ba Reum is a predator. 

497
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:02,360
 It is tentatively concluded that Seong Yo Han is not a psychopath.  Daily monitoring is to cease. 

498
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,090
 Maintain wiretap, burner phone, and regularly track. It is certain that Jung Ba Reum is a predator, 

499
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:10,580
 but he is strongly controlling the killing instinct.    Requesting a trigger. 

500
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,100
 It is decided that the trigger is the person who killed Jung Ba Reum's family, 

501
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,470
 Song Soo Ho. 

502
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,550
That's why Seong Yo Han...

503
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,970
 I am so scared Jae Hee. 

504
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,750
 I can't trust anyone. 

505
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,360
 Is this the police?  Someone's been stabbed with a knife here. 

506
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,510
 I think it's that genetics professor, Daniel. 

507
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:36,590
 The ones who came were not with the police. 

508
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,060
 You are a reporter, right? 

509
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,080
 I want to give information regarding the case of missing Dr. Daniel. 

510
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,490
 Modu Street, at the Star Forest Café. 

511
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,260
 That's why he went out that day and came alone. 

512
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,760
How long do I have to wait?

513
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,440
 Ah, I am sorry.  I don't think I can do it today. 

514
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,970
 It's taking longer than I thought to finish my work.  Bring it tomorrow. 

515
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:27,400
No, this has to be done right away—

516
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,990
Ah, damn!  Is he looking down on me because he thinks my dad's going to lose the election?

517
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,480
What is it?  I thought you resigned.  What are you doing here?

518
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,440
Uh...

519
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,690
I came to collect my things.

520
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,090
At this hour?

521
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,680
Did you really have to?

522
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:58,810
Then, I will leave you to your work.

523
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,340
Ah, why isn't Sunbae answering his phone?

524
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,700
Yes, Sunbae!  Ah, Da Seul.

525
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,930
It's a girl?

526
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:20,040
What in the world... Okay, I will be home soon.

527
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,930
- Detective Shin! 
 - Uh?

528
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:26,230
Let's have a drink together.  We should at least have a congratulatory drink since I resigned.

529
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:29,300
We would have it at the farewell party.  Let's drink then.  I am going.

530
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,760
Ah, don't be like that.

531
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,640
My wife is waiting.  They say our luck charm is a girl.

532
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,890
When she's born, I will be the one who loves her the most in the world.  I am going.

533
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:40,150
So, I will buy a congratulatory drink.

534
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:44,760
Ah, thanks, but I have to go now.

535
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,450
Please.

536
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:49,550
Ah, why are you like this?  It doesn't suit you.

537
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,980
I am sorry.  Let's drink another time.

538
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,720
He left with it just now.

539
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,510
   

540
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:30,210
Hello.  Can you check what this is?

541
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,720
   

542
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,240
What is with this punk?  Did something happen?

543
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,970
Ah, so cute!

544
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,880
I am sorry.

545
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,320
Who are you, bastard?

546
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:57,560
   

547
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,960
 A shocking event took place in which Detective Shin, the son of the presidential candidate, Shin Seong Min,  
    

548
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,850
 was stabbed to death.  
    

549
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,360
Sang!

550
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,580
Sang! Sang!

551
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,040
- Stop it. 
 - Sang!

552
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,250
Stop.

553
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,660
Sang!

554
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,450
Sang.

555
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,560
Enough.

556
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,280
Sang!

557
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,790
Which bastard was it? Huh?

558
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:29,620
Who the hell was it?

559
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,370
- Calm down. 
 - Stop.

560
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,490
Who was it?

561
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,660
Hey!

562
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,460
 At the site where Detective Shin was attacked, Kang Duk Su, Lee Jae Sik...  
    

563
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:47,140
Kang Duk Su and Lee Jae Sik? It must be that son of a bitch, Jung Ba Reum.

564
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:50,220
 The National Forensic Service will run DNA tests... 

565
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:14,420
Neither the Team Leader nor I could pick up his call.

566
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:17,160
We were in the countryside.

567
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,470
You said Kang Duk Su's things were found, right?

568
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:23,810
From Sang?

569
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:29,470
Kang Duk Su's lighter, Lee Jae Sik's button, and Kim Byeong Tae's earring.

570
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:31,950
 Jung Ba Reum, that son of a bitch! 

571
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:35,110
Sang, said he was going to drop off a laptop. But it isn't here.

572
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:37,810
Not at the scene nor in his car.

573
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,970
CCTV, CCTV.

574
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:43,650
CCTV. CCTV.

575
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:47,040
CCTV. CCTV.

576
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,430
Why isn't Ajusshi picking up his phone?

577
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,340
Ajusshi?

578
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,240
 It's me. Ba Reum. 

579
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,200
 You called me many times. 

580
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,560
Where... Where are you right now?

581
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,000
 I'm heading home. But what's the mat– 

582
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,660
It's because of that.

583
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,340
He died because of that laptop.

584
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,400
Why did Detective Shin even have that?

585
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,370
I told Detective Shin to check the CCTV footage around the area where Jung Ba Reum lives.

586
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:25,010
Jung Ba Reum, you scumbag!

587
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:27,130
It's not Officer Jung.

588
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:30,870
We confirmed that Jung Ba Reum was in Jeju island yesterday during the time of the attack.

589
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,010
He came back this morning.

590
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,670
- Are you sure? 
 - Yeah.

591
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:38,470
There are records of him boarding the flight and he was caught on the CCTV's at the airport.

592
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:40,490
There he is.

593
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:44,470
I called him here because I thought you wouldn't go even if I told you to. Let's treat that hand of yours.

594
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,390
Is my hand the problem here?

595
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,320
Team Leader!

596
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,960
Just get it treated.

597
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,430
It's because you take these pills you can't control your emotions.

598
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,330
Why do you take these pills?

599
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,670
What are those?

600
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:59,670
I picked them up from the floor of the task force office. Isn't it yours?

601
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:04,230
   

602
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:08,430
 In total he'd take twenty minutes. Actually, more than twenty minutes. 

603
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,540
 Twenty minutes isn't enough. 

604
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,540
Isn't this for headaches? Like a painkiller?

605
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:17,710
The label does say painkillers but its contents are completely different.

606
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,470
It's a drug that inhibits serotonin secretion.

607
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:21,500
Serotonin?

608
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:26,030
Serotonin is secreted by the brain to inhibit aggressive tendencies.

609
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:32,070
If you can't release serotonin, you lose control of your emotions and start becoming violent.

610
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:35,030
 Why would Jung Ba Reum take these pills? 

611
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:37,510
- Why are you doing this? 
 - I just have a few questions to ask him.

612
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:40,200
I'm Detective Go Mu Chi from the Mujin police station.

613
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,040
Thank you.

614
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:50,750
The one who prescribed this medicine...

615
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:55,170
I prescribed it to patient Jung Ba Reum.

616
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:56,810
Because he complained of frequent headaches.

617
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,540
Is that so? That's weird.

618
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:03,260
I've heard that, when people take these pills they become aggressive because they can't control their emotions.

619
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,650
That's not possible. I gave him the right prescription.

620
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:10,730
Maybe the patient swapped them?

621
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:12,040
Right?

622
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:17,970
A doctor wouldn't have prescribed this medicine to a patient who complained of a headache after brain surgery, would he?

623
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:19,510
Yes, thank you.

624
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,460
Have a good day.

625
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,740
I forgot to ask you...

626
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,210
Oh, you were on the phone?

627
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,230
I'm done.

628
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:42,100
By the way, is it even possible to  buy this medicine without a doctor's prescription?

629
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,450
Well, I got a call for an emergency patient.

630
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,600
Let's talk about this later.

631
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,190
Yes?

632
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:20,660
No, I didn't call.

633
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,900
What?

634
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,990
Did a cop just come by?

635
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,850
 I'm with the police. I need to ask you some questions. 

636
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:36,320
 The contents of this bottle are different from its label. Who prescribed it? 

637
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,770
 It's patient Jung Ba Reum's medicine. 

638
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:42,690
 This medicine wasn't in the prescription. The director brought it himself. 

639
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:45,600
 We just handed it over. 

640
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,550
 Got it. 

641
01:00:56,090 --> 01:01:00,240
Hyeong, I'll send you a number, check its base station.

642
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,610
 It's a burner phone. It's giving me three base stations. 

643
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:06,000
Three?

644
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,690
Give me the list.

645
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,320
   

646
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:06,350
 Hyeong, keep tracking the location of this phone. 

647
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,280
How come you're here?

648
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:57,590
Not long ago, Doctor Daniel had requested me to kill somebody.

649
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:02,400
 Your next target. 

650
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,810
 You can consider this person to be the worst kind of predator there is out there. 

651
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:09,680
This is the address he gave me.

652
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:30,640
