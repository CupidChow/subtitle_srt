1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440


2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,130
   

3
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,890
   

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,420
 Oh? 

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,360
 Give it. It's mine. 

6
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,940
 If you let this live, you'll live the same life as that snake. 

7
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,050
 Would you like that? 

8
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,550
   

9
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
Hey. What did he say?

10
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,630
What's wrong?

11
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,390
Did something happen inside?

12
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,150
It's not Han Seo Joon.

13
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,400
What?

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,740
It wasn't Han Seo Joon who tied it. The knot.

15
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:21,120
 I have never tied such a knot, learned to tie one nor teach anyone how to. 

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,870
He said that he never taught, learned, or showed anyone.

17
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,510
Hey, do you believe that bastard's lie? So innocent.

18
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,610
I'm sure that Han Seo Joon wasn't the one who tied the knot.

19
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,780
The end of the knot protruding from the rat's head was on the right.

20
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,960
This. This knot was tied from the left.

21
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,010
Was there a seam on the rat's head?

22
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,480
Hey, Guard Kim.

23
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,530
Guard Kim!

24
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,400
Hey! That perverted bastard.

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,730
What the heck did he do to the rat's head?

26
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,890
Look at that. The knot on the right side, right?

27
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,610
No matter what method is used, if the knot is tied by the same person, then the direction of the knot should be the same.

28
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,810
The only records left of Han Seo Joon's surgery procedures are students' class material.

29
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,870
Why are the surgical knots on the right side if Han Seo Joon is left-handed?

30
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,210
There are doctors like this.

31
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,910
There are baseball players who are right-handed but use their left hand to hold the bat.

32
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,850
It's a similar situation to that.

33
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,510
Then it wasn't Han Seo Joon who killed Team Leader Park Doo Suk's daughter.

34
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,310
There are two possible cases. One, Han Seo Joon didn't kill her.

35
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,280
Two, Han Seo Joon did kill her but someone else tied the knot.

36
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,100
An accomplice?

37
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,030
   

38
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,110
   

39
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,820
 Tie him up before he wakes up. 

40
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,850
   

41
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,200
Back then, seeing how there was a dent in the tree.

42
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,260
And seeing the car taillights being broken, he lured her by making it look like he had a car accident.

43
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,840
But, isn't it a little weird?

44
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,670
What is?

45
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,130
The taxi driver testified that he let Song Soo Jung off here.

46
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,910
Back then, there was a public telephone box here.

47
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,010
Song Soo Jung called Song Soo Ho here.

48
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,280
If he dragged her, there is no reason to disguise it as a car accident.

49
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,520
How did he take her to the car accident?

50
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,480
Even if there was an accident, it's not easy to follow someone you don't know at midnight.

51
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,710
That's true. She was by herself and it was snowing a lot.

52
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,660
What if it wasn't Han Seo Joon,

53
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,210
but someone who Song Soo Jung could trust, who brought her here?

54
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,500
As expected, there must have been an accomplice.

55
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,020
Let's go to the police station that reported it.

56
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,430
The dispatch logs may still be there.

57
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,850
   

58
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,000
What is this?

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,920
   

60
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,120
A witness?

61
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,490
There were no investigation records about this.

62
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,580
I didn't think that anyone traveling with a child would go around cutting people's heads off,

63
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,200
so I didn't report it.

64
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,040
A child?

65
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,080
Cars don't really go down this road.

66
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,820
But one car came in swiftly.

67
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,810
I know all the cars in this town, but it was a car I didn't recognize.

68
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,910
It was hard to see the driver's seat because of the light.

69
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,230
But I could see there was a boy in the passenger's seat.

70
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,580
A boy?

71
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,550
 This knot was tied up clumsy. It's like a little kid tied it. 

72
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,350
It looked like he was 10 years old.

73
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,860
Han Seo Joon didn't have a child during that time.

74
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,620
That's true.

75
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,310
There weren't any boys reported as missing during that time. 
    

76
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,350
Is this the list of all missing children nationwide? With no one missing?

77
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,940
Yes.

78
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,310
Did Han Seo Joon really use a child to lure the victim?

79
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,540
If perhaps, that kid grew up to be the next Han Seo Joon...

80
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,910
Just thinking about it is terrifying.

81
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,240
It's still a deduction.

82
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,360
Let's start by looking for a man in his 30's between the two victims.

83
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,700
   

84
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,870
Among the victims' acquaintances, there is no one who comes from an orphanage,

85
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,530
nor men in their 30s who may have helped Han Seo Joon 25 years ago.

86
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:03,070
That's not all. There is no connection between Kang Min Joo and Hong Na Ri's job, workplace nor school.

87
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,300
Ah, I don't understand this.

88
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,600
It's definitely an acquaintance of hers.

89
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,300
- An acquaintance? 
 - Yeah.

90
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,790
Kang Min Joo was caught in the CCTV getting in a car with a smile on her face.

91
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,770
Also, there was no sign of forced intrusion at Hong Na Ri's house, which means she opened the door herself.

92
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,130
It's definitely someone the two of them know.

93
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,500
I don't think so.

94
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,540
It's someone who has no relationship with the victims.

95
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,330
He definitely enjoyed killing them.

96
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,750
If it were me, I would never choose anyone around me.

97
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,320
You know why? You have to enjoy it as long as you can without getting caught.

98
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,950
Look here foolish Officer Jung.

99
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,120
If it were you. If it were you and there is a stranger's car,

100
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,630
would you smile like this and get in the car?

101
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,080
Also, would you let someone in your house if it were someone you had never seen before?

102
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,480
- No, well... 
 - Hey.

103
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,520
There is definitely a connection between the two that we are missing.

104
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,110
Ah, let's start from the beginning.

105
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,990
In a situation like this, you need to start from the beginning.

106
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,440
When you are stuck, you need to start from the beginning.

107
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,390
Huh?

108
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,020
Someone really touched this.

109
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,850
See? I was right.

110
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,920
Who is it?

111
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,880
 She was reinstated one month ago.  
    

112
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,310
 She is on standby here. 

113
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,810
   

114
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,790
   

115
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,230
   

116
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,110
Why do you have this?

117
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,920
You look healthy.

118
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,280
It's good to see you Officer Jung.

119
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,320
 Why am I suddenly feeling this tingle? 

120
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,070
I am sorry.  I didn't mean to lie to you.

121
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,030
Don't you know what happens if you tamper with police evidence?

122
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,040
It's all been captured on the CCTV, so don't think about lying.

123
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,650
I saw the wound on Hong Na Ri's wrist at the crime scene.

124
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,700
There was evidence of her having been tied up with something, so I went to Hong Na Ri's house to check on it.

125
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,890
I overheard you talking with Officer Jung there.

126
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,590
 The murder pattern this time is different than Kang Min Joo's. 

127
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,690
 In Kang Min Joo's case, the location of kidnapping, killing, and the location where the body was abandoned were all different. 

128
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,200
That's why I wanted to check on Kang Min Joo's knot.

129
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,700
Why are you checking on that?

130
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,000
Please drink.

131
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,920
Does it have something to do with that? 
    

132
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,970
That's right.

133
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,260
Whether or not the knot found on Kang Min Joo's and Hong Na Ri's hands

134
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,660
were perhaps the same as the knot found on the remains of the head hunter case lead detective's daughter,

135
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,580
- I wanted to check on it. 
 - How did you know that?

136
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,100
I am asking you how did you know that the knot on Kang Min Joo, Hong Na Ri, and Park Hyun Seok were the same?

137
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,080
While I was preparing for a documentary on execution, I remember seeing that knot tied on that child's remains in the Head Hunter case archive.

138
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,200
Since the knot was so unique, I still remember it.

139
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,730
And I recently saw the same knot, so I was investigating.

140
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,260
Stop lying.

141
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,750
The fact that Kang Min Joo was bound was released to the press, but not the type of knot.

142
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,370
So how did you know?

143
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,640
You are not going to be straight with me?

144
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,120
It's not the knot on Kang Min Joo that I saw.

145
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,610
- Kang Min Joo may not be the first kill. 
  - Oh, so cute. 
   

146
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,100
The killing may have started a month before.

147
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,390
 That's right!  That's right! 

148
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:57,450
As soon as I returned to work, a lady came looking for me, saying that she thinks her daughter had been murdered.

149
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,730
Uh? Hello.

150
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,220
The police thought it was a simple runaway case.

151
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,040
- Simple runaway? 
 - Yes.

152
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,980
Even though the companion dog was dead and hanging?

153
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,570
They say Kim Young Hee was suffering from severe depression.

154
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,700
So the police thought that when her depression got much worse, Kim Young Hee killed her companion dog and disappeared.

155
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,300
They just filed a runaway report and closed the investigation.

156
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,390
They saw it as a simple runaway case even with the knot?

157
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,140
It wasn't here.

158
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,010
I've confirmed that a cart that was at the park on the day of the incident went missing.

159
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,010
The culprit probably didn't realize it.

160
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,600
That the dog chewed on the knot so it became loose.

161
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:11,060
It fell here.  It's some distance away from the park so the police didn't find it.

162
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,810
If you found it, you should have taken it to the police.

163
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,660
Why do you have it?  Give it to me.

164
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,240
- On one condition. 
 - What?

165
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,490
I want an exclusive on this case.  I want to revive Sherlock Hong Ju.

166
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,730
So, share all investigative information related to this case with me.

167
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,960
- No, I feel uncomfortable around you. 
 - Don't you think I feel the same about you?

168
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:37,490
If I just sit and do noting while waiting to get assigned, I could lose my job.

169
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,900
- What is the real reason? 
 - What?

170
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,820
Don't you think I know you?  You want to catch that punk, right?

171
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,320
Why are you dying to catch that punk?

172
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,580
 By chance, do you know PD Choi Hong Ju? 

173
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,570
Sure, I do.  While you guys were catching Seong Yo Han, we spent a lot of time together at your house.

174
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,530
Do you remember?

175
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,210
By chance...

176
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,970
By chance...?

177
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,670
Ah, just say it. What?

178
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,680
Did I like her?

179
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,050
What?  You?

180
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,360
You have a dark mind, you punk.  But, you shouldn't do that to Bong Yi.

181
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,070
Bong Yi?

182
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,210
Ah, that Oh Bong Yi you often talk about?

183
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,390
Oh Bong Yi?  Look at you.

184
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,050
You remember PD Choi but not Bong Yi?

185
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,000
You shouldn't be like that.

186
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,420
Bong Yi worried so much about you back then.

187
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,640
It's not like I don't want to remember.  What am I supposed to do when I can't remember?

188
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,570
 What could that memory be? 

189
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,030
Ba Reum?

190
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,950
- Ah, Auntie. 
 - What are you looking for?

191
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,470
I was wondering if I have a photo album.  You know, like a  kindergarten photo.

192
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,470
Why that, suddenly?

193
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,990
I thought I could kind of remember some things from when I was young.

194
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,860
Really?  That's great.

195
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,620
I think I might have some at my place.  I'll bring them over the next time.

196
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,860
Ah, really? Then, I would be grateful.

197
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,800
- Ah, Auntie. 
 - Yes?

198
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,920
What is this bird cage?

199
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,690
You were taking care of a bird for a short while before the accident.

200
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,790
Ah... I think I kind of remember.

201
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,180
- But, where is the bird? 
 - You didn't have dinner yet, right?

202
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,910
I made your favorite, extra strong fermented soy bean paste stew.

203
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,560
- What's wrong?  Does it upset your stomach? 
 - Yes.

204
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,900
I will get rid of it.

205
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,970
I am sorry.

206
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:35,090
Anyway, your taste in food changed.  You used to love this stew.

207
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,950
Yes.  Yes, this is Jung Ba Reum.

208
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,610
Ah, the redevelopment office?

209
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,120
So, you are saying that Kim Young Hee, Kang Min Joo, and Hong Na Ri, all these crimes were committed by the same punk, right?

210
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,160
There might be some epithelial tissue, so check with the National Forensic Service.

211
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,090
Okay.

212
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,740
I will catch this bastard.

213
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,290
What trouble are you going to cause catching this bastard?  You belong to the Evidence Storage Team, not  Violent Crimes Team.

214
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,450
You know that I am a Violent Crimes detective through and through.

215
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,500
How long am I going to be stuck in the Evidence Storage Team?

216
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,300
If I want to make it back to the Violent Crimes Team, I need to score something, right? Give me a chance.

217
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,660
I'll catch him and bring him right to you.

218
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,320
Don't look at me like that.

219
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,750
This is... Just until the results are out.

220
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,070
W-What are you doing!

221
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,910
 It will be demolished before the presidential election. 

222
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,780
Hi, Uh Bung!

223
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,160
 Stop! Don't come any closer! 

224
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,740
Oh Bong Yi. Bong Yi!

225
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,730
- Oh Bong Yi! 
 - Oh my God!

226
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,380
I'm sorry!

227
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,220
 Oh, oh, my child! 

228
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,110
 Officer Jung, every now and then 

229
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:22,400
 please check on my girl, Bong Yi. 

230
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,280
 She stopped coming after what happened to her grandmother. 

231
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,090
 It's such a shame. Graduation was coming up so soon. 

232
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,570
   

233
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,490
 I surrender! I surrender! 

234
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,460
 Do you want to marry me, Bong Yi? 

235
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,770
 When you graduate, come be my bride. 

236
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,960
 Where are you, Oh Bong Yi? 

237
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,300
You're okay.

238
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,560
It must've been hard for you.

239
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,930
But for you to have your babies, you'll need a cozy place.

240
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,510
Just wait! I'll make a pretty home for you!

241
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,790
Wait just a little longer. I'll be done in a minute.

242
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,820
Huh?

243
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,820
Why did you page me at the break of dawn?

244
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,380
- That. 
 - What about that?

245
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,740
These were the pictures I took at Kim Yeong Hee and Kang Min Joo's house last night.

246
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,520
The house and neighborhood are quite run down, right?

247
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,600
There's mold on the walls and there are cracks everywhere.

248
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,510
- So what? 
 - So this...

249
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,670
Don't the window guards look too new here?

250
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,690
You're right...

251
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,220
These are newly installed too.

252
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,150
The worker who replaced these guards...

253
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,970
Which is how they could conveniently escape without suspicion, and they didn't need an alibi.

254
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,870
This model was provided by a contract from the city.

255
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,620
They were replaced as a result of a campaign for single women who lived in high-crime areas.

256
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,260
- Who installed these for you? 
 - Volunteers.

257
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,390
It was a campaign with members of the Korea Security Association.

258
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,710
Ah, excuse me. Are you raising that dog here?

259
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,450
Yes. It's an abandoned dog. The volunteers take turns taking care of it.

260
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,750
Detective. The late Kim Young Hee's dog was also white, right?

261
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,720
Oh.

262
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,440
Yes, Team Leader. The dog fur on Kim Young Hee's hairband,

263
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,330
could you check if there was fur of another breed?

264
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,610
Do you know who installed the window guards?

265
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,940
Lots of people came to volunteer because it was a temporary event,

266
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,690
so it wasn't recorded one by one.

267
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,840
We have a lot of well-known volunteers like corporate representatives. 
    

268
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,180
How can we find out where that is if you take such tight shots.

269
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,510
Do you have the original copy of this photo?

270
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,310
- This is what? 
 - This is Hong Na Ri's house.

271
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,580
- How do you know? 
 - Here. This.

272
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,670
There was a cabinet on Hong Na Ri's neighbor's veranda. The sticker stuck on the cabinet was a turtle sticker.

273
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,210
Hey, how did you know this?

274
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,950
When we came here, I saw the sticker on the way out.

275
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,420
- You remembered this? 
 - Yes.

276
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,360
Did you become a genius after brain surgery?

277
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,240
I know, right? Dong Koo said I wasn't that smart before the surgery.

278
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,880
Yes.

279
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,910
   

280
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:44,980
 This is OBN's PD Choi Hong Ju, who is preparing a documentary on crime against women. 

281
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,750
My daughter is in college and living there. Thinking about my daughter. 
    

282
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,180
Five daughters. Sometimes there are crimes against women on the news. It feels like it could be my story. 
    

283
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,800
I participated because I thought of my daughter. 
    

284
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,070
Isn't she cute? They said it's a girl. Now that I'm becoming a dad,

285
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,090
I participated because I wanted to be a little bit of help 
    

286
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,300
to a world where all daughters of this world can live safely.

287
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,280
Thank you for participating. We prepared a small gift.

288
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,300
Aigo. You didn't have to.

289
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,770
Two of them re-tied the knot to the left. Jung Man Ho. Kim Baek Gi.

290
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,930
- I think it's Jung Man Ho. His expression. 
  - I thought of my daughter. 

291
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:22,010
- Jung, you don't have a daughter. 
 - He lied, too.

292
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,540
Why? What are you thinking about?

293
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,320
- That guy brutally killed Kim Yeong Hee's dog. 
 - And?

294
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,760
- Thank you. 
 - Ah, excuse me.

295
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,770
Can we do an additional interview? Kim Baek Gi. Jung Man Ho.

296
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,210
- Yes, I understand. 
 - Also Woo Hyeong Cheol.

297
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,000
- What is it that you need? 
 - Ah.

298
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,950
Could you please wait here? We are setting up the camera.

299
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,720
Aigo. How cute.

300
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,120
- Yes? 
 - They will come soon. Please sit down and wait.

301
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,980
Is it Jung Man Ho? It appears like he doesn't like dogs.

302
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,450
No, it's not.

303
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,670
- Woo Hyeong Cheol? 
 - I am sure of it. Look at this.

304
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,900
Kim Baek Gi, Jung Man Ho, and all the other volunteers' gestures are the same.

305
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,040
But, Woo Hyeong Cheol's gestures are bigger and more exaggerated than normal.

306
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,900
Especially this part. "...because I wanted to be a little help to a world where all the daughters can be safe."

307
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,170
His hand movements are big as if he is acting when he says this.

308
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,670
It's as if he's trying to explain something he doesn't understand.

309
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,820
How can we make a judgment just from someone's hand movements?

310
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,120
I thought the same so I double checked.  Can we do an additional interview? 

311
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,110
I pet the dog exactly the same way in front of the volunteers.

312
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:41,180
I pet the dog on both sides of the neck, on the side, and even swept under the tail.

313
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,750
Jung Man Ho showed that he was uncomfortable petting  the dog.

314
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,530
Kim Baek Gi and Woo Hyeong Cheol seemed to pet the dog affectionately.

315
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:53,720
But Kim Baek Gi pet the dog on both sides of the neck, on the side, and behind the ears.

316
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,370
Woo Hyeong Cheol pet precisely both sides of the neck and below the tail.

317
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:03,910
- What about that? 
 - Since most dogs don't like to be petted under their tail,

318
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,900
people who really like dogs wouldn't pet them under their tails.

319
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,000
- But why did Woo Hyeong Cheol pet below the tail... 
 - It was because of me.

320
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,950
I pet the dog under the tail right in front of him

321
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,980
Woo Hyeong Cheol saw me pet the dog under the tail.

322
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,040
He pets the dog the exact same way, even following the same order.

323
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,980
He did exactly what I did.

324
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,760
It wasn't because he really likes dogs.

325
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:31,490
He purposely pets the dog under the tail to show me, a police officer, that he likes dogs.

326
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,090
I'm sure it's Woo Hyeong Cheol.

327
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,020
What about the knot? He definitely finished the knot towards the right.

328
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,860
He already knew that this interview was fake.

329
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:45,390
That's why instead of tying the knot like usual, he tied it differently. Here, look at this.

330
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,370
This is a broadcast with Woo Hyeong Cheol. 
    

331
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,870
Here. He's holding the pen with his left hand.

332
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,650
He is left-handed.

333
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,250
So you're saying he untied the knot with his right hand, to make it look like he's right-handed.

334
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,000
Hey, but. Did you study about psychopaths or something?

335
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,660
How are you so sure about all this?

336
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,000
I just... I can just tell.

337
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,180
Again, again. You're saying you just know. Did you visit a psychopath's mind or something?

338
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,230
I saw that you were released on the news.

339
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,600
It's all because of you, Mr. Lawyer. I'm very thankful.

340
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,780
What do you mean thanks to me? I resigned as soon as I found out what kind of person you were.

341
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:53,230
If you had done it until the end, I would have been able to come out faster.

342
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:58,320
What is the reason you came to see me?

343
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,220
That child... I was wondering if you know where she is.

344
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,350
That child? No way–

345
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:11,170
Ah, don't misunderstand. I want to meet them in person to kneel and apologize.

346
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,810
My lawyer would never tell me.

347
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,210
I really want to apologize–

348
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:21,510
I do not know. I got rid of all the related documents when I resigned from representing you.

349
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,530
Even if I knew where they live, I can never tell you.

350
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,610
I guess there's nothing I can do.

351
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,870
I can't go around looking for her because I have this on my leg.

352
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:37,650
It's a shame, but I guess I should give up looking for her.

353
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,610
Who is that person?

354
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,050
Father, you're here?

355
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:58,600
Yes, Team Leader? Did you confirm the dog fur on Kim Young Hee's hairband?

356
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,920
 Yeah. It's not one type, but two types. 

357
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,210
Oh, it's two types? Yes.

358
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,080
There are two type's of fur.

359
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,380
   

360
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,950
 "Psychopaths use a lot of hand gestures when describing abstract and emotional content such as family relationships." 

361
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,520
 His hand movements are big as if he is participating in a play. 

362
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,400
He's especially using a lot of gestures.

363
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,370
 It's as if he's trying to explain something he doesn't understand. 

364
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,700
But, that's not something you learn from studying.

365
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,460
Ah, Jung Ba Reum. Who is this punk?

366
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,070
Aigo, I'm tired.

367
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,910
Hey, Parachute. If you're not busy tomorrow, help me out.

368
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,960
- Hey, Officer Jung. Do you want to join our team? 
 - Yes?

369
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,320
- Me? 
 - Officer Jung?

370
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,220
It seems like you have a good sense as a detective.

371
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,140
Don't waste your talent at that village police station.

372
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,120
Check and see if this fur matches the fur from Kim Young Hee's hairband.

373
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,160
Also, find out what Jung Man Ho and Woo Hyeong Cheol did on the day of Kang Min Joo and Hong Na Ri's deaths and when Kim Yeong Hee went missing.

374
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,160
But, Officer Jung is still unwell.

375
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,020
- It will be hard to work with you, Sunbae. 
 - I would love it.

376
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,600
Does that mean you will call me Detective Jung and not Officer Jung?

377
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,070
- It's going to be– 
 - Yeah, Detective Jung come here.

378
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:31,760
Lawyer Woo? Yes, he would walk my dog often.

379
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,980
Then, do you take your car with you when you go to volunteer? Do you have any logs?

380
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,530
- Of course. 
 - In that case...

381
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,260
Could I see the logs for March 8th?

382
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,820
   

383
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,580
- Feel free to contact me any time. 
 - Yes.

384
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,080
- Get back safely. Fighting! 
 - Yes.

385
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,870
Come this way.

386
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,880
- Sit down. 
 - Excuse me. Who is that?

387
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,570
Lawyer Woo is providing free counseling for teenagers who run away.

388
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,880
Your wife is very beautiful.

389
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,810
It seems like you left your wife and went somewhere nice?

390
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,040
I didn't know you were a detective. But what brings you here?

391
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:34,120
Ah, on March 8th, there is a record that you took the volunteer car. Where did you go to volunteer?

392
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,400
 He came that day to install window guards. 

393
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,220
 He is a lawyer who comes out on TV often, so I definitely remember him. 

394
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,480
Yes, Sunbae. I confirmed it and he has an alibi.

395
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,590
- Are you sure? 
  - What did I tell you? Officer Jung is still unwell. 

396
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,260
So you're saying it's certain that Woo Hyeong Cheol has an alibi.

397
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,360
 That's why. Sunbae, you didn't listen to me. 

398
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,400
Okay. Then confirm Kim Baek Gi and Jung Man Ho's alibis for that day.

399
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,390
Detective. Woo Hyeong Cheol is definitely the culprit.

400
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,850
Definite, my butt. Damn, it  was just a coincidence.

401
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,090
Go and call all the people on the list of those who applied for the window guards.

402
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:13,440
Since there can be other victims like Kim Yeong Hee, Hong Na Ri, and Kang Min Joo.

403
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,830
I'll make the phone calls.

404
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,190
So, you confirmed this person?

405
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:29,150
Yes, it looked like the cheek was torn a bit and there was a scar.

406
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,200
- How did it go? 
 - I was going to call you about it.

407
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,150
You know that dog fur from that dog house? It's different from the hair from Kim Yeong Hee's hairband?

408
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:49,060
Ah, what is this? We were completely off.

409
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:54,040
- Okay. 
 - Yes. Sunbae!

410
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:00,280
They say that at the time of Hong Na Ri's time of murder, Jung Man Ho's cellphone location was nearby Hong Na Ri's house.

411
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,020
- Jung Man Ho? 
 - I'm telling you that it wasn't me!

412
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,820
Then why were you in Hong Na Ri's neighborhood at the time of her murder?

413
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,360
My friend's carpentry is in that neighborhood. For my close Hyungnim's birthday present,

414
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,750
I went there to make a toolbox.

415
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,960
Is there anyone who can testify for you?

416
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,030
That day, the carpentry shop was closed.

417
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,240
Aigo, you were alone that day of all days.

418
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,270
This is driving me crazy.

419
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:27,240
That's right. I took a picture of the finished toolbox and sent it to my Hyungnim.

420
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,330
Show me the picture that you sent.

421
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,330
I deleted it.

422
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,560
Aigo, so you just happened to run out of storage, too.

423
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,260
I'm telling the truth!

424
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,950
What is that, fo-o-forensic, or something. Try that!

425
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:45,330
Then contact your Hyungnim. He must still have the picture.

426
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:51,160
Ah yes. Is Jae Pil Hyeongnim input as Hyeong Cheol's father?

427
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,540
Jae Pil? Is it Woo Jae Pil?

428
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,930
Huh? You must know him.

429
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,730
Ah, that's right. He used to be a detective on the Gu Ryeong Homicide Team.

430
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,240
   

431
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,070
He's not picking up.

432
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,460
Is anyone home?

433
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,400
Is anyone home?

434
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,970
Is anyone home?

435
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,840
Yes, Team Leader. Can you put Jung Man Ho on the phone?

436
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,810
Answer the phone.

437
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,410
Ah, yes.

438
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,420
It's true, right? Jae Pil Hyungnim has a picture of the toolbox I sent him, right?

439
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,070
No, did Woo Jae Pil volunteer to install the security window, too?

440
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,490
He wasn't on the list.

441
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,820
No. He followed Hyeong Cheol around on days he wasn't moving,

442
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,530
but he isn't a formal volunteer.

443
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,460
He... He followed him?

444
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,450
Who took the picture in front of the Morningstar Villa?

445
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,190
 Jae Pil Hyungnim took it. 

446
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,010
 Hyungnim always took the pictures. 

447
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,750
 2, 3. That's good. 

448
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,720
 Should we take one standing up? 

449
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,460
It wasn't the son, but the father.

450
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,300
That means there was nothing strange happened.
    

451
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,610
Was there a suspicious person by any chance?

452
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,530
I understand.

453
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,770
Oh Bong Yi?

454
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,720
   

455
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,580
Bong Yi! Bong Yi?

456
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,840
 Bong Yi. I am Ba Reum. 

457
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,540
 Give me a call. 

458
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,480
There's no streetlights or CCTV.

459
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,400
It's dangerous.

460
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,410
That bastard.

461
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,650
Stop there, you bastard!

462
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,850
Hey, be quiet you punk! Do I look like a thief?

463
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,230
Stop barking! Let me think.

464
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,690
It's a white dog?

465
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,470
Wh-What is that?

466
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,970
Bong Yi.

467
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,090
Woo Jae Pil.

468
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,670
Did you kill that woman?

469
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,680
Did you kill Team Leader Park's daughter, Park Hyun Soo?

470
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,180
Yeah.

471
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,980
Why did you kill her?

472
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,660
Tell me.

473
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,180
Let go, you bastard.

474
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,570
- Tell me, you bastard. 
 - Calm down, Detective Go.

475
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,880
- Detective Go. 
 - Hey, Go Mu Chi.

476
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,290
Are you not going to talk?

477
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,250
- What? 
 - Stop it, you bastard.

478
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,280
You have to shoot that kind of bastard!

479
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,900
- Let go! 
 - That bastard killed Park Hyun Soo!

480
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,990
What are you talking about? Calm down and tell us properly!

481
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:10,510
Park Hyun Soo! He said he killed her.

482
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,970
Jae Pil...

483
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,460
This.

484
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,940
Where is Bong Yi?

485
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,760
In the emergency room.

486
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,720
Hey, punk.

487
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,290
I've been looking for you for so long.

488
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,530
How could you be in that neighborhood?

489
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,200
 Who could that be? 

490
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,560
 I've definitely seen that face before. 

491
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,950
Where is the patient that was lying here?

492
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:42,510
Oh, she just left. I tried to stop her, but she really wanted to go.

493
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:44,650
   

494
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:56,540
 It rained heavily on the day the incident took place. 

495
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,460
 So that poor kid, whenever it rains, she... 

496
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,400
I'm sorry for being late.

497
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,180
It took me too long to remember.

498
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:32,440
♫  Too late to be back your love  ♫

499
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,430
Let's go.

500
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,630
Why'd you bring such a childish umbrella?

501
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:49,360
♫  Too late to start to love again  ♫

502
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:57,140
♫  Tonight I regret to let you go  ♫

503
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:02,710
♫  Now I wanna be back everything  ♫

504
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:06,020
♫  Because I can't let you leave  ♫

505
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,220
Hurry up!

506
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,770
I was afraid you wouldn't like it.

507
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,930
My arm hurts.

508
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:28,330
Let's go.

509
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:37,760
 The killer who's been targeting women who live alone, 

510
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,160
 was caught red-handed trying to commit a crime again in Anshin-dong.  
    

511
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,090
Anshin-dong.

512
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,270
Yes. It's me.

513
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,290
Mom.

514
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:05,470
By any chance, does she live in that neighborhood?

515
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:10,310
 Why would she be living here? She left a long time ago. Would she even want to live here? 

516
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:15,020
If you say so. Why are you getting so upset?

517
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,760
Mom, should I go home once?

518
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,390
Why would you come here? Please just let me live in peace, will you?

519
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:26,060
I'll pack some food and come to see you.

520
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:31,280
You should never come to this neighborhood. Got it?

521
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:47,080
This old lady is acting suspiciously.

522
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:58,600
Mr. Kim, tomorrow is a day off, right?

523
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,400
Yes.

524
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,220
Can you help me out?

525
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,590
Did you tell him?

526
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,840
Why are you two standing there anxiously? Just like a puppy that needs to pee.

527
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,000
We caught Hyun Soo's killer.

528
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:32,000
What did you just say?

529
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,240
Well about that...

530
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,460
Jae Pil...

531
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,150
It's not you, right?

532
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,060
My Hyun Soo... It just doesn't make sense.

533
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,450
Huh?

534
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:05,570
That's right. I killed her.

535
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:10,950
What are you saying? Hyun Soo was

536
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:14,700
- kidnapped by Han Seo Joon. 
 - During the Guryeong Mountain search,

537
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,470
I had actually found Hyun Soo.

538
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:23,640
She was sleeping in the forest. I think she ran away.

539
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,890
Bu-But...?

540
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:32,150
You were always better than me.  So condescending. I couldn't stand the sight of you.

541
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:36,170
When I heard you say that Hyun Soo and Hyun Seok were kidnapped by Han Seo Joon,

542
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:38,600
to be honest, I thought it served you right.

543
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,490
When you were crying when Hyun Seok was found,

544
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:46,050
when you couldn't get a thing done because of what happened to Hyun Soo, I liked that.

545
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,400
But Hyun Soo came back alive.

546
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,250
So I... I just killed her, before I could realize it.

547
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:58,250
If her body was found later, you would've assumed it was Han Seo Joon that killed her.

548
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,220
That's what I thought.

549
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,320
You son of a bitch!

550
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,770
Are you even human?

551
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:14,030
Die. Die you son of a bitch! Die, die!

552
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:17,240
Die!

553
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,120
You bastard!

554
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,360
Let go of me!

555
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,290
You should rot in hell, you bastard.

556
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,340
Cry it out.

557
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,820
Why did you lie?

558
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,700
You didn't kill Park Hyun Soo.

559
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,730
No way...

560
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,510
You...

561
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,460
 It's come as a shock that the real culprit behind the murder of Mr. Park's child, Miss A, 

562
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,160
 was not Han Seo Joon but Mr. Woo, who was a fellow detective. 
   

563
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,180
 Ms. Oh was– 

564
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:58,120
This wench dared to fool me?

565
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:03,060
- Yeah, Bong Yi. 
 - Oppa.

566
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,160
You haven't forgotten about meeting me later, right?

567
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,810
- Of course not. I'll see you at the movie theater at 6. 
 - Okay.

568
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,370
By the way, I have a favor to ask.

569
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:17,330
- Yeah, what is it? 
   - My grandma was wearing the brooch that I made for her. 

570
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:21,000
 - I haven't gotten it back yet. 
 - Detective Go? 

571
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,680
   

572
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,670
   

573
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,170
Where is it?

574
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,240
   

575
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:10,570
It's not here. Another box?

576
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,690
 This man... 

577
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:38,770
 What is this? Why is the man that Seong Yo Han killed in my memory? 

578
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:41,000
What are you doing there?

579
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,980
You... How did you get in?

580
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:21,870
That belongs to my baby. Give it back!

581
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:24,150
Give it to me!

582
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:28,990
Give it to me! That belongs to my baby!

583
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:31,090
Why are you asking about Song Soo Ho all of a sudden?

584
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:33,850
I was just curious about something.

585
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,880
   

586
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,090
He was burned to death.

587
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,980
Was he beaten— Oh...

588
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,140
I guess we don't know since he was burned.

589
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,630
No, he had many fractures.

590
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:57,300
There was pretty much no cartilage left, so he was beaten to a pulp until he nearly died.

591
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,710
I see.

592
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:07,690
- When did she leave? 
 - I was preparing a meal for a short while.

593
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:14,750
 Miss A, the daughter of the lead detective on the Headhunter case, and thought to be the murder victim of 

594
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,030
 Han Seo Joon 25 years ago has proven to be wrong.  Mr. B found to be the real culprit in her death. 

595
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,870
- Ma'am, are you okay? 
  - The new reports are sending shockwaves throughout the country. 

596
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:23,380
- Ma'am, where do you live? 
  - Mr. B is currently hospitalized at Mujin Hospital 

597
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,960
 due to deterioration of his health. 

598
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,760
Why is this happening? Why do I have the memory of Seong Yo Han's victim?

599
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,200
You probably looked at a lot of files on Seong Yo Han's victims before your accident.

600
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,820
I probably did since that I heard I had been working on the case with Detective Go.

601
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:45,810
You probably put together the victim's faces and what you read on his case file and mistook it for your memory.

602
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,020
Oh...

603
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,350
Don't worry.

604
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:54,170
- Soon, your memories and what you saw in his file will separate. 
 - I see.

605
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:00,170
By chance, could that happen with memories as a child?

606
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:03,590
- For example, memories when I was in kindergarten? 
 - Of course.

607
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:07,970
What you learned from books and movies are sometimes mistaken as memories.

608
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,630
Oh, I see.

609
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,390
- You're diligently taking your medicine, right? 
 - Yes, of course.

610
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:19,090
Good. Then let's switch your medication.

611
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:20,800
 - Your medicine is ready.  
 - Yes.

612
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,460
Take it three times a day, 30 minutes after meals.

613
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,100
- Okay, thank you. 
 - Thank you.

614
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:34,340
I've seen this medicine somewhere before.

615
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:39,820
 The hospitalized victim A is scheduled to be taken to the police tomorrow morning for questioning. 

616
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,360
There's no other time but right now.

617
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,480
 Because of public outcry, before being transferred— 

618
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,630
Detective. Seong Yo Han's victim, Jo Mi Jeong,

619
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,110
could I take a look at her belongings?

620
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,180
That's a medicine for anorexia. It was found in her desk drawer.

621
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,660
Hello Ma'am, this is Officer Jung Ba Reum.

622
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:10,380
I was curious about something while going over the case files.

623
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:17,340
By chance... Had your daughter ever received brain surgery?

624
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,960
 Yes, she had. 

625
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,900
 She got badly hurt while riding a bicycle two years ago. 

626
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,810
Really? I see.

627
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:29,040
Do you remember the name of the doctor who performed the surgery?

628
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:32,060
Dr. Park Min Joong?

629
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:33,250
 That's right. 

630
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:37,040
It's not anorexia but the aftereffect of brain trauma.

631
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,960
She lost her sense of smell when her frontal lobe was damaged.

632
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,760
So that's why she had lost so much weight,

633
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,030
but Seong Yo Han thought she suffered from anorexia.

634
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:51,730
I felt bad when I saw the broadcast.

635
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:54,310
Oh, then the opposite of that,

636
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:59,350
can you gain a sense of smell that you lost from a brain injury?

637
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:01,170
Why do you ask?

638
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:07,010
I was told I used to love fermented soybeans before surgery,

639
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,280
but I can't stand the smell of it now.

640
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,840
I was wondering if that was an aftereffect of my brain surgery.

641
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,400
Oh, that's not it.

642
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,020
It's not possible to gain a sense of smell that you didn't have because of brain damage.

643
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:23,710
Well, there is one way.

644
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:25,460
What's that?

645
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,380
Thank you, Doctor.

646
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,470
I'll see you next time.

647
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,720
Oppa!

648
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,960
Oh, Bong Yi! What are you doing here?

649
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,100
The doctor wanted to see me about my injury.

650
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,270
- Oh. 
 - What about you?

651
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:43,870
I came to see the doctor who performed my surgery.

652
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:48,360
Is he the one who did it?

653
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,310
Yeah.

654
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:51,260
He's not.

655
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,490
No, he is.

656
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:54,210
No.

657
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:58,880
The one who performed your surgery was a little older than him.

658
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,620
What?

659
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,350
How do you know that?

660
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,900
Oh, that's because...

661
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,440
 To still be alive after all he went through... 

662
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,760
 proves his desire to live. 

663
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,780
 It's too bad, but we have no other choice. 

664
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:43,550
 Anyway, Jung Ba Reum's surgery... 

665
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:46,000
 must be a success. 

666
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,160
No, he's not here.

667
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,650
Really?

668
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:57,690
But these are all the doctors in the Department of Neurosurgery.

669
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:59,320
Good day.

670
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:04,140
I'm here with someone who has lost her way. She seems to be one of your patients.

671
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,280
Hello?

672
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,610
Goodness, where is she?

673
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:16,570
Mujin Hospital?

674
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,320
Doctor.

675
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,780
You're back?

676
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:26,060
You see...

677
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:29,690
Are you sure you're the one who operated on me?

678
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:32,080
Of course.

679
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:36,100
Why would you suddenly ask me that though?

680
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:40,970
I was wondering if you were joined by someone else.

681
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:43,110
No, it was just me.

682
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:46,170
I don't want to sound like a show-off,

683
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:50,000
but I'm known as one of the top neurosurgeons in Korea.

684
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,320
It's what I take pride in.

685
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,050
I see...

686
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:56,770
Sorry to have bothered you then.

687
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:58,440
I'll get going. Have a good day.

688
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,350
Sure.

689
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,450
 He lied. 

690
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:20,630
Jung Ba Reum suspects something.

691
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:41,540
Why is he lying though?

692
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,860
Why?

693
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,460
Why is he lying?

694
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:51,930
Dang it.

695
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,010
We have an emergency. We have an emergency.

696
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:06,740
 There's an armed assailant in the lobby of Mujin Hospital. 

697
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,090
 Officers in the building, help is requested. 

698
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:18,710
Just you wait, Han Seo Joon.

699
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,900
I'll kill Woo Jae Pil and come for you next.

700
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:34,820
Go Mu Chi, why are you here?

701
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,380
 He's not here. 

702
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:08,940
 The doctor had a scar on his face. A long one on his right side. 

703
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:10,710
 A scar? 

704
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,770
What the heck did he do to the rat's head?

705
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:24,190
 He used to be a hotshot neurosurgeon, right? 

706
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:30,600
No way. The man's behind bars.

707
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,210
Why did he have to be a neurosurgeon of all things?

708
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:49,920
Mr. Kim, it's me.

709
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:53,040
Yes, I've been doing well.

710
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:57,300
Could I perhaps get a recent photo of Han Seo Joon?

711
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:00,890
Recent photos of inmates can't be taken outside prison walls.

712
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:04,780
A documentary show about execution interviewed him once. You could watch that.

713
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:07,760
Oh! Oh yes, yes, yes.

714
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:21,860
Let's say I killed him.

715
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:25,210
Help me so I can get to Han Seo Joon.

716
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:27,300
I'll take revenge on behalf of your kids.

717
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,750
I'll take revenge on behalf of all the victim's families.

718
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,080
Please.

719
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:41,770
I killed him. Arrest me.

720
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,510
He's dead.

721
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:45,190
What are you doing?

722
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:46,860
Arrest him.

723
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,230
It wasn't him.

724
01:05:57,230 --> 01:06:00,130
No.

725
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:04,630
No, no.

726
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,280
Mu Chi

727
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:10,630
is going to kill the guy

728
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:12,920
who murdered our kids.

729
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:16,810
I know I'm a bad guy for doing this.

730
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,250
But let's just pretend

731
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,490
like we don't know anything.

732
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,640
Let's turn a blind eye,

733
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,330
just this once.

734
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,300
Han Seo Joon's interview?

735
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,610
Yes, that...

736
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:45,000
I noticed that his interview was edited out  of the documentary.

737
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:51,380
The victim's families got very upset after the show aired, so we deleted the interview from the documentary.

738
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:53,020
But why?

739
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:57,070
I'm just really curious.

740
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:58,390
Who would do this...

741
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:02,330
I also kind of want to know why Detective Go

742
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:04,370
is so furious at him.

743
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,850
- I'll look for it. 
 - Okay.

744
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:25,100
Hey Bong Yi,

745
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,690
I just sent you a photo.

746
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:29,830
Can you check if he's the doctor?

747
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:32,600
- A photo? 
 - It's a screenshot of a video, so it might not be clear.

748
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,340
But try to see if it's him.

749
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,570
You grew up into a beautiful lady.

750
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,650
My sweetheart.

751
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:59,950
Oppa, it's him. He's the guy who did your surgery.

752
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,080
What did you do

753
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,850
to my brain?

754
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:23,830
What did you put inside my head?

755
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,650
Don't tell me

756
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:37,700
you implanted Seong Yo Han, the killer's, brain inside  me.

757
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,370
Is that what you did?

758
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:50,610
