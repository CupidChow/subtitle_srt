1
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,510
   

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,670
   

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,130
   

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,290
   

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:28,740
   

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,550
  October 17th, sunny.  

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,220
  I cut a rabbit's stomach.  

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,370
  I was curious if it was fat or having a baby.  

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,800
  October 18th, cloudy.  

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,110
  Come home right now.  

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,690
  Was it right to cut open the rabbit's stomach?  

12
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,680
  Let's eat.  

13
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,140
  That's why I poured ammonia in the fish tank.  

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,220
  What is that, Hyung?  

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,410
  Ammonia.  

16
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,130
  I heard all the fish will die if you pour this in.  

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,870
  They will die?  

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,540
  - Don't do that. 
 - Move.  

19
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,250
  Dad loves them a lot.  

20
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,600
  That's why I am killing them.  

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,030
  Those poor fish.  

22
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,570
  What Dad loves more than the fish is Choco.  

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000


24
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,070
 It's dangerous! 

25
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,680
 - I wonder what happened. 
 - I don't know. 

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,130
  October 19th, sunny.  

27
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,990
  Jae Min tattletaled on me.  

28
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,920
  A tattletaler should be punished.  

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,760
  That's why I punished Jae Min.  

30
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,330
  October 20th, cloudy.  

31
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,950
  Mom tried to kill me.  

32
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,530
  She said that a monster like me should die.  

33
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,310
  October 20th, thunder and lightning.  

34
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,270
  For the first time since I was born, I prayed to God.  

35
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,330
  I asked Him to not make me a monster.  

36
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,300
  October 29th,  

37
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,570
  bright.  

38
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,860
  I decided today that from now on, I will live with a mask.  

39
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,130
  Pretending to be the nicest and upright child in the work.  

40
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,150
  Jung Ba Reum. It's a name that I like.  

41
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,820
    
     

42
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,520
  October 15th.  

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,230
  God never answered my prayers.  

44
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,890
  I ended up becoming a murderer.  

45
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,310
     

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,420
 I remember my first murder being clumsy and hard to pull off.  

47
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,050
  However, the exhilaration and excitement from that day were something I could never forget.  

48
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,380
  I have decided that I will become God.  

49
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,380
  One who is not lazy, one who is not greedy,  

50
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,350
  one who does not lust, one who is not prideful,  

51
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,390
  one who is not gluttonous, one who is not angry,  

52
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,400
  and one who is not envious.  

53
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,210
  These are the seven sins that I have chosen.  

54
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,240
  I'm going to judge them.  

55
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,350
     

56
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,590
Hey! Hey!

57
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,290
 To Park Jong Ho, this coffee wasn't a preferred food. 

58
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,830
 But a survival tool to overcome sleepiness. 

59
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,350
     

60
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,210
     

61
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,920
     

62
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,950
     

63
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,440
      
    

64
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,420
     

65
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,300
     

66
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,480
   
    

67
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,990
  I am a predator.  

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,280
  I was born like this.  

69
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,790
You can see it.

70
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,200
Carry it just a little further, Chi Kook.

71
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,790
Wow, this is so heavy. Why are we carrying this and not using the wheels?

72
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,240
It's because of the wheels.

73
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,780
If the wheels break while rolling it on this stone road, our performance will be ruined.

74
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,260
Sorry about this.

75
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,150
Let's rest.

76
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,950
That's him. The Headhunter.

77
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,230
He looks just like us.

78
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,250
Of course. Did you think he would look like Thanos?

79
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,020
So that means there's a monster in there.

80
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,250
Did we meet in the first year of high school? We were partners in the same class.

81
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,260
I've been observing you since then.

82
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,760
You're too humble.

83
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,900
You credited all the good deeds you have done to me, too.

84
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,110
So what? Is that annoying?

85
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,300
I'll just continue being an annoying person then.

86
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,800
That's why I have been thinking since then.

87
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,620
About what?

88
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,290
That I'm going to judge you.

89
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,710
It's a sin not being arrogant, you bastard.

90
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,720
     

91
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,860
     

92
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,070
     

93
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,630
Is he dead?

94
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
- What is that? 
 - What on earth?

95
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,930
Ch-Chi Kook!

96
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,660
Help! Please help!

97
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,730
Bring me a needle and thread.

98
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,280
Huh?

99
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,620
  How annoying.  

100
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,550
  Why are you getting in the way?  

101
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,150
  This bastard is lucky.  

102
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,850
Mother, go rest in the resting room.

103
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,050
- Hurry, the last few days you were like this. 
 - It's okay, I'll do it.

104
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,530
No, no. I will do it. I'll stay with him.

105
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,870
Thank you, Ba Reum.

106
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,360
Chi Kook is like this,

107
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,300
but he will be thankful.

108
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,560
Don't be exhausted, Mother.

109
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,230
Okay.

110
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,970
Hurry and go rest.

111
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,300
I'll go and get you later.

112
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,680
This is pretty thrilling.

113
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,970
Isn't that so, Chi Kook?

114
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,890
Don't wake up. It'll be better if you don't wake up.

115
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,850
Otherwise, you'll have a more horrible death.

116
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,290
- Oh, Detective Go! 
 - How come you're here?

117
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,790
In order to give Chi Kook's mother a break, Dong Koo and I take turns.

118
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,840
So I came here.

119
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,800
I think the fingers were cut while trying to block the weapon used.

120
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,020
Out of the two, one was put back

121
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,250
but the other finger arrived too late for the surgery.

122
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,040
I wonder why he revealed Na Chi Kook's watch,

123
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,930
when he knew that would only get the investigation

124
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,070
closer to him.

125
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,160
You're right.

126
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,450
  Even at this very moment,  

127
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,650
  he is hunting for his next prey.  

128
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,880
  I''m not feeling well today.  

129
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,480
  So today, I decided to pick easy prey.  

130
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:38,440
  Someone who is small like that one and is weak with just one look.  

131
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,350
  That's a perfect prey.  

132
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,500
   
    

133
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,990
   
   

134
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,780
Song Soo Ho's gloves, Byeon Sun Yeong's ring...

135
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,370
  - That homeless man's shoesâ€” 
  - It was very natural for me to live a life filled with anger.   

136
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,910
  I think that anger was what gave me the strength to stay alive to this day.  

137
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,990
  But everything changed once  

138
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,070
  I decided to forgive him.  

139
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,710
  I should live more diligently for my brother's sake.   
    

140
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,990
  I slept like a corpse the day I returned from telling Han Seo Joon  

141
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,590
  that I forgave him.  

142
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,920
  I was able to get deep sleep for the first time after that day.  

143
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,810
  Go Mu Won started studying theology at a late age.  

144
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,080
  He filed a petition to free Han Seo Joon  

145
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,540
  from the death penalty.  

146
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,440
  Forgiveness made him live  

147
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,590
Father, hello.

148
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,570
Oh, Officer Jung!

149
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,950
What happened? Why did you come here?

150
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,970
Oh, right.

151
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,380
I am wondering if I should send someone off or not.

152
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,830
I came to get some counseling.

153
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,430
Send someone off?

154
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,730
To live or not,

155
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,280
what could the answer be?

156
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,970
Right. The time is almost up.

157
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,480
If he can't answer the question, the child will die.

158
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,860
He didn't say that the child will die. He just said that he'll kill someone.

159
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,830
He didn't say it would be the child.

160
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,280
You're right.

161
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,950
It's you.

162
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,940
     

163
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,600
    
    

164
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,990
  Don't you hate your dad who abandoned you, Han Kook?  

165
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,410
  No, I don't hate him.  

166
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,610
  I am sure he had a reason.  

167
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,400
  By chance, your dad might be watching the TV,  

168
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,770
  so is there anything you want to say?  

169
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,500
 Dad, I miss you. 

170
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,490
 I love you. 

171
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,430
  When you meet your dad, what is the first thing you want to do, Han Kook?  

172
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,080
  The amusement park.  

173
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,390
  I want to go to the amusement park  

174
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,790
  Good. I decided who I'll judge next.  

175
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,580
So commendable, that kid, Han Kook.

176
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,020
070...

177
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,150
Mom, buy me that.

178
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,990
The goat-man bread. I am hungry

179
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,550
Hold on for a little bit longer.

180
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,030
The broadcast staff said they will buy us a meal later.

181
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,840
Ma'am, could you come here for just a bit, please?

182
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,520
Wait here. I'll be right back.

183
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,980
  When the farmer only fed the donkey yummy food,  

184
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,930
  the goat got jealous.  

185
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,530
  You're eating well.  

186
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,160
  You should eat, too.  

187
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,840
That was originally your spot.

188
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,670
He stole your spot.

189
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,800
How about it? You hate him, don't you?

190
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,450
You want that child to disappear, huh?

191
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,480
Say it. You are jealous of that child.

192
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,870
Huh?

193
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,570
I brought him here

194
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,580
since you didn't answer.

195
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,140
How does it feel now that you see him in person?

196
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,190
Good kids don't lie.

197
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,420
You hate him to death.

198
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,780
Right? Just say it.

199
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,820
Then I will get rid of that child.

200
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,450
I'm not jealous!

201
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,930
So hurry up and send him home.

202
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,230
You bastard. It's a crime

203
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,680
not being jealous.

204
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:06,670
Mister, you are a very pitiful person.

205
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,710
    
    

206
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,040
    
    

207
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,100
  November 16th.  

208
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,710
  Living while wearing a mask is inconvenient  

209
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,130
  and annoying.  

210
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,480
I don't think this work suits Officer Jung.

211
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,240
That's what I'm saying.

212
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,680
But this cat looks like it was done by that guy, right?

213
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,280
It has no teeth.

214
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,310
- Hey, Officer Jung! 
 - Yes!

215
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,140
Look, look at him.

216
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,380
If this is the way you act after seeing one dead cat, you will freak out when you see a dead person.

217
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,100
I'm sorry. I'll work harder!

218
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,740
Is that something you can achieve by trying?

219
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,030
In the cabinet in the office, there are flyers that are leftover.

220
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,750
Hurry and go get those and post them all over the neighborhood.

221
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh, that turtle, so slow. You better run!

222
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,780
Yes!

223
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,080
Why are you out so late?

224
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,330
You said you were going to the library, but you went to a comic shop instead?

225
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,320
That's my business.

226
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,960
How is your hand? Is it all right?

227
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,740
Why are your hands so cold?

228
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,640
Do you want to die?

229
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,160
This won't do. Let's go.

230
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,780
Where?

231
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,380
- Let's just go. 
 - Where are we going? Let me go.

232
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,230
Can't we just go at once?

233
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,350
Let me go. Are you crazy? Hey!

234
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,240
Why can't you eat? Eat it up.

235
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,110
You should eat hot food to make you warmer.

236
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,840
Here, mix it in like this.

237
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,500
Officer Jung.

238
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,360
Officer Jung with an honorific, please. Or you can call me Ba Reum Oppa.

239
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,320
Can I marry you, Officer Jung?

240
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,710
I will do well.

241
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,010
I cook wellâ€”

242
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,730
I mean, I will cook well

243
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:22,440
and I will clean well.

244
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,430
Although I can't do that now.

245
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,370
You... Has something happened to you?

246
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,650
Nothing happened, so just answer me.

247
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:48,160
You are like a cute little sister to me.

248
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,010
Hurry and eat.

249
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,240
What a crappy way to reject someone.

250
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,130
Bong Yi. Bong Yi.

251
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,860
Bong Yi!

252
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,930
Oh, Bong Yi!

253
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,390
How annoying, that brat.

254
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,810
Hello?

255
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,830
Yes, I'm Officer Jung Ba Reum.

256
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,350
Ah, Detective!

257
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,190
Do you still happen to have Na Chi Kook's finger that never got stitched back on?

258
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,050
It's probably at the hospital.

259
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,830
I thought it might contain the culprit's DNA, so I asked them to keep it safe.

260
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,980
The team that preserves evidence wants the finger saying it's also considered a piece of evidence.

261
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,030
I'll check right away.

262
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,610
Elder, try moving it a little.

263
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,000
Can you move it?

264
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,560
No, it hurts.

265
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,080
Okay, I'm done.

266
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,670
I think your bones are okay, but your tendons are stretched.

267
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,010
You got hurt here, too.

268
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:21,440
If you don't put antiseptic on it, it will get infected.

269
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,400
This is making me upset.

270
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,420
This will sting.

271
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,870
Isn't this cute?

272
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,630
This is Goat Man. He's the "Kid-president."

273
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,860
Very popular among the kids.

274
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,160
Elder, if you wear this,

275
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,670
you will become the most fashionable in this neighborhood.

276
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,420
What? A goat makes me... What?

277
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,570
Going around beating you up? 
  (T/N: to beat up sounds like the beginning of "fashion") 

278
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,360
From now on,

279
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,560
I'll go.

280
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,000
Go where?

281
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,030
I'll go to get Bong Yi when it rains.

282
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,250
So, Elder, just stay at home.

283
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:12,100
How can I ask you to do that?

284
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,350
You're busy enough with your job.

285
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,900
No.

286
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,830
My job is to serve citizens.

287
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:22,270
Bong Yi is a citizen and so are you, Elder.

288
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,720
Is that right?

289
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,250
Then, until my leg gets better, I will ask you to help me.

290
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,710
Yes.

291
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,040
  Sometimes I go on an unexpected hunt.  

292
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,800
  The call cannot be connected, you will be connected to voicemail.  

293
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:58,140
  I saw that guy on the news who killed that student. What should I do?  

294
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,750
  Who is she saying she saw when I'm right here? Crazy grandma.  

295
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,510
  You have a message.  

296
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,290
  Why aren't you answering your phone?  

297
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:14,540
  Officer Jung, I'm so scared. I can't think of anything to do.  

298
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,110
  I'm on the bus.  

299
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,300
  When you hear this, come to the general store. 

300
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,570
  I brought a photo.  

301
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,810
  A photo? What is she talking about?  

302
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,570
Elder!

303
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,560
Ma'am!

304
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,350
Elder!

305
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,870
Elder.

306
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,900
Elder?

307
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,860
Where are you?

308
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,090
Elder.

309
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,890
Elder.

310
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,510
  This old grandma saw something she shouldn't have seen,  

311
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,810
 and ended up as an unexpected target. 

312
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,830
My baby...

313
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,100
  Just who...  

314
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,310
  Geez!  

315
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,420
Don't...

316
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,250
Please...

317
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,190
Save my baby.

318
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,380
Bong Yi...

319
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:49,180
My baby... save her...

320
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,800
     

321
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,120
He saw me but didn't report it.

322
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,520
What bastard is it?

323
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,060
He definitely saw me...

324
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,130
That photo...

325
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:02,060
It means that he saw me kill someone.

326
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,240
Where is he?

327
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,660
What happened?

328
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,240
The patient needs to restâ€”

329
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,200
Out of my way.

330
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,470
So what happened?

331
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,430
Because of me...

332
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,380
If only I answered Elder's phone call...

333
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,890
Come to your senses. Look straight into my eyes.

334
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,580
Look at my eyes, you bastard!

335
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,730
You have to tell me every single thing you saw. That's how we can catch him, okay?

336
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,360
I heard you prepared grandma's grave.

337
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,540
I wouldn't have minded a cremation. This must've cost a lot.

338
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:21,330
I spread my parent's ashes in the sea.

339
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:25,050
Even if I want to cry, there's no place to go.

340
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,690
Then, you're worried that I wouldn't have a place to go

341
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,330
if I wanted to see grandma?

342
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,100
Your grandma doesn't drink.

343
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,420
You're wrong.

344
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,560
My grandma used to like makgeolli so much.

345
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,960
Grandma!

346
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,750
Grandma, I...

347
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,710
I was wrong.

348
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,260
I'm-I'm sorry.

349
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,580
I'm sorry...

350
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,420
  I've wrapped this up.  

351
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,930
  Now, I should find that punk who is hiding.  

352
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,270
  Fortunately, at the crime scene of the last victim,  

353
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,700
  a Gudong neighborhood 70-year-old woman,  

354
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:33,700
  a witness statement and CCTV footage were collected, so we are working hard to investigate.  

355
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,870
  Are you sure that there are no ties between the victims?  

356
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,960
  Could it be that the investigation is headed in a completely wrong direction?  

357
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,320
  Now, now, now. I will tell you.  

358
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,190
  We investigated thoroughly.  

359
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,770
  There weren't any ties between the victims.  

360
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,380
- But if the victims don't have a commonality... 
 - There is none, but what?

361
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,100
If there was a standard by which he selected the victims...

362
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,990
     

363
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,150
     

364
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,780
You are Detective Go Mu Chi indeed.

365
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:27,450
You were wrong once, but you were still pretty splendid.

366
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,480
You are correct. There is a standard by which I selected my victims.

367
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,090
So why did I choose that child?

368
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,720
  - What?   
 - Why will that child die?

369
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,090
What did he do wrong?

370
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,110
Detective Go, you like being on TV, don't you?

371
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,260
What was the program on which you wrongly said that I chose my victims randomly?

372
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,090
Find the reason why I will kill the child

373
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,040
and say it on that TV show.

374
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,210
I decline a drunken broadcast.

375
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,220
Be serious. After all, a person's life is on the line.

376
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,930
If you don't say the correct answer,

377
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:17,400
as soon as that broadcast is over, right on the dot, I will kill him where everyone in the country can see.

378
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,310
I promise.

379
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,130
Do you think it will help the investigation for you to go on the broadcast as you request?

380
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:29,390
The most important thing is to save the child's life, Commissioner.

381
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:34,400
A characteristic of psychopaths who commit serial killings is their desire to boast about their brutal crimes

382
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,520
and their desire to reveal their existence. It's a type of exhibitionism.

383
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,000
His exhibitionism is reaching its climax right now.

384
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,880
If I lure him on stage just like he wants, there is a high probability that he will get easily trapped.

385
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,520
Then he will definitely make a fatal mistake.

386
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,770
Please let me be a part of this case investigation.

387
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,260
Have you ever met a psychopath?

388
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,860
What?

389
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,730
It's far worse than you can imagine.

390
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:03,720
A nice kid like you can't even imagine, a terrible monster.

391
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,080
Someone like me, who has nothing to lose, and only has evil left inside should face those punks.

392
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,010
  That's right. It is worse than what you can imagine.  

393
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,670
  A nice kid like you can't even imagine such a terrible monster.  

394
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:31,130
Okay, attention! We have not been able to find the victim's clothes and the weapon used for the crime yet.

395
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:35,000
Until now, we have focused the search on the inside of the correctional facility, but from now we will expand the search

396
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,060
to include the inside and outside of this facility and all areas where visitors can come and go. We will search again.

397
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,580
- Begin! 
   - Begin!  

398
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,150
Detective, if outside entry and exit were possible, wouldn't he have taken it out immediately that day?

399
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,540
They say outside visitors were searched thoroughly,

400
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:56,950
so it would have been difficult to take it out. It's highly likely that it's inside here, either hidden or gotten rid of.

401
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,780
Let's say that's what has happened to the weapon,

402
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,970
but why is it so important to find Chi Kook's clothes?

403
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,170
Based on the culprit's murder pattern up until now, there wasn't a case where the victim was disrobed.

404
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:10,950
The fact that only Na Chi Kook was disrobed means that there is conclusive evidence left on the clothes.

405
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,070
  Go Mu Chi, you're pretty good.  

406
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:41,160
Victim's navy blue uniform and a weapon!

407
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,140
What is he doing?

408
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,870
What are you doing? I told you to leave a while ago.

409
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,260
The culprit, you know...

410
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:59,120
I heard that he loathes God so he moved the corpses to where a cross is visible and positioned them so as to give the finger to the cross, right?

411
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,570
But he didn't do that to Chi Kook.

412
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,190
Why was it different only for Chi Kook?

413
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,200
I don't really get that part either.

414
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,620
Thank you for keeping it safe.

415
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:28,240
Oh? This is weird.

416
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,540
Hey, Officer Jung!

417
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,510
Oh, Detective Go!

418
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,570
Where are you running off to in such a rush?

419
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:42,410
- This piece of evidence... it isn't Chi Kook's finger.
 - What?

420
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,900
About a week before the accident happened we'd gone fishing.

421
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,590
And he hurt his finger with a fish hook.

422
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:52,450
There should definitely have been a scar on his finger... but it isn't there.

423
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,680
So this is somebody else's finger?

424
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,690
He purposely left behind somebody else's finger.

425
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,520
Then what about Na Chi Kook's finger?

426
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,850
- There's a church inside the correctional facility, right?
 - Yes.

427
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,660
The cross.

428
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,680
 You're quite smart, Go Mu Chi.  Detective!

429
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,180
I don't have any time to waste! Seriously!

430
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,730
Why's mass so important to those bastards?

431
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:18,350
They killed people! Those pieces of garbage!

432
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,730
Will praying erase their sins? Will they go to paradise?

433
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,360
Gosh,  why do you have to put it like that?

434
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,090
What's wrong with what I said?

435
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,240
Please be quiet. Doing this isn't going to solve anything.

436
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,120
 - Now that things have turned out like this, I should get the show started.  
 - What's wrong with what I said?

437
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,160
- Detective. 
 - What?

438
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,930
What is this?

439
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,060
Get a ladder. A ladder, quick!

440
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,020
 "Drink from it, all of you. 

441
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:13,500
 This is My blood of the covenant, 

442
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,790
 which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 

443
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,550
 He should have seen it by now. Why is he so quiet then? 

444
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:29,110
- Detective! Detective Go! 
  - Remember me and do it." 

445
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,530
What's the matter, Detective? Do you see something?

446
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,740
   

447
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,710
The culprit is left-handed.

448
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,740
The knife is plunged at 1 o'clock.

449
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,120
That's an angle that's only possible if he used his left hand.

450
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,720
You're right.

451
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,250
But what about the wounds on Chi Kook's body?

452
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:41,740
Not only for Na Chi Kook but for the other victims as well, he alternated his hands while killing them.

453
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,120
To hide the fact that he is left-handed.

454
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,640
If he used his left hand instinctively then that means he's definitely left-handed.

455
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,130
 Too bad for you, Go Mu Chi. I'm ambidextrous. 

456
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,320
I got it. The reason why Na Chi Kook's clothes were taken off.

457
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,070
It was a mockery of the emperor's arrogance. He didn't even realize he was naked because he was drunk on power.

458
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,540
You've decided to go against everything God preaches, right?

459
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:07,410
So you thought those who didn't commit the seven deadly sins were sinners.

460
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,850
But you know what? You are not a god. Heck, you're not even human.

461
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:21,730
You're just a horrible monster.

462
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:30,500
A monster that can never be saved.

463
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:43,220
 So, why did you act up in front of me? 

464
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,540
 How did you like my judgment? 

465
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,680
 This is all because of you. 

466
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:04,320
 Keep watching. See how many people I kill from now on. 

467
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,690
   

468
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,380
Scalpel.

469
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,510
Don't think this is unfair.

470
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:02,310
This way you'll be able to live again.

471
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,900
   

472
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,880
It's quiet now.

473
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,520
   

474
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,640
 If there is hell, 

475
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:16,870
 then please, let me go to the place where I will receive the most painful punishment. 

476
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,140
In order to celebrate Officer Jung Ba Reum's discharge,

477
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,790
people from all over the country have gathered in front of the hospital.

478
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:24,880
There he is!

479
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,690
He's coming! He's coming!

480
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,580
Jung Ba Reum!

481
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,870
Jung Ba Reum!

482
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,260
Jung Ba Reum!

483
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,300
 Look over here! 

484
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,720
Sit here.

485
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,140
Rest here for a while. I'll cook some rice porridge for you.

486
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,820
Yes.

487
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:04,070
    
    

488
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,790
I must've been a good person.

489
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,770
Hey, are you kidding me?

490
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:17,200
Ever since you were a child, you were an upright kid that never once caused problems.

491
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,390
That's a relief.

492
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:33,640
I'm Officer Jung Ba Reum, who has been assigned to work at Pyeongan Police Station as of today.

493
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,240
Officer Jung!

494
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,930
- I heard the news that you were coming in as my successor. 
 - I look forward to working with you.

495
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:44,870
- Let's work well together. 
 - Oh boy! Officer Jung, the face of Pyeongan station, is here.

496
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,770
Have some of this. It's Chong Myoung Tang. Sit down and drink it.

497
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:56,980
 I have committed crimes for which I can never be forgiven. 

498
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:03,490
 Crimes against innocent people and even those who I loved the most. 

499
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,100
What a crazy guy!

500
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,440
Officer Jung?

501
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,440
Detective Go Mu Chi.

502
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:22,500
Detective Go! Detective Go!

503
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:29,800
â™«  In the deep dark, with my eyes closed  â™«

504
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,170
I'm sorry for being late.

505
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,780
For remembering too late.

506
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:43,780
â™«  All the memories hidden within me  â™«

507
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,620
Why don't you two start a business writing novels? It seems to suit you better.

508
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,360
- Should we do that, Officer Jung? 
 - Ah, but I feel like documentaries suit me better than novels.

509
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,240
- I like documentaries, too. 
 - Should we show him this?

510
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:03,280
The DNA discovered in the fridge... It matches Hong Na Ri's by 99%. You see this, right?

511
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,940
Did you bring an arrest warrant?

512
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,240
Then bring an arrest warrant first.

513
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,240
I don't need a warrant, you bastard.

514
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,550
- Are you looking for this? 
 - Hey!

515
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,920
- I took them out when you were sleeping in the car.
 - Hand it over, quick!

516
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,530
- Hurry up and give it to me! 
 - Ah, no! I can't do that, Detective!

517
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:30,180
You are under arrest for murdering Kim Yeong Hee, Kang Min Joo, and Hong Na Ri.

518
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,780
- Anything you say from now will be used as evidence against you. 
 - How did you know to come here?

519
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:39,790
How do you think? You didn't request an arrest warrant, so I asked Detective Shin for this favor.

520
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,640
Hey, you bastard. Officer Jung!

521
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:49,090
Detective, he protected you this time, too. Father Go.

522
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,410
â™«  I can't feel pain.  â™«

523
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,990
Oppa?

524
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:01,510
â™«  I can't feel pain.  â™«

525
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,250
Oppa.

526
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:15,810
Bong Yi, nothing is going to happen to me. Right?

527
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,990
I'll be fine, right?

528
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,740
â™«  My love can't let go of you just yet  â™«

529
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,890
Of course, you'll be fine.

530
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:36,870
Nothing is going to happen to you.

531
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,740
You're talking bullshit!

532
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,560
You crazy bastard!

533
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:28,800
Song Soo Ho. Kim Seong Gyu. Byeon Soon Yeong. Jo Mi Jeong. Bong Yi's grandma. Why did you kill them? Why?

534
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,810
What are you talking about? That was Seong Yo Han.

535
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:37,020
Don't lie! You killed them all! Seong Yo Han was turned over and died as your scapegoat, just like your father.

536
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:42,650
In order to not get caught, you made it look like Seong Yo Han had killed them.  As if it wasn't you who committed the murder. Right? Right?

537
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:49,150
It's all your doing! You were also the one who took the priest's cross necklace and grandma's brooch! Isn't that right?

538
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,120
You crazy idiot!

539
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:21,980
It was Seong Yo Han. It was Seong Yo Han.

540
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:29,520
Damn, ouch!

541
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,060
 What did you do to my head? 

542
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,090
What did you put in here?

543
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,700
Don't tell me you

544
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:52,830
put that murderer Seong Yo Han's brain into my head!

545
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:06,540
Please help me so that nothing bad happens to me.

546
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:12,760
Please don't let me become a monster, like Seong Yo Han.

547
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:16,250
Please.

548
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:21,150
Lord, protect me.

549
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:28,990
 I loathe myself and I can't bear it anymore. 

550
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,980
May the Lord...

551
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:07,850
give you salvation.

552
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:20,830
 Please, give me the most painful punishment possible. 

553
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,480
I will...

554
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,750
curse that bastard's child for the rest of my life.

555
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:39,260
 The real culprit of the Mujin serial killings isn't Seong Yo Han. 

556
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:43,000
 It is me, Jung Ba Reum. 

557
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:48,020
Save the child first. Han Kook, who is right below you.

558
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:53,580
Die, you monster!

559
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:15,710
 Seong Yo Han was unfairly sacrificed while trying to save Han Kook and Bong Yi, from me. 

560
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:24,380
 So please stop condemning Seong Yo Han and his family. 

561
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:38,490
 I don't know how to apologize to the victims and their families. 

562
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:42,860
 Don't ever forgive me. 

563
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:49,970
 Lord, don't ever forgive me. 

564
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:58,080
