00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,880
   

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,740
   

4
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,540
 God! May God 

5
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,220
 save you. 

6
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,420
 How do I look? 

7
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,460
 I asked you to not make me a monster. 

8
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,310
 I begged. 

9
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,620
 But you completely ignored my prayer. 

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,720
 And you call yourself God? 

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,060
 From now on, I am a God. 

12
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,530
 Those humans who follow your crap, 

13
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,960
 I am going to get rid of all of them. 

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,290
   

15
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,140
   

16
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,020
 I... am a predator. 

17
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:38,830
 I... was a predator. 

18
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:50,310
   

19
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,630
   

20
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,000
Han Gook, that detective didn't keep his promise.

21
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,680
We have to show him later.

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,310
That I kept my promise.

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,480
Those who are not jealous and don't covet

24
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,530
are sinners.

25
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,440
It was me.

26
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,150
It wasn't Seong Yo Han.

27
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,710
It was me.

28
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,090
 Officer Jung, did you graduate from medical school? 

29
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,870
 How do you know all of that so well? 

30
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,240
It was all fake.

31
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,560
All of it.

32
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,360
 What are you doing? 

33
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,650
 Oh, I'm really sorry. 

34
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,090
 Have you gone crazy? 

35
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,100
 I'm sorry. 

36
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,250
 The bird must have hurt its leg. 

37
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,980
 It didn't move even though the car was coming closer. I couldn't help myself. 

38
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,980
 Were you very surprised? 

39
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,650
 I'm sorry. Sorry. 

40
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,360
 You almost died because of that bird, kid! 

41
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,360
 You're right. I'm sorry. 

42
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,900
 Sorry. Drive safe! 

43
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,610
 I'm sorry. 

44
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,650
 Because of you... 

45
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,760
 I bowed to the likes of that bastard. 

46
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,900
 No, I changed my mind. 

47
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,000
 You know what you did wrong, right? 

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,230
 For that, I'll kill you very slowly. 

49
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,960
 Slowly. 

50
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,660
From beginning to end, I was acting.

51
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,390
You're here?

52
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,900
- Oh, you're up? 
 - Yes.

53
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,860
 Don't you hate your dad who abandoned you? 

54
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,470
 No, I don't hate him. 

55
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,520
 I am sure he had a reason. 

56
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,940
 Your dad might be watching the TV. 

57
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,960
 Are you Dr. Schweitzer of animals? 

58
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,820
 Isn't it cute? You're one of the fashionable people in this area now. 

59
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,680
 Oh, thank you. 

60
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,720
 I'll help finish up and go. 

61
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,910
All that acting I've done.

62
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,970
A life of lies.

63
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,580
I wrongly believed those were my true memories.

64
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,970
They were all my memories.

65
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,870
 From the beginning, I didn't have Seong Yo Han's memories. 

66
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:04,300
   

67
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,320
 Ba Reum, Chi Kook is awake! 

68
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,550
 He regained consciousness! 

69
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,020
What?

70
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,880
 He just woke up, so we don't know his condition yet. 

71
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,240
 Anyway, get here quick. Understand? 

72
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,290
Originally, the blade was intact. 
    

73
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,160
Look. This is the picture we took of the knife right after the incident.

74
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,840
It's undamaged.

75
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,610
So you're saying Kang Duk Su's blood was found on the handle?

76
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,860
Then Kang Duk Su's murderer broke into the evidence storage room,

77
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,450
killed Kang Duk Su with this knife, then put it back?

78
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,430
What is this? Is this really a revenge killing?

79
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,180
The fact that it's with Bong Yi's grandma's knife...

80
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,040
How can he have possibly taken the knife? How are you guys guarding–

81
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,150
It's not impossible if it were done by an insider.

82
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,960
Exactly! I told you it was done by someone on the inside.

83
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,650
How else would he have known about the cigarette burn on Kang Duk Su's body?

84
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,400
He must have come in and read Kang Duk Su's case report

85
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,920
and took Bong Yi's grandma's knife.

86
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,130
I looked at all the CCTV, but there is no evidence of a third party having been here.

87
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,160
That's true.

88
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,550
Also, we searched all the CCTVs of Mujin offices before and after the incident, and nothing was found.

89
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,900
Is there any progress on Kang Duk Su's case?

90
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,370
Nothing yet. How is there not even one clue or witness?

91
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,670
It's driving me nuts. The higher-ups keep hounding us.

92
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,520
And people are asking why we would arrest the Apostle of Justice and that if we do, they wouldn't leave us alone.

93
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,590
And the higher-ups keep telling us to hurry up and catch the enemy that shakes the foundation of the rule of law.

94
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,530
Anyway, I am sure this was done by an insider.

95
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,490
The fact that this knife was taken means the person knew of this knife's purpose.

96
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,750
Why Bong Yi's grandma had this knife,

97
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,400
only the police know. Only the police.

98
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,760
This is a big problem.

99
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,330
Is the culprit an officer?

100
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,600
Where do you think you're going?

101
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,950
I have to report to the chief if the culprit's an officer.

102
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,960
Just stay still. We aren't sure of anything yet.

103
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,830
Why are you in such a hurry?

104
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,240
That's right.

105
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,580
Even if the culprit killed Kang Duk Su and put it back.

106
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,350
We can't be certain that it was done by an officer.

107
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,100
There are hundreds of people who go in and out of the Mujin offices every day.

108
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,390
How would the person get in here without a passcode?

109
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,770
Have you been leaving it open?

110
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,980
I don't always lock it up.

111
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,910
My passcode is my birthday, so anyone who works here would know easily.

112
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,430
Hey! Who in the country doesn't know your birthday when that whole incident–

113
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,700
If there's a chance that the culprit is an insider, we have to be even more careful.

114
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,600
The culprit might hide more if we talk about it without knowing everything.

115
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,930
Let's keep this quiet and investigate.

116
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:54,100
First, Detective Go, look through all the CCTV footage again from before and after Kang Duk Su's incident.

117
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,630
- Yes, sir. 
 - And Detective Kang

118
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,960
see if there's anyone on the inside who made an inquiry on Kang Duk Su's case.

119
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,450
So you're saying these are all the CCTV footage from three days before and after Kang Duk Su's murder?

120
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,300
Yes, sir. But the special team already went through them.

121
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,420
Why would you need to look at it  again?

122
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,100
Hey. Hold on.

123
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,920
Rewind that.

124
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,290
That's strange, isn't it?

125
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,050
What is this? What happened?

126
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,160
Did someone touch it?

127
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,400
No, after the special team took it and watched it, no one accessed it.

128
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,460
Give me this video file and the hard drive stored in Mujin office's CCTV. Quickly.

129
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,370
Hey, Porn head.

130
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,920
Porn head.

131
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,990
This bastard, why do you have such a bitter look when you have a guest? Do you really want to taste something bitter?

132
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,820
I don't do bad things anymore and just work now.

133
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,320
How many times do you have to check?

134
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,060
Don't you dare do something like that again. It won't end with jail.

135
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,270
I'll cut your hands and throw them to a pigsty. Bear that in mind, punk.

136
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,020
Take a look at this.

137
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,230
I think someone spliced the video.

138
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,130
Restore it to its original state as quickly as you can.

139
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,850
Don't wait until you finish the whole thing but report back to me each time you recover something.

140
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,840
- Say yes. 
 - Yeah.

141
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,630
He must be after a porn criminal.

142
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,020
I wonder how good it is!

143
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,590
This punk!

144
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,650
 I thought it was something amazing and sold my soul to restore it! 

145
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,300
He must be finished already. He sure is fast.

146
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,940
   

147
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,500
Look at this guy.

148
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,760
Does the fact that this guy was erased mean he's the culprit?

149
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,060
Who are you?

150
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,670
Now, who's this guy?

151
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,450
What is that piece of paper?

152
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,490
You. Who are you?

153
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,980
   

154
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,240
OZ. OZ!

155
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,260
This bastard.

156
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,410
Date. Date.

157
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,040
Oh, if it's this day, it's the day when I got hit in the head.

158
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,140
Parking lot. Parking lot.

159
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,910
Parking lot...

160
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,290
 67Do6264. 

161
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,320
Oh, stop, stop, stop. Please zoom in on that.

162
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,960
Where is that?

163
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,200
Okay. Just wait, you bastard.

164
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,030
Just try throwing away my family photo. You're dead.

165
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,800
I caught you.

166
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,420
It's still here?

167
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,160
   

168
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,940
Does he stay here long-term?

169
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,280
Excuse me!

170
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,890
Is there no one?

171
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,810
Excuse me!

172
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,340
What's going on?

173
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,840
Excuse me. Is there anybody here?

174
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,200
Oh, where did it go? In the meantime...

175
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,020
   

176
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,580
Hello?

177
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,910
Are you okay? Are you okay?

178
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,520
 Wow! 

179
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,220
 Wait, wait. 

180
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,780
 - Let's rest for a bit.  
  - Aigo! 

181
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,410
 You have poor stamina. 

182
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,380
 You just took a break. 

183
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,130
 How long has it been that you're tired again. 

184
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,290
 What are you going to do when you're trying to catch a suspect, you punk? 

185
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,110
 Please workout. Huh? 

186
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,130
 I really don't like to do any exercising except breathing exercises. 

187
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,250
 Let's rest for just 3 minutes. 

188
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,480
 Hey, isn't this an MP3? 

189
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,490
 You still have this? 

190
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,230
 My mom bought this for me as my birthday present. 

191
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,390
 It's still good and the sound quality is good. 

192
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,420
 I couldn't throw it away because it reminds me of my mom. 

193
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,990
 What kind of music is this? 

194
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,750
 It's classical music, but I'm not sure what the title of the song is. 

195
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,040
 It's music that I listen to when I need to focus. 

196
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,120
 When I listen to this music, it calms my mind 

197
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,590
 and I'm able to focus. 

198
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,830
 It's nice. 

199
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,120
 You must've been nervous because of your performance. 

200
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,940
 What is that? 

201
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,210
 It was the place where prisoners took a shower after swimming, 

202
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,150
 but a new indoor facility was built, so it's been a while since anyone used it. 

203
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:24,370
 Hey, it's an outdoor shower at the detention center then? 

204
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,960
 I wanted to take a look. Can I take a look? 

205
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,940
 Hey! Hey! 

206
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,860
 - Water still comes out?  
  - Yeah. 

207
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,080
 - Because the water supply is still connected.  
  - But you know what? 

208
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,890
 What? 

209
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,490
 - That you are annoying.  
  - Huh? 

210
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,070
 What? Are you imitating Dong Gu? 

211
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,810
 It doesn't suit you. 

212
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,910
 Did we meet in the first year of high school? 

213
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,290
 We were partners in the same class. 

214
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,790
 I've been observing you since then. 

215
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,510
 You're too humble. 

216
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,580
 You credited all the good deeds you have done to me, too. 

217
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,850
 So what? Is that annoying? 

218
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,890
 Then I'm a person who is always annoying. 

219
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,560
 That's why, 

220
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,440
 I have been thinking since then. 

221
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,010
 About what? 

222
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,860
 That I'm going to judge you. 

223
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,180
 Why? Why? 

224
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,390
 It's a sin not being arrogant, you bastard. 

225
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,800
 Those garbage people are going to run wild like they own the place? 

226
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,310
 Hiding like a rat. 

227
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,710
 Am I a bastard who kills weak and powerless women? Huh? 

228
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,870
 Jerk... 

229
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,010
 Hey, Mr. Naked King. 

230
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,360
 What did you eat? You're so heavy. 

231
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,920
Ba Reum!

232
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,900
What's wrong with you?

233
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,950
It's visiting hours. Let's go inside.

234
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,270
Hey, I got a call from Dong Gu. Let's hurry and go in.

235
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,990
Come inside.

236
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,230
Where are you going?

237
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,400
Chi Kook woke up. Let's go in.

238
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,120
You punk.

239
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,700
Ah, what's wrong?

240
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,710
Why are you so nervous? Let's hurry and go.

241
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,440
Hurry and go. Go, go.

242
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,780
I...

243
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,860
- I did it... 
 - Be quiet.

244
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,250
What are you doing? Your friend's arm will fall off.

245
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,460
 What happened? 

246
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,170
 Why? 

247
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,980
 He definitely saw me. 

248
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,170
Visiting hours are over.

249
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,640
Rest is the priority for the patient right now, so please leave.

250
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,910
He needs to rest.

251
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,560
Let's go.

252
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,790
He asked why he is laying here...

253
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,880
I don't think he remembers anything from the time of the accident.

254
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,370
In the case of extreme shock,  the brain sometimes blocks  out memories

255
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,220
that it cannot handle.

256
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,080
So did you tell him what happened that day?

257
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,040
No. I didn't tell him in case he gets shocked.

258
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,890
For now, I told him that he was in a huge car accident.

259
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,220
His condition right now is still unstable.

260
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,960
He regained consciousness but

261
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,510
his condition can rapidly get worse.

262
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,370
We will have to monitor his condition.

263
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,040
Mother. Don't worry too much.

264
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,250
Doctors are always scaring people.

265
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,600
They're doing that so they won't be responsible if something happens later, so don't pay any attention.

266
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,370
Chi Kook recognized Ba Reum, too.

267
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,180
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

268
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,320
They shared such a tearful hug.

269
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,170
He didn't even look at me.

270
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,900
Hey, he reacted when he saw you.

271
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,290
I'm disappointed, Mother.

272
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,870
One worry down, Jung Ba Reum.

273
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,640
Where are you going?

274
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,730
Ah, he's so happy that he

275
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,720
lost his mind completely.

276
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,980
The two of them were like soulmates.

277
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,620
 Yes, Mother. Take care. 

278
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,990
   

279
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,180
 - Is something going on?  
  - Chi Kook's clothes and weapon 

280
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,960
 were found. 

281
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,850
 The call cannot be connected, you will be connected to voicemail. 

282
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,770
 I saw that guy on the news who killed that student. 

283
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,170
 What should I do? 

284
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:11,710
 Who is she saying she saw when I'm right here? Crazy grandma. 

285
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,600
 You have a message. 

286
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,590
 Why aren't you answering your phone? 

287
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,140
 Officer Jung, I'm so scared. 

288
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,620
 I can't think of anything to do. 

289
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,190
 I'm on the bus. 

290
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,510
 When you hear this, come to the general store. 

291
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,730
 I brought a photo. 

292
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,780
 A photo? What is she talking about? 

293
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
 Elder. 

294
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,670
 Elder, it's me, Officer Jung. 

295
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,240
 Oh? 

296
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,090
 Officer Jung? My goodness. 

297
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,660
 I nearly had a heart attack! 

298
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,490
 Be careful. 

299
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,570
 Be careful. 

300
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,190
 What were you talking about? What photo? 

301
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,690
 So what happened was, as I was working... 

302
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,910
 - You know that student who died at the grape farm, right? 
 - Yes. 

303
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,920
 Her picture... It was there. 

304
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,220
 Here. Look. 

305
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,300
 Why did they kill her? 

306
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,380
 But... 

307
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,170
 My Bong Yi's school uniform button... 

308
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,380
 Where did you get that from? 

309
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,910
 Officer Jung! Oh my! 

310
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,610
 My baby... 

311
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:32,850
 My baby... How pitiful. What am I to do? What am I to do? 

312
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,670
 My baby... 

313
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,280
 Find him! The bastard who killed my grandmother! 

314
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,500
 Find him! 

315
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,460
 Grandma, it's all my fault. 

316
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,980
 I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

317
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,100
 You think you've become God, don't you? 

318
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,120
 I've seen bastards like you. 

319
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,770
 You deemed those who did not do the opposite of what God said, as sinners. You punished them as you pleased. 

320
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,100
 But you know what? You are not God. Heck, you're not even human. 

321
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,100
 You're just a horrible monster. 

322
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,090
 A monster that can never be saved. 

323
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,620
 You're worse than a piece of trash. 

324
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,870
 You pitiful bastard, you're done for. 

325
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,880
 Wrong. You got it wrong. 

326
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,670
 Oh no, Father. 

327
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:15,740
 Your little brother, got it wrong. 

328
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,490
 I got it right! Where is the child? 

329
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,310
 Where is the child, you son of a bitch! 

330
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,090
 The one who's supposed to get angry isn't Han Kook, it's him. 

331
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:29,920
 - A sinner who did not get angry.  
  - Hyung. 

332
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,480
 - I told you I'd kill him when the broadcast ends if you didn't give me the right answer, didn't I?
 - Hyung. 

333
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,450
 Does it make sense? The Headhunter killed his parents by slashing their heads off. 

334
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,370
 And even made him like this. And yet he forgave him for all of it. 

335
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,970
 It's quite a sight. 

336
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,690
 I'm sorry! 

337
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,720
 I'm sorry. I acted out against you without knowing any better. 

338
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,590
 I'm sorry! 

339
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,550
 Kill me. Kill me. 

340
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,420
 I'll die in his place. 

341
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,910
 Please don't kill my poor older brother. Please spare him! 

342
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,090
 Mu Chi, I'm fine. 

343
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:11,290
 Even if something does happen to me, it will never be your fault. Got it? 

344
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:14,830
 This is your last chance. Get angry. Be furious. 

345
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,590
 Be furious at the Headhunter who killed your parents. 

346
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:21,010
 And at the world that didn't execute him. 

347
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,280
 Please, Hyung. 

348
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,820
 My beloved brother, 

349
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,640
 I'll– 

350
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,430
 I'll forever be sorry to you. 

351
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:44,180
 Hyung, please! Hyung! 

352
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,480
 I'm sorry. 

353
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,560
   

354
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,670
You should have just left me to die instead.

355
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,490
If I were the old version of myself,

356
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,140
then I wouldn't have had to feel this unbearable wrenching pain.

357
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:20,240
Is this your way of

358
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,250
punishing me?

359
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,810
 Visiting hours are over. 

360
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,340
 It's important for the patient to rest. Please leave. 

361
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,850
Something was definitely up between the two of them.

362
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,970
Did they fight before he got injured? Even if they'd fought...

363
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,590
 May God, 

364
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:34,410
 save... you. 

365
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,900
Han Kook.

366
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,150
   

367
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,940
 If a fork crane is used to demolish everything, his body will be destroyed. 

368
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,920
 I need to return him to his mother's embrace intact. I need to do at least that. 

369
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,990
Where did it go?

370
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,520
What are you doing over there?

371
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,210
Where did everything that was kept here go?

372
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,460
Come on out quickly. We're demolishing this place now.

373
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,930
- Come out. 
 - Where the hell did you put everything that was kept here?

374
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,420
Why would we do that? Just get out of there!

375
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,090
   

376
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,730
What happened?

377
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,020
What's with that expression?

378
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,660
Where is Han Kook's body? Hand it over this instant!

379
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,620
What are you talking about? Han Kook?

380
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,300
You hid Woo Hyeong Cheol's body too.

381
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,090
So hand it over right away. I have to give that child back to his mother. Give him to me now!

382
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,120
Who is Han Kook?

383
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,830
The child kidnapped by Seong Yo Han?

384
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,230
Why do you think I would have that child?

385
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,540
You really didn't hide him?

386
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,570
As if I would even know where that child was.

387
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,530
So where is his body? Are the memories of the place where

388
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,950
Seong Yo Han hid that child coming to you now?

389
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,470
 If it wasn't him who moved the body then who was it? 

390
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,560
 There is someone out there who knows my true identity. 

391
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,020
 Who could it be? And why? 

392
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,610
Please, don't kill me. Don't kill me...

393
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,360
Let me live!

394
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,920
- Oh! 
 - Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

395
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,440
- It's okay. It's okay. 
 - Don't kill me. Don't kill me. 
 - Oh, no, no!

396
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,410
It's me. I had visited you along with Gu Dong Koo and Officer Jung.

397
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,760
I'm a detective. A detective. Detective Go Mu Chi.

398
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,150
Detective Go Mu Chi. You remember me now?

399
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,880
Yes.

400
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,970
My gosh. Come on up. Alright.

401
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,280
You must have had a nightmare.

402
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,820
You don't need to worry anymore. Okay?

403
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,960
The culprit is dead.

404
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,000
What do you mean he died?

405
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,340
Who died?

406
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,260
The culprit who stabbed me died?

407
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,800
Your mother said you couldn't remember a thing.

408
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,320
What?

409
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,110
Oh, I heard about it from my mom.

410
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,010
I heard she told you it was a car accident.

411
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,540
What? Oh.

412
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,930
About that...

413
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,380
"The culprit who stabbed me?"

414
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,600
I've started remembering a few things.

415
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,020
- So? Do you remember what happened? 
 - Uh.

416
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,720
Well... but I don't remember the culprit's face.

417
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,730
Just the fact that someone attacked me in the shower.

418
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,260
He-He attacked me from the back so I didn't see his face.

419
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,710
In the shower?

420
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:34,280
Who was it, though?

421
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,490
Who died?

422
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:42,650
 You're curious about who died rather than who the culprit was? 

423
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,250
I'll send you the culprit's files through Officer Jung.

424
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,420
 Why is he showing such a strong reaction to Officer Jung? 

425
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,380
Get some rest. Put your mind at ease.

426
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,230
Are these all the showers?

427
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,680
Well, yes. That's right.

428
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,790
Ah, there's a closed shower. Could it be that?

429
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,100
Closed?

430
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,600
Where is it?

431
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,290
How long did you say it was closed for?

432
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,330
About two years.

433
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,040
 I put it in this corner, right by the entrance. So that it wouldn't get in the way of the other crew members. 

434
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,480
He said the magic box was in the waiting room the entire time.

435
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,700
It would take about 3 minutes to go from here to the auditorium.

436
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,920
He attacked Na Chi Kook and put him inside the magic box.

437
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,590
He carried Na Chi Kook who was stabbed all over and covered in blood all the way to the auditorium?

438
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,620
That doesn't make sense.

439
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,660
 If I just die 

440
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,780
 and leave without saying anything, 

441
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,710
 she'll spend her whole life looking for Han Kook. 

442
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,070
 Right. I should confess. 

443
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,530
 - Hello, please help me find my son. 
 - I have to tell her the truth. 

444
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,510
Please help me find him. Thank you.

445
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,750
Han Kook's mother.

446
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,000
Officer Jung? Are you better now?

447
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,330
   

448
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:41,080
What... brings you here?

449
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,940
Han Kook...

450
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:52,650
Stop... looking for Han Kook.

451
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,570
What... What do you mean?

452
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,240
Actually, I...

453
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,400
- I... I... 
  - Breaking news. 

454
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,700
 Kim Han Kook, who disappeared and was assumed to have died one year ago, 

455
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,610
 was found dead in an abandoned factory in Gyeonggi Province. 

456
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:26,920
Han Kook! Han Kook! Han Kook!

457
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,630
Han Kook! Han Kook!

458
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,540
Han Kook!

459
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,100
 How? 

460
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,040
 Who did this here? 

461
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,790
''Who did it?''

462
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,660
It was Seong Yo Han, that bastard.

463
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,150
That bastard killed him!

464
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,940
That psychopath bastard.

465
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,930
How were we able to find him here? We couldn't.

466
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:08,410
Can you tell when he died?

467
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,320
He was in formaldehyde, so I can't tell for sure. 
  (TN: A preservative chemical) 

468
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,370
We have to carry out an autopsy to be sure.

469
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:28,880
- This... 
  - Later, the detective will see that 

470
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,230
 I kept up my end of the bargain. 

471
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,190
 You have until midnight, three days from today. Will you give up on Han Kook? 

472
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:47,900
 If you don't find me in three days, the entire country will see Han Kook's body sans his lungs. 

473
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,570
   

474
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:07,710
 After passing the deadline to save Han Kook's life, which was last night, professionals think there's a small chance that he might still be alive. 

475
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,300
This kid...

476
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,870
Does... Does he have his lungs?

477
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:31,790
That horrible jerk. How could he do this to a kid?

478
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,550
I'm sorry... I'm sorry Han Kook.

479
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,110
I killed him.

480
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:50,340
I was busy drinking. I gave up on him.

481
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,000
I just gave up on him. I killed him.

482
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,350
Mu Chi Hyeong.

483
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:02,090
I'm sorry Han Kook. I'm sorry.

484
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,710
The kid's body was found in an abandoned factory?

485
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,780
 Where's Han Kook's body? Hand it over now! 

486
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:33,460
I think he got his memory back. I have to stop him before he does anything.

487
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,010
You...

488
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,430
Give me back my gun.

489
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,680
I said give it back.

490
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,860
Why are you doing this? Tell me why.

491
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,650
It was me.

492
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:14,150
It was  me. 

493
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:18,650
It wasn't Seong Yo Han, but me!

494
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:22,150
Bong Yi's grandmother, Father Go, and Chi Kook...

495
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,690
From the beginning, I killed them all.

496
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,440
From the beginning.

497
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:35,690
Don't you get it? Song Soo Ho, Byeon Sun Yeong, Jo Mi Jeong, Kim Seong Kyu, Park Jong Ho! Everyone!

498
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:41,560
They were kind, good and innocent people but I brutally killed them all!

499
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,510
I'm not human.

500
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,210
I'm a monster.

501
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:53,560
So don't try to stop me from killing myself.

502
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:58,040
Don't try so hard to die. You don't have much time left anyway.

503
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,530
I stopped by Korea to attend a seminar 21 years ago.

504
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,120
I was staying at a colleague's lab.

505
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,310
At that time, I received a package from an unknown sender.

506
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:29,510
 Who sent this? 

507
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,510
 At that time, I knew that Han Seo Joon did a successful brain transplant. 

508
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:02,050
 He wanted to let me know of his success. 

509
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,730
 I was curious what would happen to that rat. 

510
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:11,990
 So from that day onward, I wrote an observation journal. 

511
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:17,090
 Day 3 from discovery. In very good condition. Active and no problems. 

512
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:21,740
 Bowel movement and feeding are good. Weight is 120 grams. 

513
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:28,140
 Day 10 from discovery. Slow movements. Noticeably slow movement and activity. 

514
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:34,220
 Bowel movements and feeding are not good. Eating much less from day 5. 

515
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,530
 Day 20 from discovery. In very bad condition. Very little movement. 

516
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:44,480
 Weighs 70g less than the weight at the time of discovery. Does not eat and is noticeably slimmer. 

517
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:56,800
 Day 30 from discovery. Death. In the end, Han Seo Joon failed.  
    

518
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,350
You are going to die, too.

519
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:14,570
You were hiding that? Just how much are you hiding?

520
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:18,650
From the beginning, you knew all about it? That I'm a predator?

521
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:23,030
Calm down. If I had known, don't you think I would've worked with you?

522
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:26,890
- I was sure it was Seong Yo Han. 
 - How? Why were you sure?

523
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:31,180
Since I tested the baby inside of Han Seo Joon's wife for the gene of a psychopath.

524
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,180
The results showed that the baby in her womb was a psychopath.

525
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:39,180
After I did the genetic test, I left for England so I didn't hear the news about Han Seo Joon's wife.

526
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:44,320
But one day, 25 years later, I got a call from a broadcasting station's PD.

527
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,400
Yes? This is Daniel.

528
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,880
 Hello, I am PD Choi Hong Ju. 

529
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,640
 It's nothing much, but I'm covering a serial killer case in Korea that recently came up. 

530
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,350
 I have a question about the psychopath gene. 

531
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:02,950
At the moment I remembered that child, so I went back to Korea in a hurry and looked for Han Seo Joon's child.

532
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:09,670
I searched and found her house, but I found a dog with signs of abuse from a long time ago at that house.

533
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:14,620
One of the biggest traits of a predator is animal abuse from childhood.

534
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:19,900
So I was anxious and went straight to find the place where her son worked.

535
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,940
 I'm quite good with a knife, too. The carotid artery is in there, so if you got stabbed there, your blood will spurt like a fountain. 

536
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,780
 Such an image will leave quite an impression. 

537
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:32,010
Seong Yo Han showed the traits of a psychopath for sure. There was no doubt about it.

538
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,220
You were wrong.

539
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:39,030
But, do you remember everything?

540
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,150
Yes.

541
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:44,030
All of it.

542
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:48,140
I remember everything from beginning to end so clearly.

543
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,870
Then you shouldn't die irresponsibly like this.

544
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:54,300
You should think about the dead victims.

545
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,260
What can I do?

546
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,690
I tried to confess but the body disappeared.

547
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,400
The only thing to do is to die, but I can't die!

548
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:07,000
You should do what you can. Take care of other predators who have the gene like you do.

549
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,190
So that there won't be any more victims like the ones you killed.

550
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:13,050
That's your way of atonement.

551
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,780
- "Atonement?" 
 - Yeah

552
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,570
Do you think I can be redeemed?

553
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,940
Stop with your nonsense.

554
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,640
Are you going to die?

555
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,570
It's easy to die and not take responsibility.

556
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:31,290
But if you die, what about Seong Yo Han?

557
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:35,980
Because of you, he became a psychopath killer and died. Will you not reveal Seong Yo Han's innocence?

558
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,220
If you die, the truth will be buried.

559
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:44,670
Seong Yo Han will be remembered as a serial killer for future generations and you'll be known as the country's son.

560
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:48,090
Seong Yo Han is fishy, too. Seong Yo Han is also suspicious!

561
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:51,060
He didn't even report me and came to kill me himself.

562
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,970
You said Seong Yo Han has the psychopath gene, too.

563
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,770
No. He had the genius genes. The remaining 1%.

564
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,370
Seong Yo Han was a person who had the good will of an ordinary human being.

565
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,850
With his outward behavior and preconceived notion that he was Han Seo Joon's son

566
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:09,200
I... I mistook him as a predator.

567
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,060
On what grounds?

568
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,010
On what grounds, are you so sure about that?

569
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,640
You are the evidence. You're suffering right now.

570
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,500
If Seong Yo Han was a psychopath, you wouldn't be suffering right now.

571
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:25,400
There are no feelings of guilt, sympathy, compassion, regret in a psychopath's brain.

572
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,520
But look at you right now.

573
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,720
You're in pain. You're suffering.

574
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,040
Now that I look back, it wasn't his memory.

575
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,490
It's not the memory from Seong Yo Han's frontal lobe that was consuming you. It was his feelings.

576
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:43,560
That's why you got feelings of ordinary human beings that you didn't have before.

577
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,550
I'd rather...

578
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:57,010
I'd rather not have those kinds of feelings.

579
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,110
 After being kidnapped by the serial killer, Seong Yo Han,  
    

580
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:07,170
 1 year after his discovery, Kim Han Kook memorial procession is happening throughout the country. 

581
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:10,820
 In particular, a special place will be set up in the amusement park where Kim disappeared. 

582
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,530
 Save that child first. Han Kook who is below you. 

583
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,510
He knew Han Kook was there.

584
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:18,650
 Because of you, he became a psychopathic killer 

585
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:22,200
 and died so unfairly. Will you not 

586
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,790
 reveal Seong Yo Han's innocence? 

587
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,470
 That's right. 

588
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:30,900
 Let's reveal the innocence of Seong Yo Han, who died unfairly. 

589
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,880
 Maybe that's the reason why 

590
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,930
 Seong Yo Han's brain came into my head. 

591
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:38,890
 Maybe that's what he wanted to do. 

592
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,540
I'm sorry, Han Kook.

593
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,490
Ajussi caught the suspect too late.

594
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,330
So that there are no more victims like you,

595
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:56,460
Ajussi will catch all the psychopaths in the world.

596
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,160
I promise.

597
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,590
That way,

598
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:04,450
I'll ask forgiveness from you, Han Kook.

599
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:13,580
   

600
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:20,610
- I want an iced Americano. 
 - Me too

601
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,250
What time was the meeting?

602
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,580
Ah, this week...

603
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:39,630
Ah, let me go get my phone.

604
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,990
It was just getting quiet, but a body appeared.

605
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,320
Don't worry so much.

606
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,290
Aunt, is Eun Chong okay?

607
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,860
Of course. He's sleeping.

608
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,750
Aigo, he's so pretty while sleeping.

609
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,710
Ah, it's okay. Come back slowly.

610
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,360
She's coming late.

611
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:12,840
Let's play.

612
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,580
My goodness, how sad for that baby's mom.

613
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,340
He was found 1 year after he died.

614
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:22,530
That bastard killed a child so horribly like that.

615
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,870
- You said that he's that serial killer bastard's, son, right? 
 - I told you so.

616
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,640
What crime did the kid commit?

617
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,730
I still don't like to see him.

618
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:34,600
Ah, when he grows up, he'll be no joke too.

619
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,740
Would he be any different? He has his father's blood.

620
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,920
Of course. What the? Did the turn go?

621
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,650
Ah, seriously.

622
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,430
Would you sleep?

623
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,640
Ah, seriously!

624
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,170
Gosh.

625
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,480
Isn't it terrible?

626
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,160
She probably didn't know he was like that?

627
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,720
If she knew, would she have given birth?

628
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,330
Isn't it terrible to think about even if it's your own child?

629
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:00,750
I heard it's a son. But is it really Seong Yo Han's son?

630
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,030
Who gave birth to Seong Yo Han's son?

631
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,340
Choi Hong Ju...

632
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,560
   

633
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,820
No, he was sleeping well before but woke up.

634
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,720
Ah, I don't know who he's like but he's noisy.

635
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,810
I'm so tired.

636
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,970
I'm sorry. I'll give you more.

637
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:44,260
Just a little more.

638
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,620
Okay, I got it. I'll go now.

639
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,340
Eun Chong. Why did you cry?

640
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,170
Eun Chong, are you hungry?

641
00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:00,050
Here. Eat.

642
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:04,150
You're not going to eat? Okay, okay, okay.

643
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,750
Hold on.

644
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,100
Aigo, I got it. I got it. I got it.

645
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,530
Why is he crying so much?

646
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:27,210
Oh. I will sing a song. Oh, okay. Okay.

647
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:31,840
Okay, okay, okay.

648
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,560
Here.

649
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:38,520
 Stop crying. Stop crying, drink this milk and hurry and go to sleep. 

650
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,350
 I don't want to! 

651
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,680
 If you don't listen, the Headhunter monster is going to scream and catch you! 

652
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:53,390
 I'm scared! When is mom coming home? 

653
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,600
 When you're scared, 

654
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,400
 there's the song that mom sings. 

655
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,380
 Let's sing it together. 

656
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,020
 Then you won't be scared. 

657
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:14,010
 Mom! 

658
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:16,550
 It's mom! 

659
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:34,450
 Noona! 

660
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,430
 When the car turns a corner, it slows down. 

661
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:56,300
 Wait until then and when I open the door, you got to jump down, okay? 

662
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,700
 Noona. I'm scared, Noona. 

663
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:04,020
 It's okay. Noona will hold your hand tightly and run, so trust me. 

664
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:27,560
 Please help us! Please help us! 

665
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,210
 Please help us! 

666
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,920
 Is there anybody out there? 

667
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,970
 Noona, my legs hurt. I'm bleeding. 

668
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:50,880
 Just hang in there. Just a bit more. 

669
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,840
 I don't want to go. I won't go. 

670
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,020
 We have to go. Hurry! 

671
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,750
 I won't go. 

672
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:05,390
 Stay here. Don't make any noise, got it? 

673
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:07,800
 Noona will bring the police. 

674
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,110
 Noona, no. Don't go. 

675
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,610
 Noona, no. Let's go together. 

676
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,700
You must be in a good mood. You didn't even put any dirt on your face.

677
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:30,010
Your face is so clean that I don't have to wash it.

678
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:34,760
I know, right? These days she doesn't go around trying to dig.

679
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,780
She must've given up.

680
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,960
My baby.

681
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,230
She's not in the ground.

682
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,240
Come and see me. To see me.

683
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,980
 How creepy. 

684
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,780
 No wonder, the baby seemed unusual. 

685
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:06,490
 Once he starts crying, he doesn't stop. 

686
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,840
Where did it go? I definitely put it in my pocket.

687
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,610
No way, that's also...

688
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:58,770
That's the only proof that I'm the culprit.

689
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:00,370
I have to find it.

690
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:03,560
The evidence that I'm the culprit, not Seong Yo Han.

691
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,990
How did Seong Yo Han have photos of the people that I killed?

692
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:31,100
Even though he knew I was the culprit,

693
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,740
why didn't he report it and come to save Han Kook himself?

694
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:46,720
Back then, it seemed like he was trying to say something.

695
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:01,410
- Yes, PD? 
  - By any chance, is Bong Yi not feeling well? 

696
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:04,800
- Why? 
 - She didn't come to work and her phone is off.

697
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,790
 I'm a bit worried. 

698
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:10,390
If you're not busy, can you go?

699
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:13,530
I'm sorry. I'm a bit busy right now.

700
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,350
Our recording is in the afternoon, right?

701
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:31,110
I was worried you were sick. Your phone was switched off, too.

702
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:33,920
You don't look so good.

703
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,900
Bong Yi...

704
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,920
It's not true, is it?

705
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:47,940
You and the bastard who killed my grandmother... It's not true, right?

706
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:52,270
I guess it is.

707
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,260
Is that why you got me a job at the broadcasting station?

708
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,980
Did you think that would ease your guilt?

709
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,210
Bong Yi, that's not it.

710
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:04,820
You knew who I was all along.

711
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:11,030
You knew that Seong Yo Han killed my grandmother.

712
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,440
Then how could you do that to me?

713
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,730
How could you do that to me?

714
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:20,820
Were you with him even on the day he'd come back from killing my grandmother?

715
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,600
Bong Yi.

716
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:30,690
That bastard's child...

717
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:33,600
I'm going to curse him for the rest of my life.

718
01:03:56,930 --> 01:04:00,570
Excuse me, nurse. Sorry to bother you, but can I use a phone?

719
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,280
   

720
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,080
   

721
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,440
   

722
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,220
Did you get the results on that bloodstain?

723
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,470
Yeah. It is Na Chi Kook's blood.

724
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:19,170
But where did you find it?

725
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:22,550
So he actually did get attacked in the showers.

726
01:04:56,430 --> 01:05:01,810
 The real killer of the Mujin serial killings is not Seong Yo Han. 

727
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:08,040
 It is me, Jung Ba Reum. 

728
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:12,270
This mint scent. It was from you.

729
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:15,280
It turns out I killed the wrong guy.

730
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:19,570
I was wondering why Kim Jin Seong kept his mouth shut till the very end.

731
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,700
It was because of you.

732
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,490
To save you.

733
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,400
Idiotic bugger.

734
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:31,430
Tell me about those photos.

735
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:34,240
How did you have them?

736
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,800
Save the child first.

737
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,890
What?

738
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:39,620
Han Kook, who is under you right now.

739
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:46,720
So you've come to save Han Kook. And Oh Bong Yi, too?

740
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,390
Let the kid go. I beg you.

741
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:52,280
That's really too bad.

742
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,240
You're too late.

743
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,860
What?

744
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,670
Go Mu Chi lost the game. He couldn't meet the deadline.

745
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:06,270
I guess he's shocked due to the stones that came out from his brother's body.

746
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:10,220
He has thrown away any thoughts of saving the kid and is busy drinking.

747
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,180
It's is quite a shame. It's a shame for me, too.

748
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:17,170
But what am I to do? A promise is a promise.

749
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:21,610
And so, as soon as the deadline passed, I judged the child.

750
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:28,750
A person without envy is a sinner.

751
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,510
You crazy bastard!

752
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:33,840
Yes, that look! That look in your eyes!

753
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,530
I love such angry eyes.

754
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:42,670
You are very well qualified to become one of my people.

755
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:47,940
By the way, did you come alone? You didn't call any cops?

756
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,100
But why?

757
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,820
So that I could kill you with my own hands.

758
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:57,300
Are you that angry because I killed your friend?

759
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,890
It would be useless to call the cops.

760
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:05,700
If I don't kill you, who knows how many more horrendous things may take place next.

761
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,730
What are you trying to say?

762
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:13,500
Just let me kill you.

763
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,110
That's what's best for you.

764
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,500
What's that look in your eyes?

765
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:26,870
You and I... We're both so pitiful.

766
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:29,000
Pi-Pitiful?

767
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,880
I'm pitiful?

768
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,340
Pitiful...

769
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:37,010
You son of a bitch.

770
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:49,910
Say it again. Am I pitiful?

771
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:57,900
I am God. God.

772
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,600
I am God, how could I be the pitiful one?

773
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:06,820
God? You're just a psychopath with mutant chromosomes.

774
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:56,800
Die, you monster!

775
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,380
 We... 

776
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:31,640
 Seong Yo Han was unfairly sacrificed 

777
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,270
 while trying to save Han Kook and Bong Yi from me. 

778
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:38,600
 So stop condemning Seong Yo Han and his family. 

779
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:47,060
 I don't know how to apologize to the victims and their families. 

780
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:51,510
 Don't ever forgive me. 

781
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:53,270
 God, 

782
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:59,480
 please don't ever forgive me. 

783
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,460
   

784
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,640
   

785
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:30,710
There's a lot of scarring around the area he got stabbed.

786
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:32,940
Yes. That's the only part.

787
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:37,450
All of that scarring means he held on to the knife and endured it for a long time.

788
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:41,780
 He-He attacked me from the back so I didn't see his face. 

789
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:47,140
 That can't be. Na Chi Kook is lying. 

790
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:08,640
Chi Kook.

791
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,140
How are you feeling now?

792
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,250
It's you.

793
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:38,300
I want to live a happy life with my mother.

794
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,370
That's all I want.

795
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:49,280
Please, turn yourself in.

796
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:54,700
It's a pity Seong Yo Han died instead of you.

797
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:58,500
I'm really scared.

798
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:02,280
However, I can't turn a blind eye to this just because I want to live.

799
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,620
That's why you must do it.

800
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:10,070
It must be you. That's how we all live.

801
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:27,300
Officer Jung!

802
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,030
Na Chi Kook. Na Chi–

803
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:42,500
Doctor. Doctor!

804
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,280
Doctor!

805
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,460
Patient, are you okay?

806
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,220
Jung Ba Reum!

807
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:56,480

808
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,210
   

809
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:19,210
 Please open the door. 

810
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:21,910
 We need to look for Han Kook together. 

811
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:27,260
 Damn it. It's no fun if you're like that. 

812
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,740
 Crawl out of there already. 

813
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:31,290
 That's how things will get more interesting for me.
