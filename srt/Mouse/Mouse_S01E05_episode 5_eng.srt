00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,110
   

3
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,720
   

4
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,530
I'm disappointed that you didn't believe me.

5
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,490
And now? Do you believe me?

6
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,540
Don't forget. By the exact time the broadcast ends,

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,910
if you can't tell me why this kid is going to die, he's not going back to his mother.

8
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,550
   

9
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,460
   

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,230
With the bereaved families' consent, we are revealing the victims' real names and faces.

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,880
   

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,260
Knowing that reporting is essential in order to save Han Kook and arrest the criminal,

13
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,950
 the bereaved families made this difficult decision. 

14
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,450
However, homeless Mr. Kim's identity has not been revealed yet.

15
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:30,090
 Based on his skull and statements from other homeless people around him, we drafted a montage. 

16
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,920
Why did you get dirty again?

17
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,210
Did you go to the mountain again?

18
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,730
 Dear viewers, any small tip is valuable. 

19
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,650
 If you have any information, don't hesitate to contact us. 

20
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,300
Detective Go Mu Chi, are there any specific characteristics of this serial murder case?

21
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,690
There are.

22
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,410
In all crime scenes, there was a cross

23
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:09,150
and the victims' middle fingers were bent to point at the cross.

24
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,200
The killer either despises God or feels repulsion toward Him.

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,470
Previously...

26
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,440
 This killing... The boxing gym director who was murdered recently. I am certain that this is the same killer. 

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,240
You assumed that the killers from the murders of  Byeon Sun Yeong and Song Soo Ho were the same person.

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,770
- Didn't it turn out to be true? 
 - Correct.

29
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,520
Also, Song Soo Ho was killed by resentment,

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,340
 And that awakened his murderous instincts. 

31
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,360
 After that, he randomly chose the restaurant employee as his victim. 

32
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,500
You also said that the random killings will continue to happen, correct?

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,200
Correct.

34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,500
Among the seven victims of this serial murder case,

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,980
Song Soo Ho and this elder in her 70s are believed to have been killed

36
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,840
after they discovered the criminal's identity.

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,880
The murders and murder attempt cases were initially believed to be random.

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,010
But then the killer gives you a call.

39
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,610
 You are correct. There is a standard by which I selected my victims. 

40
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,870
He declared himself that those killings were not random.

41
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes. After speaking on the phone with the suspect, I completely reexamined these cases.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,370
The victims' area of residence, school, workplace, hometown, etc.

43
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,430
I thoroughly looked through everything related to the victims, but did not find any connection.

44
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,410
 Then I thought that maybe I was too focused on the case itself, 

45
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,280
 so I started looking at the victims' surroundings from the beginning. 

46
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,880
CEO Jang says he wants to have just one drink.

47
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,170
Do you know how many buildings that man has?

48
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,990
Just turn a blind eye just this once, sit next to him, and be nice to him for a little while.

49
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,150
I don't want to!

50
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,470
Even if I starve to death, I won't do anything that is embarrassing towards my Min Ji.

51
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,310
Fine! Save that body and starve to death.

52
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,730
Seriously, why are you doing this to someone who says they don't want to?

53
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,620
Are you the only one who'll starve to death?

54
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,020
- Your daughter is going to die with you! 
 - Come out! Come out!

55
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,930
Ah, seriously!

56
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,370
 After her husband's death, 

57
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:22,010
 Byeon Sun Yeong was a single mom who was living a tough life raising her daughter while working in the kitchen at a bar. 

58
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,970
   

59
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,990
Park Jong Ho was a young man who worked night and day at part-time jobs.

60
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,230
Hey! Hey!

61
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,410
This instant coffee was found at the scene.

62
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,320
 To Park Jong Ho, this coffee wasn't a preferred food. 

63
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,160
 But a survival tool to overcome sleepiness. 

64
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,260
 Taking the victim's most precious item as if it were a prize of war, 

65
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,760
 he knew very well what this coffee meant to Park Jong Ho. 

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,740
   
   
   

67
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,380
   
   

68
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,970
   
   

69
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,310
   
   

70
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,590
The only victim who survived, Officer Na Chi Kook, 
     

71
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,320
was said to be a very good and upstanding young man.

72
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,120
 His acquaintances have said that he was never able to ignore an injustice. 

73
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,200
 When he was in high school, he even saved a person who was being assaulted. 

74
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,330
   

75
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,470
   

76
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,590
And even homeless Mr. Kim, whose identity is still unknown, 
    

77
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,120
 was said to be very popular among other homeless people. 

78
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,950
 His personality was quiet. 

79
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,490
 And if he had food, he would share with others. 

80
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,870
We received an important tip.  He wants to confirm directly with PD Choi.

81
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,620
But they're requesting to have their voice changed.  They're scared that the culprit will know their voice.

82
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,060
 - And Miss Jo Mi Jeong was—
 - Hello. 

83
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,150
 - a thin college student who weighed less than 40 kilograms. 
 - It's Mi Jeong. 

84
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,630
 Miss Jo, whose family was not doing well. In order to make a living and pay for her tuition, 

85
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,830
 she was a mukbang creator online. 

86
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,750
As you can see, all of these victims

87
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,330
 were disadvantaged in society and were good citizens. 

88
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,710
 Continuing on, we have an informant coming in. 

89
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,790
 We'll connect them. 

90
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,870
Did you said that you have important information regarding the case?

91
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,530
 It's not about the case, but I have something to ask Detective Go Mu Chi. 

92
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,120
 I'll get straight to the point. 

93
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,570
 Detective Go Mu Chi, do you think you are qualified to stand in that spot right now? 

94
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,160
Calls that are not related to the case–

95
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,680
 There are rumors that you frequent gambling places and take bribes from criminals. 

96
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,350
 Is that correct? 

97
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,940
I'm not sure what you've heard, but they're baseless rumors.

98
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,930
 Okay, let's leave it at that.  Then, how about the rumor that you are a member of a bereaved family? 

99
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,940
Remove the voice changer.

100
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,180
But we promised to alter the informer's voice—

101
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,560
- This bastard is suspicious.  I'll take responsibility, so remove it quickly. 
  - I'm asking you. 

102
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,330
 Am I correct? 

103
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,730
- What does that have to do with this case? 
  - Ah, the rumors must be true. 

104
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,770
- Remove it quickly! 
 - I removed it!

105
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,070
But that bastard is already changing his voice.

106
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,040
 Didn't the headhunter decapitate your mom before your eyes? 

107
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,300
 - It must have been a big shock.  
 - Check the caller's number, quick.

108
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,130
 The murder suspect who recently jumped off the roof... 

109
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,920
 Did he really jump off? 

110
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,000
 Perhaps, did you push him? 

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,600
I didn't.

112
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,460
 It's a joke. Of course, you didn't. 

113
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,140
 Surely, a detective wouldn't kill someone. 

114
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:45,200
 But still, in your mind, you wanted to push them many times. Didn't you? 

115
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,330
 You can't seem to answer. What does silence mean? 

116
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,160
 - It's an affirmation. 
 - Is the detective a bad guy? 

117
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,370
 Isn't that right?  Isn't the reason for this broadcast to find and kill that guy? 

118
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,460
 You don't really care whether the kid lives or dies, do you? 

119
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,740
 You are being very patient. 

120
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,080
 The reason why I'm calling 

121
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,030
 is because I'm worried. 

122
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,370
 A person who can't control his emotions when he sees a killer 

123
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,960
 and the fact that you're doing a broadcast like this to save someone else's precious son– 

124
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,640
Worried?  You worry about yourself, you crazy bastard!  You son of a b*tch!

125
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,970
- Hang up quickly! 
 -  Uh oh, did you just curse? 

126
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,740
 If you get this upset with a viewer's straight talk from the bottom of their heart, 

127
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,220
 I wonder what you'd be like in front of the culprit, when you're supposed to be calm and composed. 

128
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,790
   
   
   

129
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,280
 Is he crazy, seriously?  Is this a police officer? 

130
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,310
 Ah, he's really something. 

131
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,680
Detective Go, why didn't you tell me that a member of your family was killed by the headhunter?

132
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,490
Why would you curse?

133
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,770
Everyone is going nuts telling me to remove you.

134
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,460
They said that they can't trust you.

135
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,870
They said that Han Kook might be in danger because of you, so they want the broadcast stopped.

136
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,760
The message board is about to explode!

137
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,900
What are you going to do?  Huh? Seriously!

138
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,550
 Ah, I will cut out for a bit. 

139
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,520
That's correct.

140
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,390
Yes, I...

141
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:35,660
lost both of my parents twenty five years ago to the serial killer called the Headhunter.

142
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,970
If given the opportunity, I would like to catch and kill the bastard who killed my parents.

143
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,220
That's how I feel, honestly.

144
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,260
I understand that

145
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,000
because of my personal vendetta,

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,030
you could think that I want to do this broadcast to catch and kill him.

147
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,550
However, trust me.  The only reason I'm doing this broadcast is to save Han Kook.

148
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,640
This broadcast is the only way to save Han Kook right now.

149
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,290
Please help us to continue this broadcast.

150
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,780
I was wrong.

151
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,520
I will not be swayed by my emotions.

152
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,610
I promise you.

153
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,110
 Sunbae, the courier delivery is here. 

154
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,080
Yes, I am told that an item presumed to have been sent by the culprit just arrived at the studio.

155
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,910
   

156
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,160
Yes.

157
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,730
We just checked the video footage contained in the USB which appears to have been sent by the culprit.

158
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,240
     

159
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,150
Minors and those with a feeble mind or body,

160
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,730
please refrain from watching.

161
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,740
   

162
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,110
 Will you believe me now? 

163
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,170
 It's exactly when the broadcast ends. 

164
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,560
 If you can't tell me the reason why by then, this kid dies. 

165
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,310
 You will see an unforgettable show. 

166
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,870
 We can't tell for sure whether or not the person who sent this video is the real culprit. 

167
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:01,500
Since the kid is wearing a mask, we can't tell for sure whether this kid is really Han Kook.

168
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,040
That's right! That's right! That's right! 
    

169
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,590
The goat man mask Han Kook had on the day of his disappearance,

170
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,320
- and the clothes he was wearing, they are exactly the same. 
 - Han Kook.

171
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,550
However, it is not enough to judge by them,

172
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,550
so we will confirm directly with Han Kook's mother.

173
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,980
The kid in this video, is he your son?

174
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,060
Yes, it's my Han Kook.

175
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,010
Are you sure?

176
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,970
I know my son.

177
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,550
 - It is my son.  
 - I was told to deliver this here.

178
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,640
 There is another courier delivery addressed to the detective. 

179
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,300
What is going on?  What are those two doing?

180
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,380
That's different than what I sent.

181
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,160
What?  What are you talking about?

182
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,940
   

183
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,130
   

184
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,330
It's 8:00 p.m., two hours until the broadcast.

185
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,500
It's over.

186
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,380
Let's do it, the broadcast.

187
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,250
- What? 
 - I am saying let's gamble.

188
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,990
We've got nothing to lose, right?

189
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,080
I remember that I once saw on the news that a killer got infuriated

190
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,220
when the killing was reported as having been done by some other killer.

191
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,970
That's right. Those punks really like to flaunt themselves,

192
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,340
so they can't stand it when someone else gets the spotlight for what they have done.

193
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,540
What if we make a fake, so that it infuriates him?  A fake Han Kook.

194
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,800
   

195
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,270
 What do you think?  It's perfect, right? 

196
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,900
Wow! With the same clothes and the mask on, he looks exactly the same!

197
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,940
Hey Gu Dong Koo, you've got some skills.  Where did you find a kid like him?

198
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,180
My girlfriend is an instructor at an academy for child actors.

199
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,120
My kid does a great job of acting like a frightened kid.

200
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,500
You know it's cash pay, right?

201
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,740
You must keep it confidential, please.

202
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,790
Of course, a child's life depends on it.

203
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,380
Can you do it?

204
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,130
When the video starts playing, I will ask you a question.

205
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,280
I just need to say that it is my son, right?

206
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,490
Yes.

207
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,930
Let's go, hurry.  We only have one hour left.

208
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,960
Here.

209
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,960
- You can do it well, right? 
 - Yes, don't worry.

210
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,800
 I feel disappointed that you really don't believe me. 

211
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,440
 How about it? Do you believe me now? 

212
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,540
He just left.

213
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,350
What is he doing, putting people on standby?

214
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,570
That's not the video footage I sent.  It's different.

215
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,920
I knew something was strange.

216
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,080
   

217
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,610
The courier delivery service...  It's that punk!

218
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,040
Camera 3, on PD Choi, hurry!

219
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,410
 - Ah, yes.  
 - Ah damn, what's going on?

220
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,000
Just now, we checked the video footage sent from the person presumed to be the culprit.

221
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,160
 Detective Go Mu Chi went to fact check. 

222
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,850
 We will continue to answer the calls for any information. 

223
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,810
I... I am not the one.  I am with the courier service.

224
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,450
You can call the company to check.

225
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,480
Then, why did you ran away? You punk!

226
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,880
I was scared! I saw the news.

227
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,880
I thought I got unlucky and got involved in a crime.

228
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,910
This punk!

229
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,910
- It's a burner phone. 
 - What?

230
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,060
You. Where did you pick that item up?

231
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,790
Ah, that is... I was told that it was left inside a locker at Shimjeon Station.

232
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,140
- Shimjeon Station? 
 - Yes.

233
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,280
Then, can I leave now?

234
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,830
We will let you go after we confirm this.

235
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,960
I will go and check the CCTV and come back.

236
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,580
Detective Go, you should hurry up and go in.  You need to  do the broadcast.

237
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,080
Will you be alright?

238
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,770
I am fine.

239
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,340
- You go with him too. 
 - Okay.

240
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,560
Call as soon as you confirm.

241
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,530
 - We will take the next call.  
 - Okay!

242
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,670
- Hello? 
   - Ah, yes. 

243
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:19,970
 Since it's a composite sketch so it's hard to say. 

244
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,770
 But that homeless person, I think he's someone I know.
   

245
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,610
Is that right?  Can you give more details as to how you know him?

246
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,320
I think he is the person who's been sponsoring our orphanage every year.

247
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,520
 But, a few years ago, after experiencing some hardship, he suddenly disappeared. 

248
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,440
 He gave away all his wealth, too. 

249
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,240
If he was a sponsor, were there any photos taken of him?

250
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,020
 Ah, yes. There was one photo of him taken with the orphanage kids. 

251
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,670
Please send it over immediately.

252
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,860
Yes, Detective. I just sent it.  Please confirm it for me.

253
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,420
 The homeless person's identity has been confirmed.
   

254
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,840
It has been revealed that homeless Mr. Kim was the CEO of a once top three transport company in Korea,

255
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,040
CEO Kim Seong Kyu.

256
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,910
After losing his family to an accident five years ago,

257
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,470
CEO Kim gave all his fortune back to society and disappeared.

258
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,400
With "no ownership" beliefs, he practiced sharing in his everyday life.

259
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,600
Just a moment, please.

260
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,920
Uh!

261
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,870
 Thanks to your active sharing of information, 

262
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,040
- Send it to me quickly.
 - we were able to find out the identity of homeless Mr. Kim that the investigators had not been able to do.

263
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,210
Even minor information can become a clue to finding the culprit.

264
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,300
   
   
   

265
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,260
We just received a tip that Han Kook was spotted. We will connect the call right now.

266
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,000
 - You saw Han Kook? 
 - Ah, damn. I finally got through. 

267
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,410
  - Why the hell do you hang up on someone calling with a tip? So rude! 

268
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,170
 Why aren't you connecting my call? 

269
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,710
 You are treating a perfectly normal person like a drunkard or a mental patient. 

270
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,200
- Excuse me— 
  - Detective Go Mu Chi, have you calmed down now? 

271
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,540
- If you make a prank call during a broadcast, you can get penalized— 
  - It's not a prank call though. 

272
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,580
 Do I get penalized even when I call because I am curious about something? 

273
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,400
 It's a fake, isn't it?  The video of the kid you just showed. 

274
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,430
 It really looks fake to me. 

275
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,910
What do you mean "fake?" It is the video footage sent by the culprit.

276
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,530
 I can't believe you. 

277
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,710
 You know, why go through the trouble of hiding the kid's face by putting the mask on? 

278
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,520
 Isn't it because that kid is not Han Kook? 

279
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,440
Okay, I will confirm that video was sent by the culprit for you.

280
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,100
We have secured the CCTV footage of the person who placed the envelope containing the USB with that video footage inside a subway station locker.

281
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,910
Please take a look.

282
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:49,480
The culprit, in order to not reveal his identity, had Han Kook place the envelope containing the USB

283
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,310
inside the subway station locker.

284
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,720
And he used a burner phone to call the courier service to have it delivered to me.

285
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,780
Are you still going to say that he's a fake?

286
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,960
Is he not a fake?

287
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,460
- My Han Kook! 
  - Ma'am! 

288
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,480
- It is my Han Kook! 
 - Ma'am.

289
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,940
What are you doing?

290
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,920
- Why did you lie to me? 
 - Please calm down.

291
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,750
Ah, I am afraid!

292
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,730
Ma'am!

293
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,510
Go to a commercial.

294
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:24,820
 - Please call 911, hurry! 
 - Ma'am. 

295
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,900
I didn't think that far. I should have told her beforehand.

296
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,140
You didn't have time to do that.

297
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,980
- W... Why is she like that? 
 - Thanks for your hard work. Where is Officer Jung?

298
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,930
He's patrolling the Shimjeon Station area with the police, looking for a witness.

299
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,950
- What about you? 
 - To the future Hitchcock, wouldn't this be a more vivid investigation scene?

300
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,580
How can you leave a sick friend and come here by yourself?

301
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,500
- Hong Ju. 
 - Uh, Min Jeong.

302
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,050
About that victim, Byeon Sun Yeong...

303
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,000
I think she and her daughter had called our show.

304
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,080
It was about 2 months ago.

305
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,450
I think she had sent a story to our Confession Care Corner program.

306
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,960
Ah, then the station desktop clock that was at Byeon Sun Yeong's house was—

307
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,450
Yes. We sent a commemorative watch, since the response to the story was big.

308
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,510
The commercial will end in five seconds.  Three, two, one, cue!

309
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,020
There was an unexpected event. 
    

310
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,020
Kim Han Kook's mother received a shock after seeing him on the security camera.

311
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,940
 She has been transported to a hospital and is resting now. 

312
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,370
- Jong Ho, Park Jong Ho. 
  - I am sure that the viewers would also feel the same way as Han Kook's mother. 

313
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,870
 Jo Mi Jeong, a Mukbang  channel streamer. 

314
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,930
 Kim Seong Kyu, CEO of a mid-sized company. 

315
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:44,440
Na Chi Kook, Na Chi Kook.

316
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,700
It's not Na Chi Kook.

317
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,940
 This doesn't fit. 

318
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,830
 Our production team will carefully review everything you send us. 

319
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,290
I found it.  What the victims have in common.

320
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,910
Okay, then. It's confession time. Shall we confess?

321
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,140
 Mom, thank you for raising Min Ji. 

322
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,670
 Min Ji is going to grow up and earn lots of money. 

323
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,200
 Let's live a long time with Min Ji.  I love you, Mom. 

324
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,530
This story tugged at the heartstrings of many listeners on that day and became the talk of the town for a while.
   

325
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,430
Park Jong Ho was a power blogger who had nearly 50,000 blog visitors.  He was an ant man (hard worker).

326
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,220
His blog was open to the public, so that anyone could see its contents.

327
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,800
Jo Mi Jeong was an online mukbang creator with thirty thousand subscribers.

328
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,510
Identified as CEO Kim Seong Kyu, homeless Mr. Kim

329
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,700
 had become a big issue in the media for giving back all this fortune to society five years ago. 

330
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,810
- Have you seen this child...
  - Hey there, young cop! 

331
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,580
Yes, what is it?

332
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,130
They took the CCTV and now they are causing a ruckus trying to open the locker.

333
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,640
- Who is it? 
 - Hurry! Hurry!

334
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,510
The victims had this commonality, with the exception of Correctional Officer Na Chi Kook.

335
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,530
PD Choi Hong Ju had the key.

336
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,870
Yes. Since it was the first news story after I started my job, I remember it clearly.

337
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,550
There was a student who was seriously injured from a group assault.

338
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,680
The detective in charge said that he would have died if they had been a little late.

339
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,740
His survival was possible because of students who saved him from death.

340
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,100
One of the students among them was this person.

341
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:23,120
 Ah, I hesitated because I was afraid, but my friend ran ahead and stopped them. 

342
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,870
 My friend is the great person. I really don't deserve this award. 

343
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,870
This person is prison guard Na Chi Kook.

344
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,590
 Eight years ago, we interviewed Na Chi Kook, who received a Heroic Citizen Award. 

345
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,520
That day, this video was broadcast nationwide on the news.

346
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,740
 Doctor. Excuse me, Doctor! 

347
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,820
 In high school, the person who saved you from under the overpass... 

348
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,760
 Help me! 

349
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,770
 That student is Chi Kook.  Please save Chi Kook this time, Doctor. 

350
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:59,030
 Doctor, please save him. Please save him! 

351
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,260
 If he's the son of Headhunter, then he has the psychopath's blood, right? 

352
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,630
 Shouldn't we decapitate this punk, too? 

353
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,610
 Look at his eyes. 

354
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,550
 These aren't human eyes.  They are the eyes of a monster. 

355
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:29,590
 That's right. The blood of a murderer flows through this body, 

356
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:34,230
 so don't touch me. Or else I'll kill you all. 

357
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,220
 Ah, this bastard. 

358
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,740
 Hey, let's become heroes today! 

359
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,190
 Kill him! 

360
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:55,960
 Here, here!  Please help, here! 

361
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,820
 - Ah, damn! What is this? 
 - Hey, are you okay? 

362
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,560
 He must have died, Ba Reum. 

363
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,210
 - No, he's still breathing. Call 911. 
 - Okay. 

364
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,340
 No. 

365
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,120
Have you caught on?

366
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,900
The victims, whether intentionally or unintentionally, are people whose private lives have been exposed to the public.

367
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:26,430
The suspect hid in his room and listened to the radio, looked through the blog, and watched the online streams.

368
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:31,060
 He choose murder targets by searching the news. 

369
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,350
 They lied to me. 

370
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:44,380
 - "They lied to me."  These words from Han Kook's mother are causing an endless argument.  
 - What's that?

371
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:50,280
 Our fact check team received a tip that the video was a fake, so we have fact checked it urgently. 

372
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:57,580
We got ahold of the video footage of OBN's documentaries Hope for Children where Kim Han Kook appeared a month ago.

373
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,980
We have compared it to the child in the video sent by the suspect.

374
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,890
 Dad, I miss you.  I love you. 

375
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,560
In doing so, we have discovered a surprising truth.

376
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,310
In the program that was aired a month ago,

377
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:18,000
there is a scar about one centimeter long on Kim Han Kook's neck, under his ear.

378
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,850
However, in the video said to be sent by the suspect today, the child does not have this scar.

379
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,230
This child is not Han Kook.

380
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:33,600
Why would the suspect who took Han Kook film another child as a substitute?

381
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,610
In the end, we can only find that this video was filmed by the production crew.

382
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:42,250
 We ask for OBN's Sherlock Hong Ju team's response to our assertion. 

383
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,640
What's going on?

384
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,490
Choi Hong Ju!  Did you make a fake video?

385
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,640
 These two! 

386
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,600
I'm going to refute it.  Get them on the phone.

387
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,340
   
   

388
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,300
You want to refute it?

389
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,270
The video we released was sent by the suspect.

390
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,620
Even though it was confirmed that the child in the video is not Han Kook?

391
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,100
First, we would need to analyze whether the video you made the comparison to was fabricated or not.

392
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,590
So you're saying that the video that was released in the broadcast was definitely not made by you.

393
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,140
- That's right.  I already told you that we're sure that the video was sent by the suspect. 
 - Camera One.

394
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,330
- Tight close-up on Detective Go Mu Chi. 
 - Yes, I understand.

395
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:24,470
We are in phone contact with someone very important right now.  Please connect him. Hello?

396
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:29,450
 The kid wearing the mask in the video is my kid. 

397
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,940
 I took him over because we received a call from the acting academy that my kid attends. 

398
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,930
 Since it is for saving Han Kook, I promised to keep it confidential until the broadcast is over. 

399
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,850
 But still, this isn't right, Detective. Is it? 

400
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,400
So you met Detective Go Mu Chi in person, right?

401
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,920
 Of course!  That lady was also there with him. 

402
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:56,570
So, what you are saying is that PD Choi and Detective Go Mu Chi personally asked for an actor?

403
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,400
 I see. 

404
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:06,270
So why would they create a false video to deceive the public and air a fraudulent broadcast?

405
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,970
It was never a fraudulent broadcast!

406
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,670
It appears that Detective Go Mu Chi is very agitated.

407
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,810
 - Hey, hold on! 
 - We heard your defense. 

408
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,240
- Oh damn. 
  - Wait, don't hang up the call.   

409
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,650
- Put on a commercial! 
 - What?

410
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,510
Yes, we will return after this commercial break.

411
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,550
   
   

412
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:30,170
I will send you two videos right now. The video that we just aired, and a video from the documentary.

413
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,830
Can you please verify whether it's real or fake?

414
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:39,040
 So in the end, it appears that the culprit didn't send this video. So what happened to Kim Han Kook? 

415
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,600
 The truth is, if 48 hours have passed after a child is kidnapped, 

416
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,660
 kidnapping experts commonly consider the child to be deceased at that point. 

417
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,080
- Once the commercial is over, focus on me, please. 
 - Yes, five more seconds.

418
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,010
Three, two, one. Cue!

419
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,030
Yes, I acknowledge it.

420
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,210
As that child's father said, we did create a fake video.

421
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,170
What?

422
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,180
 We believed that if the fake video was aired, the true culprit would contact us for sure. 

423
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,420
It was for the purpose of drawing out the culprit. In this situation we were willing to try anything.

424
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,660
 Yes, Detective Go Mu Chi acknowledged that a fraudulent broadcast was aired. 
   

425
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,480
But we did not play that fake video.

426
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,670
To be more specific, before we played the video we made, the video that was sent by the culprit arrived.

427
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,930
The video that we played on air is definitely the video that the culprit sent.

428
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:30,750
You made a fake video, but you didn't play it on air?

429
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,820
"So you drank, but you didn't drive while drunk?" Yes, I understand.

430
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,850
So we've obtained another piece of evidence?

431
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,920
Yes, we did. Please look at the screen.

432
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,730
This video that was broadcast on OBN shows Han Kook putting an envelope into a locker.

433
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:52,950
And this CCTV video that we just obtained shows a delivery employee taking an envelope out.

434
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,800
The locker that Han Kook put an envelope into is Number 14.

435
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:02,810
Then the locker that the delivery employee took the envelope from is Number 13.

436
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:07,400
The time that Han Kook put the envelope in the locker was 9:50 p.m.

437
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,630
And the delivery employee took the envelope out at 10:10 p.m., 20 minutes later.

438
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:18,010
So have we confirmed who put the envelope in Number 13, and at what time?

439
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:22,880
As you can see, at 9:40 p.m., which is 10 minutes before Han Kook appeared at the lockers,

440
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,180
lockers Number 13 and 14 were both empty.

441
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,770
Very soon after, the train arrived and the passengers came out

442
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:32,480
making it hard to see the lockers because of the crowd.

443
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,350
But once the crowd cleared, Number 13 indicates that it is now being used.

444
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:43,200
So have the contents of what Han Kook put in Number 14 been confirmed?

445
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,340
Unfortunately, we have not been able to confirm that due to police restrictions.

446
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,560
But how can the video created by OBN

447
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,390
and the location that the culprit told Han Kook to leave something at both at Shimjeon Station?

448
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,230
 Not to mention, in lockers that are right next to each other. Should we interpret this as a coincidence? 

449
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:08,870
To analyze this, it appears that the culprit knew that OBN created a fake video and put it in this locker.

450
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:14,370
And he used Han Kook to put in something else in the locker next to it, as if to taunt them.

451
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,950
 So this means that the culprit wanted it to be known 

452
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:23,540
 that the video played by the broadcast station is fake. Can't we interpret it that way? 

453
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:29,100
That lowers the chances of the hostage being alive.

454
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,740
We sincerely hope that Han Kook is still alive.

455
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,880
 We'll be back after the commercial. 

456
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,930
   

457
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,160
Yes, sir.

458
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,090
So the killer made a fake video and sent it to us?

459
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,940
I need to verify the video, but I think you're right.

460
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,790
Why would he do that? Why the hell?

461
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:11,380
Maybe this is what his plan was from the beginning. That we wouldn't be able to finish the broadcast.

462
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,810
We're doing this broadcast because  he  wanted us to. So why would he do that?

463
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,010
The broadcast itself might not have been his goal.

464
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:24,600
By making the broadcast dramatic like this he must have wanted to put himself in the spotlight.

465
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,650
If not that then...

466
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,730
Then what?

467
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,840
What if he set up this entire thing?

468
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,890
- Yes. 
  - Detective Go. 

469
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:47,070
 I stopped the reporters from trying to open the locker next to locker 13. But there's a USB inside that locker too. 

470
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:50,210
A USB? Check what's on it right away.

471
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,660
   

472
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,490
Oh?

473
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,410
   

474
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,800
- Yes. 
  - Detective, this file seems to be corrupted. 

475
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,150
 Nothing is showing up. 

476
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,130
Then, take the USB to Mujin Station. It'll take you five minutes if you go by taxi.

477
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,190
Taxi! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

478
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,290
Thank you.

479
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,730
Come on. Pick up.

480
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,530
This is driving me crazy.

481
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,730
I'm sending another video your way. I need you to restore it as soon as possible.

482
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,940
You need to restore it immediately.

483
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,970
 Wrap up the broadcast. It's the president's orders. 

484
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,200
What do you mean? We still have fifteen minutes remaining!

485
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,160
 Everything's a mess because you rigged the broadcast. 

486
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,950
 The president is fuming! 

487
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,690
Don't argue with me. Wrap up the show after the commercial is over.

488
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,170
 Leave one camera running for the closing remarks. Pack up the rest. 

489
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,930
What are you waiting for? Don't you want your paychecks?

490
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,340
 Just do what I told you to! 

491
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,600
Yes, I understand.

492
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,460
Could you please go as fast as you can?

493
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,520
I will direct the remainder of the show. Detective Go will be the host.

494
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,710
PD Choi, just go back and wrap up the show. We can't continue the broadcast.

495
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,950
We're almost done. Please give us a few more minutes.

496
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,470
You're putting all of us in a difficult position. Besides this is the president's order!

497
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,610
Honey, let's think that he's our Saet Byeol (Morning Star).

498
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,240
Let's think about Saet Byeol and hold out.

499
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:35,230
Ah, whatever. If I'm fired, you have to provide for me.

500
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,420
Thank you, Writer Oh.

501
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,530
Thank you, Director.

502
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,770
- Yeah? 
 - The video is being restored right now.

503
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:46,780
Do it as fast as you can.

504
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,800
I sent them two videos of Han Kook for comparison. Ask them the progress on those?

505
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,420
He's asking, how the comparison of the two videos going?

506
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,740
Oh, that? I just finished comparing the videos.

507
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:59,740
Hey! Open the door!

508
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,350
Open the door right away!

509
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,900
The broadcast starts in five seconds. Focus, Go Mu Chi.

510
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,800
We were able to confirm that

511
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,570
the child in the video that we aired was not Han Kook.

512
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,880
However, the video that we aired is in fact the video sent by the killer.

513
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,010
   

514
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,510
   

515
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,850
   

516
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,850
   

517
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:57,290
The killer made a fake video and handed it to us so that we could play it,

518
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:03,230
only so that we'd fall into his trap and end up having to stop the broadcast midway.

519
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,510
Get that door open right away!

520
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:12,850
 I'm not going to give up on this show. I will save Han Kook. 

521
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,480
Can you zoom in here, please?

522
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,240
You can see something there, right?

523
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,340
Stop this and come on out already, you bastard.

524
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,690
If you're confident enough then stop playing these pranks and come out.

525
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,010
You know my number, right?

526
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,040
Call me, right away!

527
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,140
 Don't say that! You have to save the child somehow. 

528
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,090
   

529
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,310
   

530
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,540
   

531
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,020
   

532
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,000
I got the card.

533
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,240
What are you guys doing right now?

534
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,300
- Do you really want to get fired? 
 - We're almost done.

535
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,970
Drag them all out of here!

536
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,430
Sir!

537
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,480
Sir!

538
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:13,960
 If you don't say the correct answer, as soon as that broadcast is over, right on the dot, I will kill him where everyone in the country can see. 

539
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:21,540
   

540
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,970
Alright everyone, what is it that you see here?

541
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:36,080
It's hard to say for sure because it's quite decomposed but it looks like an insect.

542
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,570
I've got entomologist Dr. Lee Pil Sung on the line.

543
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,650
Doctor, what is this?

544
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:46,310
Please look at it closely. Is it a locust?

545
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,660
 A locust has long wings so it's double the size. 

546
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,190
Then is it a cricket?

547
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,740
 A cricket does has a similar wingspan and a bump on its chest. 

548
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,830
 But this insect doesn't have that characteristic bump. 

549
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:03,170
Then... is it possible that it's a grasshopper?

550
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,880
 Oh, yes, I see it's spines. 

551
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,580
 You can see them under the light brown borderline. 

552
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,370
 It is a black-rimmed grasshopper. 

553
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,600
Thank you for this call.

554
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,270
Yes everybody...

555
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,360
What you're seeing right now is a grasshopper.

556
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,700
It was found in the throat of victim Park Jong Ho.

557
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,230
The killer put it in Park Jong Ho's throat after he killed him.

558
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,940
Guys, what comes to your mind when you hear grasshopper?

559
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:30,000
It's the children's story, 'The Ant and the Grasshopper,' right?

560
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,410
The death of these five victims...

561
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,380
   

562
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,870
   

563
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,710
are related to children's stories.

564
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,500
Detective, I see something in the reflection of the mask that Han Kook is wearing. 
    

565
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,070
It-it's a wall... 
    

566
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:50,740
It's got some pictures and newspaper clippings, but I can't see them properly.

567
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,790
There's a drawing too. Or is it a cartoon?

568
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:58,240
Oh, well, it's not a cartoon. I'll send you a zoomed-in video of what I see.

569
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,640
What's that?

570
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,130
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

571
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,530
I've got it.

572
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:32,750
Hello sir, was Byeon Sun Yeong wearing a hat when she got off work?

573
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,770
Oh, she was?

574
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,470
What was the color of that hat?

575
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,140
Are you sure?

576
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,550
I got it.

577
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,840
The reason why Na Chi Kook's clothes were taken off.

578
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,770
The color of the hat that Byeon Sun Yeong was wearing when she got off work was purple.

579
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,400
However, when she was found dead, she was wearing a red hat.

580
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,340
Mr. Na Chi Kook, unlike the other victims, was found stripped of his clothes.

581
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,850
At the time, I was sure the killer did that to

582
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,240
make sure that no traces of his DNA were left behind on his clothes.

583
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,080
However, there wasn't any DNA on his clothes in the first place.

584
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,440
 That is not all. 

585
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,310
At the scene of the murder of a homeless man identified as Chairman Kim Seong Kyu,

586
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,310
we found an ax, which was the murder weapon.

587
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:25,200
As for Jo Mi Jeong, he went out of his way to move her body

588
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,910
to a vineyard ten kilometers away from her house. Why did he do that?

589
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,770
Listen to me carefully. You're watching, right?

590
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:38,070
I'll tell you exactly why you chose those people to be your victims.

591
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,500
Byeon Sun Yeong: Little Red Riding Hood

592
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,850
Park Jong Ho: The Ant and the Grasshopper

593
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,270
Na Chi Kook: The Emperor's New Clothes

594
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,470
Kim Seong Kyu: The Honest Woodcutter

595
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,930
Jo Mi Jeong: The Fox and the Grapes

596
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:55,240
You're killing people to act out these children's stories!

597
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,470
   

598
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,680
 Bingo! 

599
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,550
We got a call.

600
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,490
Trace the call.

601
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:18,010
 You're smarter than I thought. You actually found the reason. 

602
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,170
Hey, I'm glad you called.

603
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,010
But don't you think you took too long to call?

604
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,570
It wasn't fun talking all by myself.

605
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,940
 I was getting quite frustrated, but now I'm glad because you're getting closer to the answer. 

606
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,940
 I had to compliment you at least. 

607
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,510
 And here I thought that you were doing the show without knowing anything.  
    

608
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:39,240
PD Choi, if you'd known the answer, you should have told us earlier.

609
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,770
First, tell me if Han Kook is safe.

610
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,730
 He's doing very well. 

611
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:47,120
 Okay, so let's hear the answer that you found out. 

612
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,310
I found something interesting in the ending of all the stories you've acted out.

613
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,940
All of them have a lesson.

614
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,070
'The Ant and the Grasshopper' is about the grasshopper who lazed around all day.

615
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,510
'The Honest Woodcutter' is about

616
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:03,120
the woodcutter's greed to have every ax beside his own.

617
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,080
'The Fox and the Grapes' is a story that warns about the fox's gluttony.

618
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,570
 What about 'Little Red Riding Hood?' 

619
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,480
The wolf's lust.

620
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,980
It's a warning against lust.

621
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,210
 Then what about 'The Emperor's New Clothes?' 

622
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:19,110
It was a mockery of the emperor's arrogance. He didn't even realize he was naked because he was drunk on power.

623
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:22,740
 Interesting. So, what's your conclusion? 

624
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,530
Little Red Riding Hood; Lust. The Ant and the Grasshopper; Sloth.

625
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:32,560
The Emperor's New Clothes; Pride. The Honest Woodcutter; Greed.  The Fox and the Grapes; Gluttony.

626
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,750
These are the 7 deadly sins from Dante's Purgatory, you bastard!

627
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,360
We got a signal!

628
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,900
 Oh, that seems possible. 

629
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,090
 But did the people I killed commit those sins? 

630
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,560
 They didn't. Then why did I kill them? 

631
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,770
As to why you killed them...

632
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,790
 Hey, we got the signal. You need to buy us some time. 

633
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:03,850
You know, right? That my parents were killed by the Headhunter?

634
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,430
So, I know psychopaths very well.

635
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,500
I studied quite a bit about them, you see.

636
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,480
They are really meticulous with everything they do.

637
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,590
But you?

638
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,210
You're not like that.

639
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,470
You keep leaving traces all around the place.

640
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:25,020
Try guessing where you slipped up. Let me give you a hint.

641
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,820
It was about 15 days ago.

642
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:33,500
 Detective Go Mu Chi, are you stalling so that you can trace the location of this phone? 

643
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,910
 Or are you just rambling on because you can't find the answer? 

644
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:41,630
 You don't have much time left. Hurry up if you want to save the kid. 

645
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,610
You bastard, I'm not done talking!

646
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,690
Ah, we lost him!

647
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:52,360
Look at this bastard hanging up!  It seems he's got a bad feeling.

648
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,840
The woman that just came to your mind! The woman who you let live 15 days ago.

649
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,200
 I've got it. The reason why Na Chi Kook's clothes were taken off. 

650
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,190
 You need to take this call. I think it has got some important information. 

651
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,900
 Yes, hello? What are you calling about? 

652
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:15,130
 I'm not sure, but I think it was him. 

653
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,380
 Him? You mean the killer? 

654
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,960
 I was working part-time at a supermarket. 

655
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,040
 It was about two weeks ago. I was working alone, at night. 

656
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:35,690
 When someone suddenly held a knife to my throat. 

657
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:42,020
 He told me to eat everything at the supermarket and that I'd die if I didn't. 

658
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:45,460
 I pushed it all in 

659
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:48,360
 and kept swallowing. 

660
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:55,730
 And then, I slightly turned around 

661
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,210
 only to see that there was no one there. 

662
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,150
 Then why didn't you report the incident? 

663
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,160
 Because I was scared. 

664
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:07,210
 How much do you weigh? 

665
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:11,130
 About 38kg. 

666
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,440
 Are you on social media? 

667
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,530
 No, I'm not. 

668
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:21,490
 Have you ever been on TV or something like that before? 

669
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:28,030
 I'm an aspiring model, so I've been in fashion magazines a few times. 

670
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,810
 Magazine? 

671
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:43,480
 Mr. Park Geom, what did you say came out of Jo Mi Jeong's stomach? 

672
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,090
 Wait a minute. 

673
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:49,820
 Her stomach was empty. But there was some food left in her esophagus. 

674
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,640
 Her esophagus? 

675
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,790
 He killed her because she couldn't eat. 

676
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:01,480
 She threw up.  This medicine was found in university student Jo Mi Jeong's drawer.

677
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,680
It's the medicine prescribed to people with anorexia.

678
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,300
 Five packs of ramen, one pan of Tteokbokki, and two chickens. 

679
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,650
 Bye guys! 

680
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,440
She made a living by being doing a mukbang show.

681
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,590
But she would always throw up everything she ate due to a fear of gaining weight.

682
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:24,610
She was anorexic. Gluttonous? She absolutely was not!

683
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,810
In the end, that was the reason.

684
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,670
Why did you kill them?

685
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:34,650
I don't know why, but you have a grudge against God.

686
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:38,520
You kill people then bend their finger so it's facing the cross.

687
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,870
You?

688
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:43,420
You've decided to go against everything God preaches, right?

689
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,150
So you thought those who didn't commit the seven deadly sins were sinners.

690
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:50,380
A person without lust. A person without laziness. A person without arrogance.

691
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,480
A person without greed. A person without gluttony.

692
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,020
A person without envy. A person without anger!

693
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,450
These are the people you consider sinners!

694
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:01,180
That's why you punished them as you pleased!

695
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,430
We got a call.

696
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,520
Just try to hang up the phone again.

697
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,880
 Indeed you are smart, Detective Go Mu Chi. 

698
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,500
 This is why I am your fan. 

699
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,770
Drag it out. Drag it as long as you can.

700
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:25,900
Byeon Sun Yeong.

701
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,950
You killed her because she never fell any temptation and lived for her daughter.

702
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,570
For having no sexual desire.

703
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:36,560
 Even a stupid girl has a nice face. What's wrong with using her body a little? 

704
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,940
You put a grasshopper down the throat of Park Jong Ho, who lived diligently in this world, you crazy bastard!

705
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,260
 That punk wouldn't have died if he lived being more careless. 

706
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:50,680
 What's the point in living like that? He died without saying a peep like an ant under my feet. 

707
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,170
 But it was a lot of fun seeing him resist until the very last moment. 

708
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:56,170
What, you bastard?

709
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:00,040
Don't get worked up. Buy some more time, just a little more.

710
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,240
So what about Jo Mi Jeong?

711
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:09,230
 She threw up after the show, but she acted like she doesn't gain weight. 

712
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:14,560
 As for Na Chi Kook, when I saw him acting humble in his interview, 

713
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,010
 I wanted to kill him quickly to relieve him of his crimes. 

714
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:20,340
That–

715
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,950
That pitiful grandma.

716
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,220
Why did you kill that grandma?

717
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,180
 Why did you kill the grandma, you bastard? 

718
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,020
 Ah, that? 

719
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:35,900
 She was just unlucky. Do you think it was fun for me to kill that old lady? 

720
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,450
 They need to fight back and resist for it to be fun. 

721
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,880
 It was so boring. 

722
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,310
 Does that even make sense right now? 

723
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:47,890
 Did you not think of her family? 

724
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,320
 Are you still human for doing that, you bastard? 

725
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,010
I found the location!

726
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,250
We found it. Track it now!

727
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,290
They got a signal. Just a little more.

728
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,620
 Just a little. Just drag it a little more. 

729
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,250
He stopped. 123 Seongho-dong.

730
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,570
Aigo, we got it.

731
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,050
 That is not the answer to my question. 

732
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,720
 Why does the child die when the time runs out? 

733
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,500
There was bread next to where Han Kook disappeared.

734
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,470
You lured Han Kook with this bread.

735
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:30,270
But Han Kook couldn't go home in the end. Even the birds didn't eat this bread.

736
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:32,600
 Bird? Oh... 

737
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,230
Right. You wanted to use 'Hansel and Gretel' to prove something regarding one of the sins.

738
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:39,430
 So what is the child's crime? 

739
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,200
 We are almost there. We have him surrounded. 

740
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,130
There are two left in the Seven Deadly Sins, envy and anger.

741
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:48,330
Start the VCR.

742
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:51,640
 Do you not hate your Korean father, who is in Korea, for abandoning you? 

743
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,240
 No. I don't hate him. 

744
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,250
 My father must have a reason too. 

745
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:02,350
 Do you want to say something to your father, since he might be watching TV? 

746
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:06,250
 Dad, I miss you. 

747
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,040
 I love you. 

748
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,390
You watched this.

749
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,570
 So? 

750
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:14,190
The ending of 'Hansel and Gretel.'

751
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:19,250
The witch who ate children would put them in a pot and kill them, right? Out of anger.

752
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,720
Because of anger!

753
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,740
You wanted Han Kook to be mad at his father for abandoning him. You wanted him to be furious.

754
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,230
 We have arrived. 

755
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:32,140
You are about to kill an innocent child for an absurd reason.

756
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:37,640
There. I got it right.

757
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,540
Now stop this shit and let the child go.

758
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:51,080
The criminal is inside. He is watching the broadcast while on the phone.

759
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,640
 Keep the criminal focused on something else so he doesn't care about anything else. 

760
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,470
 You think you've become a god, huh? 

761
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,220
Good. Keep delaying.

762
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,820
You chose people who didn't commit the seven deadly sins and punished them however you wanted.

763
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:06,690
It's as if you think you've become a god.

764
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:08,880
But what will you do?

765
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,230
You are not a god. Heck, you're not even human.

766
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:14,500
You are just a horrible monster.

767
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,390
A monster that can never be saved.

768
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,930
You're worse than trash...

769
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:22,250
 You are a pitiful bastard. 

770
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:33,630
 Is this the Headhunter doing things again? Is the head cut off this time too? 

771
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,490
 The people have lost trust in the police for not being able to catch the Headhunter, 

772
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:40,610
 for about a year. Why can't he be caught? 

773
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:43,980
 Is it because he's too smart for the police? 

774
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,840
 Smart? 

775
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,860
 You mean that punk? 

776
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:54,320
 That bastard should've never been born into this world. That mutant monster bastard. 

777
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:57,500
 A bastard who couldn't be thrown away. 

778
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,400
 Hyun Soo. 

779
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,370
 Hyun Soo! 

780
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,600
Hey.

781
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:40,440
I gave you what you asked of me.

782
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,510
Keep your promise.

783
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:43,560
 There is a child inside. Be careful. 

784
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,740
 Make sure to enter so the child doesn't get hurt. And take the guy alive. 

785
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:56,120
Don't move! Don't move! Get down!

786
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,060
 Don't move! 

787
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,790
 We caught him. 

788
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:03,840
You are finished, you bastard!

789
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,610
 You are wrong. 

790
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,060
Why?

791
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,900
 Honey, what's going on? 

792
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,060
 I asked what's going on? 

793
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:18,920
What happened?

794
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,270
 Why are you doing this? 

795
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:28,650
 There's not much time left until the promised time. If you want to save the child, hurry up. 

796
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:40,200
- Calm down, Detective Go. 
  - Hey, it's because of anger. 

797
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,140
I got it right. Where is the child?

798
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:51,260
We just restored the USB from Shimjeon Station.

799
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,750
Where is the child, you bastard!

800
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,000
Come out right now!

801
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:11,530
Hello... Hello!

802
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:13,650
- Put it on screen. 
 - Huh?

803
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,730
Put it on screen!

804
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:17,760
Are you crazy? You can't!

805
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,530
If you don't want to get fired, hurry and put it up!

806
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:22,140
This crazy–

807
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,090
Grab her. Hurry and put it up!

808
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,400
Let go! Let go!

809
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,170
- I said, let go! 
 - Where's the child?

810
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,880
Look over there.

811
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,250
 He had to get angry and not Han Kook. 

812
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:43,610
 He feels guilty for having no wrath. 

813
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,790
Hurry and end it you crazy bastard!

814
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,030
Close up on Go Mu Chi!

815
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,040
Pr-Priest!

816
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:02,750
 I told you that if you don't answer me before the broadcast ends that I will kill him. 

817
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,880
 Time's up. 

818
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:10,860
Hyeong.

819
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,370
 How does this make sense? 

820
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:16,040
 The Headhunter killed his parents by cutting off their heads 

821
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:21,120
 and made his body this way, but he forgave him. 

822
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,200
 It's quite a sight. 

823
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,950
 It was very natural for me to live filled with anger. 

824
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:32,490
 I think that anger was what gave me the strength to stay alive to this day. 

825
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:38,640
 But everything changed once I decided to forgive him. 

826
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,300
 I should live more diligently for my brother's sake. 

827
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:50,640
 I slept like a corpse the day I returned from telling Han Seo Joon that I forgave him. 

828
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,130
 I was able to get deep sleep for the first time after that day. 

829
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,990
Hey! You bastard!

830
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:00,280
I'm going to kill you if you lay a hand on my brother!

831
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,300
You bastard!

832
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,710
 Did you say anger is a sin? 

833
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:06,510
 Why? It's a sin not being angry. 

834
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:10,770
 Get mad at him. Let your anger out. 

835
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:13,290
 If you do, I'll forgive you of your sins. 

836
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:17,550
 Alright. Unleash your anger. 

837
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:19,700
 Hurry! 

838
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:24,540
Hyeong. Do it. Curse that jerk.

839
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,480
Please!

840
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:30,130
He killed our parents.

841
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:34,540
You want to kill that bastard, Han Seo Joon, too. Please.

842
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,540
 Mu Chi. 

843
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:43,250
Then get mad at me. Get mad at me.

844
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,740
I made you that way.

845
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:51,650
If I hadn't made a noise that night in the camper, that wouldn't have happened to your hand.

846
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:55,470
I just watched as you were getting beat up by the bastard.

847
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:59,640
Hyeong, I... I made you that way.

848
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,100
 I'm sorry, Hyeong. It's all my fault. 

849
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,760
 You forgave the bastard because of me. 

850
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,170
Please be angry with me. I'm begging you.

851
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:15,010
 Mu Chi. I have never hated you. 

852
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:18,190
No, no. Hate me.

853
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,800
Please hate me.

854
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,700
I don't want to see you break down or

855
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:29,590
destroy your life for revenge.

856
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:39,470
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

857
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:43,310
Let my brother go. I'm sorry!

858
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:45,370
Oh, what do I do?

859
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,330
It's all my fault.

860
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:53,490
I acted out against you without knowing any better.

861
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:54,970
 - I'm sorry.  
 - Oh, okay.

862
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,940
Ah, I understand. Thank you!

863
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,800
Taxi!

864
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:04,610
Sir, please take me to Irae-dong Cathedral!

865
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:06,440
Quickly!

866
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:15,610
 Kill me. 

867
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:18,700
 Kill me! I'll die in his place! 

868
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,740
 I'll die in his place. 

869
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,870
 Please don't kill my poor older brother. 

870
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:25,210
 Please let my brother go. 

871
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,360
Mu Chi. I'm okay.

872
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,570
No matter what happens to me, it's not your fault.

873
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:33,450
Alright?

874
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:37,760
 It's your last chance. Get mad. Be furious 

875
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,550
 with the Headhunter who killed your parents and at the world that didn't execute the jerk. 

876
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,340
 Unleash your anger toward them. 

877
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,500
 Please. Hyeong. 

878
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:56,070
 My beloved brother, 

879
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,070
I'm–

880
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:02,530
I'm forever sorry to you.

881
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:06,570
Hyeong, please. Hyeong!

882
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,880
I'm sorry.

883
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:14,840
No, don't!

884
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,340
No!

885
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,770
   

886
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,630
   

887
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,870
 You think you've become a god, huh? 

888
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:49,650
 I've seen punks like you. 

889
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:56,500
 You passed judgement on those who did not do the opposite of what God declared as sin and appointed them as sinners. 

890
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:00,810
 You fell into a delusion that you were a god. 

891
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:13,110
 But what should we do? 

892
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:16,250
 You are not a god. Heck, you're not even human. 

893
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:22,030
 You are just a horrible monster, you bastard. 

894
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,780
 A monster that can never be saved. 

895
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:51,460
   

896
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:22,040
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 🐭  The Mouseketeers 🐭 @Viki.com 

897
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,800
   

898
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:34,710
 He knew we were making a fake broadcast, so he made a fake one as well. 

899
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,040
 How did he know? 

900
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,240
 Did he really bug us or something? 

901
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,630
 You were Kim Joon Sung's last call before his death. 

902
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,550
 Are you okay? 

903
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:47,370
 Someone came by the day of Officer Na Chi Kook's mishap, right? 

904
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,540
 Who? 

905
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,760
 Did you catch that guy? 

906
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,890
 Did you see his face? 

907
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:57,320
 Did you found Bong Yi's grandmother's DNA at that doctor's house?
