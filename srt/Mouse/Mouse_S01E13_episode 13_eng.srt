2
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,070
   

3
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,650
   

4
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,850
 It's too late for an abortion, Ji Eun. 

5
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,090
 Then what do I do? Are you telling me to give birth to a murderer? 

6
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,010
This is probably for the best.

7
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,090
Please kill me.

8
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,880
Kill me, please.

9
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,540
Crazy wench.

10
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,200
I'll kill you if that's your wish.

11
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,660
Why did you save me?

12
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,530
You should have left me to die!

13
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,050
You should have let me die.

14
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,560
Why?

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,230
Why!

16
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,000
Make sure to have that child.

17
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,200
Why did you save me?

18
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,360
You should have let me die...

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,010
 - Another murder in Suseong– 
 - It's Suseong again. 

20
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,240
 During the past two years, 10 murders have taken place. 

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,300
 The serial murderer of Suseong has finally been caught. 

22
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,290
 Mr. Kim, a worker at Seokpo Smelting Plant, made a confession– 

23
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,030
 The Suseong serial murderer, Mr. Kim, received life imprisonment. 

24
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,170
   

25
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,920
   

26
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,210
   

27
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,530
   

28
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,610
   

29
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,130
   
   
   

30
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,690
   
   

31
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,400
    

32
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,960
   
   

33
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,540
   

34
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,510
 You're not asking why Bong Yi was released. 

35
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,060
Detective Shin found the crime weapon right here.

36
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,930
Not Bong Yi's knife, but the real weapon. The one that cut off Kang Duk Su's privates.

37
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,820
That's why Bong Yi was cleared of the crime.

38
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,000
- Yoo Na? 
 - Yes, it seems she saw something.

39
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,420
 What the hell did you see? 

40
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,010
 There's no way she would have seen my face. 

41
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,380
 I have to stop her from meeting Yoo Na. 

42
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,760
What is it? I sent over all of the evidence.

43
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,350
The clothes Bong Yi wore to the hospital

44
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,100
and the clothes that were seen on PD Choi's black box are different.

45
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,710
Miss Oh Bong Yi.

46
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,640
Could you come to the police station?

47
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,380
What did you see?

48
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,400
It was you, wasn't it?

49
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,370
Bong Yi hasn't said anything?

50
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,930
Yes. She refuses to say anything.

51
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,900
That will only put her at a disadvantage.

52
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,620
But... you can't be sure that Bong Yi's knife was the murder weapon.

53
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,600
Shouldn't you look into it further?

54
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,810
We searched everywhere and found nothing.

55
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,230
The water flow was rougher because of the rain that day.

56
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,720
If an object floated downstream,

57
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,180
then due to centrifugal force, couldn't it get caught somewhere along the riverside?

58
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,310
 Yes, Sunbae. I found it. 

59
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,640
I can't believe it got caught here. The Heavens really helped us.

60
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,740
Besides Kang Duk Su's DNA, we found someone else's DNA on the murder weapon.

61
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,600
What?

62
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,890
A totally incomprehensible result came out.

63
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,970
I'm not sure how I should interpret this situation.

64
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,670
It came from an inmate.

65
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,260
What? What does that mean?

66
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:56,960
The DNA from the knife that killed Kang Duk Su is from someone who's currently serving time in prison.

67
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,800
Someone in prison?

68
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,810
I mean, how can an inmate's DNA be found here?

69
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,110
That's why I'm so confused right now.

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,420
He planted it here on purpose.

71
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,540
On purpose? The killer, you mean? Why?

72
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,160
Why do you think? He's goading us.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,010
By putting the DNA of someone in prison on the weapon, someone whose alibi is 100% provable,

74
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,800
he's saying, "No matter how hard you try, you can't catch me."

75
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,670
He's trying to show the police that he's confident. That he's not scared. He's mocking us.

76
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,990
Do you really think... that's the real reason?

77
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,950
Why are you holding onto that money so much?

78
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,740
It's nothing. 
    

79
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,770
Bong Yi, it's all over now.

80
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,970
Just dream of happy things from now on.

81
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,720
By the way, what is your dream?

82
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,700
Dream...

83
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,160
I've never had the luxury to dream.

84
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,160
You should do so from now on. Dream of something that makes your heart race.

85
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,500
Was your dream always to be a producer?

86
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,910
No.

87
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,670
Someone else's dream became mine.

88
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,240
Right. Why don't you come work with my team?

89
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,050
Me?

90
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,880
I mean,

91
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,710
I never went to college. I haven't even graduated from high school.

92
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,510
- Your academic background doesn't matter. 
 - No.

93
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,820
What could someone like me do? I can't do something like that.

94
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,830
Think about it and give me a call.

95
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,990
Yes.

96
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,030
   

97
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,600
Why is Yoo Na still not here?

98
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,620
Did she go to the police?

99
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,020
That won't do. I really hope not.

100
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,270
 The number you have dialed is switched off. 

101
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,990
There you are.

102
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,730
Where were you? I have been looking for you for a while now.

103
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,130
No, you see I have to meet Yoo Na.

104
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,120
But Yoo Na isn't home.

105
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,000
She moved away.

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,650
She moved?

107
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,690
Yoo Na wanted me to show you this.

108
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,160
 Unnie, I'm sorry I couldn't say bye before leaving. 

109
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,110
 It was you, right? 

110
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,140
 I saw this when you locked the door. 

111
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,070
 Thank you. 

112
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,980
 If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here right now. 

113
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,360
 I would've probably already died, right? 

114
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,610
 I'll keep this secret until I die. 

115
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,960
 Even from mom and Bong Yi. 

116
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,410
 I promise. 

117
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,770
 I'm going to forget all of it. 

118
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,000
 Red Sun!  
  (T/N: A catchphrase accompanied with a hand gesture that supposedly induces hypnotism.) 

119
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,100
 Thank you so so much. 

120
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,470
 I did go to see you, unnie. 

121
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,420
 But the police officer said I couldn't meet you then. 

122
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,460
 Ahjusshi, give me your phone. 

123
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,040
 Unnie, I'm sorry I couldn't say bye before leaving. 

124
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,010
 I'm going back to the neighborhood I used to live in. 

125
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,190
 Thank you. 

126
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,300
 - Mom! I love my room. 
 - You do? 

127
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,660
 Yoo Na help me pick this up. 

128
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,110
 Mom promised me that she'd never drink again and even go to therapy. 

129
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,480
 Once I move, I'll be going to school too. 

130
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,720
 I have a dream now. 

131
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,740
 I want to grow up to become like Oh Bong Yi Unnie. 

132
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,530
 I'll grow up to become just like you, unnie. 

133
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:39,340
 Unnie is way cooler than Goatman and Ladybug. She's my hero forever. 

134
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,750
 - Bye Unnie! 
 - Bye! 

135
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,030
I... It's not like I did something great.

136
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,030
I want to become an adult that Yoo Na can always look up to.

137
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,260
 Is this what you call a proposal? Do you have any common sense at all? 

138
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,070
 If you're a rookie then do your job right, like a rookie should. 

139
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,680
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,130
I did try my best.

141
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,100
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,190
 Right by the entrance, you'll find a desk. 

143
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,350
 That's where I sit. 

144
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,350
 It's right next to the bathroom, so it smells terrible. 

145
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,990
 Since no one wants to sit there, that desk ends up becoming the rookie's. 

146
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,880
 But I really like my seat. 

147
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,830
 Why? 

148
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,850
 So what if it smells a little? 

149
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,430
 I'm just really glad that I have a seat in the broadcasting station. 

150
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,330
 Do you like it that much? 

151
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,220
 Of course. It had been my dream since I was young. 

152
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,730
 To become a producer that was just and stood for the truth. 

153
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,920
 A PD that made a world that's just and fair. 

154
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,510
 That dream... 

155
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,610
 probably won't come true anymore, right? 

156
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,910
 No, unnie. 

157
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,350
 We can survive this and escape. 

158
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,870
 Let's make sure we do that. 

159
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,980
 Alright. 

160
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,340
 Hyun Soo, I will promise you this. 

161
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,650
 No matter what, 

162
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,590
 I'm going to get you out of here. 

163
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,290
 I'm sorry, Unnie. 

164
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,740
 I wanted 

165
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,590
 to make your dream come true. 

166
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,850
 But I don't deserve to do that. 

167
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,890
- Yes, Bong Yi? 
 - I'm going to do it.

168
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,740
The job.

169
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,250
I want to find my dream.

170
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,600
What's with that expression? Didn't things end up well?

171
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,080
I almost killed that little girl.

172
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,880
But you didn't kill her.

173
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,190
That's only because she promised to keep it a secret.

174
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:51,070
That's just an excuse. You weren't able to kill her.

175
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,130
I wasn't able to kill her?

176
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,900
I was sure you wouldn't kill the child.

177
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,180
If I had really thought that you were going to kill her,

178
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,750
I would have stopped you by all possible means.

179
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,770
Why?

180
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,140
How were you so sure that I wouldn't kill Yoo Na?

181
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,630
Inside your brain, Jung Ba Reum and Seong Yo Han

182
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,210
are still fiercely fighting.

183
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:22,240
But right now, the good instincts are overpowering the predator instincts.

184
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,400
I almost killed Hoon Seok.

185
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,220
And the cat I'd been raising...

186
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,650
That was the moment when the suppressed murderous instinct awakened.

187
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,820
You lost control because it was the first time.

188
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,620
But you were able to take out that murderous instinct on Kang Duk Su.

189
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,100
Things will be quiet for the time being.

190
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,240
For the time being?

191
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,050
That means you never know when it might come out again.

192
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,270
By the way,

193
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,050
if you didn't want to frame Bong Yi for it,

194
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,520
then why did you kill Kang Duk Su like that?

195
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,610
 I wanted to punish him with the knife that 

196
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,320
 Bong Yi's grandmother had planned on killing Kang Duk Su with. 

197
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,630
 So I went to the evidence storage room to take that knife. 

198
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,940
 And that's where I saw it. 

199
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,070
 Whoever kills a human being is to be put to death. 

200
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,620
 A wound for a wound. 

201
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,190
 An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. That's how one must repay one's crimes. 

202
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,530
 The moment I read that, I decided that's how I wanted to kill him. 

203
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,790
I think Seong Yo Han made that gym director Song Soo Ho read it when he killed him.

204
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,720
The reason that verse came to my mind right away,

205
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,420
must have been Seong Yo Han's influence.

206
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,200
I wonder what Song Soo Ho did to Seong Yo Han, that made Seong Yo Han take revenge in such a cruel manner.

207
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,710
He hit him until his cartilage was completely worn out

208
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,770
burnt him alive.  And even

209
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,250
stabbed him in the heart.

210
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,160
Did you meet Lee Jae Sik?

211
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,660
Yeah, well.

212
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,740
He was so shocked that he was trembling to the extent he couldn't even speak.

213
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,750
It makes sense that he's shocked. His DNA was found on the weapon that killed Kang Duk Su.

214
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,690
- So was he suspicious of anyone? 
 - I'm telling you, the guy couldn't even speak.

215
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,980
But he said he shared a cell with Kang Duk Su last year.

216
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,300
Attention. Among the inmates who have been in contact with Lee Jae Sik,

217
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,060
find out if there's anything out of the ordinary about the guys who have been released.

218
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,380
Also, find out if any of the inmates that shared a cell with Kang Duk Su and Lee Jae Sik

219
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,220
have been released from prison recently.

220
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,050
- Yes! 
 - Make it quick.

221
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,900
 - Camera? 
 - Detective Kang said he'd return the camera sometime today.  
    

222
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,920
   

223
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,400
What is this?

224
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,780
Why is she broadcasting this, again?

225
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,590
 I left it there when I went to help Bong Yi. 

226
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,540
 The special investigation team wanted to see what was filmed. 

227
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,960
 They said it didn't have anything of importance and would return it today. 

228
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,100
 A car without any headlights on came rushing at me. 

229
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,370
 As I was trying avoiding that car, my bicycle rolled down the bridge. 

230
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,470
- Hey, Officer Jung. 
 - Detective Go.

231
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,490
Why did you suddenly video call me?

232
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,680
Ta-Take a look at this. You're always riding a bicycle around, right?

233
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,710
Take a look at this.

234
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,110
What is this?

235
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,630
Oh? Oh, that's the new mini black box from Geo Cam.

236
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:28,120
It's really small so it's very popular among cyclists.

237
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,640
But it's probably not released yet.

238
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,770
- So you're saying this is a black box for bicycles? 
 - Yes.

239
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,600
 Got it. 

240
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,490
Whose...

241
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,890
bicycle?

242
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,770
What if that bicycle

243
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,220
had a black box?

244
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,950
Then it would have definitely caught me on it.

245
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,090
Hyeong Sik, Hyeong Sik come on out!

246
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,100
- What is it, father? 
 - He's asking about something you put on your bicycle.

247
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,620
What?

248
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,570
Ah, you called after seeing it on the "on duty" mart, right?

249
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm a power blogger, you see.

250
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,400
The company begged me to try it and review it.

251
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,880
It uploads automatically.

252
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,390
- And its performance– 
 - Where is it right now?

253
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,390
He's a detective.

254
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,490
- Where is it? 
 - Ah, it's inside.

255
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,710
Please come in. It's this way.

256
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,080
Damn it! Please find it for me, Detective.

257
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,150
Ah, I bragged so much about it!

258
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,220
How did those freaking thieves know where I lived?

259
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,670
But you're saying you saw it on your bicycle an hour ago?

260
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,740
That's right.

261
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,630
Did someone steal it?

262
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,900
Show me what you uploaded on the site.

263
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,220
Here.

264
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,430
   

265
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,580
Anyone could easily tell that it's this house.

266
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,120
The drawing is a killer, isn't it? I'm a member of the graffiti club as well–

267
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,650
You might as well have advertised that you wanted someone to come and steal it.

268
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,220
Can a police officer speak informally to someone they're meeting for the first time?

269
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,450
The thief probably wouldn't even report it even if the killer's face was recorded on it.

270
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Why did you come all the way here?

271
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,440
Oh, I was...

272
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,240
curious as well.

273
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,410
   

274
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,400
- You're here. 
 - Hello.

275
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,140
I have to cover a case. Do you want to come with me?

276
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,960
Really?

277
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,410
Detective, did you catch the thief who stole the black box?

278
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,710
No, goddamnit.

279
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,940
I knew it'd be like this. He's the one who stole it, so he won't report it.

280
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,050
Out of all the things to steal, why'd he steal that?

281
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,000
What are you looking at right now?

282
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,730
The Lee Jae Sik case.

283
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,800
The inmate whose DNA was found on the weapon used in Kang Duk Su's murder.

284
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,450
He saw someone trying to rape his daughter, so he assaulted him.

285
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,910
- That guy died, so he received 5 years of imprisonment.
 - I see.

286
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,280
I mean, was he supposed to just watch as someone tried to rape his daughter?

287
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,550
What a shitty law.

288
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,190
That's true. He must find it quite unfair.

289
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:42,070
- Ah, that's right, Lee Jae Sik lived in the same room as Kang Duk Su. 
 - What?

290
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,810
Lee Jae Sik was with Kang Duk Su at the Anyang Prison.

291
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,070
Then six months ago, he was moved to the Mujin Prison.

292
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,380
Oh... But what does the two of them living in the same room have to do with

293
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,030
Lee Jae Sik's DNA being on the murder weapon used to kill Kang Duk Su?

294
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,040
Kang Duk Su was released more than a year ago.

295
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,270
That's right.

296
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,530
   

297
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,300
He graduated from a clothing academy and worked at a factory that dyes jeans.

298
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,670
He really lived diligently.

299
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,700
They gave a person like this five years?

300
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,720
But why was this person's DNA planted there?

301
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,600
I need to meet with him myself.

302
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,760
Detective, let's go together.

303
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,900
You should put in a request for a retrial.

304
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,480
It's only possible to get a retrial if there is new evidence.

305
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,310
I mean, the statute of limitations has passed.

306
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,490
Wouldn't it be nice if the real culprit would confess?

307
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,350
To release someone who was unfairly accused.

308
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,760
   

309
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,400
 I'm okay now. 

310
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,360
What do you mean, you're okay?  I thought your daughter was getting married in a few days.

311
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,540
You said you were upset because you couldn't see that.

312
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,240
5253, you have a visitor.

313
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,270
That's right.  The broadcasting station was going to ask me about Kang Duk Su.

314
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,050
I'll be back.

315
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,870
I'm here to cover Lee Jae Sik.

316
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,930
- Just a moment please. 
 - Okay.

317
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,580
Hey, Dong Koo!

318
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,910
Hey, Bong Yi!  What are you doing here?

319
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,220
- Have you been well, Dong Koo? 
 - PD Choi!

320
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,710
I became the youngest writer on the Sherlock Hong Ju team. Today is my first day.

321
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,670
Really?  How did you–

322
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,730
Ah, you used the PD Choi chance.

323
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,740
Ah, but I think you're making a mistake.

324
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,680
- Bong Yi is only good at fighting. 
 - Do you want to die?

325
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,030
See that?  How could a writer use such one-dimensional words?

326
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,780
Hey, do you really want to die? You're not even worth my one fist. You can't even fight.

327
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,110
Are you here for coverage?

328
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,970
Yes, I came to cover Lee Jae Sik.

329
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,100
- Ah, because of the Kang Duk Su case? 
 - Yeah.

330
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,430
- I have to write something for a moment. 
 - Okay.

331
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,140
Oppa, what crime is that grandpa in here for?

332
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,550
He looks like someone who wouldn't even need laws. 
  (T/N: Means someone would be good even without laws.) 

333
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,040
Well, the thing is, the Suseong serial killer case–

334
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,390
- What? He's the culprit of that case? 
 - No.

335
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,930
Hey, I totally have goosebumps!  Look at this!

336
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,820
- It's not that. 
 - That's so unexpected!

337
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,920
- Is he an usual suspect or what? 
 - Hey!

338
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,090
But why is a person like that looking with such kind eyes?

339
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,770
Bong Yi, it's time.  Let's go.

340
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,880
- Okay. 
 - Okay. 
-  Hurry and go.

341
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,010
But... I'll get in touch with you later.

342
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,600
- Okay. 
 - Ah!

343
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,610
Bong Yi, are you okay?

344
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,200
What are you doing?  Huh?

345
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,950
- I'll hold this. 
 - Okay.

346
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,680
Let's go.

347
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,980
Lee Jae Sik is an honest man.

348
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,100
He's never had a problem throughout his time in jail.

349
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,130
He's a model inmate.  He has suffered a lot.

350
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,960
He'll be released in a few days.

351
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,400
Could I meet with him right now?

352
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,160
Please wait a moment.

353
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,560
- He's in the middle of an interview right now. 
 - An interview?

354
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,360
Well, I was shocked.

355
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,250
- How did my DNA get there? 
 - Right...

356
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,980
You lived in the same room as Kang Duk Su?

357
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,560
- Yes, it was really brief– 
 - Oh Bong Yi.

358
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,800
- Oh, Ahjussi! 
 - Bong Yi.

359
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,700
- Oppa! 
 - Why are you here?

360
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,870
Ah, the thing is, from now on–

361
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,340
Take Bong Yi and go outside.

362
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,780
- Why? 
 - Go outside!

363
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,050
Why is she here?

364
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,610
She's working with my team.

365
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,230
So you brought a young kid to this place full of criminals?

366
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,280
I understand. Let's talk about it later. Right now I'm in the middle of an interview–

367
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,940
Did you attach this yourself?  The thing on your clothes.

368
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,760
Oh, yes.

369
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,650
I went to a clothing academy, so I like making things like this.

370
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,540
Then did you attach this to Kang Duk Su's clothing also?

371
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,310
- We're in the middle of an interview– 
 - Is the broadcast important right now?

372
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,710
Is that trifling broadcast more important than catching a serial killer bastard?

373
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,820
- Sunbae, you can't do this here. 
 - That's right about the patch.

374
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,180
The patch on Kang Duk Su's clothing, that's my clothing.

375
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,190
I put a patch on his clothes with the scraps of clothes that I bought with my money from custody.

376
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,870
He must have liked it.

377
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,070
He kept coveting it and on the day of his release, he forcefully took the clothes I was wearing.

378
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,740
He said that he would wear it on a special day.

379
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,650
A special day?

380
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,770
So, was that day a special day?

381
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,950
Kang Duk Su, you son of a bitch. I'm glad you died.

382
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,770
I should have killed him!  Me!

383
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,200
Why does Ahjusshi get so angry?

384
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,220
It's because Detective Go cares a lot about you, Bong Yi.

385
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,090
He doesn't want you to see the dark side of the world again.

386
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,650
There's something I'm curious about.

387
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,890
What is it?

388
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,530
About Mu Chi Ahjussi...

389
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,170
Did you have feelings for him?

390
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,960
The thing is–

391
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,810
So he kept the clothes he took from Lee Jae Sik for a special day

392
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,200
and wore it for the first time that day.

393
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,220
So Lee Jae Sik's DNA was preserved for over a year,

394
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,140
and since the knife that stabbed Kang Duk Su was wrapped in that clothing,

395
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,190
Lee Jae Sik's DNA was found on the knife.

396
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,410
It's possible if it was stored well.

397
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,780
So I'm saying that we have no trace of the guy that killed Kang Duk Su.

398
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,850
We're back at square one.

399
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,500
We just wasted time because of that DNA.

400
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,510
You're a writer.

401
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,870
What do you mean, a writer?  I'm a laborer.

402
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:33,270
Oh, if it's strength work, then Bong Yi will get a Heavenly Artistic Award.

403
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,860
Wow, if I got that, shouldn't they give me an Oscar Writer Award?

404
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,250
That would also be good.

405
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,760
About that Ahjusshi earlier.

406
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,260
Did you see that he was beside himself when I fell?

407
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,580
I mean, he even had tears in his eyes over a small wound on my hand

408
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,810
that was bleeding a tiny bit.

409
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,590
You were bleeding?  When?

410
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,130
I'm okay.

411
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,970
You two are too much.

412
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,180
He said that when he saw you, it made him think of his daughter.

413
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,120
- He said that you look a lot like his daughter. 
 - I do?

414
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,960
Anyways, he told me to take care of your injuries.

415
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,410
He kept worrying that you would think strangely of him.

416
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,180
He was worried that a stranger would think strangely of him?

417
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,860
A person like that killed ten people?

418
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,480
He didn't do it.

419
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,670
Oppa, how can you be so sure that he's not the culprit?

420
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,600
At that time, Kim Ajusshi

421
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,110
said he was tortured by the police, so had no choice but to make a false confession.

422
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,240
They told him it was better to confess to avoid the death penalty.

423
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,370
Later, when he went through the trial

424
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,020
he said he only confessed because he was forced to do so.

425
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,790
- But they didn't accept it. 
 - Ah.

426
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,410
How gullible.

427
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,640
No. But if it was so unfair, wouldn't there be a retrial or something?

428
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,850
If there isn't new evidence, they can't even request a retrial.

429
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,970
Well, it would be good if it became an issue.

430
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,460
You never know.  New evidence could come out.

431
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,850
Hey!  Bong Yi, you should talk to the broadcasting station and do a broadcast.

432
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,490
But if he was falsely accused, what did his family do about it?

433
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,900
He only has one daughter for family, and it's been a long time since he's seen her.

434
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,530
Isn't that harsh?  She's still his daughter.

435
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,060
Because she's his daughter

436
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,580
she must have felt a greater sense of betrayal.

437
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,720
Since he must have been the person she trusted most.

438
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,190
It didn't seem like fake tears.

439
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:33,400
 If there isn't new evidence, they can't even request a retrial. 

440
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,300
   

441
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,420
   

442
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,800
   

443
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,490
   

444
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,700
The injunction was cited, so the next item was put to an end.

445
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,790
Isn't there an item for the show that we can prepare quickly?

446
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,400
   

447
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,000
Oh... What about this?

448
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,470
It says their classmate's grandmother is

449
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,790
s-suffering from d-dementia.

450
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,870
They said that she was accused of killing the cats in their neighborhood.

451
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,860
Did Detective Konami post about that again?

452
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,460
Does that person not study?

453
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,750
They think our bulletin board is their drawing board. They completely cover it.

454
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,300
Isn't there another item?

455
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,900
Then perhaps, what about the Suseong serial killer case?

456
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,330
The claim about the false confession due to police torture?

457
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,070
That's the culprit's claim.

458
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:56,140
Why that case, all of a sudden?  Did something happen?

459
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,160
Well, it's nothing like that.

460
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,750
It's just that if he were really falsely accused,

461
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,810
at least his daughter

462
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:10,330
should know that her father isn't the culprit and is a good person.

463
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,860
Is our program a personal broadcast?

464
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,200
Is this a personal broadcast station for his daughter?

465
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,900
I'm sorry.

466
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,470
Okay, let's think about items on our own for a day then  discuss it again tomorrow.

467
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,020
Okay.

468
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,330
You worked hard.

469
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,950
- The planning was good. 
 - Oh?

470
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:37,670
A broadcast where, at least his daughter understands that her father is not the culprit.

471
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,800
- It's a good approach. 
 - Really?

472
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,810
But... How are you going to make his daughter believe that he's not the culprit?

473
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:48,230
I will find a way somehow.

474
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,100
Somehow?

475
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,780
That's good.  Somehow.

476
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,430
- Find it and tell me. 
 - Okay.

477
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,940
Even if she's a rookie, she really doesn't know her place.

478
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,690
Why?  It reminds me of when I first started working, so I like what I see.

479
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,770
1995...

480
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,350
A rainy day.

481
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,710
There is a limit to the material you can find on the internet.

482
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,990
- Wow!  Is this where you store the evidence boxes? 
 - Yeah.

483
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,910
Wow, it's really spacious.

484
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,880
Is all of the evidence from all over the country here?

485
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,570
Not only the evidence, but we even have old case records that were handwritten.

486
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:51,080
- Shall I say, it's the history of Korea's crimes.
 - Wow,

487
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,490
our Officer Jung has a key position.

488
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,510
But, in what order are they organized?

489
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,000
By year and by subject.

490
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,600
Over there are serious crimes, and here are patricides,

491
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,150
and this side is serial killings.

492
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,500
Bong Yi, let's go out now.  Outsiders are not allowed in here.

493
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,600
Oh, hello.

494
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,240
I am from the south district station.  I need to check something with the bereaved about the evidence.

495
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,930
Ah, I see.

496
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,130
- Ah!
 - Uh!

497
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,800
Hey, Bong Yi.

498
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,370
Did you stay here all night?

499
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,490
Yeah.

500
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,860
- And looked at all of this?
 - Yeah.

501
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,690
Come here.

502
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,050
- Just a minute, oppa.
 - We have to hurry.

503
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,790
- It's strange.
 - What is strange?

504
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,870
- This apple.
 - What apple?

505
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:51,810
According to the experts, it is too experienced for a first offense.

506
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:55,920
- But, the first murder usually is clumsy, right?
 - That's right.

507
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,900
So, I researched all murder cases and attempted murder cases that occurred near Suseong.

508
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,660
But, take a look at this.

509
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:09,160
Look at this.  This is an attempted incident that took place in Guryeong two years prior to the Suseong case.

510
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:15,470
Here, it says that the culprit cut up an apple and ate it while holding a pregnant woman captive.

511
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,530
Apple pieces were also found with the Suseong serial killing victims, right?

512
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,110
What do you think?  They are similar, right?

513
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,560
You are right.

514
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,390
- But he was never caught.
 - That's right.

515
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:33,370
Then, the culprit for the attempted incident in Guryeong is Suseong serial killings'...

516
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,210
He could be the real culprit.

517
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:41,100
Then, Mr. Kim really could have been unfairly framed.

518
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,140
If he was unfairly framed,

519
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,360
do you want to set it straight?

520
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,990
Isn't that obvious?

521
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,820
He's not even the culprit but spent over 20 years in prison.

522
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,530
Of course, he should be set free quickly.

523
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,470
If the Team Leader finds out that I copied the case materials and brought them out,

524
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,060
I am going to get fired for sure.

525
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,240
Hey, you did this for a good cause.

526
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,620
You are cool, my friend.

527
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,170
Look at this.

528
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,660
At the scene of the 10th Suseong serial homicide, there were 5 hairs that weren't the victim's.

529
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,050
But the result of testing the hairs showed

530
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,950
the blood type was O.

531
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,160
Also, it said that a large amount of cadmium was detected.

532
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,070
So, at the time, the police assumed that

533
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:39,270
because cadmium was released in large quantities in the vicinity,

534
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,460
one of the employees at Seokpo Smelter factory was the culprit.

535
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,130
Well, at the time, Mr. Kim...

536
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,020
I mean Kim Bong Cheol was also an employee at the factory.

537
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,050
His blood type is also O.

538
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,000
And he said his house was within 10 kilometers of every murder scene.

539
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,170
The day Kim Bong Cheol worked overtime and the day the incident occurred coincided perfectly, too.

540
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:05,650
But, at the time, the NFS identification wasn't as accurate as now so we can't trust everything.

541
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,700
Also, Mr. Kim couldn't be the only blood type O who was exposed to cadmium.

542
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,810
That's right. That's what I'm saying.

543
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,730
But, Kim Bong Cheol's confession decided everything.

544
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,940
In the end, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.

545
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,390
Well, during his second and third trials he said that no choice but to give

546
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:27,380
a false confession due to cruel treatment by the police. But they didn't accept it.

547
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:31,290
Anyway, there needs to be new evidence for him to be retried.

548
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,320
Then we definitely need to find something new.

549
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,570
Regarding the Guryeong attempt,

550
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,240
if our reasoning is correct,

551
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,230
- that survivor could be the only survivor of the Suseong serial killer case. 
 - Oh.

552
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,910
Then shouldn't we meet that survivor first?

553
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,830
How?

554
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,030
Ba Reum Oppa will find her.

555
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,420
I will?

556
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,420
Ah, that house address is from 26 years ago.

557
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,640
It won't be easy to find.

558
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,900
Okay. Well, we can start from the address first.

559
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,320
- Thank you! 
 - Yes!

560
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,550
Oh, Officer Jung!

561
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,230
Hello.

562
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,320
Are you Sung Jin Ah?

563
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,670
Who are you?

564
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,620
I am from the broadcast station.

565
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,610
Please wait a moment.

566
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,830
- The inside of my house is messy. Please wait. 
 - Ah, okay.

567
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,490
Okay, okay.

568
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,590
Hello!

569
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,690
Aigo, you're so cute.

570
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,230
But why are you here from the broadcast station?

571
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:24,630
It's just that I have some questions while covering something.

572
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,840
If you don't mind, I was wondering if I could hear the details

573
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,670
about what you experienced in 1995.

574
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,180
1995?

575
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,690
About when you were kidnapped by a man.

576
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,630
Ah. That incident.

577
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,810
But why are you suddenly asking about that?

578
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:47,040
Ah. To be honest, I have questions about the Suseong serial killer case

579
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,190
so I'm gathering information about it.

580
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,680
If you're talking about the Suseong serial killer case,

581
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,320
wasn't the culprit caught a long time ago?

582
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,670
Yes. That's true.

583
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,540
By any chance,

584
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,720
is there a connection between the Suseong serial killer case and what I went through?

585
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,110
Oh no, it's nothing like that.

586
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,100
I just need to confirm something.

587
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:17,120
If it's okay, could you explain in detail what happened back then?

588
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,890
Okay.

589
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,470
Back then, I was 9 months pregnant.

590
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,200
I was on the way home.

591
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:35,260
 This is probably for the best. 

592
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,400
 Please kill me. 

593
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:41,130
 - Kill me, please.  
  - Crazy wench. 

594
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,370
 I'll kill you if that's your wish. 

595
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,460
That is all.

596
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:50,880
He was wearing a military uniform and he cut and ate an apple.

597
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,480
Then, by any chance, did he have any other characteristics?

598
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,400
No, nothing else.

599
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:08,620
Honestly, after I saw the news, I wasn't sure because the Suseong serial murder case was similar to what I went through.

600
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,980
So I told the police at the time too.

601
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,250
The detectives in charge of the Suseong serial killer case came to talk to you?

602
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,790
Yes. They wanted to know if it could be the same person.

603
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,890
I told them everything that I saw.

604
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,820
They said okay and left. I didn't hear from them after that.

605
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,460
So, I just thought this case must be different.

606
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,300
 They purposely omitted it. 

607
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:34,110
Then, did you find the person who saved you that time?

608
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:38,050
No, I didn't. It wasn't someone from my neighborhood.

609
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,840
He wasn't easy to find because he was an outsider.

610
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:47,960
 I told him to hurry and kill me, but he cursed at me and said I'm a crazy wench. 

611
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,030
Good. Let's prepare this.

612
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,530
I'll get permission from the director.

613
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,020
Oh Bong Yi, you're pretty good.

614
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,350
Thank you.

615
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,520
Are you that happy?

616
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,470
This is all because of Oppa. Because you found that person.

617
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,520
Why did she say that?

618
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,580
- About what? 
 - No, during that time, she was almost due.

619
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,090
Why did she ask him to kill her?

620
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,910
Usually, someone who is pregnant

621
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:19,740
would think about her child and ask desperately to live, right?

622
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,610
Isn't that right?

623
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,640
Wouldn't she have a situation that we don't know about?

624
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,270
Ah, even so.

625
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,790
Even so, I don't understand...

626
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,910
Yes, writer? What?

627
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,460
Oppa, hold on.

628
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,700
Why? Why did they say not to do it?

629
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,920
It's an old case where the verdict has been made.

630
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,160
If we unnecessarily touched something where the police, the prosecutor, or the court is overturned.

631
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,580
He asked how we will handle that.

632
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,990
What are they afraid of?

633
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:57,410
If you're so confident, shouldn't you not care about whether to do the broadcast or not?

634
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,030
Seriously, police, prosecutors, judges

635
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,860
and even broadcast stations are all the same.

636
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,190
Everyone only cares about their own interests.

637
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,410
Unjustified people are just going to die with other people who suffered injustice.

638
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,190
Are you that upset?

639
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,330
No, if someone is really framed,

640
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:19,260
that person's life is so pitiful.

641
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,870
Will anything change if you do the broadcast?

642
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,680
Well still,

643
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,470
at least his daughter would trust him.

644
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:46,830
We will provide government support to improve dementia for the elderly.

645
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:49,970
A new beginning. A different beginning.

646
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,650
I am Shin Seong Min, number 8.

647
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,040
Sheesh, just go! You can't cover anything here.

648
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,180
Why did you have to push me out, huh?

649
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,380
Reporter Seong. Hello.

650
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,290
Oh? You're the one who hurt his head and got surgery!

651
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,330
I did hear that you got reinstated.  I see you were assigned to work here.

652
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,420
I'm working on the Evidence Storage team. What brought you here?

653
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:32,560
I was wondering if there was anything new about Kang Duk Su's case.

654
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,860
Well, haven't you heard anything?

655
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:42,100
As I was organizing materials for the murder case, there was something I found by chance.

656
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,380
- Woah! Did you see the news? 
  - The future daughter-in-law of the Presidential candidate 

657
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,610
 was found to be the daughter of Mr. Kim, the real culprit of the Suseong serial murders. 

658
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:54,590
 Mr. Kim killed 10 women from '97 to '99 in such a grotesque manner 

659
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:58,070
  that it filled the entire nation with fear and shock. 

660
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:02,510
Of course I'd known. I've liked Da Seul since I was in college and I used to follow her around.

661
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:06,770
And when I finally officially proposed marriage to her,

662
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,600
suddenly she wanted to break up.

663
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:15,760
I kept asking her "What's wrong?" and held on to her. Only then she told me.

664
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,880
That her father was the killer in the Suseong Case.

665
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:25,900
Did your parents knew as well?

666
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,630
Yes. I tell my father about everything, so I told him about this as well.

667
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:40,470
Your father's on TV.

668
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,010
 It's true that she is going to be a part of my family. 

669
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:47,300
 What am I supposed to do now? Should I tell my son to abandon her?  
    

670
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,970
 She's a simple and lovely girl. What crime did the daughter commit?  
    

671
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:56,050
 My daughter-in-law has suffered a lot up until now. 
   

672
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:01,050
 Even if you can't give her your blessing, please don't throw any stones at her either.  
    

673
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,810
We got permission. The Suseong Serial Murders are number one among the real-time search topics.

674
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:09,600
The entire nation is going crazy about a killer's daughter being the Presidential candidate's daughter-in-law, so we got the green light.

675
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,910
Even if we get any pressure from the outside, he's going to shield us from it.

676
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,750
I'm really busy with the preparations for the broadcast.

677
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,730
I do feel sorry for Detective Shin, but there's not much I can do about it.

678
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:22,820
- It's a blessing in disguise. 
 - That's great. Congrats.

679
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,170
Fighting, Bong Yi.

680
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:43,760
The owner of that blue toothbrush. Is he your next target?

681
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,460
I need to prepare before Seong Yo Han's instincts are awakened.

682
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,540
Just who is he? That guy?

683
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,720
How should I find this rat-like bastard?

684
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,330
I need to find him before he kills somebody else.

685
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,490
   

686
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:18,180
   

687
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,520
   

688
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:39,300
 Yes, he took those pants from me. 

689
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,150
 Then what about this? Is this Kang Duk Su's? 

690
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,560
 I don't know those clothes. 

691
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:50,710
 The patch on the back of the sleeve, isn't the one I put on either. 

692
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:54,670
 What? That means the killer really did put the DNA on the weapon. 

693
00:47:54,670 --> 00:48:00,000
Today we're going to talk about an attempted case from 26 years ago. 
    

694
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,200
This 1995 Guryeong case took place after the culprit in the Head Hunter cases,

695
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,720
Han Seo Joon, was caught. The world was focused only on the Head Hunter cases.

696
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,980
So no one paid any attention to this attempted incident.

697
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:17,350
Let's first hear the testimony of the woman who escaped safely from this attempt.

698
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:21,950
 I was wearing knee-length stockings and socks on top of them. 

699
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:25,660
 He removed them and tied my hands behind my back using the stockings. 

700
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:30,870
 He removed an apple and a pocket-knife from his bag and cut the apple and ate it in front of me. 

701
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:33,640
 He cut it in the shape of a crescent moon before he ate it.  

702
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,750
 I remember the shape of that apple vividly to this day. 

703
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,210
Yes, the stockings and the apple. These two things are

704
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:46,140
the famous signature of this serial murder case, in which 10 victims were found.

705
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:50,270
We have confirmed yet another signature which was never revealed.

706
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,760
Let's hear the autopsy report from back then.

707
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,660
 I remember the shape of the apple pieces that came out from the victims of the Suseong case because they had a unique shape. 

708
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,330
 They were crescent-moon shaped. All of them. 

709
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:03,360
The shape of the apple that she saw in Guryeong was also a crescent moon.

710
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,740
Do you think that's simply a coincidence? Let's hear her testimony again.

711
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,760
 I told him to hurry and kill me, but he cursed at me. 
.

712
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,850
 He called me a crazy wench and said he'd kill me if that's what I wished for. 

713
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:20,800
Mr. Kim, who is currently serving sentences as the killer in the Suseong serial murders,

714
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,840
suffers from congenital speech and hearing impairments.

715
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:30,020
But the killer heard her request to kill her, cursed at her, and even said he would kill her if she wished so.

716
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:34,020
If he has speech and hearing impairments, how did he hear her

717
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,280
and even reply to what she said?

718
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:42,040
 According to the testimony of the witness in the attempted Guryeong case, the killer was in his 20s and wearing a military uniform. 

719
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,610
 As expected, that doesn't line up with Mr. Kim's age who was in his 40s then. 

720
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,020
 If the perpetrator in the Guryeong case, 

721
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,440
 and the one in the Suseong serial killings are the same person... 

722
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,610
 Why did you save me? You should have left me to die! 

723
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:59,490
 Who was that? Who?  

724
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:02,960
 Why did he save me and then simply leave? 

725
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,170
 According to our investigation, current experts are of the opinion that the NFS reports from back then are highly inconsistent, 

726
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:13,300
 and that Mr. Kim's hair obtained now and the hair from back then could not be considered to be the same. 

727
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:19,240
 In addition to the Seokpo smelter where Kim worked, near the site of the Suseong killings, 

728
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,770
 it has been confirmed that there were a lot more factories where cadmium could be produced. 

729
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,050
 First, in the vicinity of the 4th crime scene, 

730
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:31,530
 the factory where Mr. Kim worked, the seventh crime scene, is an accessory factory. 

731
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:39,360
 And even a jeans dyeing plant away from the crime scene, where cadmium can be detected.  

732
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:47,360
A jeans dyeing plant, cadmium, and currently in his mid-40's?

733
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:51,040
Let's see.

734
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,810
Lee Jae Sik. Lee Jae Sik.

735
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:00,550
Suseong serial killings. 
    

736
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,900
A jeans dyeing plant.

737
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,910
 Even if someone other than Mr. Kim is revealed to be the real culprit in this case, 

738
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:16,740
 - he will not receive punishment.  
- What's this?
    

739
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:24,080
 Because the statute of limitations for this case has expired. Maybe the police, prosecution, and court bought the real culprit time 

740
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:30,840
- Oh, Oh my god. Amazing. 112. 112. 112. 112. 
  - by declaring an innocent man guilty.  
  (T/N: 112 Crime Report Number) 

741
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:36,250
I wonder how much I'll get paid for reporting this to the broadcasting station.

742
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,650
- Good work today! 
 - You, too.

743
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:42,020
- Good work. 
 - We got a really good response.

744
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,360
- You did great. 
 - You, too.

745
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,180
   

746
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,870
Yes?

747
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,040
Who?

748
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:04,900
- Oh, Ahjusshi! 
 - Oh, Bong Yi, what's up?

749
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,520
Did you see the broadcast?

750
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,490
Yes, I saw it. I heard from Officer Jung. You really are something, Oh Bong Yi.

751
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:14,380
Oh no, I didn't do much. It was PD Choi's work.

752
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,630
- Here. 
 - What's this?

753
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:21,550
I heard you were MC'ing Detective Shin's wedding.

754
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,410
I was worried you'd go wearing those clothes to the ceremony.

755
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:28,780
Hey, what's wrong with my clothes? Why are you giving me this?

756
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:33,290
What do you mean why? Who says that? I just wanted to.

757
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,790
Now I've got a job and I get paid too.

758
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:39,670
By the looks of it, I don't think I'm getting fired right away either.

759
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:42,640
I just used a few months' worth of savings in advance.

760
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,970
Thanks for taking care of me all this while.

761
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:49,700
There! Wow, what to do?

762
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,420
How do I look? Cooler than Officer Jung, right?

763
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,030
No. Definitely not.

764
00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:00,280
You've literally got hearts in your eyes.

765
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,490
Bong Yi, Officer Jung likes you a lot.

766
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:10,060
You don't know how relieved I am to know that you have the kindest-hearted guy by your side.

767
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,330
He must be a gift sent by your grandmother.

768
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,630
You deserve to be happy now.

769
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:22,620
Show your grandmother the happiest version of yourself. Okay?

770
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,680
- Yes. 
 - Alright.

771
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,180
Ah yes, right now... Oh PD, take this call.

772
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:34,180
- He wants to speak to you. 
 - Oh, really?

773
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,230
Yes, this is PD Choi Hong Ju.

774
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:41,020
Oh, is that so? Then we should meet in person and discuss it.

775
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:45,580
Would you please give me your number? Yes.

776
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:51,640
Come to my office by 7. I'll have the receptionist informed.

777
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,350
He says there's a video related to the Kang Duk Su case that can turn the world upside down. He kept saying it's a big scoop, an exclusive.

778
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:04,070
- Right. I think I'll be late because I have an interview today. Go instead of me. 
 - Yes.

779
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:06,860
Don't expect too much from this though. We get dozens of these calls.

780
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,960
By the way, the response to the broadcast was great. How do you feel?

781
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,240
It is quite bewildering.

782
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,760
But still, it feels good because people were interested in it.

783
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,930
- You did great, Bong Yi. 
 - Thank you.

784
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,170
   

785
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,570
The police are doing a briefing.

786
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:31,370
 Your daughter must have seen the show. She has already asked to visit you. 

787
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,540
Don't feel too nervous, okay?

788
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:38,610
Make sure you tell her you love her.

789
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:21,510
Upon internal investigation, no problems were found in the investigation of the Suseong serial killings.

790
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:24,160
The attempted Guryeong case and the Suseong serial killings

791
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,510
have no correlation whatsoever.

792
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:33,500
 We'd like to apologize for the confusion that the Sherlock Hong Ju show team caused the public. 

793
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:38,790
We, the police, in light of any new evidence being found, will reopen the investigation.

794
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,510
Huh. Wow.

795
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:44,840
He came here for about two years.

796
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,090
That's when there was a serial murder case around here, right? The Suseong serial killings.

797
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:52,380
- Gosh, don't even bring that up. I'd gotten dragged into it too. 
 - What about Lee Jae Sik?

798
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,930
He was a suspect too. But we both got released since our blood types didn't match.

799
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:07,300
He was hitting the guy who tried to rape his stepdaughter, and accidentally...

800
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,990
She was his stepdaughter, huh?

801
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,370
   

802
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,420
8974...

803
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,490
 The call cannot be connected, you will be connected to voicemail... 

804
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,210
Oh, Parachute, let me ask you for a favor.

805
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:29,560
Lee Jae Sik has a daughter.

806
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,960
Find out where she lives.

807
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,470
You've been through a lot.

808
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,600
Thank you, Officer.

809
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,980
If we meet in society, let's have a drink.

810
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,230
That will be great. Live a diligent life.

811
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:20,360
I woke up to go to the restroom at dawn that day,

812
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,520
but you were gone.

813
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:27,850
I didn't go to sleep and waited. You came in a little later.

814
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:31,430
Your whole body was drenched from the rain.

815
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:36,900
Your pants were covered in mud and grass.

816
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:44,730
The next day, I saw in the news that the 10th victim

817
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:50,070
was found near our house.

818
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:57,380
I couldn't tell anyone.

819
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:03,270
Is that true?

820
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:08,970
Then, if I only tell the truth, he really can't come out?

821
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:13,870
Then, will we not have to run away anymore?

822
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:15,580
Yes.

823
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:19,330
Lee Jae Sik was the one who tried to rape me.

824
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:23,740
The Oppa I liked, saw that and tried to save me.

825
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,930
That bastard.

826
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:29,340
That bastard hit Oppa with a brick.

827
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,040
You should've told the truth back then.

828
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:40,140
I was so scared.  He said that if I told the truth, he would kill me and my mom.

829
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,560
I was really scared.

830
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:49,200
Is Lee Jae Sik really the culprit of the Suseong serial murder case?

831
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,590
Oh, Gu Dong Koo. Where is Lee Jae Sik right now?

832
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:54,530
- He was released earlier. Why? 
 - Aish!

833
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,720
Where would he go? Where would he go? Where would he go?

834
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,710
Where would he go?

835
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:09,670
Oh, Detective Shin. Are there any areas from the Suseong serial killer case that haven't been developed yet?

836
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:11,370
 Yes, Sunbae. Wait a moment. Oh! 

837
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:14,910
 Here. The Jomyeong-ri grass patch where the 8th and 10th victims were found. 

838
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,940
 - That place is still there.  
 - Jomyeong-ri grass patch?

839
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,440
He said he'll come by 7... This lady...

840
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,770
Assistant Director, have you seen PD Choi?

841
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:43,640
She had a report so she left.

842
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:55,250
Yes, hello?

843
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:56,510
An accident?

844
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,270
 - Yes, we are taking him to the emergency room at Mujin Hospital.  
 - Ah.

845
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:02,460
Yes. I understand.

846
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,100
This person is from our neighborhood.

847
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:13,300
 He says there's a video from Kang Duk Su's case that could turn the world upside down. 

848
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,710
Ahjussi?

849
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:20,550
He was foretelling that Lee Jae Sik is the next target.

850
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,330
This psychopath bastard.

851
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,810
 This, too. 

852
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,050
 This person is a predator, too. 

853
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:35,940
 That's... 

854
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,700
 What happened? 

855
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,770
 Is Detective Go Mu Chi a predator? 

856
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:49,870
 - Are you looking for something?  
  - Oh. 

857
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:54,930
 It's the culprit's toothbrush that was in the evidence. I don't know where it went. 

858
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,250
 Is that so? 

859
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:00,870
 For what case? 

860
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:06,550
 Oh, an assault case. It's not a murder case but if it's gone, we'll be in big trouble. 

861
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,370
 Ah, hang on... 

862
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,500
 I will look for it, too. 

863
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,210
 It's a blue toothbrush. Blue color. 

864
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,870
 Ah. 

865
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,710
 Is it there? 

866
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,270
 - Is it this?  
  - Oh, that's it! 

867
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:30,530
 That's right! That's right! Ah! 

868
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:33,280
 That's right. It was over there. Ah. 

869
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,070
 Ah, what a relief. 

870
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:36,840
 Such a relief. 

871
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:48,870
 If he killed him by accident while trying to save his stepdaughter who was about to be raped, there's no way he could be a predator. 

872
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:53,140
 In 1997, he moved to Suseong to find a job. 

873
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:57,870
 Lived in Suseong for 8 years and moved to Chungju in 2005. 

874
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:02,430
 Suseong. Su... Suseong serial killer case? 

875
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:06,100
 The suspect was caught in that case though 

876
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:09,080
 1997, 1998... 

877
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,450
   

878
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,850
   

879
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:22,300
 If it's from 1997 to 1998... 

880
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:25,570
 It was also the time Lee Jae Sik was working in Suseong. 

881
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:30,000
 It’s unfair that Mr. Kim’s uncle was framed and was imprisoned. 

882
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:39,420
 Oh, Dong Gu. Can I get Mr. Kim's hair? 

883
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,140
 Ah. The NFS is going to re-examine the evidence of the unsolved case. 

884
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:48,110
 You said that person wasn't the real culprit of the Suseong case. 

885
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:52,420
 I wanted to send it in with the evidence, just in case. 

886
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,290
 - Can they know with this?  
  - Yeah. 

887
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:56,810
 I'll ask for it. 

888
01:02:56,810 --> 01:03:00,440
 But, they can't know for sure since it's an unsolved case. 

889
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:04,900
 Did I leave my necktie here that day when I drank? 

890
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:08,150
 Ah, that. I left it at the dry cleaner since there was blood on it. 

891
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,470
 I'll get it tomorrow and give it to you. 

892
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:10,530
  Okay. I'm going.  

893
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:12,370
 - When the results come out, let me know. 
 - Okay. 

894
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:14,500
 Thank you. 

895
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,230
 Please do a test. 

896
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,930
 It's a normal person's gene. 

897
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,130
 You can extract the DNA from these bloodstains, right? 

898
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:51,640
 Please put that on here. 

899
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:08,550
I was getting tired of waiting for your release.

900
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,690
Please save me.

901
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:16,480
Save you? The victims during that time probably said the same thing.

902
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:20,310
But what did you do to them?

903
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:22,780
Please prepare one more.

904
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:29,730
Please get an emergency operation room.

905
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,630
 It was Oppa? 

906
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:03,060
