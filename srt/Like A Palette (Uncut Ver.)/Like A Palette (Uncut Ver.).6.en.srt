[Miss Jarin Tiansawangwarp]

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,760
Jane, why is your score this low?

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,080
Yeah, why?

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,040
Miss,

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,960
why is my exam score this low?

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,720
What did you get?

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,025
I got 18.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,800
The full mark is 30.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,120
It's still more than half.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,760
But I'm sure I got more than that.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,520
It's just all in your head.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,640
Did you mark it wrong?

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,340
You've gone too far, Jarin.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,600
How dare you speak to me like that?

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,320
Get back to your seat.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
No, I won't.

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,520
I want to see my answer sheet.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,160
And you have to prove it

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,680
in front of the whole classroom
right here.

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,840
But if you didn't make any mistakes,

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,760
I will bow to you as an apology
in front of the school assembly.

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,880
Honestly, I never wanted any trouble,

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,440
if she wasn't the best friend
of the health education teacher

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,200
that I had beef with.

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
Excuse me,

29
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,550
could I see the one
that has the highest mark?

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
I got another eight questions right
like they did,

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,880
so why weren't mine marked correct?

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,160
From that incident,

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,360
the whole school knew
about 'Jane Jarin'

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,800
as a brave warrior,
reclaiming judgment.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,760
Zon was the first one
from a different classroom

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,950
who wanted to be my friend.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,400
The next one was Chawing,

38
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,710
and the reason she wanted
to be my friend

39
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,680
was that she was also treated unfairly
by the same English teacher

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,800
after she got into a fight
with her daughter.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Hello.

42
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,320
If you're turning in
your assignment, just put it here.

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Miss,

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,800
may I say something?

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
What is it, Miss Jarin?

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,040
I really think
you should keep your work

47
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,480
and personal life separate,

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,680
or you'll have to be mad at everyone
who fights with your daughter.

49
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,920
But if you really can't
control your temper,

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,060
I suggest you make an appointment
with a psychiatrist.

51
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,440
You've gone too far!

52
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,360
Of course, that heroic stunt
I pulled for my friend

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,960
sent me right
to the Principal's Office again.

54
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,720
If you want my daughter
to change schools,

55
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,200
you need to prove it fair and square

56
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,840
that this teacher didn't misuse
her position to mistreat a student.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,200
And with how strong Mom was,

58
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,960
everything ended quickly

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,360
without me getting punished.

60
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,720
The last one is Nut,

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,440
and the reason
she wanted to join the gang was simple.

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,360
She just loved my heroism so much

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,680
that she looked up to me as her idol.

64
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,880
And that was the beginning
of 'The Goddess Gang,'

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,840
with Jane Jarin as the leader!

66
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,880
Come on in.

68

Is something going on?

69
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,960
I thought you were taking me
to a dessert place.

70
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,720
But buffet is also nice!

71
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,960
I don't have to hold back.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,160
Then let's get inside.

73
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,520
Come on.

74
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,960
When is Darin gonna come?

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,880
I'm hungry.

76
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Can we just dig in?

77
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,810
- Just dig in?
- Mm.

78
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,030
- What are we waiting for, then?
- We have something cooked, after all.

79
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,440
What's this? It's sliced pork.

80
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
What is this?

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,320
- Yo, that one is the good stuff!
- Here she is.

82
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,640
- We're here.
- Hey, Darin, my bestie!

83
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,520
Hi, there.

84
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,800
- Hi, Jane.
- Hello.

85
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,040
- Have a seat, please.
- Thank you.

[Dine 4, Pay for 2, only today!]

87
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
Did you ask me out here

88
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,920
just for this sale deal?

89
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
Um...

90
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,120
Yes, another one of my friends
couldn't make it.

91
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,960
Right.

92
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,120
And I really thought this was a date.

93
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,040
She literally just tricked me
into being a sharer in this deal.

94
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,840
Goodness me,

95
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,280
I'm crashing out.

96
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,640
Jane, do you realize how cool you were?

97
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
Those three teachers that you destroyed

98
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,880
used to horrify the whole school.

99
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,516
Pardon?

100
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,440
I was your senior during high school.

101
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,440
You probably don't remember me,

102
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,680
but all the seniors knew Jane Jarin,
the leader of the Goddess Gang.

103
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,920
Mm, I also knew about this.

104
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,360
Bee told me

105
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,200
that there was this kid
from her high school who was so brave.

106
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,480
I didn't think that was you, Jane.

107
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,400
There's more.

108
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Spill.

109
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,760
Let's shed some light on the teacher
you argued with about your marks.

110
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,120
I accidentally pissed her off once

111
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,720
and got my scores taken away,

112
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,020
but I was too scared to say anything.

113
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
I still respect you
just by talking about it again.

114
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
The tears are coming.

115
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,100
Are we crying now?

116
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,040
I wasn't brave or anything.

117
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,080
I just wanted to do what's right.

118
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,680
I actually never hated
those teachers or anything.

119
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,680
Whoa, what a speech.

120
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
How about a round of applause?

121
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,720
By the way, what do you wanna drink?

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,680
Hey,

123
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,240
I'm not giving you a ride
if you get drunk.

124
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,760
I gotta take Jane home.

125
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,480
What?

126
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
I'm not drinking.
My bae's gonna pick me up.

127
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,920
Hey!

128
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,720
So you both aren't drinking?

129
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm alone in this one?

130
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
I'd better not drink, then.

131
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,120
Or maybe
you wanna drink with me, Jane?

132
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,680
I've learned my lesson.

133
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,840
Jane, Imma give this to you.

134
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,080
Right, there you go!

135
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,160
Whoa, here you go.
[Father]

136
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,650
This is yours, Jane.

137
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,520
- There.
- I'm gonna take my father's call, Jane.

138
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,800
Alright.

139
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,840
- Girl, you have hands.
- What?

140
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,720
- Jane.
- Yes?

141
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,640
Actually, Darin wanted to take you
on a date, just the two of you,

142
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
but she was too shy!

143
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,240
That's why she dragged us out here.

144
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,180
I didn't want to come here at first,

145
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,920
but she's my friend, right?

146
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,640
So I did what she asked.

147
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,620
I'm just saying
'cause I don't want you to get sad.

148
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,880
It's all fine.

149
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,120
I actually think hanging out
with many people is...pretty fun.

150
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,320
"Pretty fun."

151
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,200
"Pretty fun," my butt!

152
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,800
She took an hour to get here

153
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
and changed through ten outfits.

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,480
She was afraid you'd find out
she was shy, so she kept it simple.

155
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,040
So much for being chill.

156
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,440
Oh, right.

157
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,080
I have Dai's secret to tell you.

158
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,960
Wanna know?

159
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,120
What is it about?

160
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,960
When she gets shy,

161
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,800
she will cross her arms.

162
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,480
How?

163
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,520
Show her.

164
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,720
Don't forget the face.

165
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,080
Aha, there it is!

166
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,160
Is that a good impression?

167
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,640
If you don't believe me, just observe.

168
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,360
That means...anytime we came across
each other earlier,

169
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,440
and she looked at me
or crossed her arms while we talked,

170
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,800
she was actually blushing!

171
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
For real?

172
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
What are you chatting about?

173
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,680
Nothing!
No one was gossiping about you!

174
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,720
You're so dramatic.

175
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,640
I'm still chewing.

176
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,440
Yeah.

177
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
- Ooh, this is yummy.
- It's not cooked yet.

178
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,500
Oh, is it? Okay.

179
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,320
I didn't notice that.

180
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,080
That's sus.

181
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,760
- Dai?
- Yes?

182
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,240
It's just that...my eyes are burning.

183
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,560
Is it bad?

184
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,000
Come on, I'll take you to the hospital.

185
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,840
They're burning so bad,

186
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,280
probably for...

187
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,800
your unmatched beauty.

188
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,440
Jane!

189
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,120
Where did you get this idea from?

190
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,280
Hm?

191
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,280
Is it Rong?

192
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,160
Not me.

193
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,600
Ouch!

194
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
Dai,

195
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,840
my eyes are burning.

196
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
- Maybe from the chillis.
- Let me take care of that.

197
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,840
Whoa!

198
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,400
Nope.

199
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Just eat.

200
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,960
Must be nice, right?

201
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,680
Here.

202
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,800
Dai?

203
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,440
Hm?

204
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,360
Have a safe trip back.

205
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,400
It's from Dai.

206
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,560
Why do you have
to be involved with my sister?

207
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,920
Your sister was the one
asking me out,

208
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,000
and I didn't even ask for this dessert.

209
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,920
Tell her no, then!

210
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,440
Nope.

211
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,600
JaneWill!

212
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,640
Ginging!

213
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,680
Don't call me that!

214
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Why not?

215
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,760
You were calling me JaneWill just now.

216
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,200
Do you want a piece of me?

217
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,000
If you slap me, I'll slap you back.

218
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,840
This is my faculty building, too.

219
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Give me the dessert!

220
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,040
Huh!

221
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,920
Wasn't so hard, was it?

222
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,480
Ugh!

223
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,200
Augh!

224
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,040
Don't mock me!

225
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,200
What? Why not?

226
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,080
What's going on, JaneWill?

227
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,680
Who was that?

228
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,720
It's Dai's half-sister,

229
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,280
the Queen of Pharmacy
I told you about.

230
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,160
Should we show her
what our hands can do?

231
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,120
Maybe not.

232
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,400
You're here early today, Waii.

233
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,320
I didn't want my sweet girl
to wait on me.

234
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,040
I can wait,

235
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,640
but just for you, though.

236
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,000
Why are you such a sweet talker?

237
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,120
Are you like this with everyone?

238
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,400
[Pangpond]

239
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,600
Who was that?

240
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,120
Why didn't you pick it up?

241
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,200
They're gonna hang up on their own.

242
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,130
But right now, I'm so hungry!

243
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,880
I am!

244
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,000
You always say that
whenever we meet.

245
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
Well, it's true.

246
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
School was exhausting.

247
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,480
Why don't you pick up my calls
around this d*mn woman?

248
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,520
Hey, watch your mouth.

249
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,040
Do I have to be nice
to a homewrecker?

250
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,280
That's some bullcrap.

251
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,520
Give me back my girlfriend, woman.

252
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,680
That's a f*cked up thing to say.

253
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,120
We were never official.

254
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Why wouldn't we be?

255
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,120
I know I'm making you blush

256
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,640
whenever we meet eyes.

257
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,520
Just say you're too shy
to admit that you like me.

258
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,360
You're imagining it.

259
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,600
I've never thought of you
as more than a friend.

260
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,460
And if I'm gonna be with someone,

261
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,240
it has to be Waii.

262
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,880
Let's go.

263
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,520
Cake?

264
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,400
What?

265
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,480
I caught her red-handed today.

266
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,220
Caught who?

267
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,880
Your little friend, of course.

268
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,680
She's definitely going after NewYear.

269
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,360
I also found them at a movie theater.

270
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,160
Ah!

271
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,120
That's why Waii has been so sneaky,

272
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,400
just coming in and out.

273
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,680
Can you help me?

274
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,120
Out of all the girls in the world,

275
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,280
why mess with your brother's girl?

276
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Is Waii really a lesbian?

277
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,000
Gosh, Sis!

278
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,240
Isn't that obvious?

279
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,120
You still couldn't figure it out?
What kind of friends are you guys?

280
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,800
What?!

281
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,000
I see why she's never talked
about any guy.

282
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,280
Such a piece of work.

283
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,440
Can you help me handle this?

284
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,280
"Help"?

285
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
[Enjoy, from Dai]

286
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,680
Bussin'!

287
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,280
I should draw something for Dai

288
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,160
to repay her for the dessert.

289
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,880
But wait...

290
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,520
what should I draw?

291
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,400
I'll go with this pic.

292
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,600
I'll even change her outfit.

293
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,800
Bingo!

294
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,080
Dai will be an inspiration
for my next comic's female lead.

295
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,130
A story about an enthusiastic architect
who is just starting her career

296
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,820
and loves nightlife,

297
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,150
until, one night, she meets
a sophomore student in college

298
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,000
who goes to a pub because her friends
need her to babysit their table.

299
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,520
But...

300
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,080
would Dai be okay with this?

301
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,320
I need her permission!

302
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,600
Could I have you as a reference
for the female lead in my comic?

303
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,720
Pardon?

304
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,850
Jane...

305
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,560
have you had dinner?

306
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,620
Not yet.

307
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,200
My mom stopped by my dorm

308
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,480
and she brought me
a lot of steamed blue swimmer crab.

309
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,680
Would you like it?

310
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,180
If so, I'll bring you some.

311
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,240
Whoa, a swimmer and crab meat?

312
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,970
I can choose from the two?

313
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,080
It's a steamed blue swimmer crab!

314
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,720
What do you mean?

315
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,160
Is it both a swimmer
and a crab in itself?

316
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,520
I'm telling you right now
that I don't eat swimmers.

317
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,080
I'm downstairs now.

318
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,680
After disappearing for days,

319
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,680
why does she stop by all of a sudden?

320
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,800
[Only students in the university dorm
are allowed entry]

321
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,350
Dai is crossing her arms again.

322
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,520
Wonder what's making her shy.

323
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,360
Steamed blue swimmer crab.

324
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,720
You didn't come see me...

325
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,680
for a week.

326
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,240
Well...

327
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,560
You stole my kiss after all, Jane.

328
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,880
It wasn't a kiss!

329
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,680
It was just a peck!

330
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,840
There's a difference?

331
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,720
There is!

332
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,960
A peck is
just a light touch on the lips,

333
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,240
but a kiss involves tongues!

334
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,200
But it doesn't change the fact
that you stole it from me.

335
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,280
Well...

336
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,620
Then, what do I have to do?

337
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,600
You gotta let me
steal it back, of course,

338
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,080
beautiful.

339
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,720
Not happening!

340
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm sorry...

341
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,440
I shouldn't have...

342
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,680
Nuh-uh,

343
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,570
I don't mind it,

344
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,200
but it's just...

345
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,240
I'm definitely gonna explode.

346
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,960
Hm?

347
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,650
Well...

348
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,080
I will explode from shyness!

349
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,960
- Right, Waii?
- What?

350
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,120
I met this boy the other day.

351
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,400
He was such a snack!

352
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,120
Are you free tomorrow?

353
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,150
Can you come with me?

354
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,240
Nah.

355
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,520
Why won't you be?

356
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,880
I know you are.

357
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,270
I'm telling you that I'm not.

358
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,720
Ooh, so you're all
about glamour now, JaneWill?

359
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,720
All of a sudden, you got into makeup.

360
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,120
It's not about glamour.

361
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,560
I bet...

362
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,880
she's in a relationship now.

363
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,240
I'm not!

364
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,760
My lips are just dry!

365
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,080
Dry lips?

366
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,720
You'd only need lipstick for that.

367
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,600
Just let her do whatever she wants to.

368
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,680
As for you,

369
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,960
stop sticking your nose
into others' business.

370
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,080
Whoa, b*tch.

371
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,280
Why are you
turning this around on me?

372
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,080
I'm off. Sick of your face.

373
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,960
What?!

374
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,760
Knock it off!

375
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,030
So basically, you're okay
with Dai now, right?

376
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,080
No way!

377
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,400
What do you mean by "okay"?

378
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,640
No need to hide it from me.

379
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,080
It's written all over your face
already, JaneWill.

380
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,170
But as for Waii...

381
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,760
What about her?

382
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,720
That's gotta be it.
That's for sure.

383
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,290
What's gotta be it?

384
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,610
Waii is definitely a lesbian,

385
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,000
but she's hiding it from us.

Uh, are you hurt?

390
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,240
I found it just over there.

391
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,820
Thank you!

395
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,440
I bet she's sneaking back home.

I have too much makeup on?

Lemme see.

398
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,840
Nuh-uh, I don't think so.

399
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,920
It looks fine.

400
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,920

- Mm!

Give me a sec!

403
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,240
Dai, don't show yourself just yet.

404
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,600
I'm blushing right now.

405
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,560
You're still at it, Jane?

406
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,920

Aw, what's the matter
with you, b*tch?!

410
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,640
Oh, Jane.

411
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
How lucky.

412
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,480
Actually, I was coming to find you.

413
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,040
What is it, Champ?

414
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,200
Right...

415
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,280
So...

416
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,440
I have so many photos
of you from the beach,

417
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,800
and I wanted to send them to you,

418
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,440
but you haven't accepted
my follower request.

419
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,640
Uh, I...

420
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,920
You can follow me

421
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,070
since I am JaneWill's bestie.

422
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,160
Right...

423
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,560
Darin!

424
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

425
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Hi, there.

426
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,240
Just who I was looking for.

427
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,240
I need your help on a gig.

428
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,720
You're still available, aren't you?

429
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,960
I am.

430
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,560
Then, may I steal Darin
from you for now?

431
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,920
Come on, follow me.

432
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,800
Are you alright, Ging?

433
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,920
He told me
we weren't right for each other.

434
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,600
Is that even a reason?!

435
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,320
More like an excuse to break up.

436
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,000
Uh...

437
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,880
calm down.

438
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,680
You just got into a fight.

439
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,840
He's gonna call you
when he feels better.

440
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,040
It's been two weeks with none of that.

441
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,040
What?

442
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,280
Then, why didn't you text him first?

443
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,000
He blocked me on LINE

444
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,440
and also my number.

445
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,170
Oh...

446
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,640
Jane, drink this with me.

447
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,760
I think I'm good.

448
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,520
What?

449
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,520
Ging.

450
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,680
Ging?

451
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,200
Ding, ding, ding!

452
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,000
What?

453
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,760
If she's this drunk,

454
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,680
then how's she getting home?

455
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,200
Ging, come lie down here.

456
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,680
Go! One, two, go!

457
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,630
Wait, what's happening?

458
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,040
Are you gonna throw up? Wait!

459
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,560
Hold it in!

460
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,640
Hold it!

461
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,520
Here.

462
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,600
Get your head outta there.

463
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,680
Up!

464
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,680
Let's get you back
to where you were.

465
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,880
Jeez...

466
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,080
Will I get any sleep tonight?

467
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,840
Rise and shine.

468
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,760
It's morning already!

469
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,680
I bought you rice porridge.

470
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Hurry up and eat it.

471
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,320
Aren't you eating?

472
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
I'm not hungry just yet.

473
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,800
You drew Dai in a cartoon style,
JaneWill?

474
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,320
That's pretty cute.

475
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,760
What?

476
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,800
Why are you taking a photo?

477
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,280
Don't show it to Dai.

478
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,320
I don't want her to see it just yet.

479
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,160
I guarantee I'll zip it.

480
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,230
Enjoy your food.

481
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,780
I'm heading back to my dorm now.

482
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,520
I'll send you off downstairs.

483
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,440
It's fine.

484
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,200
I'm fine on my own.

485
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,710
I love you, bestie!

486
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,040
I...

487
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,560
trust Dai with you.

488
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
What in the world?

489
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,600
Junior, come help me with my stuff.

490
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,320
Hey,

491
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,840
aren't you really gonna help?

492
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
There's so much of it!

493
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,800
How many days?

494
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,870
What?

495
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,720
How many days
are you gonna last here?

496
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,080
You'll move your stuff back, eventually.

497
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,280
Oh, Jimmy!

498
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,640
What's all this?

499
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,480
Are you guys fighting again?

500
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,600
This time, I won't budge.

501
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
I'm done...

502
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
This is the end of it.

503
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,640
Hello.

504
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,080
Hello, Mild.

505
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,180
What's happening between you two?

506
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,960
Jimmy, I'm sorry I stayed out late.

507
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,600
Here is your prawn pad Thai.

508
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
I already bought it for you.

509
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,960
You left me starving
for two agonizing hours.

510
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,960
Come on, son.

511
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,960
As a man, you need to hang in there.

512
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,440
You can snack on something
if you get hungry.

513
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,920
Here, I'll put it on a plate.

514
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,720
I'm not eating that!

515
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,680
- I'll take it. It looks delicious.
- Hey, give it back!

516
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,990
It's mine!

517
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,080
Mild bought it for me.

518
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,160
You weren't eating it, right?

519
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,360
- Give that to me!
- Nope!

520
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,840
- Give that to me!
- Nope!

521
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,200
- Give it to me, Junior.
- Heck no.

522
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,200
- Give it to me!
- Heck no.

523
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,840
- Give it to me.
- Junior!

524
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,720
I was just playing, Mom.

525
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,270
Mild, stay the night here, darling.

526
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,160
It's already late.
You can go back tomorrow.

527
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,440
Of course.

528
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,560
Uh...

529
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,320
I'll take care of this.

530
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,280
[The drawing is absolutely beautiful]

531
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,440
[The drawing is...]

532
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,920
Yes, Dai?

533
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,880
The drawing you did for me is stunning.

534
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,040
Dai, you already saw it?

535
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
Yep, Ging sent it to me.

536
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,560
Do you really like it, Dai?

537
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,760
I love it!

538
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,880
Can I use this as a profile picture?

539
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
Jane?

540
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,760
Are you okay?

541
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,200
I'm good.

542
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,360
I'm just blushing!

543
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,360
She doesn't pick up my calls.

544
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,280
Bee, where has Dai disappeared to?

545
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,240
Nothing is happening to her, right?

546
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,560
What?
Bee doesn't even read my texts.

547
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Rong, where has Dai disappeared to?

548
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,360
Nothing is happening to her, right?

549
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,120
Oh, Darin is probably
trying to meet her deadline.

550
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,760
The professor set it for tonight.

551
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,480
She's probably very busy now.

552
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,760
Yeah, I'm also worried
about her myself.

553
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,720
I've seen that when she works hard
on something, she skips meals.

554
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,560
The next thing we know,
we need to take her to the hospital.

555
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,720
What should we do?
I'm worried sick.

556
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,980
You can buy her
noodles from my shop.

557
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,480
Are you trying to meet your sales?

558
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,440
Oh, Jane! Hi!

559
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,470
- Hello, Rong.
- Come on in.

560
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,840
Just a sec.

561
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,680
There! Okay...

562
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,200
Here's my dad.

563
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,280
- Oh, hi, kiddo.
- Hello.

564
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,440
That's my grandma,

565
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
and that's my older brother.

566
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,970
And this is Jane,

567
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,110
a freshman from my university.

568
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,480
Have you eaten, dear?

569
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Not yet.

570
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,600
Any recommendations?

571
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,760
Recommendations...

572
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,280
Our signature dish would be

573
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,600
chicken noodles and king crab noodles.

574
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,000
Uh, then...

575
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,430
what does Dai like?

576
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,280
For Dai, it'd be the chicken one.

577
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,440
Her favorite since childhood.

578
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,160
Then, I'll have
two chicken noodles to go

579
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,560
and one king crab noodle to eat here.

580
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,780
Coming right up.

581
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,000
How much, Rong?

582
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,200
- Uh...
- It's alright, dear.

583
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,600
It's on the house.

584
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,040
Excuse me just a sec, Jane.

585
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,160
Dad!!

586
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
What?!

587
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,880
- Dad!
- What?

588
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,360
Grandma gave out free food again!

589
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,680
Mom!

590
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,160
Please go get some rest, Mom.

591
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,920
Nueng, take her inside.

592
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,250
Just another sec, Jane.

593
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,680
It's just that my grandma
is pretty oblivious,

594
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,480
thinking customers
are her relatives.

595
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,240
Just last month, she let people
eat for free for almost 2,000 baht.

596
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,760
And it's gonna be 220 baht for you.

597
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,080
The drinks are on me.

598
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,560
- Here you go, Rong.
- Alright, thank you.

599
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,470
Hold on a second.

600
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,310
- Alright.
- Okay.

601
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,600
And does Dai live alone
or with someone at her dorm?

602
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
Just alone.

603
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,560
She doesn't like to share her space.

604
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,320
Such a private person, that one.

605
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,360
I think she's moved out
to live alone since high school.

606
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,760
Alright, location sent.

607
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,040
Her place is on the sixth floor.

608
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,080
- Thank you, Rong.
- Sure.

609
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,000
If you need more information,

610
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,040
don't forget to stop by my shop again.

611
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
There's so much to spill.

612
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,840
It's definitely this one!

613
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,520
Jane!

614
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,680
How did you get here?

615
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,160
By motorbike taxi!

616
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,000
You're just...

617
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,420
something else.

618
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,600
Sorry, my place is so messy right now.

619
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,520
You can sit here for now.

620
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,840
It's fine.

621
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,860
I'm just bringing you some food.

622
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,920
I was afraid
you'd work so hard that you'd faint.

623
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,480
This is from Rong's shop, right?

624
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,800
How did you know that?

625
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,080
He doesn't care about me.

626
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,840
He just wanted to find his dad
some customers.

627
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,760
Whenever anyone looks for me,

628
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,560
he always tells them
to buy noodles from him.

629
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,720
It's ingenious marketing.

630
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,040
Sounds like...

631
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,840
someone is regularly visiting.

632
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
She's slyer than I realized.

633
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,000
Or maybe...
she's hiding someone in her room?

634
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,800
Jane, are you okay?

635
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,720
That means there's always someone
coming to see you, right?

636
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,320
Mm...

637
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,400
Well,

638
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,320
there are some friends.

639
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,720
But no visits matter more than yours.

640
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,040
Do you know how happy I was

641
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,360
seeing you at my doorstep?

642
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,080
I'll put these in the bowls,
so we can eat them together.

643
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,800
Let me tie my hair up first.

644

I'm not thinking of
anything inappropriate!

647
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,480
I'm leaving!

648
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,680

I'll be there really soon.

Why? What's going on?

671
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,640

My intention
to plant a tree on her grave

676
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,280
is for us to remember that Jelly

677
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,760
will always be with us,

678
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,720
not anywhere else.

679
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,400

680
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,880
only to part ways?

681
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,600
