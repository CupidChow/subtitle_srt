4
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,760
Honey...

5
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,251
don't get angry at our child.

6
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,960
I'm sorry I was born like this,

7
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,800
that I was born as a boy.

8
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,400
But I really can't fight the feelings
of wanting to be a girl.

9
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,760
Jasmine's photo
that a neighbor tattled on

10
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,160
really made Dad fume.

11
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,760
After that day, he refused
to talk to Jasmine for about a year.

12
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,120
But for me,
Jasmine's story was the reason

13
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,720
I had the courage to become someone

14
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,360
who is self-assured

15
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,080
and not afraid to confront anything.

16
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,080
I am her health education teacher.

17
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,960
My apologies on behalf of Jarin.

18
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,920
But I didn't do anything wrong.

19
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,760
She's even denying her wrongdoing
in front of her mom.

20
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,240
Do you see how this child is now?

21
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,280
You're in the wrong, Miss.

22
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,960
If anything, you owe my mom an apology.

23
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,080
Jane!

24
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,520
What happened, ma'am?

25
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,080
Jarin insulted her teacher
in front of her classmates.

26
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,680
What kind of language did she use?

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Jarin said that if the teacher
removed her womb,

28
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,640
she wouldn't be a woman.

29
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,080
Uh...

30
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,520
And what made my daughter say it?

31
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,920
There must be
a reason for that, ma'am.

32
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,680
I was teaching her about genders.

33
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,360
I merely said that,
apart from male and female,

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,280
there's a group of people
with gender confusion.

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,640
After that, she started insulting me.

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,209
You left something out.

37
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,800
You gave an example

38
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,600
that people with gender confusion
would be like my sister.

39
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,280
Isn't that the truth?

40
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,240
He's grown up
and still confused about his gender.

41
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,120
What kind of woman goes by "Mister,"

42
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,560
and without a womb at that?

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,280
That's why I asked:

44
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,280
if your womb were removed,
would you consider yourself a woman?

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,400
See?

46
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,040
This child is beyond control.

47
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,200
I suggest you expel her.

48
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,880
Though my child couldn't choose
the body she was born into,

49
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,280
she still has every right
to choose how she lives her life.

50
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,640
Her decision to transition
is not gender confusion,

51
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,080
but the courage to accept who she is.

52
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,920
♫Every time you are near,
I feel at ease♫

53
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,360
Fermented fish!

54
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,082
I heard you like it.

55
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,400
Is Dai really this irresistible?

56
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,080
Elf,

57
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,880
I'm writing a sapphic comic!

58
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,360
My friend here
is reaching for the star.

59
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,600
And Dai is such a rare one.

60
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,840
Is my friend
really gonna date the campus queen?

61
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
Girl, that's so freaking cool!

62
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,480
I'm just...

63
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,398
trying to give her a chance.

64
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,360
"Give her a chance"?

65
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,040
I think it's the other way around.

66
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,200
Facts.

67
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,233
What's there to think?

68
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:09,240
If it were me, I'd totally go all out.

69
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,680
It just happens that I'm into boys,

70
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,800
not girls.

71
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,520
The reason I'm still unsure
is that Dai is a girl.

72
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,880
If Dad finds out,

73
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,000
he's definitely gonna go off on me.

74
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,000
Why should it matter
if boys like boys or girls like girls?

75
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,240
Love is such a beautiful thing.

76
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,040
It's 2025, and seeing as how progressive
the world has become,

77
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,393
why discriminate
based on sexual orientation?

78
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,480
Hm, Waii?

79
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,011
Huh?

80
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,600
You seem pretty invested.

81
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,680
I'm not.
I'm just giving her the encouragement.

82
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:51,600
Right...

83
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,040
Mm, why?

84
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,920
Mm.

85
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,920
Hey...

86
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,720
Dai just followed me.

87
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,800
Should I accept her request?

88
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,720
- Duh!
- Duh!

89
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,920
Mm.

90
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Look at that silly grin.

91
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,360
Hm?

92
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,000
- What's the matter with you?
- Hm?

93
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Nothing.

94
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,461
What?

95
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,800
Maybe you wanna grab the cup?

96
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,160
- Yeah!
- What are you even sucking on?

97
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,320
Here!

98
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,280
What are you even doing?

99
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,560
- Homegirl is getting awkward.
- Mm.

100
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,080
Whoa!

101
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,334
Why are you stalking me, Pang?

102
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,120
Well, you're hiding
something from me, NewYear.

103
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Hiding what?

104
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,320
Yesterday,
you didn't pick up any of my calls

105
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,600
and even left me on read.

106
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,640
Oh...

107
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,400
They didn't allow phones
in the theater,

108
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,400
don't you know that?

109
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,280
Huh? "Theater"?

110
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,920
Who were you with?

111
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,360
Why do you need to know?

112
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,240
Don't tell me
you were with another boy.

113
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,560
I wasn't!

114
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,754
I went there with Waii.

115
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,520
Well, Cake's friend
we met at the coffee shop the other day.

116
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Oh...

117
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes, Waii?

118
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,240
Today?

119
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,720
That works.

120
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,000
Then, I'll wait for you
at the usual spot.

121
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,600
Hello?

122
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,520
I'm in a library.

123
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
Can I call you back?

124
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,600
This... This is urgent.

125
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,840
Just a quick word.

126
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,440
Okay, then.

127
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,600
JaneWill, take your call outside.

128
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,720
This is a library,
so there's a noise policy.

129
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
She's right! Go!

130
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
What's going on?

131
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,800
Me?

132
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Why? Why me?

133
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,960
Kids these days...

134
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,640
They got so entitled
after gaining some followers!

135
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,480
Not just "some," though.

136
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,760
Jane's fans are over 600,000, Elf!

137
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,960
So what?

138
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
Does she think
the world revolves around her?

139
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
If I weren't so busy,

140
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,440
I would've drawn it myself!

141
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,760
That sounds good!

142
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,160
That way, we can save the cost!

143
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,973
I was being sarcastic!!

144
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,640
I don't know how to draw!

145
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,240
I graduated
from the Automotive Program!

146
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,400
What nonsense!

147
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,800
Go make me some coffee!

148
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,840
And make it sweet.

149
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,800
Yes, ma'am.

150
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,320
My body needs a rush of sugar.

151
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,240
I'm pissed!!

152
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,560
Did you get into a fight?

153
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,920
Mm.

154
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,800
Well,

155
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,920
it was ToonDenie's editor.

156
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
What?

157
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,040
Why would you beef with her?

158
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,280
Do you wanna be jobless?

159
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,240
Well, she's very controlling toward me.

160
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,320
She told me
the genre I pitched her wasn't okay

161
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,960
after I told her
I wanna write a sapphic comic.

162
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,120
She said GL's genre

163
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,720
wouldn't perform as well as
the BL and the straight ones

164
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,000
and that it wasn't for the market.

165
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,520
And who was she to judge that it wasn't?

166
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,640
Mm.

167
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,120
I don't like being forced,

168
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,080
so I told her that

169
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,960
if she didn't approve it,
I'd publish my work on another platform.

170
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,960
Whoa, you're the GOAT!

171
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,240
Show 'em how it's done!

172
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,400
And that's how she agreed, right?

173
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,360
No, that's how she dropped me.

174
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,920
It's a good thing, though.

175
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,560
Now, I don't have to stress out
about the deadline anymore.

176
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,560
Plus, I get my freedom this way.

177
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,120
I can write whatever I want now.

178
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
- Mm.
- Mm!

179
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,547
True that.

180
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,520
Then, how do you know
the sapphic genre is gonna work?

181
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,560
You bet it's gonna!

182
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,440
Right, JaneWill?

183
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,760
Mm, I'm confident.

184
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm a bit psychic.

185
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,320
I have a feeling it's gonna blow up.

186
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,160
I have a fifth sense.

187
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,400
Mm...

188
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,439
I think it's more
because you're lovesick, JaneWill.

189
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,720
Mm.

190
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
What took you so long?

191
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,520
I was finishing a report,
so it took me a while.

192
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,160
And what did they assign us to do?

193
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,560
Professor Erika and Guichai
told us to practice on our walk.

194
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,880
Dear and I had already finished ours.

195
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,160
Since you just got here,
hurry along to the professor.

196
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,320
Whoa...

197
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,160
this is not right up my alley at all.

198
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,240
I can do the duck walk, though.

199
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,520
You're a hoot and a half, JaneWill.

200
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,600
You done decided
on your talent segment?

201
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,160
I don't know.

202
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,600
What did people do last year?

203
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,960
Ask last year's campus queen.

204
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,000
Dai showcased
her black-belt karate skill,

205
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,840
with a lil' strummin' on a guitar.

206
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,400
There she is.

207
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,720
Go ask for her advice.

208
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,400
[Queen of Pharmacy]

209
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,800
Who's the girl next to Dai?

210
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,740
Isn't she the Queen of Pharmacy?

211
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,320
That's right, she's Ging,

212
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,560
full name Khemmika Arunajanjam,

213
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Queen of Pharmacy.

214
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,000
- Hello, Rong.
- Hello.

215
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,920
- Hello, Kaning.
- Hi.

216
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,960
Hm, so...

217
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,580
is there something going on?

218
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Nothing.

219
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You sure?

220
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,010
You can tell me
if you need our help.

221
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Thank you.

222
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,440
Okay, I'm off.

223
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,840
- Let's go.
- Hey, my friend!

224
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,320
Sup!

225
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,720
Have you eaten?

226
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,440
What's up with you?!

227
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,720
Nothing, I'm fine.

228
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,560
Guys,

229
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,610
I'm really starting to dislike someone.

230
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,120
Who? Spill.

231
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,320
Getting nosy.

232
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,200
The Queen of Pharmacy.

233
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,040
I don't like the Queen of Pharmacy.

234
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,880
What did that beyotch do to you?

235
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,000
She was cozying up to Dai!

236
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,960
Eek!

237
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,720
Who TF dares take away
the campus queen from my gurl?

238
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,040
GTFO.

239
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,200
Gotta handle that chick.

240
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,640
Tomorrow is the dress rehearsal.

241
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,760
I will straighten it out
once and for all!

242
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,040
You guys finna fight?

243
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,400
Got yo back.

244
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,400
We gotta lay low, right?

245
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,200
Hell to the nah!

246
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,040
I'm tired of deciphering Cake's lingo.

247
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,400
Language teachers
would totally throw hands.

248
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,480
We'll talk again
at the faculty building.

249
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,800
Betcha. Toodles.

250
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,960
Cake,

251
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,430
how could your friend do that to me?

252
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,600
Who?

253
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,720
What? How?

254
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
It's Waii.

255
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,080
She's messing with my girlfriend.

256
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,440
Your girlfriend...

257
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,710
Who?

258
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,960
The one who tutored me
at the coffee shop.

259
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,940
Oh, didn't you say
you were in the talking stage?

260
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,120
Alright, alright, we are just that.

261
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,840
I don't even know
how she got her freaking number.

262
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,290
They even went to a movie together.

263
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,120
Can you tell her
to leave NewYear alone?

264
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,400
It's probably not what you think.

265
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,640
Maybe it's someone with the same name.

266
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,560
And if it was really Waii,

267
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,280
why would she mix with that kid?

268
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,480
If you don't believe me,

269
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,440
I'll get you proof.

270
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,120
Mm, go on.

271
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,440
Pretty please, Dai?

272
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,320
Hm...

273
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,360
If I refused, you'd get mad
at me like always, right?

274
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,280
It's not a big deal.
You can just say yes.

275
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Please?

276
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,000
I'll think about it, alright?

277
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,520
Why in tarnation are ya just standin'?

278
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,600
Ain't your stomach touchin' your back?

279
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,440
How would it be
when I'm just standing straight?

280
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,800
Well, I'll be!
That's not what I meant.

281
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,200
I mean, you must be plumb famished.

282
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,280
Huh? What was that?

283
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Look.

284
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,570
Guys,

285
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,000
if you're hungry, come right over here.

286
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,000
I'll give you a 15-minute meal break.

287
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,180
Right, we have stir-fried chicken
with garlic, fried rice with pork,

288
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,560
and stir-fried chicken
with green pepper.

289
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,680
- Take your pick!
- Hurry up, guys.

290
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,440
- Feel free to take one.
- Just like sharks in a feeding frenzy.

291
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,440
Quick, or none will be left.

292
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,320
No...

293
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,400
- You can go ahead.
- You haven't given me the answer.

294
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,359
- I'm picking a fight.
- Hurry up and get the first one,

295
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,670
and I'll answer it.

296
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,950
I'll treat you to a drink, too, okay?

297
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
- Where's your pinky?
- I'll be d*mned

298
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
- with this missy.
- Promise me.

299
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,880
Who are you texting?

300
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,160
Why do you need to know?

301
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,360
I'm just asking.

302
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,920
Wanna go to the coffee shop
in front of the university?

303
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm busy.
I have an appointment.

304
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,340
You are?

305
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,040
You've been acting strange lately, Waii.

306
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,360
Be for real with me.

307
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,080
Where were you yesterday?

308
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,000
You went to a movie, didn't you?

309
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,880
I'm in a hurry,

310
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,760
so bye.

311
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,320
[Stir-fried chicken with garlic]

312
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,800
Oh, JaneWill.

313
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,790
Hey, Ging.

314
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,240
You seem to have a sour face.

315
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,920
Maybe a glass of water will help.

316
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,600
But I want
stir-fried chicken with garlic.

317
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,200
I can take fried rice with pork.

318
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,160
D*mn, this is bussin'.

319
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,080
I want another,
but I'd feel bad askin' for more.

320
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,960
Excuse me,

321
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,160
I'll go to the restroom.

322
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,160
Mm.

323
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,920
Let's add some sweetness.

324
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,720
Why the long face?

325
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
Nothing.

326
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,320
You sure about that?

327
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,950
I am!

328
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,920
Did you drop a diamond in your lunch?

329
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,000
You're digging pretty deep.

330
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,960
Hm?

331
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,320
The contest is tomorrow.

332
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,880
What titles are you expecting to win?

333
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,280
Well,

334
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,920
anything that has desserts as rewards.

335
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,400
I got it.

336
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,280
Why did you say it with that voice?

337
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,720
What did they put in that chicken?

338
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,920
She is your type, isn't she?

339
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,760
Huh?

340
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,320
What do you mean?

341
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,800
Dumb, don't play Dai.

342
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,680
You mixed up your words there.

343
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,040
You know what I mean.
Don't play dumb, Dai.

344
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,280
Mm-hm?

345
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,200
I saw

346
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,480
how you guys held hands
and whispered sweet nothings.

347
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,680
You even seemed into it.

348
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,600
So what do you want?

349
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,160
Are you even
gonna knock on my door anymore,

350
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,520
or are you gonna do it
on every single queen's?

351
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,680
Are you talking about Ging?

352
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,200
So you know who I'm talking about.

353
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,720
Calm down.

354
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,760
I'll buy you more, alright?

355
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,560
Dai, were you laughing at me?

356
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,640
Do you take pleasure in teasing me?

357
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,040
You must be having a blast, huh?

358
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,400
Or maybe you see me as a toy?

359
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,440
Ging is my sister.

360
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,640
Fleeing to the restroom?

361
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,240
I didn't flee from anything.

362
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,280
From our conversation about Ging.

363
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,280
You really misunderstood me there.

364
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,960
Were you jealous?

365
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,560
Honey, is the food ready?

366
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,880
I'm hungry!

367
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,880
- Oh, hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Dad.

368
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,120
Hi, Ju.

369
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,780
Ooh!

370
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,060
- You came just in time for food!
- Hi, Mom.

371
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,360
Lots of kisses for you two,

372
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,520
- but never for me.
- Aw, here you go.

373
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,520
Refreshing, isn't it?

374
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,880
So where's Jim?

375
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,040
He went back
to the condo with Mild.

376
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,240
They just made up.

377
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,080
What?!

378
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,800
Didn't he say they were gonna break up
for real this time?

379
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,800
But I think it's a good thing
they made up, sweetie.

380
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,560
For the sake of a strong relationship,

381
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,400
- people need to face challenges.
- Mm.

382
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,440
If something can be forgiven,

383
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,890
- you should forgive it, right?
- Mm.

384
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,120
Well, I wasn't gonna say
something bad about him.

385
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,800
It's just funny,

386
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,480
considering what a big talker he was.

387
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,600
Am I right, Ju?

388
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,280
Girl, you're so caught up
in other people's business.

389
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,000
Well, what about that girl?

390
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Hi, Juss.

391
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,360
Where are you guys now?

392
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,120
- Hey!
- Huh?!

393
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,760
That girl?

394
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,880
Which one, sweetie?

395
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,080
What girl?

396
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,280
- Uh...
- Huh?!

397
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,760
There are no girls.

398
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,440
Ju doesn't know
what he's talking about.

399
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,160
- Uh, wait!
- Mom, I'm hungry!

400
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,600
I'll help them serve the food.

401
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,160
- Uh, Mom?
- Wait...

402
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,080
"That girl..."

403
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,880
Jelly,

404
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,600
do you know anything about this?

405
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,240
Jelly!

406
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,930
You miss your Jane, don't you?

407
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,320
Are you tired
of being with Ju and Juss?

408
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,600
They're no fun, huh?

409
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,400
How's your college life?

410
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,840
Everything falling into place?

411
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,920
Yes,

412
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,320
well...

413
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,640
I'm pretty caught up in the contest,

414
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,520
but after this is over,
I think it'll be better.

415
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,120
Right...

416
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,600
Ow, Jelly, sit properly.

417
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,520
I can see worry in your eyes.

418
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,440
Juss, you read me as good as Ju.

419
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,360
Well, I'm your older sister.

420
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,080
How could I call myself that
if I couldn't see through you?

421
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,600
So...

422
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
are you still thinking about
that sophomore girl?

423
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,920
What was her name again?

424
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
It's Dai.

425
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,440
Yesterday,
I accidentally did something bad.

426
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,840
To Dai?

427
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,880
Well, not exactly.

428
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,320
I noticed that
the Queen of Pharmacy was close to Dai,

429
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,960
holding hands
and being all intimate with her,

430
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,560
so I picked a fight with that queen.

431
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,040
After that, I found out

432
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,480
that she was Dai's sister.

433
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,880
Why didn't you
make sure of it beforehand?

434
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,520
You were being impatient again, huh?

435
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,440
Well, I didn't know!

436
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,840
They have different last names.

437
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,240
Who would have thought
she was Dai's half-sister?

438
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,080
Just your luck.

439
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
So what's next?

440
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,120
How big of a fit did you throw?

441
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,360
I think...

442
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
we need Junior's help with this.

443
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,240
[I'm sorry, Ging]

444
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,520
Why don't you go take a shower?

445
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,120
She's gonna reply when she wants to.

446
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,480
Staring at it doesn't help, Jane.

447
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,920
I don't think this will work, Ju.

448
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,600
Is there another way?

449
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,400
If she doesn't read
or reply to your message,

450
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,200
then there's only one way.

451
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,180
What is it?!

452
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,640
Apologize to her in person,

453
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,600
but that's not how you do things.

454
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,360
You don't normally
beg for forgiveness, anyway.

455
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,040
I can do it if I have to.

456
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,240
Seems like
she's really into this girl.

457
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,560
I thought so.

458
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
Poor Jane.

459
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,560
Being a woman,
you must tend to your facial skin.

460
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,480
Don't let it dry out

461
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,400
like a sun-dried fish!

462
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,840
Sure, ma'am.

463
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,880
Let's see how your makeup is looking.

464
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,760
How else would it look?

465
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,600
Given my skills,

466
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
I can even turn a corpse

467
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,600
into an angel.

468
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,340
Of course,
I trust they're in good hands.

469
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,880
Oh, my, I ran out
of this lipstick color.

470
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,680
Erika, do you happen
to have one lying around?

471
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,320
You came to the right person.

472
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,400
Give that to me.

473
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,200
When it comes to lipstick,
I have all the shades under the sky.

474
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,520
Follow me.

475
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,880
Pick whichever you like, Guichai.

476
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,160
Here, does this work?

477
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Ging, so...

478
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Oh my.

479
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,600
How fabulous of Erika.

480
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,640
Right, come on.

481
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,480
There you go.

482
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,960
Thank you, ma'am.

483
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,640
I'm done, too, right?

484
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,400
Miss, you were done long ago.

485
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,560
Why are you still here?

486
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,430
What?

487
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,440
Alright, since you are already here,

488
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,160
let me take a look
at your makeup again.

489
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:35,850
Come on.

490
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,700
Now, Miss.

491
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,840
Alright.

492
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,520
My gratitude to you.

493
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,760
That was a glorious answer.

494
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,520
Minnie, Ging, Jane,

495
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
you can now go on stage.

496
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,560
Go on.

497
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,320
If you're wondering
which faculty the next three are from,

498
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,080
let's have the first girl
introduce herself.

499
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,170
I'm...sorry that I misunderstood you.

500
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,880
What did you
misunderstand exactly, JaneWill?

501
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,080
Are you talking
about my relationship with Dai?

502
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,040
We've been close since we were little,

503
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,240
and I love being clingy to her.

504
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,600
Anyway, I'm sorry
for causing the misunderstanding.

505
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,560
Next up, Miss Khemmika Arunajanjam,

506
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,360
from the Faculty of Pharmacy.

507
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,800
Though,

508
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,080
JaneWill, I don't think
someone like you is right for Dai.

509
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,520
I think Dai
deserves someone prettier

510
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,080
and smarter.

511
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,920
Stay away from her.

512
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,280
Hello!

513
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,800
I'm Ging, Khemmika Arunajanjam

514
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,480
from the Faculty of Pharmacy.

515
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,720
I'm so grateful to be able to...

516
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,880
Quick, let's get inside.

517
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,120
I told you to buy less food!

518
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,600
You act like this is a movie theater.

519
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,400
- Don't eat it if you're this fussy.
- Hey, those are still empty.

520
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,400
- Get in.
- Quick.

521
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,360
Please give me lots of love

522
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
and support, everyone.

523
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,280
JaneWill, go slay!

524
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,560
Waii, sit the hell down!

525
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,800
- Why?
- Come on, everyone's staring!

526
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
We're sorry.

527
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,850
Just eat.

528
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,200
Look, there are two of Jane's fans.

529
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,240
Make that three.

530
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,200
I'm also in.

531
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,800
How do you think your protege will do?

532
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,320
I always believe she can do it.

533
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
You're confident, too!

534
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Here goes nothing!

535
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,360
Let's cheer for her like never before.

536
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,500
Come on, let's go.

537
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Call your sister, Junior.

538
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,840
I think Jane's busy.

539
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,160
She's gonna call you back
when she's done with her thing.

540
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,120
I wonder
how the placements will go,

541
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,120
or if she's gonna become
the campus queen!

542
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,990
So, in other words, you're just crazy
about your daughter?

543
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,920
Don't you tease me like that!

544
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,960
Goodness,

545
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,000
maybe they have a live broadcast?

546
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,720
Let's turn the TV on.

547
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,690
Mom, it's the campus
king and queen competition,

548
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,960
not Miss Universe.

549
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,800
I think you should
calm down and be patient.

550
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,240
She's gonna tell you
when she's done with it.

551
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,200
I'm gonna pray to the deities

552
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,840
as another way to help her.

553
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
I'd better get going.

554
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,320
And this is the talent segment
by the Queen of Fine and Applied Arts,

555
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,600
Miss Jarin Tiansawangwarp.

556
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,960
Now, for the question,

557
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,920
I'd like to ask you

558
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,400
if you were to become
the campus queen,

559
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,540
how would you utilize the Internet
to benefit the world?

560
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,040
Jarin...

561
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,000
Answer the question.
Why are you just frozen there?

562
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,480
You're gonna put everyone
to sleep once again.

563
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,080
Please.

564
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,240
I will use it
for the online Loy Krathong festival!

565
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,720
What do you mean?

566
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,280
How are we gonna do that?

567
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,190
Well, I think
that if we float the krathong online,

568
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,040
it will help save the planet
and the environment

569
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,280
by reducing
disposal in the rivers.

570
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,600
I think this is
the best approach to it.

571
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
I don't think she's the one.

572
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Right.

573
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,640
That's amazing,
the online Loy Krathong festival

574
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,040
for less pollution and all that.

575
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,960
There's that, I guess.

576
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,680
Alright, now that
we have announced our campus king,

577
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:30,400
it's time for this year's
Wonder University campus queen!

578
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,790
She's perfect.

579
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,100
Dear judges, if you're ready,

580
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,800
pass up your scoring to the stage.

581
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,760
Please.

582
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,120
I must mention that,
aside from the judges' scores,

583
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,840
votes from all our students also count.

584
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,040
Thank you.

585
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,200
Wow!

586
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,080
How thrilling!

587
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
Here goes...

588
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,640
Are you ready?

589
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,200
If so,

590
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,920
I would like to announce that

591
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,400
this year's
Wonder University's campus queen is...

592
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,960
Miss Panisara Khanom

593
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,840
from the Faculty of Architecture!

594
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,400
Congratulations!

595
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,880
Please come up front.

596
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,080
Come up front.

597
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,000
Alright.

598
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,160
Oh, my, I'm so proud of them.

599
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,600
Our students are such beauties.

600
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,880
Now, the title is being passed over

601
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,040
from last year's campus queen
to this year's.

602
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,760
Congratulations, sweetie.

603
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,560
Alright, let's give her
another round of applause!

604
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,680
This is truly amazing!

605
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,040
It's alright, Jane.

606
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,440
I'll always root for you.

607
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,320
Thank you.

608
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,960
Please leave a message after the beep.

609
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,360
Ju, where are you?

610
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,560
Hello, Cake! Can you...

611
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,640
Jane, I'm fighting with my cat.

612
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,680
I'm hanging up.

613
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,680
What?

614
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,400
Hello, Waii?

615
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,640
- Are you free to talk?
- What's up?

616
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,960
I'm looking for an outfit,

617
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,840
but I still don't know what to wear.

618
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,240
Like, should it be
simple or flamboyant,

619
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,640
a pair of pants or a skirt,

620
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,070
long or short-sleeved,

621
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,080
a T-shirt or a shirt...

622
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:57,920
Girl, stop.

623
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,560
Just tell me briefly
where you're going.

624
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,100
So...

625
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,160
Dai asked me out for dinner tonight.

626
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,760
Oh, so it's a date.

627
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,240
Okay, I got it.

628
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,360
Wear your best outfit

629
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,880
and go all out, alright?

630
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,560
Like what?

631
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,560
A love-haze fit.

632
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,320
What is it?

633
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,680
Gosh, why is it
so hard for you to get it?

634
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,400
Just wear something that Dai
won't be able to take her eyes off.

635
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,200
And when you're alone, try to be cute.

636
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,120
Less talk, more smile.

637
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,240
And when she looks into your eyes,
you gotta act a little shy

638
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,960
to get her excited
by how innocent you are.

639
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,920
Got it?

640
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,160
Mm, I got it.

641
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,560
And take some videos for me, too.

642
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,280
- I wanna see it.
- Mm.

643
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm hanging up.

644
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,800
Why are you staring at me, Dai?

645
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,800
Do you have to go that hard
on your outfit?

646
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,560
Don't you like it?

647
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,280
- I'll go change.
- Hey!

648
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,490
Yes, I do like it.

649
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,040
It's adorable.

650
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,480
Looks really good on you.

651
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,880
Let's hop on the motorbike.

652
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,760
Are you sure?

653
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,020

664
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,120
Ooh, so you're all
about glamour now, JaneWill?

665
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,000
All of a sudden, you got into makeup.

666
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,800
It's not about glamour.

667
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,440
I bet she's in a relationship now.

668
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,160
Why do you have
to be involved with my sister?

669
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,320
What's going on, JaneWill?

670
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,520
Out of all the girls in the world,

671
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,080
why mess with your brother's girl?

672
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,560
Why don't you pick up my calls
around this d*mn woman?

673
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,600
Hey, watch your mouth.

674
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,880
Is Waii really a lesbian?

675
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,600
Stop sticking your nose
into others' business.

676
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,440
What?!

677
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,480
Knock it off!

678
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,360
I was coming to find you.

679
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,760
What is it, Champ?
