00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,840
[This program is intended for
audiences aged 13 and over]

00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,440
[It may contain
explicit visuals, audio, and content;

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,000
viewers under the age of 13
should be advised]

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,570
After three years, our love

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,970
seems to be going beautifully,

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,250
but still, there are
some days when we fight.

8
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,690
Here you go.

9
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,210
If I have to wait
just for you to be 30 minutes late,

10
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,530
I won't give you rides anymore.

11
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,730
I have to rush to my class, too.

12
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,610
If you were in a hurry,
why didn't you call me?

13
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,370
I could've come down
without showering.

14
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,410
Jane,

15
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,650
I called you three times,

16
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,170
but you never picked up.

17
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,040
[Missed calls from Dai]

18
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,250
I... I'm sorry.

19
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,410
I didn't bring my phone
into the bathroom,

20
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,600
so I didn't hear your calls.

21
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,450
Next time, I'll come here myself.

22
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,590
I'm not gonna bother you anymore.

23
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,560
I'm also thinking
that I won't give you rides anymore.

24
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,050
Because it's time we move in together.

25
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,490
Huh?

26
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,750
What did you say?

27
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,690
Here.

28
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,830
We're pretty worn out already.

29
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,470
Should we pick this up tomorrow?

30
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,830
No way.

31
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,950
I don't want to make a mess
from the first day.

32
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,150
Then how about
you take a shower to freshen up?

33
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,150
I'll put your clothes away
in our closet.

34
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,310
Nuh-uh, no.

35
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,470
Are you sure?

36
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,910
Where are you going?

37
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,510
I'm so sweaty.

38
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,830
Don't you think I smell bad?

39
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,670
It's not like
it's the first time you're sweaty.

40
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,870
Ju!

41
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,070
What's up?

42
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,990
It's just...

43
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,350
I need to pick your brain on something.

44
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,830
What's going on?

45
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,710
You know that...

46
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,350
I'm moving in with Dai today, right?

47
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,230
I...

48
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,550
I'm just wondering...

49
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,550
Like...if my butt itches,

50
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,230
do I scratch it in secret?

51
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,590
Trust me,
it's gonna be like that at first,

52
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,550
but after some time, you're gonna
scratch your butt right in front of her.

53
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,790
That can't be!

54
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,059
It's not just for you, though.

55
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,910
She's gonna do it, too.

56
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,950
You guys are gonna be more comfortable
and open with each other.

57
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,190
Then, you're saying that if it itches,

58
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,030
I can just go for it?

59
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,990
Bet.

60
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,030
Eek!

61
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,310
Aren't you gonna peel it first, Jane?

62
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:22,790
Eek!

63
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,510
I thought it was an apple.

64
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,350
Can you sleep?

65
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,270
Jane?

66
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,310
Are you already asleep?

67
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,070
Not yet.

68
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,470
It's probably the first-night effect

69
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,790
keeping me from falling asleep.

70
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,910
Does it give you peace of mind
with me by your side?

71
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,830
Yes.

72
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:56,310
Dai?

73
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,510
Yes?

74
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,070
From now on,

75
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,605
please take care of me.

76
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,550
You, too.

77
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,630
My university life
is flying by so fast.

78
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,870
With only a blink of an eye,

79
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,150
I'm already a junior.

80
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,998
And this girl
is my first-year peer mentee,

81
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,030
named 'Kim.'

82
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,590
Here you go.

83
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,870
Whoa, Jane.

84
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,470
You bought me desserts again.

85
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,110
Do you want me to have a chubby face?

86
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,030
The desserts from this place
are really good, Kim.

87
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,150
You do remember
that my family owns a bakery, right?

88
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,070
Anyway, thank you,

89
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,310
JaneWill!

90
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,470
Kim!

91
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,310
I told you not to call me
by that name, didn't I?

92
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,110
Just 'Jane,' not 'JaneWill'!

93
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,390
Why not?

94
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,190
I think 'JaneWill'
has a nice ring to it.

95
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,630
It's totally unique.

96
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,430
Plus, everyone on campus knows it.

97
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,750
Kim!

98
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,470
How about this?

99
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,310
I'll also change my name to 'KimWill.'

100
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,310
That way, everyone will know
we're a mentor and a mentee.

101
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,030
JaneWill and KimWill.

102
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,950
Watch it!

103
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,910
Well, then, I'm going to class.

104
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,590
Thanks again,

105
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,070
JaneWill!

106
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,830
Jane, come eat your favorite
stir-fried rice noodles with soy sauce.

107
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,550
Just a sec. Let me reply to my texts.

108
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,190
What's going on?

109
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,590
Normally, if she knew I bought her
this favorite dish of hers,

110
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,830
she would leave everything
and jump right at it.

111
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,310
Today, though, she seems different.

112
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,070
Who's she texting?

113
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,150
Jane,

114
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,390
another minute and it's gonna get cold.

115
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,030
Jane!

116
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,870
I'm done!

117
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,830
Whoa!

118
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,870
It smells incredible.

119
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,070
Come on,

120
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,910
the first bite is yours.

121
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:23,830
Here.

122
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,790
Here comes the choo-choo train!

123
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,630
Is it good?

124
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,590
Leave them there; I got it.

125
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,910
No,

126
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,510
I got it.

127
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,350
Go take a seat, Dai.

128
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,350
Didn't your mom say...

129
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,770
you always break dishes?

130
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,030
Who got you smiling like that?

131
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,390
I'm not even doing anything.

132
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,350
You're imagining it.

133
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,910
So you're just smiling to yourself?

134
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,910
That's odd.

135
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,510
Was there a phenomenon last night?

136
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,470
Hm?

137
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,150
Phenomenon?

138
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,550
What phenomenon?

139
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,830
The Two Moons!

140
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,590
Rewind, Kaning.

141
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,270
Nothing you said makes sense.

142
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,450
- The Two-Moon phenomenon?
- Mm!

143
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,710
What's that supposed to mean?

144
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,590
Tell me.

145
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,870
You're totally out of the loop.

146
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,030
Jane and Dai

147
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,470
have already moved in together!

148
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,150
Wait, deadass?!

149
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,150
Totally!

150
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,470
Could've led with that!

151
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,790
So, was it as sweet as a honeymoon?

152
00:16:40,662 --> 00:16:42,110
Rong, what nonsense!

153
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,950
You're so dirty-minded!

154
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,310
What? When girlfriends are together...

155
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,990
If you don't help me
with the group project today,

156
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,510
I'll be crossing your name out!

157
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,750
Ooh!

158
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,150
Miss Darin, my dearest of friends...

159
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,390
Miss Darin, the beauty,

160
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,830
I was merely teasing you.

161
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,870
From now on,
I'll refrain from doing so.

162
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,190
But don't you think
our bestie here looks sleep-deprived?

163
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,830
I guess the Moon rose all night long!

164
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,510
Stop it!

165
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,630
What even was that?

166
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,270
You're crazy.

167
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,570
You gotta keep up
with the nourishment now.

168
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,710
Want some coffee?

169
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,350
- I'm jelly!
- Me too.

170
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,150
I had so much fun and so much food.

171
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,430
It was so spicy, though.

172
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,470
Was it?

173
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,190
- Have you eaten?
- I have.

174
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,510
You don't do spicy, right?

175
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,390
Such a baby.

176
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,870
So, how are you guys doing in classes?

177
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,876
Jane, I'm here.

178
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,390
Give me five.

179
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,430
Sure.

180
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,790
That...

181
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,150
is Dai.

182
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,470
Stay here. I have to go.

183
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,350
Bye-bye!

184
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,590
Bye.

185
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,310
Let's go.
What should we have for dinner?

186
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,710
Who was that girl?

187
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,310
Oh, Kim!

188
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,190
The first-year peer mentee
I always told you about.

189
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,190
Right...

190
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,070
She's pretty cute.

191
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,390
True!

192
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,711
Kim is such a nice and adorable girl!

193
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,870
She's not picking up
what I'm putting down

194
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,430
about me not wanting to see her
getting close to that kid?

195
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,150
Let's go now.

196
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,670
Come on, are you hungry?

197
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,950
Let's get going!

198
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,750
What should we have for dinner?

199
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,950
How about noodles at Rong's shop?

200
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,510
She's sound asleep.

201
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,750
Are you mad...

202
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:09,590
Who'd get mad at your cute little face?

203
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,990
Jane, what do you wanna have for dinner?

204
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,150
I'll go ahead and order it for you.

205
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,470
You can just order what you need.

206
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,950
I'm gonna be home a little late.

207
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,950
Where are you going?

208
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,230
Just running some errands.

209
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,470
Who are you going with?

210
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,510
A friend?

211
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,010
Uh, with...

212
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,710
With a freshman.

213
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,620
A freshman?

214
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,990
Is that Kim, her peer mentee?

215
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,910
Then, when are you gonna be done?

216
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,950
I'll come get you home.

217
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,070
How so?

218
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,230
I have your motorbike with me.

219
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,190
I have my way.

220
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,310
Just send me the location.

221
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,030
Dai, don't you have to meet
the deadline?

222
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,070
You don't have to come.

223
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,190
I'm hanging up.

224
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,230
Jane!

225
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,630
Who's that freshman?

226
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,470
Where did you guys go?

227
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,310
How many people were there?
Just the two of you?

228
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,670
Wow, that feels like an investigation.

229
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,350
Which one
do you want me to answer first?

230
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,390
Just answer me.

231
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,590
I went there with Kim.

232
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,110
There were two of us.

233
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,310
Where did you go?

234
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,230
It's a secret.

235
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,110
Where did you go?

236
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,150
I'll tell you all about it later.

237
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,750
I'm taking a shower, Dai.

238
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,230
I'm going now.

239
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,270
I'll tell you later.

240
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,710
I'm off.

241
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,190
Hey, look.

242
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,030
- Hm?
- Look.

243
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,870
- That's frying me!
- Right?

244
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,070
What's going on, Miss Darin?

245
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,710
You look pretty tense.

246
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,190
Is that Botox or something?

247
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,910
Cut the jokes.

248
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,190
I'm not in the mood for those today.

249
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,750
I saw you two
being so in love just the other day.

250
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,550
Or is it that...

251
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,630
she broke up with you?!

252
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,270
Jeez, I'm sure it's not that serious.

253
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,630
Don't just say things.

254
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,750
Jane's been acting differently.

255
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,790
Different how?

256
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,670
She's way too close
with that peer mentee.

257
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,270
They went out one-on-one

258
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,670
without even telling me.

259
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,270
Last night was even more infuriating.

260
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,030
She came home at almost 9 P.M.!

261
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,110
I knew it! I can smell the sus.

262
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,790
Well, freshmen, right?

263
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,030
They have bright little faces,

264
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,510
unlike some ancient seniors.

265
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,310
If you don't want to end up heartbroken,

266
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,390
you gotta keep an eye on them.

267
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,870
Rong, don't be so foul-mouthed.

268
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,390
There's probably nothing going on.

269
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,230
But I mean it.

270
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,830
Well, what about what we talked about?

271
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,150
Did your family say yes?

272
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,870
Of course, no sweat.

273
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,630
That's nice!

274
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,830
But you gotta promise me

275
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,230
that you'll keep this a secret.

276
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,750
Well, wouldn't Dai be mad at me

277
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,070
if she found out?

278
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,190
Then,

279
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,030
we have to make sure she doesn't!

280
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,670
Dai's coming.

281
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,630
Dai, how did you get here?

282
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,230
Walking.

283
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,310
Then, how long have you been here?

284
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,110
Long enough to see you
sit here with your peer mentee.

285
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,230
You're Kim, aren't you?

286
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,430
Yes.

287
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,830
Did you eat something spicy earlier?

288
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,110
You're so feisty.

289
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,630
Then, excuse me.

290
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,270
Gorgeous,

291
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,350
you have such beautiful eyes.

292
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,470
Ow, ouch,

293
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,350
my eyes are burning

294
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,790
from your unmatched beauty again!

295
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,790
We need to talk.

296
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,270
Uh...

297
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,550
There's really nothing going on, Dai.

298
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,670
Even though she's your peer mentee,

299
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,430
you don't have to be this close.

300
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,670
I'm sorry, Dai.

301
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:22,390
I'll try not to be chummy
with Kim like that again.

302
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,670
Jane!

303
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,350
I'm... I'm coming home.

304
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,710
It's gonna be just a sec.

305
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,350
Don't hang up just yet!

306
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,390
Where are you now?

307
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,070
It's a secret.

308
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,110
I'm hanging up now.

309
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,270
Jane?

310
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,950
Why did Dai sound so stern?

311
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,350
Has she...

312
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,510
caught me?

313
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,830
Probably not, right?

314
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,790
Where did you guys go?

315
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,590
How many people were there?

316
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,830
I went there with Kim.

317
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,390
There were two of us.

318
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,630
I'm coming in!

319
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,030
Jane,

320
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,470
this isn't funny.

321
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,510
I've set up the room
and prepared this place,

322
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,030
along with some fried chicken,
since this evening,

323
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,830
and this is when you decided
to come home?

324
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,870
You don't value today at all.

325
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,830
Dai, you're being so harsh.

326
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,830
Well, look at what you did.

327
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,390
Have you ever even cared about me?

328
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,310
Uh, I...

329
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,350
Go on.

330
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,630
I'm waiting for your explanation.

331
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,230
Jane...

332
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,510
Jane?

333
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,390
Kim's family owns a bakery,

334
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,350
so I applied for a baking course

335
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,950
to surprise you with a cake.

336
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,790
That means...the reason you're close
with your peer mentee lately

337
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,230
is that you wanted
to bake a cake to surprise me?

338
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,870
All this time,

339
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,550
you've been taking
such good care of me,

340
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,670
so I thought...

341
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,390
I wanted to do
something special for you.

342
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,350
Jane...

343
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,310
I'm so sorry

344
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,270
that I...

345
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,230
Dai...

346
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,710
were you jealous?

347
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,550
Uh...

348
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,590
I...

349
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,820
I was just...a little jealous.

350
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,870
Heh-heh.

351
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:47,910
Here.

352
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,630
I love what you've done with the place.

353
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,270
I also wanted to surprise you.

354
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,350
I'm sorry
for causing the misunderstanding.

355
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,550
It's all good.

356
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,470
I'm not gonna plan
a surprise for you anymore.

357
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,510
Hey!

358
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,150
Absolutely not.

359
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,710
You gotta do it again sometimes.

360
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,350
But...

361
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,470
Just don't keep it a secret from me.

362
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,590
What? If I don't keep it a secret,

363
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,590
how is it supposed to be a surprise?

364
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,670
Good question.

365
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:18,310
I really misunderstood Kim.

366
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,710
I don't know
if she already hates me at this point.

367
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,230
I don't think so.

368
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:29,190
And you don't have to worry about Kim

369
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,830
because she's already taken.

370
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,230
Besides...

371
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,390
I...

372
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,030
love being alone.

373
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,510
Huh?

374
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,270
"Love being alone"?

375
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,670
♫I love being alone,♫ as in...

376
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,510
I love being alone with you.

377
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,170
What am I gonna do to you? Hm?

378
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,550
Why?

379
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:12,950
Well, you're giving me cute aggression.

380
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,790
♫I love being alone♫

381
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,470
Come on, I'll feed you.

382
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,550
How about this? Is it too big?

383
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,420
Is it?

384
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,150
Fine, go on.

385
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,350
- Big bite.
- Big bite.

386
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:06,230
♫Just a gaze from you
warms my heart away♫

387
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:12,190
♫Just your smile from you
paints the whole world anew♫

388
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,270
♫Nothing's ever the same♫

389
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,430
♫Don't know when it all began,♫

390
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:22,150
♫Suddenly, I can't get you off my mind♫

391
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:28,790
♫Guess you are the sweetest kind♫

392
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:36,270
♫Every time you are near,
I feel at ease♫

393
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:42,390

396
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:58,390
♫You're too cute,

399
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:17,550
I don't think that works.

400
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:18,910
- Try again.
- Let's try again.

401
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,750
So cute!

402
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:25,790
Cut.

403
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:29,390
I'm sorry.

404
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,270
Cut...

405
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:35,310
Was that too fast?

406
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,110
I'm sorry.

407
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,310
Greetings to both of you.

408
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:49,830
Why the bow?

409
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,830
What's with the gesture?

410
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,830
- Huh? What did you say?
- What...

411
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,750
- Pearmai...
- What was that, sweetie?

412
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:59,990
Girls, once you've had
enough snicks and dranks...

413
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,630
"Snicks and dranks."

414
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,870
It's, "Snacks and drinks."

415
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,510
- Wait, wait.
- Hold on, girls.

416
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,230
Goodbye.

417
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,270
Hold on, let's try that again.

418
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,470
- We're not done.
- I'm sorry.

419
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,350
- Not yet.
- Auntie, just stay cool for now.

420
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:30,230
I'm sorry. I'll order them
to cancel all the flights.

421
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,390
"Are you working for an airline?"

422
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,230
Ugh...Jane...

423
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:45,270
I almost won the jackpot back.

424
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:47,870
Always happens to me!

425
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:49,350
Action.

426
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:52,030
I heard through the grapevine...

427
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,190
- Let me make the face.
- Someone's revving their engine.

428
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,190
Cut.

429
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,310
Jane will take care of the dishes.

430
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:01,950
Wait...

431
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:02,750
It's, "I'll."

432
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,470
Come on, do that again.

433
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:07,750
I'll take care of the dishes.

434
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:09,790
Go right in.

435
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,990
Can you help Jelly face this way?

436
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:16,710
Jane, is that you?

437
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,910
Mom, you have to act like
you think she already picks up.

438
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:19,790
- Oh.
- Right, I have to...

439
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,070
Here, I'll put it on a plate.

440
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,230
I'm not hungry anymore!

441
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,910
Why didn't you snatch it?

442
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:31,950
- Why didn't you?
- You gotta snatch it.

443
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,510
- Ooh, that's right.
- Snatch it.

444
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,070
- Give it to me, Junior.
- Heck no.

445
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:36,110
- Give it to me!
- Heck no.

446
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:36,990
- Give it to me.
- Heck no.

447
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,190
Junior!

448
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,350
I'm moving back in with...

449
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,630
I'm going back to the condo.

450
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,550
One more time.

451
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:50,190
I'm not worried...

452
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,510
Oops!

453
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:53,470
- "I'm not worried..."
- One more time.

454
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,310
How about you tell them yourself?
They're all here,

455
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,350
except Mom...

456
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:58,870
How about you tell them yourself?
Only Dad is missing.

457
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,630
Try again, he misspoke.

458
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,110
- Lock me up. Mom's standing...
- Sorry.

459
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,870
Just in time,

460
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,350
you come...

461
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,350
- "You came just in time."
- Right.

462
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,510
Just in time...

463
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,190
Jeez, why am I like this?

464
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,950
It's time for food.

465
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,270
Hi, Mom.

466
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,630
You got your line wrong again.

467
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,790
- "You came just in time for food."
- "You came just in time for food."

468
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,070
Cake doesn't like anyone

469
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,190
at first,

470
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,270
but in reality, she's nice.

471
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,230
You missed your line there.

472
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,510
"Cake? That's just how she is."

473
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,310
We never seem to change.

474
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,790
There's a motorbike passing by.

475
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:34,670
- Let's do that one more time.
- Let's do it.

476
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,670
I done asked...

477
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,270
I'm sorry.

478
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:41,530
How is it?

479
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,510
Still as good as ever?

480
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,190
- That doesn't work. Move over a bit.
- Move a bit.

481
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,630
I know you're trying
to steal my thunder.

482
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:48,550
- Cut.
- You're overthinking it.

483
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,270
Wow, did you really have
to work this hard, Darin?

484
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,270
Come on, reset.

485
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,670
- Go back to where you were.
- Walk back.

486
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,270
We just wanna know.

487
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:12,350
Why'd she get mad at us for?

488
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,270
I'm sorry.

489
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,910
- Continue.
- Go back.

490
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,470
Not yet.

491
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:24,550
- Just a sec.
- Go back out.

492
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,950
Let's go.

493
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,310
Have a safe trip back.

494
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:43,990
You missed the mark.

495
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:45,710
- You gotta be on it.
- Okay.

496
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:51,470
It wasn't a kiss!
It was just a peck!

497
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:54,430
Vroom.
