[This program is intended for
audiences aged 13 and over]

00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,440
[It may contain
explicit visuals, audio, and content;

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,000
viewers under the age of 13
should be advised]

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,940
These are the photos of my family.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,560
I have twin brothers,
Jimmy and Junior,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,800
and another brother named Justin.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,880
But after the decision to transition,

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,760
Justin changed her name to Jasmine.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,200
Jimmy, Junior, Justin...

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,960
everyone has two-syllable nicknames.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,360
Even our dog was named Jelly.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,655
But when the youngest one arrived,

13
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,880
they decided to give her
a one-syllable nickname, Jane.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,040
We are a small, cozy family

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,040
who prefers to keep to ourselves.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,080
But the neighbors are always
poking around in our business.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,560
It was this auntie
who tattled on Jasmine with that photo.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,200
I guess she has too much free time,

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,600
so she decided to spend it
on our family stuff.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,080
Little girl,

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,960
you got into university this year?

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,320
Yes.

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,120
What did you choose to major in?

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,920
Do you want to be a teacher
like your mom?

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,240
No, I chose Fine and Applied Arts.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,000
Huh? Like drawing and all that?

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,080
How are you gonna put food
on the table with that degree?

28
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,520
Well, by cooking.

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Brat!

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
You're getting on my nerves!

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,160
How did they raise these kids?

32
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,680
Jane,

33
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,520
I brought some desserts for you,

34
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,519
but I haven't seen you since yesterday.

35
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,360
Are you okay?

36
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,480
Would you like me
to keep you company?

37
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:13,026
[It's okay. I'm fine]

38
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,840
I'm not okay at all.

39
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,069
Jane?

40
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,720
Jane?

41
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,485
Jane, eat something, alright?

42
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,400
I caused you so much trouble...

43
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,640
Not at all.

44
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,738
I want to take care of you, Jane.

45
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,680
Well, don't you wanna know
what happened to me?

46
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,800
Of course, I do,

47
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,840
but I just didn't want to ask.

48
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,880
I believe everyone
has their own private life,

49
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,960
but if you wanna share, I'm here.

50
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,600
My childhood dog...

51
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,560
passed away.

52
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,920
Everyone has to go through
the loss of something they love.

53
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,440
Jelly wasn't just something I love.

54
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,034
She was family,

55
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,680
a friend,

56
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,440
an encouragement,

57
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,680
someone who was there for me
through every moment of my life.

58
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,600
Right now, she has happily
crossed the rainbow bridge.

59
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,280
If she looks down from above

60
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,360
and sees her loved one crying,

61
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,280
not eating, or sleeping,

62
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,360
she'd probably be heartbroken

63
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,480
for making you feel this way.

64
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,120
This is so ridiculous of me, right?

65
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,800
Not at all.

66
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,680
If it were me, I'd be very sad, too.

67
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,560
But I do want you to know

68
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,720
that no matter how sad you are,

69
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,040
you'll have to accept the reality

70
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,520
and live in the present.

71
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,520
Be strong, alright?

72
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,360
From now on, come rain or shine,

73
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,360
you'll always see me
right next to you.

74
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,640
I'll always be your strength
and your supporter, Jane.

75
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,440
Dai...

76
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,720
Yes?

77
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,160
I want you to hug me.

78
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,680
Excuse me, then.

79
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,520
You and Dai are too chill.

80
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,920
Even after you both feel the same,
you're still in a talking stage?

81
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,720
Playing hard to get much?

82
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,040
Well...

83
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,760
Who'd be as hasty as you, Waii?

84
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,400
Me?

85
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,920
What about me?

86
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,080
I don't think
you and Orn are just friends.

87
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
I found photos of you
on her Facebook account,

88
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,720
going to pubs one after another.

89
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,680
And don't deny it.

90
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,240
There was also NewYear,

91
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,360
who you got hooked on instantly
when you first met.

92
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
So what?

93
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,480
Are you a lesbian, Waii?

94
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,364
Alright!

95
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,160
So what if I am?

96
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,760
Are you not
gonna be friends with me anymore?

97
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,418
What? Why are you sulking?

98
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,520
Cake and I just wish
you wouldn't hide it from us.

99
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,360
Mm.

100
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,240
Well, I'm just afraid
you wouldn't take it,

101
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,280
but that feeling's all gone now...

102
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Because I have JaneWill on my side.

103
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,800
Well, what about you, Cake?

104
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,417
Any thoughts?

105
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:30,980
No, girl.

106
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,600
I love gentlemen.

107
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,760
So, what's going on
between you and Dai?

108
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,358
Well, not much.

109
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,040
I think that people

110
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,840
need to take things slow,
like I'm doing now.

111
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,000
Take things slow...

112
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,230
There you go again.

113
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,080
If you guys were a novel,
you'd be over 100 chapters long.

114
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,800
She's right. Why beat around the bush?

115
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,840
- Mm.
- I only see Dai trying to win you over.

116
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,160
You should do something to reciprocate,

117
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,989
like asking her out
for a movie, a date, or...

118
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,240
meeting your parents.

119
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,240
Facts.

120
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,200
- Meeting my parents?
- Mm.

121
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
NewYear...

122
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,880
Why are you waiting?

123
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,016
Can we go back to where we were?

124
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,000
We never seem to change.

125
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,200
God made a man and a woman
for each other,

126
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,160
not for women to love each other.

127
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,640
God made humans,

128
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,468
but He doesn't force anyone
to live a certain way.

129
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,240
Everyone should be free to love
whoever they want.

130
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,060
No way.

131
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,500
I don't want this.

132
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,680
Please don't date that Waii.

133
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,945
But I will.

134
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,840
If you insist on going out with her,

135
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,480
I'll also date boys.

136
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,960
It's your life.

137
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
You don't believe me, do you?

138
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
I'll show you!

139
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,720
What's the matter, Pangpond?

140
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,760
I don't want to live.

141
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,640
My life is over.

142
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,880
Your friend is an a**hole

143
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,400
for turning NewYear into a lesbian!

144
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,120
Waii is not the only one to blame.

145
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,400
If that girl didn't play along,

146
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,640
it'd be the end of the story, right?

147
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,000
So it's my fault?

148
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,320
You wouldn't even take my side now,
would you?

149
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,960
Good.

150
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,240
Then, you'll see the last of me!

151
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,400
What kind of man are you

152
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,920
to be so stupid?

153
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,240
Your parents raised you well.

154
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,600
They spoiled you

155
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,360
and made sure
you had everything you wanted,

156
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,440
just for you
to think about ending it all

157
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,440
because of a girl?!

158
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Moron!

159
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,120
That's why she doesn't love you.

160
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,976
You can't force people
not to love each other.

161
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,442
But you can make yourself worthy

162
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,360
so that they love you back.

163
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,560
If you want to win the battle,
you'll have to fight.

164
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,320
Change yourself,

165
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,680
so she regrets her decision.

166
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Understood?

167
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,380
- Yes...
- Come here.

168
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,960
There, there, you little puppy.

169
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,360
You're such a crybaby.

170
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,087
Would you like to join my family
for somtam this week?

171
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,680
[Can I?]

172
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,440
Order me some spicy somtam
this Sunday.

173
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,800
I'll bring a senior home.

174
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,840
My, my, was it the same one
you always talked to me about?

175
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,722
Why haven't you told me
about this, sweetie?

176
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Whoa, is someone after my little sister?

177
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,920
Alright, Jane. Leave it to me.

178
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,880
Is it really just a 'senior'?

179
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,360
Junior, Jasmine.

180
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,360
No one has answered Dad's question.

181
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,120
Hm?

182
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,480
He'll find out this Sunday.

183
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,600
Hello, Dad?

184
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,600
The senior I'm bringing home

185
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,320
is a girl.

186
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,200
Oh...

187
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,040
That's a relief.

188
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,520
I thought it was a boy.

189
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,840
Dai was last year's campus queen

190
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,600
and is now a sophomore in Architecture.

191
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,225
Mm-hm...

192
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,560
That's good, sweetie.

193
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,280
When you have older friends
from school,

194
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,800
they can step in to take care of you
if something happens.

195
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,800
Dai has been taking the best care of me.

196
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,000
She's been giving me rides,

197
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,720
buying me desserts,

198
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,281
and she even told me she liked me.

199
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,161
Hm?

200
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,480
Liked you?

201
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,320
In what way, sweetie?

202
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,800
She's asking me out.

203
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,240
Hello?

204
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,880
I think our call's been disconnected.

205
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,240
No, no, sweetie.

206
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,040
Jane,

207
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,800
let me get this straight.

208
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,760
You're telling me

209
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,200
you're a lesbian, right?

210
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,920
It's just that...

211
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,393
I just want to make sure
you like this girl,

212
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,640
but that you're also
into men in general.

213
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,160
What do you mean?

214
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:22,240
I only want to make sure

215
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,000
that I still have the chance
at grandchildren.

216
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,040
I don't want to deny who I am.

217
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,080
Also, I don't want you to have hopes

218
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,320
that I'll go out with a man someday.

219
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,680
And I think I'm a lesbian.

220
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,360
What makes you think that?

221
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,120
I don't think
you should decide this so soon.

222
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,335
I watched straight porn,

223
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,680
and it didn't make me
feel anything special.

224
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,440
But it thrills me seeing women naked.

225
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,960
Mm...

226
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:32,560
Hey!

227
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,120
Our colors match.

228
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
How cute.

229
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Dai...

230
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,760
- Give me a sec to book a ride.
- Mm!

231
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,400
Are you hungry?

232
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,740
I've got a ride for us.

233
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,360
Let's go.

234
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,593
Jimmy, clean it properly.

235
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:40,680
Yes, just like that.

236
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
- Yes, Mom.
- Oh, Mild.

237
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,599
That's good. Make it nice and neat.

238
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,040
Oh, my goodness!

239
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,680
Why are my frames in such a mess?

240
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,200
Please arrange them for me.

241
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,960
And straighten my photo,
so everyone can see my face.

242
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,360
You're doing great, sweetie.

243
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,080
For heaven's sake!

244
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,800
Look at this dust, Jasmine!

245
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,240
- Yes, Mom?
- Jasmine, sweetie.

246
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,040
Here, take a cloth
and clean the area in front of the TV.

247
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,080
Goodness, it's incredibly dusty!

248
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,560
- Hurry up.
- Sure, Mom.

249
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,280
Alright, clean it properly

250
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,489
so that it's nice and clean.

251
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,640
- Oh, my goodness! Honey!
- Huh?

252
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
Lift your feet up!

253
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,784
- What's the matter?
- Look at how dusty this is!

254
00:23:23,824 --> 00:23:24,673
- Junior?
- Yes?

255
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:26,400
Sweep this over here!

256
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,760
- Sorry, Dad.
- Please do it.

257
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,720
That's right. That's it, son.

258
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,840
- Where's the dust?
- Let's see.

259
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,508
Junior, why haven't you

260
00:23:34,532 --> 00:23:35,761
- put your broom under it?
- I'm sorry, Mom.

261
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:36,880
- Honey, lift your feet!
- I'm sorry, Dad.

262
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,360
- Whoa, whoa!
- Jeez, make it quick!

263
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,840
- Whoa, whoa!
- You're blocking my way!

264
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,445
- Jeez...
- Whatever makes you happy, honey.

265
00:23:42,485 --> 00:23:44,320
Whatever makes you happy.

266
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,040
- Honey, be honest with me.
- What?

267
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,000
Why do we have to rush the cleaning
at this minute?

268
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,240
Well, we have a very special guest
joining us today.

269
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,673
"A very special guest..."

270
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,520
Honey...

271
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,400
If you don't want to lend a hand,
stop interrupting.

272
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,960
Go sit outside
if it's such an inconvenience.

273
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,200
Please.

274
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,240
- Jeez...
- Go sit outside, Honey.

275
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,720
Fine!

276
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,400
I'm an outsider in this family now.

277
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,840
Honey, you don't even care
to arrange the pillows after yourself.

278
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,200
Jeez, we need to make it nice and tidy.

279
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Kids, hurry up, alright?

280
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

281
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,840
Yes, Mom.

282
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,320
Are you really not
gonna change your profile pic?

283
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,400
You're gonna keep using my drawing?

284
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,680
Don't you want to change it
to your pretty face?

285
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,560
I'd rather show everyone

286
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,640
that the cutest cartoonist
gave me her drawing.

287
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,120
Honestly, the picture you drew of me

288
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,640
looks even better
than I do in real life.

289
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,160
Hello, Mom.

290
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,480
- Hi, there.
- Hello.

291
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,160
This is my mom and Junior,

292
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,160
and this is Dai, my senior.

293
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,500
You're such a beautiful girl.

294
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,560
No wonder
you were the campus queen.

295
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,440
- Thank you.
- Who even told you that, Mom?

296
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,480
We'd better go inside now.

297
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,400
Come on in.

298
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:35,224
Let's go.

299
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,360
Hi, Dad.

300
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
Hi, sweetie.

301
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,680
Why are you out here in all this heat?

302
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,040
Well, your mom chased me out here,

303
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,520
telling me I was blocking her way.

304
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,960
Do you also read
'Phon Nikorn Kimngwan,' Dad?

305
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,610
Have you heard of this series?

306
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,600
My dad used to find these
for me to read, too.

307
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,200
They're pretty fun

308
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,160
and a good insight into how people lived
80 years ago in Bangkok.

309
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,040
Certainly.

310
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,600
I love reading it.

311
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,440
We have more than
100 books from this series.

312
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,480
We have to mention this one, too,

313
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,160
an edition with all the highlights
from different books.

314
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,960
It's such a great read, sweetie!

315
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,400
How nice.

316
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,960
I'm definitely
going to look for one to read.

317
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,280
Don't bother looking for one.

318
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,720
I'm about to finish this one,

319
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,440
and you can borrow it once I do.

320
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,040
You can give it back to me
after you finish reading it.

321
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,720
- Really?
- Of course.

322
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,040
Thank you.

323
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,480
I think we should continue
this conversation inside.

324
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,640
Otherwise, the food I warmed up
would get cold.

325
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,640
Let's go, kids.

326
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,440
Whoa, is this a graduation party?

327
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,940
What?!

328
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,000
After all, my daughter
is bringing a guest home.

329
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,600
Dai, you're the first friend
she's ever invited to our house.

330
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,160
- True.
- That's right.

331
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,920
You're even prettier
than any of the girlfriends I've had.

332
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,280
Hey!

333
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,400
That hurt!

334
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,320
What's your lipstick color?

335
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,320
I'm into it.

336
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
I have it in my bag.

337
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,760
- Would you like to try?
- Hold on, sweetie.

338
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,480
Let's now enjoy our meal

339
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,900
- before we talk.
- Come on.

340
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,720
- Please dig in.
- Sure.

341
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,560
- Let me have some.
- Would you like some omelet?

342
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,460
Hm...

343
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,160
Honey.

344
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Eat your food!

345
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,920
Go on now!

346
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,120
Mm...

347
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,360
Here.

348
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,720
Dai,

349
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,840
please take care of Jane for me.

350
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,640
I have no idea whether
she's causing trouble at school.

351
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,640
Keep her in her place, would you?

352
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,280
Leave it to me, Mom.

353
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,920
I'll make sure she stays in line.

354
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,160
Dai!

355
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,920
- Dad.
- Huh?

356
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,520
- Eat.
- Mm-hm.

357
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,080
Here you go.

358
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,880
Eat up, honey.

359
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,760
- Here you go, son.
- Alright, Mom.

360
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,240
I'll take care of the dishes.

361
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,640
That can't be. Go wait outside.

362
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,640
I got it.

363
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,080
Dai, go talk to Juss.

364
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,240
I'll take care of it.

365
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,600
I'm the best at dishwashing.

366
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,600
Sweetie, don't!

367
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,480
You broke so many dishes last time.

368
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,760
Just come out here, you.

369
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,120
- Mom!
- Go, and don't bother them.

370
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,400
Come on, let me handle it.

371
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
If you insist.

372
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,000
Jane isn't good at chores.

373
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,760
Why are you out here, Dad?

374
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,280
I'm waiting to have a word with you.

375
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,160
You're making quite a serious face.

376
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,800
Jane,

377
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,200
when you told me you were a lesbian,

378
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,920
did you consider

379
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,920
who would take care of you

380
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,480
when you get older

381
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,400
and don't have children?

382
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,520
Well...

383
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,040
Dai and I can take care of each other.

384
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,840
And what if you break up before that?

385
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,320
I don't think this kind of love

386
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,560
will last long.

387
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,800
Then I'll keep it in the fridge.

388
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,000
Now's not the time for jokes.

389
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,760
I'm being serious, sweetie.

390
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:52,240
Then why do you think a relationship
between women wouldn't last?

391
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,440
I don't think it's relevant.

392
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,360
Even one between a man
and a woman can end.

393
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Look at the auntie next door.

394
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,760
She's divorced.

395
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,240
With Juss,

396
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,600
it took me a long time
to come to terms with it.

397
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,680
Now, it's you.

398
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,160
I don't know where I'd put myself

399
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,320
or even how I could come to accept it.

400
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,480
I believe that if you love me,

401
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,280
my sexual orientation

402
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,680
is not going to be a problem
in our family.

403
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,840
What are you thinking, Dai?

404
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,880
I'm sorry.

405
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,440
For what?

406
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,740
Well...

407
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,840
Besides Ging,
I'm not close to anyone in my family.

408
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,720
When problems come up,

409
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,640
the only thing I do is text my parents.

410
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,680
We never sit down face-to-face

411
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,320
or have a family meal together.

412
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,400
After what I saw today,

413
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,320
I feel even worse.

414
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,280
Your family gave me the warmest welcome,

415
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
but...

416
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,280
I can't even take you
to meet my parents.

417
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,480
It's all good.

418
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,320
It's not a problem for me at all.

419
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,800
So don't stress out, okay?

420
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,080
But...

421
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,480
Are you sure you're okay with things
the way they are?

422
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,720
Mm.

423
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,000
I guess I am.

424
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,160
I got used to being independent

425
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,400
because I've been living on my own
since high school.

426
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,360
I don't feel like I'm missing anything,

427
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,080
though I do get lonely sometimes.

428
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,680
I guess you don't get lonely anymore.

429
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,400
'Cause I'll keep you busy.

430
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,960
Thank you, beautiful.

431
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,520
Are you tired today?

432
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,900
Not at all.

433
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,480
It's been so much fun.

434
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,160
What about you?
What do you think about my family?

435
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,840
They're adorable.

436
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,640
I absolutely love them.

437
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
Dai?

438
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,640
Yes?

439
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,960
I think...

440
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,880
I have a feeling
that I want to open the door.

441
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,120
Where's your key? Unlock it.

442
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,120
I'll help you find it.

443
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,200
Hey, Dai!

444
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,960
Just kidding.

445
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,920
Jane?

446
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,280
Yes?

447
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Do you know that being together
isn't the end of our journey,

448
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,200
but just the beginning?

449
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,720
Yes.

450
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,160
Once we make it official,

451
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,040
our relationship will be clearer,

452
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,960
and we'll gradually learn
each other's strengths and weaknesses.

453
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,350
There will probably be days
when we fight or disagree,

454
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,940
but we'll get through them together.

455
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
Understood?

456
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,960
I do now.

457
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,200
I'll do my absolute best.

458
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,080
I will, too.

459
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,240
I will go all in.

460
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,880
So...

461
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,760
Will you be my girlfriend, Jane?

462
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:21,120
♫Every time you are near,
I feel at ease♫

463
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,760
♫You're too cute,
no way I can deny that♫

464
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,120
♫You're my comfort zone,
don't let go of me♫

465
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,720
Thank you.

466
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,920
One blended banana milk, please.

467
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,240
Congratulations,
you're the 99th customer of the day.

468
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,640
There's a buy 1 get 1 free deal for you.

469
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,320
Here you go.

470
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,480
Thank you!

471
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,920
Thank you, too.

472
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,400
After the day I said yes
to being Dai's girlfriend,

473
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,600
my life has been graced
with many good things!

474
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,260
Out of the blue, I got
a buy 1 get 1 free deal

475
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,160
for being the 99th customer of the day!

476
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,920
Plus, I'm also lucky in love.

477
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,800
Morning, I miss you.

478
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,240
Morning, miss you, too, Dai.

479
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,760
But the most surprising thing of all
is a message from Dad.

480
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,270
Jane,

481
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,880
bring that senior home
for a meal again sometime.

482
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,040
Sure thing.

483
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,350
But she's not just a senior now.

484
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,880
My life is at the happiest place!

485
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
Hello?

486
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,280
Hello, Jane,
my absolutely bombshell and cutie pie!

487
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,460
Right...

488
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,900
I have great news for you.

489
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,920
What is it about?

490
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,600
Our staff has been missing you
so, so much!

491
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,040
So we had a meeting and decided
we want you back on our team!

492
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,880
Right, but...

493
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,920
I don't think I'll have time
to create another comic for you.

494
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,960
I'm having fun writing the GL's one.

495
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,800
Ooh! Ooh!

496
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,080
That's exactly
what I wanted to talk about!

497
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,000
Right now, the website's wanting
to try its hand in that market.

498
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,840
You can go ahead
and publish that comic here.

499
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,580
Hard pass.

500
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,480
When I pitched the idea,
none of you cared to accept it.

501
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,840
All of a sudden,
you want to explore the market?

502
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,320
Isn't that kinda sus?

503
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,560
I think I'll stick to doing it myself.

504
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,480
And please don't contact me
any further.

505
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
Goodbye.

506
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,520
Ugh...Jane...

507
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,960
One orange cake, please.

508
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,240
Of course.

509
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,960
Who's with you today?

510
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,120
Oh, it's just me,

511
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
but I got really lucky today

512
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,440
with this buy 1 get 1 free deal!

513
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
You did?

514
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,240
Yes!

515
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,320
And how did you know I was here?

516
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,840
Is this a coincidence?

517
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,760
Love is never a coincidence.

518
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,680
If I want to see you,

519
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,120
I'll search high and low for you.

520
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,040
Dai, you silly...

521
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,360
Are you blushing, Jane?

522
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
I'm not.

523
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,680
Jane?

524
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,280
Yes?

525
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,080
From 1 to 100,

526
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,720
how much would you say you like me?

527
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,200
Hm...

528
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,040
I'd say 200!

529
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Really?

530
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,200
Then, if it gets to 300,

531
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,400
should we talk about
moving in together?

532
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,320
That way, we can do more
than what we used to.

533
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,320
You haven't ordered any drinks.

534
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,600
Here it is.
You already have one for me.

535
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,790
That's right...

536
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Getting red?

537
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,200
Dai!

538
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,880
That's the former Queen of Architecture
who's on the page's news.

539
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,920
Who is she with?

540
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,250
Do you know how sharp your eyes were

541
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,680
looking at me back then?

542
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,200
Like that.

543
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Dai!

544
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,680
Hm?

545
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,160
I have a confession to make.

546
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,600
Actually,
I also looked back at you every time.

547
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,600
I still didn't know how I felt,

548
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,560
but I did know
that I was so weirdly attracted,

549
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,800
that I couldn't help but look.

550
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,920
But, at that time,

551
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,690
you also stared at me,

552
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,720
sometimes
with your arms crossed, too.

553
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,160
That was why I thought
you didn't like me.

554
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,000
That wasn't what happened at all.

555
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,440
Here.

556
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,960
Is it good?

557
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,080
Oh, yeah.

558
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,800
Now, a university fan page
has posted about my dating news.

559
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Let me see.

560
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,680
[There are tons of Janes
on campus, so could you be specific?]

561
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,500
[That can't be; it'd be such a waste
if someone as pretty as Dai likes girls,

562
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,360
and anyone can ride on her pillion, no?
Stop making things up. Not into it]

563
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,960
[Hey, the photo is blurry,
so can I get more info?

564
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,560
Which Jane is that supposed to be?]

565
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,960
[Ooh, Dai being a lesbian got my heart
shaken, but which Jane, though?]

566
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,440
[Anyone have this Jane's social media?
Wanna give her a follow]

567
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,480
This photo...

568
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,320
is gonna get mad views!

569
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,720
What? Champ, where are you going?

570
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,240
You're quite something.

571
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,240
Don't you love me anyway?

572
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
Of course.

573
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,520
Silly you.

574
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,920
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming, Dad?

575
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,000
Or are you here to spy on me?

576
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,720
No, sweetie.

577
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,960
The reason I'm here

578
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,480
is to apologize to you
about what happened that day.

579
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,920
I just thought you were too young
for this kind of stuff.

580
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,360
But I'm almost 19 now.

581
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,640
In my eyes,

582
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,360
you're still a child no matter what.

583
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:53,120
It's just that...Dai and I got together
to gradually learn about each other.

584
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,240
We're not talking
about marriage or anything that far.

585
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,360
I know how much you love

586
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,160
and care for me,

587
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,160
but...

588
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,280
isn't it my choice to choose
who I want to spend my life with?

589
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,560
You can't stop me, either,

590
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,860
because...

591
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,480
I'll get mad at you,

592
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,360
and you will miss out on the chance
to have somtam with me all year.

593
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,920
And without me,

594
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,120
there will be lots of leftovers at home

595
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,520
since I have the biggest appetite
out of everyone.

596
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,160
But...

597
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,440
Alright, okay.

598
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,200
But you gotta remember

599
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,840
that I have the right
to keep my eye on you.

600
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,280
I don't want my little girl
to cry her eyes out in the end.

601
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,480
Well, if I ever got hurt,

602
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,870
will you hug me and comfort me, Dad?

603
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,600
I'll be here anytime
and anywhere you want.

604
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,840
Thank you, Dad.

605
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,080
Right, Dad?

606
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,800
Hm?

607
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,000
I have one question
that's always been on my mind.

608
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,880
What is it, sweetie?

609
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,320
Why do all my older siblings
have two-syllable names

610
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,480
but I only have one?

611
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,280
Oh!

612
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,120
This, huh?

613
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,560
Here's the story.

614
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,520
I was actually the one who named you

615
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,400
because your mom's name idea
was tricky to pronounce.

616
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,200
What was it?

617
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,000
Your name actually had three Js.

618
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,150
J-A-J-O-J,

619
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,430
pronounced, 'Ja-joj.'

620
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,800
I think I prefer
the name you gave me.

621
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,280
It's one syllable, but...

622
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,580
I like it!

623
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,640
Right? Good for you.

624
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,840
Otherwise, you would've grown up
being called,

625
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,960
"Ja-joj! Ja-joj!"

626
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,880
Could you imagine
how embarrassing you'd feel?

627
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,400
[Directed by SUEASIAM STUDIO]

628
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,760
You're totally out of the loop.

629
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,520
Jane and Dai
have already moved in together!

630
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,640
Thanks again, JaneWill!

631
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,720
Where did you guys go?

632
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,560
How many people were there?
Just the two of you?

633
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,200
I went there with Kim.

634
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,440
There were two of us.

635
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,400
Wouldn't Dai be mad at me
if she found out?

636
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,400
Have you ever even cared about me?

637
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,800
- I...
- Go on.

638
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,680
I'm waiting for your explanation.
