Come on.

Gosh, look at you.

Why don't you put them away?

26
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:07,360
Come on.

You stink.

28

Jeez,

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,640
I bet you haven't even taken a shower.

30
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,520
Don't tell me...

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,480
you had alcohol last night.

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,320
It wouldn't be milk tea, would it?

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,000
Hey!

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
Stop getting on my nerves.

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm just worried about you.

36
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,160
Well, I had a few drinks.

37
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,160
A few drinks,

38
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,520
and you're completely wasted.

39
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,040
If you'd had more than that,

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,160
I bet you would've run around naked.

41
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,880
Exactly.

42
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,289
Don't you think you're too fine now?

43
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,640
Why?

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,760
Wait,

45

you haven't seen the video, have you?

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,620
What video?

47
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,000

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,480
Stop fooling around, will you?

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,880
That video of you and Dai
is going viral now.

50
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,240
A video?!

51
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,300
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,240
Wait...

53
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,840
This must be a dream within a dream.

54
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,280
Wake up! Wake up now!

55
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,080
Did you get this from my dream?

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,960
It's exactly like my dream last night.

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,000
Jeez, stop being silly.

58
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,920
What dream are you talking about?

59
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,840

Oh, my...

62
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,560
Here.

63
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
See for yourself.

64
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,320
It hurts.

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,520

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Gosh...

67
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
The photo doesn't match.

68
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,480
Don't smile.

69
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,960
Now frown.

70
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,680
Are you serious?

71
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,200
Are you sure
this isn't someone else's ID card?

72
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,600
You mean she looks too pale, right?

73
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,559
Here.

74
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,080
She looks exactly like the photo, right?

75
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,080
She just didn't have
her makeup on, you know.

76
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,520
That's why she looked different.

77
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:51,433
Cheers!

at a pub, too, right?

85
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,560
That's right.

86
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,800
If you haven't tried alcohol before,

87
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,340
you'd better not try it here,

88
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,760
or you might get too drunk
to make it home.

89
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,680
Don't worry about that, France.

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,560

97

98

I'd come home
to get more clothes this week.

99

Yes?

100

101
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,540

No,

103
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,480
I wasn't.

104

What is it, Mom?

105
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,240
I was gonna ask

106
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,000
what time
you're coming home tomorrow.

I think I'll be there around noon.

110

If it's at noon,

111
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,560
then what do you want for lunch?

112
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,320
Uh...

113

114
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,040
Uh,

115

- I'm sleepy now.
- You took forever!

116
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,800
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Sorry,

117
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,840
- my car broke down.
- Wait, don't hang up yet.

118
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,840
Hurry.

119
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,640
Why am I hearing guys in your room?

120
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,200
No one's here.

121
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,800
It's probably the TV.

122
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,760
What channel are you watching?

123
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,000

but it's a wildlife documentary.

126

What?!

133

You're out
drinking with friends, aren't you?

134

No! They're my seniors.

135

Are they men or women?

Well, there are both of them.

00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,480

Aren't you too young?

151
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
How did you get in?

152
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,040
But that makeup...

153
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,640
makes you look older.

154
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,640
Do you smoke?

155
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,160
You don't like smokers, do you?

156
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
I don't mind people who smoke.

157
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,600
I just can't stand the smell.

158
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,840
My brother once got his heart broken

159
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,760
and started smoking like crazy.

160
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,840
He smoked all day. His lips turned dark,
and he smelled terrible.

161
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,240
I couldn't handle it,

162
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,560
so I told him to quit.

163
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,400
Wait, why are you putting it out?

164
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,520
Because you don't like it.

165
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,160
It shouldn't matter to you.

166
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,720
We're not that close anyway.

167
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,120
I'm about to leave, too.

168
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,560
Well,

169
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,720
I was gonna quit anyway.

170
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,140
Good, then.

171
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,920
Right.

174
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,440
Can you stop calling me "JaneWill"?

175
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,160

The Queen of FA?

177
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,480
Or should I call you by your student ID?

178
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,560
Just call me Jane.

179
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,000
Whoa...

180
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
That sounds even longer, no?

181
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,000
"Just call me Jane."

182
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
What's so funny?

183
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,152
Nothing.

184
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,400
Just thinking about it pisses me off.

185
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,920
If I'd known he was a flirt,

186
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,480
I wouldn't have let him smash me.

187
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,240
Smash?

188
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
What does that mean?

189
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,840
It means getting laid.

190
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,680
Sorry?

191
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,120
Hooking up, you know.

192
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,160
I'll show you.

193
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,720
This.

194
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,920
And this.

195
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,760
I get it now.

196
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,040
I slept with him,
and now I'm sitting here crying.

197
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,480
A guy that cruel...

198
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
deserves to have his thing cut off!

199
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:12,346
I'll cut it off, snip, snip, snip.

200
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,560
Alright.

201
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
Bottoms up!

202
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,240
Come on.

203
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,200
Here's to my crappy boyfriend!

204
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,760
Cheers!

205
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,640
Drink up.

206
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,140
Should I?

207
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,000
Finish it off.

208
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,280
Finish it!

209
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,640
If you're hanging out with us,

210
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,520
you need to handle your liquor.

211
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,480
Drink!

212
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,800
That's enough, Nene.

213
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,920
She's just started.

214
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,800
Don't rush her.

215
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,560
Are you good, Jane?

216
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,640
If it's bitter,

217
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,080
mix it with some soda.

218
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,880
Come on.

219
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,080
It'll go down easier.

220
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,200
Bottoms up!

221
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,840
Bottoms up!

222
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,800
Come on.

223
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,480
- Yay!
- Cheers!

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Keep going.

225
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,520
Come on!

226
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,360
Calm yourself down!

227
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,640
So, how exactly did you go that far?

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,760
I have no idea.

229
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,760
The last thing I remember is
I was drinking with my peer mentors.

230
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,840
What really surprised me...

231
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,444
is that outfit you wore to the pub.

232
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,000
It's so freaking white.

233
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,800
Like you were going to
some kind of meditation.

234
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,240
Cake!

235
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,800
Aw, I'm sorry.

236
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,680
It's your fault for cracking me up.

237
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,920
I have to apologize to Dai.

238
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,040
Dai!

239
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,320
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,280
Hey, stop that.

241
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,560
Grown-ups don't cry.

242
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Come on.

243
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,640
Let's drink.

244
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,480
Cheers!

245
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,880
That's enough, Jane.

246
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,680
Okie. This...

247
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,680
is my last shot.

248
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,960
One more!

249
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,600
One more.

250
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
One more.

251
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
One more.

252
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
One more!

253
00:15:48,703 --> 00:15:49,703
One more.

254
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,160
You're talking in circles.

255
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,980
Will you ever finish the story?

256
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,920
That's all I can remember.

257
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,400
If you can't remember anything,

258
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,080
then how did you get back to your room?

259
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,900
Right.

260
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,120
How did I?

261
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,640
I don't remember that.

262
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,760
I'll just ask Meen.

263
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,400
She's probably still asleep.

264
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,880
I'll call her in the evening.

265
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,960
Do you think...

266
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,920
my mom's seen the video?

267
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,200
If you're worried about that,

268
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,780
let me handle it.

269
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,120
What are you doing?

270
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,040
Hi.

271
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,560
Hello?

272
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,720
Hello.

273
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,680
I'm a friend of the girl in the video.

274
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,640
Isn't she hot?

275
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,080
Whoa, look at that.

276
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,400
Hey.

277
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,840
Come here.

278
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Have you seen this?

279
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,440
- What?
- Look.

280
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,040
It's the campus queen.

281
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,420
Look at this.

282
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,800
Here.

283
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,000
The girl we can see clearly
is an architecture sophomore.

284
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,240
She's so hot.

285
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,520
I know her.

286
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,400
Isn't she hot?

287
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,880
But the other girl...

288
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm not sure
if she's studying at Wonder University.

289
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,120
- Hey, Champ.
- What?

290
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,360
Do you know her?

291
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,600
Do you?

292
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,800
Oh...

293
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,480
Hey, is your head okay?

294
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,240
It's okay. I'm fine.

295
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,400
Sorry.

296
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,880
Why does it matter?

297
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,080
Come on.

298
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,600
She's pretty, man.

299
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,240
She has nothing to do with us.

300
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,040
But she's pretty.

301
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,200
Look at your buddy.

302
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,880
Hey!

303
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,200
Why would you ask him?

304
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,280
You know he hates
poking into people's stuff.

305
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,840
Am I really wrong for being curious?

306
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,480
Am I?

307
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,640
Look at him.

308
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,800
He's keeping things from me.

309
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,400
She's pretty hot, though.

310
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,160
Gosh, it's hot.

311
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,280
It is.

312
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,480
My eyes hurt.

313
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,640
- Cover?
- Let's go.

314
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,800
Get in the shade.

315
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,520
We'll drop you here.

316
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah, right.

317
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,960
I'm leaving.

318
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,640
Will he really delete the video?

319
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,400
He definitely will.

320
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,200
He even said he was sorry.

321
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,480
He only posted it
'cause he thought it was cute.

322
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,520
Can we really trust him?

323
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,840
I know his number,

324
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,000
his social media, and even his address.

325
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,040
And I know
he's studying at a university nearby.

326
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,920
If he doesn't delete it,
I'll go to his home.

327
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,840
You're the best, huh?

328
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,120
- Well...
- You love your friend...

329
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,720
more than anyone, huh?

330
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,240
- Of course.
- But are you sure

331
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,680
you're doing this

332
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,280
for your friend

333
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,800
and not...

334
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
yourself?

335
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,000
Hey, come on.

336
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,720
I do love my friend, Waii,

337
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,200
but when it comes to guys...
It happens,

338
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,160
you know.

339
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,480
Gosh, it's hot.

340
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,520
Don't worry, okay?

341
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,760
It's gonna be okay.

342
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,420
If you want anything,

343
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
text me.

344
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,880
Right.

345
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,200
We're leaving now.

346
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,720
Have some rest, alright?

347
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,800
- Bye-bye.
- Can you be on your own?

348
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah, I can.

349
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,720
Alright, bye.

350
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,880
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

351
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,080
Let's go.

352
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Darin, check this out.

353
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,760
Too blurry.

354
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,440
That's what you get for sneaky filming.

355
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,240
Wait, so it's true?

356
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,160
It is, and that's me,

357
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,480
not my double.

358
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,640
Why?

359
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,240
Fine. If you're good,
then it's nothing.

360
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,840
That's it, then.

361
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,940
Gosh,

362
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,560
why does it have to turn out this way?

363
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,560
I'm going crazy.

364
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,840
Oh, it's Dai.

365
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,240
What are you sorry for this time?

366
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,360
Why is she acting
like she doesn't remember?

367
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,440
Is she testing me,

368
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,160
or is she so mad
that she's being sarcastic?

369
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,460
I'm really sorry.

370
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,560
I didn't mean it.

371
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,720
[I'm really sorry]

372
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,280
[I didn't mean it]

373
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,800
I have no idea what's going on.

374
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,680
[I have no idea what's going on]

375
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,160
By the way,

376
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,520
do you happen to like donuts?

377
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,400
What? Why is she talking
about something else now?

378
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,840
If it's edible,

379
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,680
it's my favorite.

380
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,900
Come help me finish these donuts.

381
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,640
I bought them
on a buy-one-get-one deal,

382
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,160
but if I eat them all,
I'll definitely gain weight.

383
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,360
Are you worried
about gaining weight, too?

384
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,320
Give me some time to dress up.

385
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,340
I'm actually about to go home.

386
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,480
Have a seat, Jane.

387
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,720
Thank you.

388
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,920
Well...

389
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,600
I...

390
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,600
You can talk to me
like you did last night.

391
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,880
It was cute.

392
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,520
I'm sorry I crossed the line, Gai!

393
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,080
It's Dai,

394
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
not Gai.

395
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,360
I'm sorry, Gai!

396
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,680
I'm Dai.

397
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Calm down, okay?

398
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,880
I'm sorry...

399
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
Dai.

400
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,640
I must have upset you.

401
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,840
Really? Have you?

402
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,560
I have!

403
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
You haven't.

404
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,640
Yes, I have.

405
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
No, you haven't.

406
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
I have.

407
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,680
I kissed you when I was drunk.

408
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,240
That's not what happened.

409
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,240
You were drunk,
told me I had beautiful eyes,

410
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,480
and then leaned in close.

411
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
That's all.

412
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,640
What did you just say?

413
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,240
What made you think
you crossed the line?

414
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,160
Is it the video?

415
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,080
Isn't that the Queen of FA?

416
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,560
Looks like she's really drunk.

417
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,520
I think you're right.

418
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
I'll go check on her.

419
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,720
You have beautiful eyes,

420
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,920
gorgeous...

421
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,920
I wish I had eyes as beautiful as yours.

422
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,280
Hey, you can't film them.
That's rude.

423
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,720
Why can't I?

424
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,320
It's kinda cute. Look.

425
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,320
JaneWill!

426
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,840
- We're sorry.
- We're really sorry.

427
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,400
- Jane... Hey!
- It's okay. I don't mind.

428
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,840
- We're really sorry.
- It's okay.

429
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,720
Let's go.

430
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,480
- Jane...
- We're really sorry.

431
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,280
Are you okay?

432
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,480
Oh, gosh.

433
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,240
You didn't cross any lines, Jane.

434
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,920
You were drunk

435
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,240
and told me,

436
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,920
"You have beautiful eyes, gorgeous.

437
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,600
I wish I had eyes
as beautiful as yours."

438
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,000
You didn't do anything at all,

439
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,960
and you nearly puked on me.

440
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,960
Please excuse me.

441
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,760
I gotta go to a somtam place.

442
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,240
I'm craving somtam.

443
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,920
Aren't you going home anymore?

444
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,680
I'll go home first and then head there!

445
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,840
You're so cute, Jane.

446
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,120
Hey!

447
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,480
How come she's this wasted?

448
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,720
Come on.

449
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,000
Hurry!

450
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,160
Will they be okay?

451
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,480
Jane!

452
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,960
Hey, is your friend okay?

453
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,920
She's just drunk. Nothing serious.

454
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,280
Anything I can do to help?

455
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,600
We're good, sir.

456
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
It's her first time drinking, you know.

457
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,360
That's right.

458
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,640
At 19,

459
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,520
it's impressive
how much she could drink.

460
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,690
When I had my first drink at 19,

461
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,960
I couldn't even walk straight home.

462
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,440
Okay...

463
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,520
Oh, that's our ride.

464
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,040
Nene, I'll take Jane to her dorm

465
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
and leave after that.

466
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,880
- Okay.
- Sounds good?

467
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,560
Come on.

468
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,200
Get in, Jane.

469
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,530
- Make sure she gets to her room.
- Help!

470
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,960
How old is that girl?

471
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,080
She's 19, sir.

472
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,200
I think you need to talk to the owner.

473
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,680
This way.

474
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,960
Okay.

475
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,840
Please.

476
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,680
- The owner?
- Yes. This way.

477
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,600
Alright.

478
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,360
You puked on her?

479
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,600
Yeah.

480
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,920
- Come on.
- You're amazing, sis.

481
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,800
- Look,
- I can't.

482
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,040
what's so funny about it?

483
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,480
It's embarrassing.

484
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,960
Well, it is funny.

485
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,640
Wow, your first drink
was memorable, huh?

486
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,920
Look,

487
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,400
as your brother, let me tell you this.

488
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,000
Next time you drink,
don't mix soda with alcohol.

489
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,720
It goes down easy,

490
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,720
but it also hits you quickly.

491
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,960
What are you guys talking about?

492
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,040
You're being loud.

493
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,280
There's something funny, Mom.

494
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,720
Something funny?

495
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,280
What is it? Tell me about it.

496
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,880
It's not funny, Mom.

497
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,240
Let's go.

498
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,920
- What?
- Let's cook me some food.

499
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,400
- What's with you?
- I'm sick of them.

500
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,440
You had something just now.

501
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,880
I want an omelet.

502
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,560
Don't cook for them.

503
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Honey!

504
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,840
We're about to have lunch,

505
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,640
and you're having a donut?

506
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,600
Oh, come on.

507
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Put it down.

508
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,600
Well...

509
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,960
I mean,

510
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,120
I've been craving this.

511
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,830
I've told you several times
to get me some,

512
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,430
but you never did!

513
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,920
Your blood sugar's gonna go up.

514
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,360
Didn't the doctor tell you
to cut down on sugar?

515
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,960
Just a little won't hurt, Mom.

516
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,600
Right, Dad?

517
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,960
Just a little.

518
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,840
Whoa!

519
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,240
You're enjoying it, huh?

520
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,880
This is my favorite.

521
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,080
That's a big bite.

522
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Look at you.

523
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,720
Here, sweetie.

524
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,800
This is 200 baht.

525
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,720
It's for the donuts.

526
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,600
Thanks, Dad.

527
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,400
So you won't run out of money for meals.

528
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,880
All the dishes have been served.

529
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,880
You can dig in now.

530
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,560
Jimmy, Junior, go ahead.

531
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,410
Mhm, sure.

532
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,960
Alright, let's eat, guys.

533
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,160
Can I have one, Dad?

534
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,440
Sure, take it.

535
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,760
- Have some.
- It looks amazing.

536
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,840
Make sure you leave some
for your sisters, too.

537
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,170
- Alright?
- Got it.

538
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,870
Thanks.

539
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,640
I don't want any food now, honey.

540
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,280
- Gosh.
- This is good.

541
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,160
It sure is.

542
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,160
Thanks.

543
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
Right, Junior,

544
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,360
when will you finally have time
to translate my book?

545
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,840
Well,

546
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,520
I need two more weeks
to finish my current project.

547
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,840
And the company's sending me
a documentary script next,

548
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
so it'll take a while.

549
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,480
Whoa! Oh, come on!

550
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,040
Mine is just five pages.

551
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,240
And I'm not making you do it for free.

552
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,200
I'm paying you
the same rate everyone else does.

553
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,600
I know,

554
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,040
but you gotta wait until it's your turn.

555
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,640
Fine, then. Alright.

556
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,840
What about you, Jimmy?

557
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,440
How's your job going, son?

558
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,120
It's just okay.

559
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,800
A white-collar job, you know.
Clock in at 8,

560
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,960
clock out at 4.

561
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,640
No bonuses at all.

At least there's OT.

00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,080
I'm actually kinda tired of it now.

564
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,960
I'll probably get a new job next year.

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,720
What?

566
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,960
What exactly is this new job?

567
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,840
If you don't have one yet, don't quit.

568
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,700
I heard it's hard
to find a job these days.

00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,040
Yeah.

00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,880

Jobs are hard to find now.

572
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,640

00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,700
unless you've got
a new job waiting, alright?

574

If you end up unemployed
with no income,

575

almost a hundred employees last month.

I'm not actually quitting.

580

Guess I'll put up with it for now.

581
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,360

for money again.

I'll keep it for Jimmy,
for when he's unemployed.

00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,000

I've got one in the afternoon,

gave us an assignment,

610

I don't want to go,

about being the Queen of FA anyway.

00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,640
Yuphin,

746
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,920
- Yes?
- get the jar.

747
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,040
Now let Darin draw some names.

748
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,640
Baiplu and Namwan!

749
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,000
Baiplu and Namwan
are staying together.

750
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,600
Aoeng-aoey and...

751
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,560
Pearmai!

752
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,920
Aoeng-aoey and Pearmai
are staying together.

753
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
JaneWill!

754
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,920
And Dear!

755
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,280
Wow! I'm glad
you're my roommate, JaneWill.

756
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,920
JaneWill and Dear
are staying together.

757
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,080
That's right.

758
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,040
Now that you know your roommate,

759
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,560
I'll show you the room.

760
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,240
- Come on. Get up.
- Alright.

761
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,080
Next, I'll draw the kings' names.

762
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,400
Alright.

763
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,040
Okay. Here we go.

764
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,080
First, Khunphaen and Ice.

765
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,080
Oh, damn.

766
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,440
I ain't got my charger on me.

767
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,000
You mind if I hold yours
for a lil' minute?

768
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,000
Sorry?

769
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,560
Hold what for a lil' minute?

770
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,040
I mean,

771
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,960
I forgot my charger.

772
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,560
Can I borrow yours for a bit?

773
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,840
Wait, no. For some time.

774
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,200
Oh...

775
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,520
You mean this charger,

776
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,360
right?

777
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,400
Thanks.

778
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,280
It's actually nice that
I get to share a room with her.

779
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,680
Gives me the perfect chance
to ask about Dai.

780
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,640
What?

781
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Nothing.

782
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,820
Hey, Dear.

783
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,400
Do you ever talk to Dai?

784
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,720
Pretty often, like a few times a week.

785
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,120
A few times...

786
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,920
I see.

787
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,000
Has she ever told you
whether she hates anyone right now?

788
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,560
Well...

789
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,320
I don't know nothin' 'bout that.

790
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,880
I ain't feelin' it, so...

791
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,720
What did she mean
she didn't know nothin'?

792
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,240
And she ain't feelin' it?

793
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,240
What did she mean?

794
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,920
It must be some sort of secret.

795
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,080
What?
Why you lookin' at me like that?

796
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,520
I was waiting for you to finish.

797
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,800
No, that's it.

798
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,000
I'm done talkin'.

799
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,400
You're done?

800
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,360
Yeah.

801
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,040
That's not true.

802
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:36,030
She ended her sentence with "so..."

803
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,080
I'm sure
she almost let something slip for sure,

804
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,000
but someone must've told her
to keep quiet.

805
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,040
I knew Dai was sneaky.

806
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,880
She's the ultimate villain.

807
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,400
I made you egg fried rice.
It's on the table.

808
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,520
Egg fried rice again?

809
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,400
There's also a stuffed omelet.

810
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,720
So, what are you making?

811
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,640
Fried boiled eggs with tamarind sauce.

812
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,360
Why is everything eggs, Mom?

813
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,400
Do you have anything else?

814
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,600
We're gonna end up malnourished.

815
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,040
There's clear soup with tofu.

816
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,000
I added some eggs, though,

817
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,040
to make it taste better.

818
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,680
Today's a holy day,

819
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,000
so I want us to skip meat.

820
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,400
It's a way to make merit

821
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,600
and keep animals from being killed.

822
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,480
- Sadhu.
- Sadhu.

823
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,600
I'm off to work.

824
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,720
Eat before you go, sweetie.

825
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,560
I've made plenty of yummy dishes.

826
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,040
They're all eggs.

827
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:47,710
I must go now, or I'll be late.

828
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,320
You guys can have it all,
Jimmy and Junior.

829
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,280
Don't save any for me.

830
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:51,980
Bye.

831
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,280
I wonder
how Jane's doing at the beach.

832
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,200
You should call her, then.

833
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,640
Junior, give her a call.

834
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,400
Okay.

835
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,600
Hi Mom.

836
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,960
How are you doing? Is the room okay?

837
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,620
Who's your roommate?

838
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,120
The room's great, Mom.

839
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,720
My roommate is Dear,

840
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,440
the Queen of Architecture
I told you about.

841
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,960
Is your room close to the beach?

842
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,520
Yes, Mom. It's right by the beach.

843
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,480
JaneWill!

844
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,280
I've gotta go, Mom.

845
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,370
- JaneWill!
- They need me.

846
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,560
What is it?

847
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,600
- Let's go.
- Come on.

848
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,450
Hey,

849
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,320
did you already get a job?

850
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,800
Why are you dressed
like a flight attendant?

851
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,240
Are you working for an airline?

852
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,160
I am.

853
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,000
No way.

854
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,080
Airlines only hire women.

855
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,240
They'd never hire you.

856
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,240
Look,

857
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,120
where I work

858
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,880
has nothing to do with you.

859
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,000
- Jane...
- Mom!

860
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,960
So you're calling me nosy?!

861
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,040
You're a pervert,
and now you're talking back?

862
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,120
You should go to work, sweetie.

863
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,600
Goodbye.

864
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,520
How did you raise your kid

865
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,040
to be so disrespectful?!

866
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,680
Probably the way
your mom raised you.

867
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,520
And just so you know,

868
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,240
if you don't leave my daughter alone,

869
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,360
I'll sue you for defamation.

870
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,680
Section 393 states what, Jimmy?

871
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,960
Whoever insults or verbally humiliates
another person,

872
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,520
causing shame or hatred,

873
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,200
shall be imprisoned
for no more than one month

874
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,640
or fined for no more than
ten thousand baht,

875
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,360
or both, ma'am.

876
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,520
If you wish to speak, do so.

877
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,080
Junior, record a video.

878
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:16,760
Okay.

879
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,840
Easy, Mom.

880
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,720
Let's go inside.

00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,740
You don't like my guts either, do you?

884
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,000
I heard she has a love rival right now.

885
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,840
Milk helps with spice, you know.

00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,000
The thing you're curious about,

887
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,960
why don't you just ask Dai yourself?
