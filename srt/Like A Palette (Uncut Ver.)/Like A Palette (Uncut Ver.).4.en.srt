4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,200
Love is all about destiny.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,600
Back in the day,
whenever I heard that,

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,080
I felt like laughing,

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,320
but after I experienced it firsthand,

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,160
I realized how real it is.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,680
When two people meet,
it's never a coincidence.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,560
Is that the girl?

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
What's the matter with her?

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,280
She's making a face.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,480
Maybe she's hangry?

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
I don't know.

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,800
You like her, don't you?

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,560
Go say hi.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,200
If I do now,

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,800
she's gonna bite my head off.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,600
Touché.

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,880
That's some deadly aura.

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,640
You like them ferocious?

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,080
She's usually nice, though.

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,160
- Girl!
- No one said anything!

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,680
Darin, you can't just bail
on me like that.

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,400
- That's right.
- You always bail on me.

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
Didn't she say she would pay?

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,440
- Yep, she did.
- Right?

28
00:01:41,286 --> 00:01:42,206
- Right?
- Yeah?

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,640
I'll give you ten baht.

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,280
Yeah.

31
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,880
- What are you looking at?
- Yeah, what?

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,000
- Nothing.
- Tell me.

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,840
You're looking at her again,
aren't you?

34
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,320
It's nothing.

35
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,640
- You always do that, girl.
- Ooh!

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,059
- What were you looking at?
- Always.

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,880
- Ooh, who are you looking at?
- What was that?

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,160
- Who are you looking at?
- Aha, I saw that!

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,440
- We're late, but who?
- Hey!

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
I'm not looking at anyone!

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,440
What's wrong with you guys?

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,800
Aha!

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,360
All this looking,

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,680
so when's the action?

45
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,680
You want her number?

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,600
- Lemme ask her for it!
- Whoa, no!

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,720
She's blushing.

48
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,400
You're deadass blushing!

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,640
- You are!
- No, I'm not!

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,400
No?

51
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,720
She's so into her!

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,920
- Ooh!
- Cut it!

53
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,160
- Keep walking!
- Hurry up, we're late.

54
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,120
Why are you looking at me, then?

55
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,960
Because I like you,

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
beautiful.

57
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
Am I being punked?

58
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,320
Where is it?

59
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,969
Junior.

60
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,876
Yes?

61
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,040
Help.

62
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,437
Who messed with you?

63
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
Tell me everything.

64
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,880
They're not gonna live another day.

65
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,200
That girl from Architecture,

66
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,440
the one I gossiped about within earshot,

67
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,200
remember?

68
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
I do.

69
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,040
Did she hurt you?

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,400
I'm calling the cops.

71
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,320
Don't you worry.
We're taking her to court.

72
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,720
This will be on Judge Judy, I swear.

73
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,600
She didn't.

74
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,040
It wasn't like that.

75
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,080
So what did she do to you?

76
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,520
She confessed that she likes me.

77
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,440
[Crashing out]

78
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,640
Junior, please help.

79
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,780
I don't know what to do with my life!

80
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,080
Jane, you scared me there.

81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,640
I could really pinch you!

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,600
Do you like girls?

83
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,520
If not, just say no to her.

84
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,200
Why wouldn't I like girls?

85
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,240
Mom and Juss are both girls.

86
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,587
No! Jane, not like that.

87
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,600
I mean, like lovers do.

88
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,920
Lovers!

89
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,040
If you don't like her
like that, just say no.

90
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,120
I don't know.

91
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't want to accept
or deny her feelings.

92
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,040
Sh*t, this is gonna be hard, then.

93
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,720
How about this? Just don't rush things.

94
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,120
I think you should be your normal self.

95
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,120
Meanwhile,
think of what you wanna do,

96
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,640
if you're okay with someone
being into you,

97
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,120
or if you're okay with her.

98
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,960
Hm, if you come to realize
that she's not the one,

99
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,000
you can end things with her then.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You really think that?

101
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,720
Mm, I do.

102
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,080
Okay, I believe you.

103
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,400
Oh, you're home?

104
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,960
So what's the tea, Jane?

105
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,120
Someone said they saw you and Dai
at the soccer field.

106
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,720
What were you two doing there?
Checking out some boys?

107
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
Or were you talking things out
about that guy who approached you?

108
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,160
Right, we talked things out.

109
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,960
Argh!!

110
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,040
What's wrong?

111
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm totally amped!

112
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,080
It's like watching a TV drama
that's a little too real.

113
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
Were there any fighting scenes?

114
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,640
Fighting? There was none of that.

115
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,120
Just Dai telling me she's into me.

116
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,360
Emergency group call!

117
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,320
Hey, what's up?

118
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,680
Give me the rundown.
Why am I missing this?

119
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,320
Yeah, it's the twist of the century,

120
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,960
even more extreme than soap operas.

121
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,920
Guys, take a breather.

122
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,880
I'm still as shocked as you are.

123
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,840
Are you sure you heard it right?

124
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,960
Tell me everything
in chronological order.

125
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,800
There's no shot I got it wrong.

126
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,080
Our faces were only inches apart.

127
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,540
Shut up!

128
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,200
You might as well have bumped heads
if you were that close.

129
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,440
And why do you have to be that close?

130
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,440
Well, she leaned in.

131
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,240
So...

132
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,280
- Did anything NSFW happen?
- Did anything NSFW happen?

133
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,280
It's not that extreme!

134
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,640
Where are you guys?

135
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,600
Are you still here?

136
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
Yep, just too stunned to speak.

137
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,800
Right, Dai is a lesbian.

138
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,240
Huh?!

139
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,800
And how did you know that?

140
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,960
Look at her Insta's bio.

141
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,120
The status says, "I am a lesbian."

142
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,800
It's obvi she's into girls.

143
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,488
Huh?!

144
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
What?

145
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,120
D*mn right!

146
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,800
Dai's a lesbian!

147
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,720
Jane!

148
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
How come you stalked her profile
and still missed that?

149
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,640
Otherwise, you would've known
a long time ago that she likes you.

150
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,280
I'm gonna crash out!

151
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,440
Right, speaking of which,

152
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,040
there are so many queens in the sea,

153
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,400
but why did you hit the jackpot?

154
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,440
Maybe Dai's into unhinged girls.

155
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,160
Cake!

156
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,520
Sike!

157
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,040
You're cute and charming, JaneWill.

158
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,920
Grandma,

159
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,280
it's late, so let's get inside.

160
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,720
Come on, easy.

161
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,400
You're pretty strong!

162
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,620
I'll take her inside.

163
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,880
Alright.

164
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,240
Still as good as ever?

165
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,080
Mm!

166
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,040
Knew it!

167
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,180
What are you laughing at?

168
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,160
At Jane.

169
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,040
Maybe she's a little
too invested in TV dramas,

170
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,400
so much so that she's imagining things.

171
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,360
Though I'd die to see that part
where you said that to her.

172
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,840
What face did she make?

173
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,840
A shocked one, of course.

174
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,560
What else?

175
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,720
She turned around and ran for her life.

176
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,480
- Hm...
- Oh...

177
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,680
- She's just a girl.
- Mm.

178
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,360
Having the gorgeous campus queen
confess to you,

179
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,960
- who wouldn't run off?
- Facts.

180
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,387
But I'm not even sure

181
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,520
if she can handle it.

182
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,305
Or maybe she's taken?

183
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,440
Come on.

184
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,400
At least, you were honest,

185
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,960
so just make it obvious.

186
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,040
Right, don't forget
that you have a rival, though.

187
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,120
That senior guy, I mean.

188
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,240
You're right.

189
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,360
It's gonna be fine.

190
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,280
You have our full support.

191
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,600
Mm!

192
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,760
- Hands in!
- Let's go!

193
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Dai! Dai!

194
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,560
Dai! Dai!

195
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,712
Do you have a question?

196
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,520
No!

197
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm just curious.

198
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,960
Why is Dai
who's never easily attracted to anyone

199
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,720
suddenly into that FA girl?

200
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
I don't know.

201
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,000
She just feels right when I look at her.

202
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,480
You just fell in love, huh?

203
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,120
Mm.

204
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,440
Are you still hanging out?

205
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,280
I'm closing the shop soon.

206
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,120
Whoa, Dad!

207
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
We're still chatting!

208
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,520
You can still chat tomorrow.

209
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,306
- We'll go after we finish this bowl.
- Alright.

210
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,060
Just a minute, Dad.

211
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,840
Come on, we're here for you.

212
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,080
- Mm.
- Go for it.

213
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,400
What?

214
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,920
Why are you still here?

215
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,080
My dad's closing up.

216
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,080
We need to finish the food!

217
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,640
I'm snitching to his dad.

218
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,000
What noodle dish is this?

219
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,040
Where's my soup?

220
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,880
- Well, you asked for the dry one.
- Oh, I did.

221
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,200
Did I miss something yesterday?

222
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,360
Well, where in hell
were you hiding, Waii?

223
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,440
In bed.

224
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,560
I'm getting goosebumps
from my intuition.

225
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,000
I literally called it.

226
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,600
What do you mean?

227
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:37,713
You already knew Dai is a lesbian?

228
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,880
Well, I had a feeling that was the case.

229
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,360
Why didn't you fill me in, then?

230
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,760
You literally left me in my delulu.

231
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,480
I've made a clown out of myself
multiple times already.

232
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,280
Uh, right,

233
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,920
it's almost 2 P.M., so I'm heading out.

234
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,320
Where are you going?

235
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,240
We're in the middle of a gossip sesh.

236
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,320
A practice
with Professor Erika at 3 P.M.

237
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,760
It's almost the contest day.

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,760
What's the rush?

239
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,440
It's only 1:50 P.M.

240
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,120
It's not even a five-minute walk
from here to the activity center,

241
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,120
so what's the hurry?

242
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,360
She's right.

243
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,840
There's a full hour left,

244
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,920
so where's the fire?

245
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,480
To be there ahead of time,

246
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,320
so other people don't have to wait.

247
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,520
Stop!

248
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,200
Hands off.

249
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,720
I'm off.

250
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
What's the matter with her?

251
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,880
Hm...

252
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,360
Has she been acting strange lately?

253
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,320
Hm...

254
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,120
No, that's normal.

255
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,040
I bet she's rushing off to see Dai.

256
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,440
Yes, that's for sure!

257
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,440
You're so freaking smart, Waii.

258
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,840
Why couldn't I think of that?

259
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,960
- Wanna know why?
- Mm.

260
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,840
Because you're a dumb-dumb, Cake!

261
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,360
Waii, you b*tch!

262
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,200
- Hm?
- What?

263
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,640
Do you want some of this?

264
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,160
Nope, not playing along with ya.

265
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,440
Hello, dear.

266
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,600
This handsome young man
is from the Faculty of Science, Guichai.

267
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,120
- Oh!
- Mm.

268
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
- He looks perfectly decent.
- Right.

269
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,200
A little workout
could get you in the right shape.

270
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,720
Listen to Guichai, young man.

271
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,400
That's right. I guarantee you
it's gonna go off without a hitch.

272
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,460
We want him
to look his best, right?

273
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,080
- Oh!
- Mm.

274
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,520
Little Queen of FA?

275
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,080
Come over here, would you?

276
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Yes.

277
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,240
- Hello, Professor.
- Hi, there.

278
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,560
- Hello.
- Hi.

279
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,880
Here's the thing.

280
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,160
Your score is not as good
as it should be,

281
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,120
but I do believe that
you still have a chance

282
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,280
if you can outshine everyone
in the show with your talent.

283
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,240
Can you do that, dear?

284
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Hm, then...

285
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,680
Could I do a drawing show?

286
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,800
Goodness!

287
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,480
That talent you said
can be done by just anyone.

288
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,480
It's not for the stage!

289
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,480
- Ugh!
- Uh...

290
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,760
How about this?

291
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,360
Yuphin, your job is to come up with
a show for her talent segment.

292
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,960
Make it really flamboyant.

293
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,050
- Let's give them goosebumps, shall we?
- Yes!

294
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,160
- Of course!
- Mm.

295
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,880
Breathe fire, Jane!

296
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,240
I guarantee
the judges have never seen it before.

297
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,040
Are you nuts, Yuphin?!

298
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,000
This is the campus
king and queen competition,

299
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,440
not Lunar New Year!

300
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,760
Who would be responsible
if the auditorium caught fire?

301
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,880
- Ugh!
- Sorry, Professor.

302
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,840
I'll come up with a new idea!

303
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,600
Go, you two peers.

304
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,160
Go over there and come up

305
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
with the talent portion.

306
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,560
- Sorry about that, Guichai.
- Jane!

307
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,480
Are they gonna be okay?

308
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,920
Jane, who are you looking for?

309
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,520
Sit down.

310
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,480
Sit right here.

311
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,560
Who are you looking for?

312
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,640
But what's wrong
with fire-breathing, Jane?

313
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,280
She hasn't even made a new post.

314
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,550
Where is she?

315
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,880
If you wanna know, hit her up.

316
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Is that a good idea?

317
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,520
It's gonna be fine.

318
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,280
Just a simple text

319
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,360
wouldn't tip her off
that you want to see her!

320
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,880
Are you crazy? I don't want to see her!

321
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,080
Don't lie to yourself.

322
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,720
If that's not the case,
then why are you missing her now?

323
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,240
That's insane!

324
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,640
I'm not missing her!

325
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,440
Because I like you,

326
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,640
beautiful.

327
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,400
Stop saying that!

328
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,640
Gosh, what's happening to me?

329
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,000
Why am I sitting here
talking to myself?!

330
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,970
Done with the project, Darin?

331
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,000
Just a bit left. Why?

332
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,000
There's a problem
with my model's structure.

333
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,560
It's leaning.

334
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,200
Could you come and fix it?

335
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,200
Whoa, no way.
It's a time crunch for me as it is.

336
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,520
I don't have time to help anyone.

337
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,470
Please, Darin, my bestie?

338
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,640
If it's difficult for you to come to me,

339
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,960
can I take my model to your place?

340
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Pretty please?

341
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,880
Be here in two hours with Kaning.

342
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,040
You're two peas in a pod.

343
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,640
Huh?!

344
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,170
Kaning is coming to you, too?

345
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,960
Yeah.

346
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,920
I'm going. See you in a bit.

347
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,200
Who are you looking for?

348
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
I'm right here.

349
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,800
What are you thinking, JaneWill?

350
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,760
You seem weirdly flustered.

351
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
Nothing!

352
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,440
Where did Dai go?

353
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,600
Should I check for her
at her faculty building?

354
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,120
But if she doesn't have classes,
I probably won't see her.

355
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,960
Or should I wait for her
at the coffee shop?

356
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,920
Wait, but she said that day

357
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,560
she was waiting for
her friend's training.

358
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,720
Maybe she's there every evening?

359
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Right, Cake!

360
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,600
Do you happen to have a friend
who's at the soccer field now?

361
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,120
Why?

362
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,440
Are you gonna spy on Dai

363
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,680
in case she's waiting
on her friend like the other day?

364
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,960
How does she know that?

365
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,920
She's as smart as a whip,

366
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,640
catching on to my every word
without me having to explain.

367
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,600
Silence is the loudest answer, isn't it?

368
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,280
I hate to break it to you,

369
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,280
but I don't have any friends
who'd be hanging around that place.

370
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,330
But I do.

371
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,880
Who would
a sleepyhead like you even know?

372
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,360
Well, just a senior.

373
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,480
It's settled, then.

374
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,240
Let's go see Waii's senior!

375
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,400
- Come on, let's move!
- Uh...

376
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,800
- Are we going?
- Duh, hurry up.

377
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,320
Let's go.

378
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,880
- Get a move on. Now.
- Hold up!

379
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,600
Will this senior of yours
really be at the field?

380
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,520
I guess so.

381
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,360
This is where she normally trains.

382
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,280
Shake a leg!

383
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,520
- I think she's around here.
- Come on!

384
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,600
She's right there.

385
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,920
Where?

386
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,000
- Well...
- So?

387
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,880
Is that friend of yours here?

388
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,160
There she is.

389
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,840
Oh...

390
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,520
Waii, are you here
to see me train for running?

391
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,240
I am.

392
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,560
That's Orn from Sports Science.

393
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,080
Do you know her?

394
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,840
Who wouldn't?

395
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,720
Orn is a nightlife enthusiast
who loves clubbing.

396
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,200
And she's one hell of a player.

397
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,680
Better yet,
she swings both ways.

398
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,800
Wow!

399
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,400
You're really specialized
in other people's business.

400
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,880
Well, I love sticking my nose in!

401
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,840
Do you want to hang out tonight?

402
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Hm...

403
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
I'd rather not.

404
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,360
Then, why did you come to see me?

405
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,200
I just wanted to see you
train for running,

406
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,000
not asking to hang out.

407
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,010
I don't get it.

408
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,640
Get back to training, Orn.

409
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,000
Don't pay attention to me.

410
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,680
I'll be hanging around here.

411
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Come on, girls.

412
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Let's find somewhere to sit.

413
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:51,283
Come on.

414
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
It's so hot.

415
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,520
- Waii!
- What?

416
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,400
You're low-key a sl*t, aren't you?

417
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,440
What do you mean by "low-key a sloth"?

418
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,680
A sloth that keeps to itself?

419
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,720
B*tch!

420
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,440
- Why are you laughing?
- Don't play dumb.

421
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,160
What do you mean?

422
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,440
And you, what are you laughing at?

423
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,760
What? It's funny!

424
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,920
- What?!
- "A sloth that keeps to itself."

425
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
How is that funny?

426
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,600
Are you hungry?

427
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,400
Dai...

428
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,680
Is the weather cold?

429
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,000
Hey, JaneWill!

430
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,280
What's wrong with you?

431
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,440
What's happening?

432
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,680
Girl, what's your problem?

433
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,920
I'm fine!

434
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,600
Clearly, you're not!

435
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,920
Clearly.

436
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,520
I'm totally fine!

437
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,960
I see...

438
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,480
The reason you took us here

439
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,440
is that you want to spy on Dai, right?

440
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
I'm not spying on anyone!

441
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,280
Of course, whatever you say.

442
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,320
How is that not spying?

443
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm really not, though!

444
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,640
Okay.

445
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,280
- You're not, huh?
- Alright, we believe you.

446
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,490
[Waii, Jane(Will), Cake]

447
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
What's the deal with you
and my name tag?

448
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,800
Totally not spying.

449
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
What was that for?

450
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,480
What's wrong with you guys?

451
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,800
Why are you so quiet?

452
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,760
Cat got your tongue?

453
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,530
Huh?

454
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,560
So what's next, JaneWill?

455
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,200
Well, Dai hasn't said
anything more about that day.

456
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,160
If she doesn't,

457
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,840
- just ask her.
- Right.

458
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
No shot.

459
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,520
Since she was the one confessing,

460
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,560
she should be the one responsible.

461
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,880
I'm not the one who's into her,

462
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,160
so why do I have to go after her?

463
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,480
Yet you came
all the way here to spy on her?

464
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,760
Hm?

465
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,400
Ugh, if this is the way
you look at things,

466
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,720
you'll never get to talk
to her by the time you graduate.

467
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,640
I'm going home.
What a BS.

468
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,640
You're completely wasting my time!

469
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,190
Waii,

470
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,280
I still have some questions about Orn.

471
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,560
Tell us more about it
in the group chat tonight.

472
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,440
I can smell that secret you're hiding.

473
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,760
But now, I have to get home
and feed that big back cat

474
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,760
before she devours
my entire bed frame.

475
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,960
So, toodles!

476
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,640
Keep me posted.

477
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,400
I'm off.

478
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,120
What?!

479
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,560
Dai.

480
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,800
I like fermented fish.

481
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,960
D*mn it!

482
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,960
What was that about?

483
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Yes?

484
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,480
Do you mean marinated salmon?

485
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
That's not it.

486
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,080
I mean, the fish that's fermented
until it has a sour taste.

487
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,640
Right.

488
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,360
And you're not implying

489
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,720
that I should get you some
from the market?

490
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,520
No, I'm not.

491
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,120
I'm just... I'm like...

492
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,840
I don't know
how to start a conversation.

493
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,100
Then, that means
you wanna talk to me?

494
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,960
How does she know that?

495
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,400
Why is everyone around me so smart?

496
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,400
Does this mean
I'm too much of a dumba**?

497
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,680
Can we meet?

498
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,840
I want to treat you to some green tea.

499
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,960
We need to talk face-to-face.

500
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,680
At 10:30 P.M.?

501
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,160
I mean, tomorrow.

502
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,900
Right.

503
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,200
Like, at 5 A.M.

504
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,400
Are we meeting for green tea
or morning prayers?

505
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,880
Then, what time will you be free?

506
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,720
If you want to talk without a hitch,

507
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,760
we can meet at 7 P.M.

508
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,760
Darin, my bestie,
we have a huge problem!

509
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,320
Dai...my model is leaning again.

510
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,160
Gosh...

511
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,810
Why did she just suddenly disappear?!

512
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,790
Why isn't she reading my text?

513
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,360
Maybe she's busy.

514
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,520
Is she with her girlfriend?

515
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,040
There's no way she doesn't have one!

516
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
Maybe a side chick... Oops.

517
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,360
Did anyone hear that?

518
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,000
Ugh!

519
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,680
Why do I wanna know what she's doing?

520
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,640
It's the afternoon,
and she still hasn't shown up,

521
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,920
not even reading
or answering our texts.

522
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,640
Is Waii...

523
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,120
mad at us for prying about Orn?

524
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,800
She gets mad at us
because we were curious?

525
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,800
Or is it that...

526
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,720
she's hiding something from us?

527
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,360
Ugh, and why do we
have to be bothered by this?

528
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,800
Facts. Screw her
if she doesn't want to tell us.

529
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,400
It's her d*mn business, not ours,

530
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,200
right?

531
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,960
Fine, b*tch.

532
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,520
We don't wanna know anymore.

533
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,440
Get your a** to class tomorrow.

534
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,280
What's going on?

535
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,000
She's not reading it...

536
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,360
Maybe she's still asleep.

537
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,960
Did I take long?

538
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,440
Gosh, Waii!

539
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,640
What was that?

540
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,880
You scared me.

541
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,040
There, there, don't be mad at me.

542
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,280
I'll take you
to eat something good, alright?

543
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,360
With how generous the host is,

544
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
I'd better go for something pricey.

545
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,520
Just eat however much you want.

546
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,480
It's my treat today.

547
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,720
Anyway, have you picked
the movie you want to see?

548
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,400
Not yet.

549
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,560
I'm waiting for you.

550
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,880
How adorable.

551
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,560
Come on, let's go inside.

552
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,560
My bad.

553
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,760
So, what's the deal

554
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,840
with you and Dai?

555
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,520
Did you hit her up?

556
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,890
Well...

557
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,480
I did.

558
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,760
Spill!

559
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,440
Hm?

560
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,720
I said, "Spill!"

561
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,600
Well...

562
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,240
we're having a talk this evening.

563
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
Are you saying yes to her?

564
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,160
Are you crazy?
I'm not into her or anything.

565
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,680
Right...

566
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,720
So you're rejecting her?

567
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,640
Well, though I'm not into her,

568
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,150
I don't hate her, either.

569
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,000
If I turn her down,
she might think I hate her, right?

570
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,040
What? Jane,

571
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,000
are you tryna get on my nerves?

572
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,520
You want a piece of me?

573
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,280
Hm?

574
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Alright, I won't ask
any more questions.

575
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,120
You're no different from Waii.

576
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,440
For real, though,

577
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,360
you've gotta know it in your heart.

578
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,680
I don't know. I...

579
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,000
Nobody has ever flirted with me before.

580
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,860
And what was your heart telling you?

581
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,680
Was it like, "Lub-dub,"

582
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,120
when Dai confessed?

583
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,500
I don't know!

584
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,680
I only remember
myself being shocked!

585
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,320
Then, be shocked all you want.

586
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,800
I can't help you
if you're like this.

587
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
- What?
- Buh-bye.

588
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,720
[Elf]

589
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,040
Hello?

590
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,520
Hello, Little Jane.

591
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,080
Have you decided on the new story?

592
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,640
I...

593
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,280
I have a genre I want to write about.

594
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,080
Can I give you
a confirmation tomorrow?

595
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,920
You have?

596
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,080
What genre?

597
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,120
Can you give me a little spoiler?

598
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,760
I really can't.

599
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,720
I'll tell you about it all at once.

600
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,880
Come on.

601
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,400
This way, I can introduce it
at the meeting tomorrow.

602
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,720
Well, then...

603
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,240
I'll let you know tonight.

604
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,160
But...

605
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,880
Oh...

606
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,880
Hello?

607
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,640
Hello?!

608
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,760
She hung up on me just like that!

609
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,120
Ugh, kids these days!

610
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,280
Such a pain to do follow-ups on them.

611
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,880
They stop
whenever they feel like it.

612
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,120
Where's the sense of responsibility?!

613
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,120
What? You too?

614
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,040
Are you gonna stare all day?

615
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,840
What's the matter?!

616
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,920
There's a new creator
submitting a draft for consideration!

617
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,840
Is there?

618
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,960
How is it?

619
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,160
Gah! This is a ghost story!

620
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,600
Didn't I tell you

621
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,120
that our website
doesn't do ghost stories!

622
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,360
But this one is about a ghost couple,

623
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,080
a love story
between a ghost and a human!

624
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,800
I think it kinda goes
with our website's concept.

625
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,960
I don't like anything
related to ghosts or spirits,

626
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,800
capiche?!

627
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,960
I don't like it!

628
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,560
Are you scared of ghosts, Elf?

629
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,360
D*mn right, I am!

630
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,920
I'm getting goosebumps!

631
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,280
Don't ever take another one in!

632
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Get that away from me!

633
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,720
My skin's crawling!

634
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,320
One blended green tea, less sugar,
and no whipped cream, please.

635
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,120
Sure thing.

636
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,440
You came early?

637
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,800
So did you.

638
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,400
Here,

639
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,000
I bought this for you.

640
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,520
What is it?

641
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
Fermented fish!

642
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,840
I heard you like it.

643
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,640
So, what do we need to discuss

644
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,920
face-to-face?

645
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
What is it?

646
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,440
I will...

647
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,880
JaneWill, what?

648
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,120
I will ask you to continue
where you left off that day

649
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,600
next to the bleachers.

650
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,800
Hm...

651
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,440
What was it about?

652
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,960
You being invested in TV dramas?

653
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,640
It's not about that!

654
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,920
Oh,

655
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,080
about that senior guy named Champ?

656
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,400
Not that one!

657
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,560
Then, I don't know
what else we talked about.

658
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Who wouldn't remember
something that important?

659
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,640
Right, she's definitely
messing with me.

660
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,140
Dai, you loony!

661
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,600
Where are you?

662
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,480
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

663
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,760
What's the matter with you?

664
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,080
Nothing.

665
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
Is there anything I can eat?

666
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,480
There's plenty of food in the fridge.

667
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,200
Nah,

668
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,800
I'd rather buy something else.

669
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,000
What?

670
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,640
We have food at home!

671
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,160
What's with that dude?

672
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
Pond!

673
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,680
Where are you going?

674
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,720
Oh,

675
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,360
what are these, Junior?

676
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,040
Hi, Auntie.

677
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,560
Hi, Mild.

678
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,680
Jimmy, where are you
taking your stuff?

679
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,520
I'm going back to the condo, Mom.

680
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,000
It's good that you've made up.

681
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,000
If there's another fight,

682
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,920
you need to learn how to talk it out

683
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,680
so that there's no need
to move your stuff in and out.

684
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,320
You heard that, Mild?

685
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,760
Don't pick a fight again.

686
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,720
You're the one who always starts!

687
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,800
Not every time!

688
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,640
Every time!

689
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,320
Aight, let's move this
back to your room.

690
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,560
Hey, that's enough. Put it down.

691
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,760
It's my fault.

692
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,240
I promise I won't start another fight.

693
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,520
And I'll do as you say, Mild.

694
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,600
Mm!

695
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,800
That's good, son.

696
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,080
Then, let's have a meal

697
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,520
before you go back to your condo.

698
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,720
- Of course.
- Sure.

699
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,720
- Let's go.
- I'll help you with that.

700
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,560
- Here you go, dear.
- Alright.

701
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,800
It really is great news.

702
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,080
You're lucky to have a girlfriend
who tries to win you back.

703
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,560
Meanwhile, I'm the one doing that
to all my boos

704
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,320
with no luck winning them back!

705
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,560
That's because I'm a Gigachad, bro.

706
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,760
Huh?!

707
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,680
And how do we look any different?

708
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,200
Dunno.

709
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,080
The other day, you told me...

710
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,480
I told you that I like you.

711
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,600
It wasn't a joke.

712
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,960
I'm serious.

713
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,040
The reason I always look at you
is that I like you.

714
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,240
But after I told you,

715
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,440
you ran away from me,

716
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,600
so I didn't want
to bother you anymore.

717
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,720
I was afraid

718
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,480
that you would feel bad

719
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,440
or uncomfortable.

720
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,320
Hold up,

721
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,880
so...

722
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
What do you even see in me?

723
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,960
Are you really serious?

724
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,240
You're really not pranking me, right?

725
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,040
I am serious.

726
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
It's not a prank.

727
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,160
Well, you're just so adorable.

728
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,000
The way you laugh,

729
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,200
eat, walk,

730
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,080
or just anything

731
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,920
couldn't be more genuine.

732
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,760
And when you went full send
on the dramas,

733
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,920
saying that I looked at you
out of hatred

734
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,120
is all the more reason I adore you.

735
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,280
You're adorably naive.

736
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,280
But...

737
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,640
do I really look like
the villainess in those dramas?

738
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,880
Well...

739
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,120
I don't know!

740
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,840
This is how
it always pans out in those!

741
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,640
Gosh, no more.

742
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,840
Don't say anything more
about those pathetic things I do.

743
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,920
It's too embarrassing.

744
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,720
It's not pathetic at all.

745
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,020
It's the cutest.

746
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,280
I quit smoking because of you.

747
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,320
I want to take care
of those little things.

748
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,520
I even showed you my possessive side,

749
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,400
even though you're just my crush.

750
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,840
That last one

751
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,800
kinda made me wanna laugh.

752
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,800
You quit smoking for me?

753
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,640
I said I didn't like
the smell of it, didn't I?

754
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,880
I've never even thought about that.

755
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,160
So...

756
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,520
Are you okay with my confession?

757
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,320
Well, are you just gonna confess?

758
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,520
What do you mean?

759
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,000
Well,

760
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,320
are you not gonna try asking me out?

761
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,240
Uh...

762
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,400
I've had too many headaches
because of you already,

763
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,000
and I'm not about to let this go on
another night.

764
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,120
Does that mean
you're letting me ask you out?

765
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,760
Uh, I...

766
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,560
I...

767
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,600
Jane, do you know

768
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,280
that pursuing someone

769
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,880
is like knocking
on their door every day,

770
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,720
hoping that they will
eventually let you in?

771
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:51,760
I...don't know much about it.

772
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,120
I...

773
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,080
I always compare real life to dramas,

774
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,680
so I don't know much
about pursuing anyone.

775
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,320
Though I will try to understand...

776
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,680
I guess?

777
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,520
Why the hesitation?

778
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,520
Well, I'm not into you,

779
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,040
but...

780
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,200
I don't hate you, either.

781
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,680
So I thought that if I were...

782
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,280
being asked out,

783
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,360
then, I'd know more about it.

784
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,880
I've never experienced love

785
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,640
outside of comics

786
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,320
and TV dramas.

787
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,680
How would I know
what comes after this?

788
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,520
I understand.

789
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,880
Should we go home?

790
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,080
Where's your dorm?
I'll give you a ride.

791
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,320
Dai, are you giving me a ride
on this motorbike?

792
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,120
Why, Jane? Are you scared?

793
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,560
Uh, no.

794
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,120
I just didn't imagine
you knew how to ride it.

795
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,780
Here.

796
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,040
Thank you.

797
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,640
Thank you.

798
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,080
Helmets are very important,
you know?

799
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,680
After putting it on,
you need to strap it tightly.

800
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,720
Thank you!

801
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,810
I hope you won't have
another headache

802
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:51,860
because of me tonight.

803
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,240
And...

804
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,400
what are you waiting for?

805
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,840
To make sure you get up there.

806
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,040
You told me...

807
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,160
that what you're doing
is like knocking on a door

808
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,320
and waiting for me to answer, right?

809
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,680
Mm,

810
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,600
but if you get annoyed,
you can tell me.

811
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,920
I will stop and never bother you again.

812
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,240
That's not what I'm saying!

813
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,040
I...

814
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,200
I don't know what I'm feeling,

815
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,320
but...

816
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,200
I just wanna tell you...

817
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,080
Mm-hm?

818
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,480
Please knock
on my door again tomorrow,

819
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,480
the day after tomorrow,

820
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,040
and every day after that!

821
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,120
Drive home safe!

822
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,040
Mm!

823
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,920
You're so adorable, Jane.

824
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:21,800
♫Every time you are near,
I feel at ease♫

825
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,720
[Directed by SUEASIAM STUDIO]

826
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,720
It's Waii.

827
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,240
She's messing with my girlfriend.

828
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,560
Yes, Waii?

829
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,960
Today?

830
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,360
Then, I'll wait for you
at the usual spot.

831
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,240
Be for real with me.

832
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,200
Where were you yesterday?

833
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,720
You went to a movie, didn't you?

834
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,200
I'm really starting to dislike someone.

835
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,080
She was cozying up to Dai!

836
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,960
I think Dai
deserves someone prettier

837
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,400
and smarter.

838
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,320
Stay away from her.
