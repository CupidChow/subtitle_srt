1
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,790
Doesn't she look familiar?

2
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,990
What's her name again?

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,220
She's all over my feed.

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,910
My university life,

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,790
the one I thought
would start out perfectly,

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,270
is now turning into a big mess.

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,830
Look.

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,310
- I think I've seen her somewhere.
- I know, right?

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,630
Oh...

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,710
Are you okay?

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,790
Thank you.

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,710
Hey, is she the girl in the video?

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,830
Wait, she is!

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:48,950
Yeah, you're right.

15
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,670
She looks just like her.

16
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,230
It all started
from this ridiculous video

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,590
that I can't even remember
how it happened.

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,270
[The night before]

19
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,030
And it happened with this senior
I really don't like,

20
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,110
or maybe we can just call her my enemy.

- Let me introduce myself.

40
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,270
My name's Jane,

41
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,490
Jarin Tiansawangwarp.

42
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,550
I'm a freshman
in the Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

43
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,310
I chose this major

44
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,030
simply because I love drawing comics.

45
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,990
And why do I love it?

46
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,630
It all began with reading tons of them.

47
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,790
The more I read,
the more I wanted to draw

48
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,110
and tell my own stories.

49
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,070
At first, I was just doodling for fun,

50
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,790
but people actually liked it.

51
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,790
As my followers grew,

52
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,270
ToonDenie reached out to me.

53
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,790
And that's how I started earning money
even before graduating high school.

54
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,790
Here's yours.

55
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,030
Next, please.

56
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,590
- What's your name?
- It's Pong.

57
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,750
Pong?

58
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,430
Here.

59
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,830
Next, please.

60
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,070
What's your name?

61
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,230
It's Jane.

62
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,710
Jane?

63
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,230
Why are there so many Janes
in our major this year?

64
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,110
There are a lot.

65
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,670
We're only halfway through,

66
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,070
and there are already
three Janes.

67
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,990
Now it's the fourth Jane?

68
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,070
Right? We've already got
both male and female Janes.

69
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,230
So many Janes.

70
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,110
I can be Janie, then.

71
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,030
We've already got one there.

72
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,990
Alright, then what's your full name?

73
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,710
It's Jarin,

74
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,430
Jarin Tiansawangwarp!

75
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,430
Okay.

76
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,270
I'll add one syllable
from your first name, then.

77
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,750
That'll be unique.

78
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,070
Sounds great.

79
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,630
Here.

80
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,070
- Thank you.
- No worries.

81
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,350
Next, please.

82
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,110
- I'm Som.
- Som?

83
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,630
[Jane(Will)]

84
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,670
JaneWill?

85
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,510
JaneWill go where?

86
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,110
JaneWill?

87
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,150
I can't believe it.

88
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,750
Who would've guessed he'd mash
"Ja" in my first name that means "will"

89
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,590
into my nickname?

90
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,030
Seriously, who would have a name
that ends with a modal verb?

91
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,990
I mean, sure, the name's a bit odd,

92
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,350
but they don't have to
laugh that hard about it.

93
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,990
Whatever.

94
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,870
For the next four years,

95
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,870
there's no way I'm befriending Cake.

96
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,030
Cake,

97
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,070
here you go.

98
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,310
Aw...

99
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,470
You bought these for us?

100
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,910
Thanks, JaneWill.

101
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,830
Which one do you want?

102
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,990
That one.

103
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,150
Nope, take this one.

104
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,950
Well, anything can happen, I guess.

105
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,670
I was so sure
I'd never be friends with her,

106
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,470
but what happened that day
turned it all around.

107
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,990
I'll take this, this, and this, please.

108
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,150
[Jane(Will)]

109
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,990
That'll be 140 baht, please.

110
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,030
I forgot my wallet.

111
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,630
But I can pay by scanning.

112
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,950
Wait...

113
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,230
Hey!

114
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,350
Gosh...

115
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,310
What's going on?

116
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,950
Why now?

117
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,910
Come on.

118
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,510
Here.

119
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,590
You can pay me back later.

120
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,070
Take it for now.

121
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,670
From that moment on,

122
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,710
all my anger just disappeared.

123
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,470
It felt like we were actually destined
to be friends.

124
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,230
As for Waii,

125
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,470
we met because she forgot
to bring a pen to class.

126
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,670
Next thing I knew,

127
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,430
the three of us
were basically inseparable,

128
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,590
close enough to talk about anything.

129
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,790
We even ended up with a group name:
The Nosy Diggers Club.

130
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,830
There you are!

131
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,070
You guys done hunting
for the seniors' signatures?

132
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,870
I've only gotten ten of them, Meen.

133
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,150
What? Why's that?

134
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,190
I've almost gotten all of them now.

135
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,630
Blame it on her.

136
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,250
What? Why are you blaming me?

137
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,550
If you hadn't been so picky
about the elevator,

138
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,750
we would've had so many more.

139
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,310
Gosh, do you wanna fight?

140
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,170
- Bring it.
- Stop.

141
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,870
Do not fight, girls.

142
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,670
Wait, can you tell me
what actually happened?

143
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,030
So, Cake has this elevator instinct.

144
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,830
If the left one is on its way,

145
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,630
she'll tell us to wait for the right one

146
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,750
'cause she feels it'll be quicker.

147
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,510
But she was wrong.

148
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,470
So it was all in your head?

149
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,270
Fine.

150
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,070
Next time, you two can go by yourselves.

151
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,790
- I'm out.
- Aw, don't be mad.

152
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,670
I mean,
you can't put all the blame on her.

153
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,630
- Right.
- Gotta blame those seniors, too.

154
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,550
Exactly!

155
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,590
They're impossible to track down.

156
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,830
Right? Finding them

157
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,590
is even harder than finding a boyfriend.

158
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,070
Honestly,

159
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,470
those seniors are just looking for ways
to mess with us freshmen.

160
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,510
You think so?

161
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,150
That's possible.

162
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,430
Wait, I remember it now.

163
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,230
Especially that jerk...

164
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,790
Ugh, I couldn't stand him
the moment I saw him.

165
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,830
What was his problem?

166
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,630
Who are you talking about?

167
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,710
- What was his name again?
- What was it?

168
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,830
- Oh, I know.
- It's on the tip of my tongue.

169
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,870
He's Tang-oh. You know him?

170
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,190
Oh...

171
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,310
- The one with funny hair?
- Yeah.

172
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,190
- How funny.
- The male senior...

173
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,030
- My head...
- Gosh...

174
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,190
That is too funny.

175
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,790
This angle, okay?

176
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,430
Alright. Take stunning shots, okay?

177
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,430
Snap,

178
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,590
snap,

179
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,590
snap.

180
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,590
Wow, did you really have
to work this hard, Darin?

181
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,150
Perfect, isn't she?

182
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,310
Yeah.

183
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,070
Why did you stop, JaneWill?

184
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,110
Cake!

185
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:33,950
What?

186
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,030
I bet that senior doesn't like me.

187
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,070
Who?

188
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,510
That one with the denim jacket.

189
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,110
Wait,

190
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,470
that's Dai,
the campus queen from last year.

191
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,390
She was the campus queen?

192
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,150
Yeah, that's her!

193
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,030
Seriously, why would she hate
a goofy newbie like you?

194
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,190
'Cause you're an eyesore?

195
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,470
I don't know.

196
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,950
But girls looking at girls,
what else could it mean?

197
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,750
Aren't you just imagining things?

198
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,950
No, I'm not.

199
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,310
This is already the fourth time.

200
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,070
You sure about that?

201
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,590
- Did your dad call?
- Stop.

202
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,350
So that means...

203
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,190
you've also looked at her
four times already.

204
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,470
Otherwise, you wouldn't have known
she looked at you.

205
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,030
I mean, I just felt like
I was being looked at!

206
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,830
Did you accidentally do something
to upset her?

207
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,830
Who's upset? What happened?

208
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,790
Should we fight?

209
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,910
No, it's nothing.

210
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,030
Just go back to sleep.

211
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,670
Dai?

212
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,550
Wow!

213
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,390
This is amazing, Darin.

214
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,950
Your sketch is amazing.

215
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,070
Check this out, everyone.

216
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,110
Good linework
not only improves your design skills,

217
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,870
but also makes your work
admired by others,

218
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,550
empowering you
to design with confidence.

219
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,550
Let's give Darin
another round of applause, everyone.

220
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,950
- Darin!
- Yes?

221
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,550
Are you planning to submit it
to some kind of competition?

222
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,590
You're giving us a hard time.

223
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,430
Work harder, then.

224
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,390
Ugh!

225
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,590
Whose sketch is this?

226
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,510
Prarong...

227
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,230
Yes, Professor.

228
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,110
What kind of sketch is this?

229
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,950
Gosh,

230
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,630
even elementary kids
can do better than this.

231
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,270
I won't approve work like this.

232
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,830
Go redo it.

233
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,510
Come on, Professor Erika.

234
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,440
Argh!

235
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,990
It's Erika Barbara!

236
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,470
Address me by my full name,

237
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,020
or you'll lose twice the points.

238
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,270
Remember that!

239
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,670
Come on.

240
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,870
Please, Professor Erika Barbara!

241
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,350
Erika Barbara!

242
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,910
Your sketch is too good.

243
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,210
Erika Barbara!

244
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,590
Do you know Dai's Facebook or Insta?

245
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,990
Why do you want it?

246
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,830
My business.

247
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,640
What?

248
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,030
None of your business.

249
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,070
Jeez, you b*tch.

250
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,550
Don't say that to anyone else, alright?

251
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,070
So, do you know her Insta?

252
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,950
What?

253
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,750
Be pipe-tient.

254
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,470
It's patient!

255
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,630
[An architecture student]

256
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,790
Thanks.

257
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,510
Who are you guys talking about?

258
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,310
Ask Cake for that.

259
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,430
I'm busy right now.

260
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,590
[An architecture student]

261
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,830
Gosh,

262
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,750
you're posing with the faculty sign!

263
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,070
No need to put it in your bio.

264
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,570
[Pretty, the one who took it]

265
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
[It was me]

266
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
[It's supposed to be 'architectural']

267
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,510
She's never really thrown shade
at anyone, though.

268
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,390
And she hasn't replied to any comments.

269
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,590
She only liked them.

270
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,310
[When are you taking me out
for hot pot?]

271
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,710
Why does she hate me, then?

272
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,550
Hello?

273
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,630
Oh...

274
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,910
Yes, Elf?

275
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,790
So, Jane,

276
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,390
any sign of your new project yet?

277
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,150
Well...

278
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,270
I'm still imagining it.

279
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,230
What?

280
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,070
You mean you haven't even started?

281
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,630
I've just been busy with school lately.

282
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,830
No matter how busy you are,

283
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,030
you should make time
to give me something.

284
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,190
Your fans have been asking me nonstop

285
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,670
that ToonDenie might literally crash!

286
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,710
Just give me a little more time, okay?

287
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:10,150
I swear I'll get it to you in two weeks.

288
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,790
Fine, then.

289
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,150
I'll wait.

290
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,670
But you have to get it to me.

291
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,360
Don't bail on me.

292
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,430
Got it.

293
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,380
Oh...

294
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,670
This is the old draft!

295
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,150
Where's the new one?

296
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,830
The creator hasn't sent it yet.

297
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,630
So I wanted to ask you

298
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,750
if we could publish the old one first?

299
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,670
Are you crazy?

300
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,230
People are already complaining
about reruns everywhere.

301
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,470
Now you want to rerun a comic, too?

302
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,310
Go fetch a new draft
and have it ready to post tomorrow!

303
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,750
Yes.

304
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,030
Can we sit here?

305
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,910
Come on.

306
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,510
Come here.

307
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,870
Perfect. We got our seats right away.

308
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,790
I've got you something to eat as well.

309
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,870
Isn't that nice of me?

310
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,910
Say thanks.

311
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,350
Anyway, do you know why they called us?

312
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,910
Who are you asking?

313
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,870
I'm just asking out loud.

314
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,550
If anyone's listening,
go ahead and answer.

315
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,910
Oh, I'm not listening.

316
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,190
What are you guys talking about?

317
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,670
Seriously,

318
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,510
do you ever actually hear
what anyone says?

319
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,190
I'm eating this.

320
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,190
- Alright, is everyone here?
- Wow, it's good.

321
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,710
So, we called everyone together today

322
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,500
because we're going to select

323
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,340
the king and queen
of our Visual Arts major

324
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,110
to go head-to-head
with the other majors.

325
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,150
Then, we'll select those
who are most suitable

326
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,600
to represent our faculty

327
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,430
in the campus king and queen competition.

328
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,670
Excited, aren't you?

329
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,910
So, anyone wanna nominate themselves?

330
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,790
You can nominate your friends as well.

331
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,670
Anyone?

332
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,390
No.

333
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,310
This one.

334
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,190
If no one's gonna nominate anyone,

335
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,110
then I'll choose for you myself.

336
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,910
That girl.

337
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,790
You, too.

338
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,510
And the last one...

339
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,190
is you. Get up.

340
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,330
JaneWill!

341
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,790
Hey, JaneWill!

342
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,350
- Get this again tomorrow, okay?
- Got it.

343
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,590
She's calling you.

344
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,990
Come here.

345
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,470
Right here.

346
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,670
Come on.

347
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,030
Alright, these two
are rocking a gorgeous style.

348
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,430
Then for the other one,
I want a cute, innocent,

349
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,910
kinda clumsy vibe.

350
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,910
Make it different, you know.

351
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,670
Why is she standing there?

352
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,310
You're amazing.

353
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,150
Even I, who rarely laugh,

354
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,310
couldn't help cracking up.

355
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,390
Right.

356
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,790
Anyway, congratulations.

357
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,590
You're our major's queen now.

358
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,790
You slayed.

359
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,710
Who said I wanted to be it?

360
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,590
What?

361
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,990
If you didn't want to,

362
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,910
why did you do what they said?

363
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,110
I didn't know
they wanted me to be funny.

364
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,530
Please give her a round of applause!

365
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,790
Good luck.

366
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,430
I'll just sing something simple.

367
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,470
If I sing off-key like usual,
I'll definitely get eliminated.

368
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,910
I'll be safe for sure.

♫Uh! Apple-Pen♫

371

♫I have a pen, I have pineapple♫

♫Uh! Pineapple-Pen♫

373
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,350
Me? A plain Jane?

374
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,710
Going up for the faculty's queen?

375
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,390
I'd definitely die of embarrassment.

376
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,150
Hey, the crown might land on you.

377
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,470
- Right.
- You never know.

378
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,310
Don't you want a crown?

379
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,990
Nope.

380
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,390
What? Are you serious?

381
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,830
That's such a big surprise for the year!

382
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,280
Wow.

383
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,230
How about you tell them yourself?
They're all here,

384
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,390
except Dad.

385
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,670
Hey, why?

386
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,750
What is it, Junior?

387
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,590
You're curious, huh?

388
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,880
Just say it.

389
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,910
Come on,

390
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,230
tell us now.

391
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,850
Come on, sweetie.

392
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,950
Jane got picked
as the major's queen.

393
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,550
What? Seriously?!

394
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,550
That's unbelievable.

395
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,070
I can't believe

396
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,230
there's someone uglier than her.

397
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,310
Jimmy!

398
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,430
Yes?

399
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,270
That's not a nice thing to say.

400
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,030
Come on,

401
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,510
I was just kidding, Mom.

402
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,110
Who would even dare
mess with your favorite daughter?

403
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,270
If she hadn't inherited your beauty,

404
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,710
she wouldn't have won this title.

405
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,790
When I was young,
I actually won a beauty contest.

406
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,350
Maybe Jane could be
the campus queen, too!

407
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,710
Let's just eat first, alright?

408
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,110
No need to dream that far,

409
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,990
or you'll end up disappointed.

410
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,910
Jasmine,

411
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,070
go help your sister
with her walk and her smile.

412
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,950
Better get her ready now.

413
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,670
Alright, you know what?

414
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,990
I'll call your dad

415
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,190
and tell him
to throw a celebration party for Jane.

416
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,350
- Hey, Mom. Calm down.
- Calm down.

417
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,110
I shouldn't have asked him.

418
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,470
Shouldn't have praised her.

419
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,100
Yay!

420
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,430
[Queen of the Faculty
of Fine and Applied Arts]

421
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,710
Alright,

422
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,750
and this year's Queen of the Faculty
of Fine and Applied Arts is...

423
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,630
JaneWill, Jarin Tiansawangwarp,

424
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,590
from Visual Arts!

425
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,310
Let's all root for JaneWill

426
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,390
to win the campus queen title
and make our faculty proud!

427
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,910
But before we all head off,

428
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,230
we have a surprise.

429
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,390
What is it?

430
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,150
We're going to reveal the seniors
from different majors

431
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,730
who've been disguised as freshmen.

432
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,760
I wonder who they are.

433
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,490
The first one is...

434
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,990
Pong, a third-year
Arts and Design major!

435
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,390
The second one is...

436
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,470
Joo, a second-year
Fashion Design major!

437
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,870
The third one is...

438
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,310
Gluay, a fourth-year
Jewelry Design major!

439
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,430
And the last one is a Visual Arts major.

440
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,950
You?

441
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,070
Don't tell me it's you?

442
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,510
Meen, a sophomore!

443
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,510
Yay!

444
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,830
It's Meen!

445
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,670
It's her. Meen's a sophomore!

446
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,150
Hey, why are you staring at me?

447
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,910
Well,

448
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,830
I'm just so proud that
my friend is the faculty's queen.

449
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,590
Anyway,

450
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,430
if you actually win
the campus queen title,

451
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,510
you might even
get to become an actress.

452
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,230
You know, just like her.
What was her name again?

453
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,270
Dai!

454
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,470
Once she became the campus queen,

455
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,910
a film studio reached out
to cast her in a series.

456
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,710
Well,

457
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,510
it seems the rain won't stop soon.

458
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,230
Yeah, you're right.

459
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,310
Good thing
my dad happened to be around,

460
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,910
so I asked him to give me a ride.

461
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,910
Mhm.

462
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,910
Dai's actually very pretty, isn't she?

463
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,310
Her face card is unmatched.

464
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,910
If she goes into showbiz, wow,

465
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,070
she might just become a superstar.

466
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,310
Can you stop talking about her already?

467
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,750
I don't really like her, you know.

468
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,070
Come on, JaneWill.

469
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:35,070
Why are you so annoyed with her?

470
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,070
I don't know.

471
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,590
It's just my irritation, I guess.

472
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,710
Your irritation?

473
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,390
Are you crazy?

474
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,830
I said I don't like her. That's it.

475
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,350
If you bring her up again,

476
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,870
I'm done talking to you.

477
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,550
Hey!

478
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,070
That has nothing to do with this.

479
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,070
If anyone else had said that to me,

480
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,750
I'd have thrown a shoe at them.

481
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,710
Do you want that?

482
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,630
Didn't hear that.

483
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,510
Didn't hear, my foot!

484
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,790
Come on, look at you.

485
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,030
Anyway, my dad's here.

486
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,150
Gotta go now.

487
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,390
Bye.

488
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,390
Let's fight again later, okay?

489
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,520
Very well.

490
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,070
What's wrong with her?

491
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,510
Hey,

492
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,030
what about you?

493
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,310
You've already had two cups of coffee.

494
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,870
Why are you still so sleepy?

495
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,070
Are you sure
you're a human and not a koala?

496
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,910
I've been sleepy since the afternoon,

497
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,030
but I'm still here
'cause I'm worried about you.

498
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,670
Wow.

499
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,710
Really appreciate that, girl.

500
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,990
You should leave, then.

501
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,790
The rain's letting up.

502
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,670
I'll be leaving in a bit, too.

503
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,550
Okay. I'm leaving, then.

504
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,420
Okay.

505
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,670
Oh...

506
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,710
I'm sorry.

507
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,110
It's okay.

508
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,910
I'm the one who should say sorry

509
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,790
for sitting too close

510
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,150
and blocking your way.

511

[Jane(Will), Queen of the Faculty
of Fine and Applied Arts]

You're the Queen of FA?

513
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,270
She must've heard
everything I said, right?

514
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,150
That's why she asked me that,

515
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,070
to show off

516
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,790
that she won
the campus queen title last year.

517
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,150
Looks like
you'll be seeing a lot of me, then,

518
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,270
since last year's campus queen
is assigned to guide this year's queens

519
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,830
until the contest.

520
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,810
There it is.

521
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,750
She's stressing me out.

522
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,790
Nice to meet you.

She's wearing rose-scented perfume.

526
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,190
You're doomed.

527
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,230
You should be careful
when you're about to gossip.

528
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,070
What's so funny?

529
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,150
You were right there with me.

530
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,110
Why didn't you give me any sign?

531
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,070
What? I didn't see her.

532
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,270
If I had, I would've told you.

533
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,830
So, what were you guys saying about her?

534
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,910
We weren't.

535
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,950
Didn't say a thing.

536
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,350
JaneWill was!

537
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,630
Was it bad?

538
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,150
I went all out.

539
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,190
Whoa,

540
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,230
so you're actually doomed
like Waii said.

541
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,630
She even told me that

542
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,500
last year's campus king and queen

543
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,350
are assigned to mentor
this year's kings and queens

544
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,910
until the contest.

545
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,510
Does that mean
you must see her every day?

546
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,730
Exactly.

547
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,220
Sorry.

548
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,630
Okay.

549
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,590
You'd better be ready to die,

550
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:33,030
'cause I'm sure you won't rest in peace.

551
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,070
Cake!

00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,950
Come on, enough messing around.

553
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,990
- What?
- She's stressed now.

554
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,030
Let's figure out
how we can help JaneWill.

555
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,750
You mean I need to be serious?

556
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,430
- Yes.
- Yes.

557
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,230
Okay, then.

558
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,510
I'll be serious now.

559
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,670
Three, two, one...

560
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,630
Alright.

561
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,870
Go apologize to Dai with a garland.

562
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,710
What?!

563
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,430
Do I have to go that far?

564
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,110
Yeah.

565
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,050
If you've got the guts to gossip,

566
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,350
you must have the guts
to apologize, too.

567
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,270
But isn't that too much?

568
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,110
Do I really need to do that?

569
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,990
She's not a shrine, either.

570
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,630
Do I have to be that respectful?

571
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,830
Well, you can try other ways
if you want.

572
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,790
But I think this is the best one.

573
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,350
I agree with that.

574
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,430
It wouldn't hurt to try, would it?

575
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,710
Are you sure?

576
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,150
Will it really work?

577
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,910
- Yeah.
- Yes.

578
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,070
It definitely will. Trust me.

579
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,870
Go apologize to Dai with a garland.

580
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,870
Dai, I'm sorry.

581
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,670
I don't want that.

582
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,130
Junior!

583
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,790
Junior, I want your advice on something.

584
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,340
What is it?

585
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,830
There's this senior from another faculty
who doesn't like me,

586
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,510
and I gossiped about her,

587
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,950
but she heard everything.

588
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,150
Quit ASAP.

589
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,590
Come on!

590
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,190
Just kidding.

591
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,470
Did you say something bad?

592
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,950
I did.

593
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,710
I said I didn't like her
and was annoyed with her.

594
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,110
You can just leave her alone.

595
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,590
She's in a different faculty, isn't she?

596
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,990
I wish I could do that,
but it wouldn't be easy.

597
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,070
Why, though?

598
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,270
I'm the Queen of FA.

599
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,430
Does it have something to do with this?

600
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,310
Of course it does.

601
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,070
I'm the Queen of FA,

602
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,110
and she was the campus queen last year.

603
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,050
She's going to be my mentor

604
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,310
both at the camp and during activities.

605
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,790
My friends said I should apologize
to her with a garland,

606
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,350
but that seems too much.

607
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,880
So I'm thinking of sending her
an apology on Insta,

608
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:51,550
but I have no idea how to start

609
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,390
to make it come off as friendly.

610
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,790
Got it. I'll take care of it.

611
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,510
I've got plenty of experience
apologizing to girls.

612
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,070
First of all,

613
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,710
send her a sad meme
that makes you look pitiful.

614
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,710
A sad meme?

615
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,030
Then wait
until she accepts your message request.

616
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,910
One hundred percent, she'll reply.

617
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,110
Did you finish the work from last night?

618
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,430
I stayed up all night doing it.

619
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,910
Haven't even slept yet.

620
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,870
Let me get you a cup of coffee, then.

621
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,110
Alright.

622
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,110
What, Dai?

623
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,270
Come on. It's hot out here.

624
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,160
- What was that?
- It is hot.

625
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,590
What?

626
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,790
Hello, my friends.

627
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,950
Tell me which one is our model.

628
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,950
Take a guess.

629
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,990
I'll go with that one.

630
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,990
The height is just perfect.

631
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,350
Gosh.

632
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,710
Since we've got Dai, this one's ours.

633
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,150
- This one?!
- Yeah.

634
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,630
- Seriously?!
- Yeah.

635
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,470
Whoa, it looks fantastic.

636
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,710
Tell the professor
I did the pillars, okay?

637
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,870
- Come on.
- Is that alright?

638
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,910
That was the trickiest part.

639
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,750
Come on!

640
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,830
I'll tell her you cut the toothpicks.

641
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,750
Fine.

642
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,830
What are you looking at?

643
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,550
Nothing.

644
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,830
You're acting suspicious, Darin.

645
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,350
What? I'm not.

646
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,990
Wow, this just looks perfect.

647
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,030
Fantastic.

648
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,510
- Hi.
- Oh, Professor...

649
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

650
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,030
So, whose model is which?

651
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,310
- Let me see.
- Take a look right here.

652
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,350
This is my group's model, Professor.

653
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:43,030
I made it from scratch,

654
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,790
starting with the foundation,

655
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,000
- the pillars...
- This one

656
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,950
or this one?

657
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,550
This one, Professor. Not that one.

658
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,430
Bring your models into the classroom,

659
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,510
and give a presentation
one group at a time.

660
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,870
Let's go inside.

661
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,290
I hadn't had any sleep or food,

662
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,230
and my whole body
wasn't functioning properly.

663
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,190
Are you sure that's yours?

664
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,670
I'm certain, Professor.

665
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,750
Alright, come here, everyone.

666
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,310
Come check in right here.

667
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,030
Come on.

668
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,550
Kings to the left,

669
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,870
and queens to the right.

670
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,270
Then, go ahead
and take your profile pictures.

671
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,110
Oh, gosh.

672
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,510
Make sure
your handwriting looks neat, alright?

673
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,150
- Yuphin!
- Yes?

674
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,910
Isn't this supposed to be
your responsibility?

675
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,670
Why's a top-tier scout
like Guichai doing it herself?

676
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,950
Meet your responsibilities now.

677
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,710
She was speaking,

678
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,230
so I didn't know when to interrupt.

679
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,830
Do not argue with me.

680
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,510
Just meet your responsibilities.

681
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,510
- Okay.
- I will help her with that.

682
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,110
That's great.

683
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,630
Split the responsibilities, okay?

684
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,550
We will.

685
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,910
My apologies.

686
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,110
Prarong.

687
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,070
Prarong!

688
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,490
Yes?

689
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,630
Why are you smiling, shaking,
and not taking any photos?

690
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,030
Just take the photo.

691
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,470
Yes, Professor.

692
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,820
- Jeez!
- Right here, please.

693
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,110
You guys...

694
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,750
Do it.

695
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,150
Have you checked in yet?

696
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,070
Right here, right?

697
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,830
Yes.

698
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,030
Wow, who's that?

699
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,670
Let me take a closer look at you.

700
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,790
Wow!

701
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,590
You look gorgeous.

702
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,910
We're actually
already familiar with him, Guichai.

703
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,870
He's Ice, an engineering student.

704
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,830
Could you include him
as one of your male leads as well?

705
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,990
Sure thing.

706
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,670
We're like friends after all,

707
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,630
so we've got to support each other
all the way.

708
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,950
You only need a bit more makeup.

709
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,070
Jane, this way.

710
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,030
Come here.

711
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,650
Uh, well,

712
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,550
can I quit now?

713
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,870
There are too many people,

714
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,270
and it feels kinda hectic.

715
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,950
You can't, Jane.

716
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,210
Or our FA's name will be ruined.

717
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,430
Follow me this way.

718
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,240
Come on.

719
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,390
Oh...

720
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,630
Hey,

721
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,470
is your head okay? Lemme see.

722
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,430
It's okay. I'm fine.

723
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,910
Are you hurt anywhere?

724
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,950
You ain't even lookin' where ya goin'.

725
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,070
Well, I...

726
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,990
I'm okay.

727
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,630
And I'm not going anywhere.

728
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,950
Sorry.

729
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,510
Have you checked in yet?

730
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,910
I'll take your profile picture.

731
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,910
Ain't done it yet. I'm on it now.

732
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,430
Hold up here for a sec.

733
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,280
What kind of dialect was that?

734
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,870
Greetings to both of you.

735
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,470
Why the bow?

736

Don't bother. We're in the same year.

737
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,270
Oh, my bad.

738
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,070
That was shocking, wasn't it?

739
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,150

I'm Jane from FA.

742
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,550
Girls, once you've had
enough snacks and drinks,

743
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,430
come with me.

744
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,430
Professor Erika Barbara is waiting.

745
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:20,670
You can go first.

746
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,990
My stomach aches.

747
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,310
What now?

748
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,510
Is she okay?

749
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,670
She said her stomach ached.
I think she meant she needed to pee.

750
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,150
Just now she hit heads
with someone else, too.

751
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,510
For real, what's her deal?

752
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:55,990
She hasn't replied yet.

00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,430
Could it be that
she finds my profile pic irritating?

755
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,570
Is this JaneWill?

756
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,470
Well,

757
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,830
my username already makes it obvious.

758
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,950
Guess I look too good, huh?

759
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,150
And she can't even call me
by my actual name.

760
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,310
If you're not close to me
but try to call me JaneWill,

761
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,150
I'll be really pissed.

until she accepts your message request.

Hello, Dai.

767
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,870
Alright.

768
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,670
What's the matter?

769
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,590
I want to apologize
for what happened yesterday.

770
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:38,100

771

I'm blushing now.

772

Wait,

773
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,970
what is she trying to say?

774
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,590
All I wanted from her was,
"I forgive you,"

775
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,830
but now she's blushing?

776
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,070
I know you love green tea.

777
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,390
If you forgive me,

778
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,590
I'll get you ten cups.

779
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,110
That's so generous of you.

780
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,710
My favorite green tea is pricey, though.

781
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,550
I'm not getting the tea.

782
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,710
I'm buying ten cups
for you to put green tea in.

783
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,480
Don't worry about it.

784
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,670
I'm not mad at you.

785
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,460
Really?

786
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,430
Yes.

787
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,550
There's no way she's not mad.

788
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:54,190
Could it be that
this is some kind of trap,

789
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,230
trying to lure me in?

790
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,590
So,

791
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,270
is Dai really not mad at you?

792
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,270
I wonder about that too.

793
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,510
There's no way she's not mad

794

after hearing everything I said.

795
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:18,870
Well, she could just
be very nice and kind.

796
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,910
After all, she was the campus queen.

797
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,830
No matter how nice she is,

798
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,670
I still don't trust her.

799
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,830
Don't overthink it.

800
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,230
Let it go.

801
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,870
Let it go.

802
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,710
Yeah, that's right.

803
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,110
Anyway, it's time.

804
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,830
I gotta go now.

805
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,110
Mhm.

806
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,390
See you tomorrow.

807
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:49,490
Bye.

808
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,150
I'm very proud of you, Jane.

809
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,070
Why, though?

810
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:08,150
You're the prettiest peer mentee
I could ever ask for.

811
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,870
Plus, you're the Queen of FA.

812
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,070
Thanks.

813
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:17,070
But...I feel like I'm not pretty at all

814
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,950
around everyone else.

815
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,550
Come on, don't say that.

816
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,870
Keep your confidence up, okay?

817
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,910
When I told your other peer mentors,

818
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,550
they were so proud of you.

819
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:30,110
They even said
they want to take you out to celebrate.

820
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,430
Perfect!

821
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,470
I've been craving hot pot anyway.

822
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,750
No! We're not eating that.

823
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,070
What? What will we do, then?

824
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,870
We're university students now,

825
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,630
so we celebrate at pubs.

826
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,030
- Pubs?
- Yep.

827
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,070
I even booked a table myself.

828
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,470
Well...

829
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,710
I don't drink alcohol, Meen.

830
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,830
You can just drink sodas
or eat some food.

831
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,310
Come on, I've already told everyone.

832
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,390
Don't tell me it's tonight.

833
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,430
No way.

834
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,870
I've got plans tonight.

835
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,510
It's tomorrow night.

836
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,510
Whoa,

837
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,470
that's so sudden.

838
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,790
I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it.

839
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,030
By the way, what time?

840
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,270
At 10:30 P.M.

841
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,830
At 10:30?

842
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,910
Is that when we'll meet
or when we'll leave?

843
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,030
When we'll meet, obviously.

844
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,430
Who goes out drinking
and leaves that early?

845
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,510
You're funny, really.

846
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,790
I actually have no idea.

847
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,310
I always thought
they started drinking around 6 P.M.

848
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,830
and went home by 7.

849
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,750
I never knew they stayed out this late.

850
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,670
Alright, good girl.

851
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:43,950
So you're coming, right?

852
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:48,830
I can give it a try.

853
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,270
Yay!

854
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,070
Let me treat you to a milkshake, then.

855
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,030
Sounds good?

856
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:55,790
It's on me.

857
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,070
- Okay.
- Come on.

858
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:57,910
- Alright.
- Let's go.

859
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,350
- A milkshake...
- Sounds good, right?

860
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:01,790
- I want some whipped cream, too.
- It's on me.

861
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,470
Sure. You can get anything.

are you free tonight?

868
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,950
What is it?

869
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,070

00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,190
I can't. Already got plans.

873
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,000
Don't tell me it's a date.

874
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:56,070
Nope, it's just my peer mentors.

875
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:58,230
They're taking me out to celebrate.

876
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:01,110
Lucky you.
My mentors haven't done anything so far.

877
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,070
Gotta go now. I'm in a hurry.

878

00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:40,990
What is it, Jane?

887
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:43,950
Well,

888
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:46,310
I have no idea what to put on.

889
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,870
I've never been to a pub,

890
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,850
so I don't know what others wear.

891
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,350
Is there a dress code?

892
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:54,670
Don't worry about it.

893
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,110
Just wear something casual.
