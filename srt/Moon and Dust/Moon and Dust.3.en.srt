1
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:06,200
I slept holding my brother last night

2
00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:08,666
I'm becoming more and more possessive

3
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:09,400
about my brother

4
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:11,466
so I bit him

5
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,000
He didn't refuse

6
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:15,500
Does this mean he's also fond of me doing this?

7
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:19,766
Can I totally possess him?

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,233
Song Qi, open the door

9
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:57,966
I am Qi Yan

10
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,366
I'm coming

11
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:06,966
Come in

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,200
What movie has you this hyped up, anyway?

13
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:15,566
It's brand-new

14
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,866
It's my first time to see

15
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:18,766
I bring it especially for you

16
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:21,000
Generous of me, huh?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,800
OK

18
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,700
Five

19
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:35,566
This way

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,966
It's about the time

21
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:42,266
I have to leave now

22
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:43,666
Qi should be back now

23
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:45,200
I have to go back and cook for him

24
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:46,166
I gotta go

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,966
Boss

26
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:49,133
Somebody may think you are hurry to

27
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,466
cook for your pretty wife

28
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,966
Where did you get that idea?

29
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,000
He is my younger brother

30
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:54,266
Hold down the fort here

31
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:54,833
Bye bye

32
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:55,633
OK

33
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:06,700
That fits Qi's taste

34
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:12,766
This

35
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:19,333
This is Qi's favourite

36
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,266
Let me take more

37
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:39,500
What is Qi doing now?

38
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,533
Two men

39
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,900
That's too weird

40
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,333
It's my first time watching it

41
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,866
So it is with me

42
00:04:58,266 --> 00:04:59,066
Qi Yan

43
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,066
En

44
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,500
I tell you a secret

45
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:02,800
What？

46
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,766
My brother and I are not biological brothers

47
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,466
Your brother is so nice to you

48
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,866
You are not biological brothers, really？

49
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,700
When I was very young

50
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:15,833
I was found by my brother

51
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:41,533
Don't be afraid

52
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,633
cover it and you wo't feel cold

53
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:52,966
Do you want to go home with me?

54
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,300
What should I call you?

55
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,100
How old are you?

56
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,700
I don't know

57
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,066
Then,from now on,you can take my family name,Song

58
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,866
We'll celebrate your birthday on this day every year

59
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,400
I agree with you

60
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,033
My brother is so nice to me

61
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,466
so I swear I must be better to him

62
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,100
I will be with my brother forever

63
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,666
I will take good care of him

64
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,933
It's much earlier than usual today

65
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,566
Qi must be happy

66
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:53,266
Before, I just wanted to possess him

67
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:55,000
I wanted to be the only one in his eyes

68
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:57,666
But I found that I loved him

69
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,000
You're brothers

70
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:00,900
So what?

71
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:02,300
Song Li is not my biological brother

72
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,800
There is no blood relation between us

73
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,566
Even though

74
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,600
You're still brothers, aren't you?

75
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,166
Besides, a same-sex relationship

76
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,866
between two men rarely succeeds

77
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:12,166
Why does it matter that we're all men?

78
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,833
I don't care about the sex

79
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,000
I do care about my brother

80
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,600
Song Qi loves Song Li

81
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:22,166
You will never understand

82
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,266
As I get older, my longing for him grows too

83
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,100
But I don't have the courage to tell him

84
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,033
I'm afraid to scare him

85
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:40,700
That's alright, my bro

86
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,233
I got you

87
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:45,100
It's not like you went crazy yesterday

88
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:46,700
Brother Li is sure to be yours

89
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:48,566
Let's go

90
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:49,833
Play games

91
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,566
OK, go

92
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,100
Brother?

93
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,200
Brother Li

94
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:10,800
Qi, you're here too

95
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:12,766
Are you ready to go outside?

96
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,033
Brother

97
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,833
How long have you been there?

98
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,833
I just got here

99
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,500
The door opened

100
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,566
just when I was going to open it

101
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,466
Anything wrong?

102
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,933
Brother Li, well

103
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:29,833
I'll take him to a gaming café to play for a while

104
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,233
Go

105
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:32,766
Qi

106
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,066
Remember to come back for dinner

107
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:47,766
OK

108
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:06,033
