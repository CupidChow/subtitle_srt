1
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:10,566
Qi

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,600
Brother

3
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:26,100
Brother

4
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,200
I knew you would come

5
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:29,866
After all, I will be apart for two weeks

6
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:30,700
Of course

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,300
You are my only family left in this world

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,066
It's for sure that I'm reluctant to part with you

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,766
Alright

10
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,800
Now you won't be mad at me anymore

11
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,000
Brother

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,633
I suspect I'm actually a dog

13
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:50,966
I'm eager to bite you all the time

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,100
So you are a doggie that was raised by my own hands

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,200
Qi

16
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,466
If I didn't come today

17
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,300
you would go cry in your department, right?

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,800
Song Li

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,466
I am not that weak as you said

20
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,433
I'll more likely to have an erotic dream

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,966
What?

22
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,200
Nothing

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,200
Brother

24
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:37,166
I'm too tired to move a step

25
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,500
Then walk holding my hand

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,566
Wow

27
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,433
What a man with the favour of god

28
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:16,800
Which did you say

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,300
has the favour of god, me or my brother?

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,666
He

31
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,466
is destined to rise to prominence in the future

32
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:23,600
with a life of great wealth and honor

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,466
It's of great worth of you to live a life like that

34
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,200
Brother

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
He said you're blessed with a good fate

36
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,000
I can have a younger brother like you

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,500
no wonder that I can be blessed with a good fate

38
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:34,866
Master

39
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,700
Can you do a fortune-telling for my brother?

40
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:42,033
A born bad seed

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,400
The retribution will finally comes

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,066
Stop talking nonsense!

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,833
He's not that kind of person

44
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:49,633
Qi

45
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:50,466
Let's go

46
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:57,333
Qi, listen to me

47
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,200
I've watched you grow up  since you were little

48
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:00,666
I truly know who you are

49
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:01,866
I'm the one who have the right to tell

50
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,566
Forget the born bad seed

51
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:04,400
Absolutely no!

52
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,200
As for the retribution

53
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,600
he is talking bullshit!

54
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,100
Even if there is the retribution

55
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,066
I will face the consequences for you

56
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:11,900
Brother

57
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,666
What silly of you

58
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,500
Why?

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,033
Did I say anything wrong?

60
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,500
Brother

61
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,466
You put so much trust in me

62
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,033
You are so innocent, and so kind

63
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,466
But what if he's right about me?

64
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,300
Brother

65
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:30,900
Have you ever heard about

66
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,233
the story named Bodhisattva and the bad dog?

67
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,266
No

68
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:37,600
One day

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,500
Bodhisattva found a dog

70
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,500
He took the dog home

71
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:43,433
and feed it carefully

72
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,700
He thought the dog was very poor

73
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,800
so he showed great affection for it

74
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:48,900
Everytime the dog made mistakes

75
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,633
he just indulged his dog's bad behaviors

76
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,000
But Bodhisattva was not aware that

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,166
this dog was just born bad

78
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,833
The more he indulged

79
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:58,833
the more it wanted

80
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,800
Once the bad dog was grown up

81
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,200
it was thinking

82
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:03,700
there is always a good smell around Bodhisattva

83
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,200
What's that smell exactly?

84
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:07,300
Brother

85
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,966
Huh?

86
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:10,633
What did the bad dog do, guess?

87
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,233
I have no idea

88
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,633
It my first time to hear it

89
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:15,966
Of course, the more it thought, the more curious it became

90
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,233
Finally

91
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,233
the bad dog took advantage of Bodhisattva's inattention

92
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,700
and it ate his flesh

93
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:23,500
and drank his blood

94
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,033
The question that

95
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,166
"how could Bodhisattva's flesh be that tasty" consumed the bad dog

96
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,966
The bad dog couldn't control its' desire to the blood and flesh

97
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:33,466
Until one day

98
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:37,433
The bad dog pulled Bodhisattva down from the Lotus Throne

99
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,166
He was torn up and eaten up by the bad dog

100
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,066
That's the end

101
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,633
Did Bodhisattva notice that at the beginning?

102
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,500
He pretended to be unconscious, right?

103
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:55,066
I guess so

104
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:58,600
How could he have remained unconscious of it?

105
00:04:59,033 --> 00:04:59,766
Brother

106
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,466
You also think he did it on purpose, right?

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,066
Why did he pretend to be unconscious?

108
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,600
Why he didn't stop the bad dog?

109
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:13,966
He's also to blame

110
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:15,233
He should also be responsible for this matter, isn't he?

111
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,100
Where did you hear this story?

112
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:22,900
It's chaotic!

113
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:30,900
Bodhisattva, he is the one to blame

114
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Brother

115
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,100
Why do you like smoking?

116
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,300
Don't pick up this habit

117
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,900
I only smoke when I'm thinking about something

118
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:13,133
Brother

119
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:15,433
What are you thinking about now?

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,266
Brother, when I'm gone

121
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,033
will you miss me?

122
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,233
Why ask such a cheesy question?

123
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,666
Gimme another try

124
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:37,966
Do you mind if I miss you?

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,966
The bus is coming

126
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:47,466
I'm leaving now

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,600
Song Li

128
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,700
Which question was your pick just now?

129
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,466
Song Li

130
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,033
I miss you too

131
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,566
[Good morning]

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,666
[Want to see my brother]

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,233
[This coffee is pretty good]

134
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,600
[This coffee is pretty good]

135
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,700
[This coffee is pretty good]

136
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,633
[Yes]

137
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:14,566
[I will buy it for you in the future]

138
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:17,233
[Okay~]

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,900
[Studying]

140
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,233
[Brother, do you miss me? ]

141
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,566
[Of course, come back soon. ]

142
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:35,900
[I miss you too]

143
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:30,066
Your smile blooms like spring

144
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:31,266
Are you dating someone?

145
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:35,000
Hell freezes over!

146
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,900
Tell me,huh?

147
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,500
Stop gossiping！

148
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,366
What are you hiding for?

149
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,166
There's nothing under the sky I haven't witnessed

150
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm a man who walks among thorns

151
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
without being pricked

152
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,166
Let me weigh in on this

153
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,833
Back off

154
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,666
Hey, Song

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,566
Sister Hong

156
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,500
What's the matter?

157
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,966
I come to tell you that

158
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,966
I was requested to arrange a match for his daughter

159
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:06,633
An idea popped into my head-you are still single

160
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:07,633
Sister Hong

161
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:10,500
I'm not thinking along those lines right now

162
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,500
The girl is a nice person

163
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:15,066
Don't refuse yet—at least meet and talk first

164
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:17,833
I worte her numbers on the photo

165
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:18,966
Bye bye

166
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:21,266
Sister Hong

167
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,600
Song Qi

168
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,666
I have something important to tell you

169
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,833
but calm down first

170
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,100
Cut the crap

171
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,233
and get to the point

172
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,800
Brother Li will have a set-up with someone

173
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,166
Hello? Song Qi?

174
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,400
Song Qi?

175
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:53,833
How's the process going?

176
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,900
Have they met?

177
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,866
Not yet

178
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:58,033
He just received the photo a moment ago

179
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:20,733
Qi

180
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:21,400
Brother

181
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,566
I figured you'd just finished your shower by now

182
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,500
Let me see your face

183
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:30,500
OK. That's it

184
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:32,166
OK

185
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
You have such fair skin!

186
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,033
Have you been working out in secret?

187
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,366
You've got muscles

188
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,266
Brother, you've been working out these days

189
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,666
are you planning to get married?

190
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:03,633
I'm a man

191
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,900
I can't be a weakling

192
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,033
who can't lift a finger

193
