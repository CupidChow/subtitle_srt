1
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:15,566
Dude, you're playing like a noob today!

2
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,366
I'm about to lose a rank

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,200
Hey, wait, Wang

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,866
When did my brother leave today?

5
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:29,700
He left at 5:30

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,366
Anything wrong?

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,100
Fine, nothing

8
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:35,200
Go ahead with your work

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,633
OK

10
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:37,466
5:30...

11
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:41,700
As he usually does

12
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:42,900
he usually spends about

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,200
20 minutes shopping in the supermarket

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,000
So, maybe he has heard something

15
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:50,900
Go on by yourself

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,500
I'm leaving to deal with something

17
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:43,166
[30 minutes ago]

18
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:03,833
Song Li said

19
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,766
he will give me whatever I want

20
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,000
But all I want is him

21
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:09,866
I want to kiss him

22
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:12,700
Will Song Li give me that too?

23
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:17,366
I think I'm really going crazy

24
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,300
My brother got injured today

25
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,066
Those who hurt my brother were bad guys

26
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:25,266
So I burned his house down

27
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,066
I'm a bad guy too

28
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,900
But I wouldn't let my brother know that

29
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,966
I'm afraid he'll leave me

30
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,700
But I really want him to hold me

31
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,200
I want him to love me

32
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,000
Qi

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Is that you?

34
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:23,300
I forgot my towel

35
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,366
Can you grab it for me?

36
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:38,166
Song Li

37
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:40,233
Starting now, could you call me "brother" ?

38
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:41,500
You little rascal!

39
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,666
I'm your brother, and that's never changing!

40
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,800
Don't be ridiculous

41
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,566
Give it to me now

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Hmm?

43
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:52,033
If you don't call me that, I won't give it to you

44
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:55,300
Stop teasing me!

45
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,166
Just give it to me

46
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,066
Brother

47
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:59,066
I've called you "brother" thousands

48
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:00,966
Just call me once, please

49
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:02,966
You

50
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:04,266
Please, brother

51
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:05,400
Just once

52
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:13,766
Bro...ther

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
Can I possess you all to myself,my brother?

54
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,033
I'll sleep with my brother

55
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:00,666
Good night

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,800
Night

57
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,233
How could you look at it?

58
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Shouldn't you be looking at me?

59
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
You didn't fall asleep?

60
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,766
People say that studying law is very stressful

61
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,500
I thought you had already fallen asleep

62
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,600
It does stress me out

63
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,300
Do you have any good ideas to relieve stress?

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,866
How could I have such a method?

65
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,366
Seriously?

66
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:27,400
Alright

67
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,066
Behave yourself

68
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,400
Don't treat me like a kid

69
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,166
Would you like to buy some flowers, ma'am?

70
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,300
No,thanks

71
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,000
Would you like to buy some flowers, sir?

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,400
You can give them to your girlfriend

73
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:51,866
I don't have a girlfriend

74
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,166
Fine

75
00:06:58,966 --> 00:06:59,533
Little gir

76
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:02,200
How many should I buy for someone I like?

77
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,900
Seven

78
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,666
It means "secretly loving you"

79
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,233
OK

80
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:08,500
Then I'll take seven

81
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:09,433
OK

82
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,066
The answer is C

83
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,333
It's right

84
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,000
Our Qi is really amazing

85
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:38,433
Ta-da! These are for you, brother

86
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,233
Isn't it weird to give roses to an adult man?

87
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:44,666
That's odd

88
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,066
I happened to see a girl selling flowers

89
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:46,900
so I bought them  on a whim

90
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:49,233
To thank you for taking care of me all these years

91
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:01,766
Smells good, right?

92
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:02,600
I made it

93
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,633
Very good

94
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,900
Our Qi even learned how to cook

95
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,700
Here you are

96
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:11,600
How did you get hurt?

97
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,400
You need to be careful when you're cooking

98
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,500
Do not hurt yourself

99
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:15,600
Nothing

100
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,233
You've been taken care of me for all these years

101
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:19,300
Now it's time for me to take care of you instead

102
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:29,266
I can do it myself

103
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:35,033
Wow,it's really tasty

104
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:36,033
Have some too

105
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,666
It has varieties of vitamins

106
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,966
Brother

107
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:38,666
Yes

108
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,300
You will not see me off tomorrow, really?

109
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:42,833
Tomorrow

110
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,233
I have something important to deal with

111
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:46,366
Or I'll definitely go

112
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:00,266
Brother

113
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:00,833
Um?

114
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,900
Have you ever thought about getting married?

115
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,766
I can't make time for that right now

116
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,000
I just wish you can graduate successfully

117
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,566
and find a good job

118
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,166
Then, I can be admitted by the college

119
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:14,766
That's all

120
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Look

121
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,900
Brother

122
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:27,000
A gift for you

123
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,266
How could you afford that?

124
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,866
Did you tighten your belt to save the money?

125
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,266
I told you

126
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,033
don't deprive yourself of your daily life

127
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,600
My phone can still work

128
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,700
The new one I won't accept it

129
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:41,366
Just take it back

130
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,266
I bought it with my scholarship money

131
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,000
And yours is too old

132
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:48,800
The camera has poor resolution for videos and photos

133
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,033
This phone has a high-megapixel camera

134
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,966
I can have video chats with you everyday

135
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:53,766
Come

136
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:00,866
See

137
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,000
Fine

138
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,000
You give this phone to me as a gift

139
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,000
I will give you one as well

140
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,800
What do you want?

141
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,400
Brother

142
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,033
Can I save it up?

143
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,166
Like,accumulate all my future gifts into one

144
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,100
Just one

145
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:18,966
Combine them all into a single wish

146
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,466
Brother,say yes, please

147
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,100
Little smarty, you brain never stops

148
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:24,766
OK

149
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:25,966
You have my word

150
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:27,833
Really?

151
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:28,666
Yes

152
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,500
Pinky promise

153
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
