1
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:28,066
What's wrong？

2
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,900
Burn it!

3
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,100
Hey

4
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,766
Hey

5
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:49,900
You came to the Chen's house from your school

6
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,966
just to set this house on fire?

7
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:51,733
You need to know

8
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,900
you are a good boy in your briother's eyes

9
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,300
Don't you feel afraid that your brother will know it?

10
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,900
I do feel afraid！

11
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,066
But the bad guys around him

12
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,500
they deserve the punishment

13
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,666
And the pains he suffers

14
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:02,533
he just endured them

15
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,266
without even saying a word

16
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,966
He always remains gentle like a lamb

17
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:08,366
I'll do what he cannot do for him

18
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,500
Hey

19
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:12,300
You'd do anything for your brother

20
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,000
You don't care about any other

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,033
except him in this world,do you?

22
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,700
This is illegal

23
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:18,133
Just keep your eyes open

24
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,466
Bark loudly to remind me,if someone returns

25
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,300
You're no better than a mad dog!

26
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,233
Those who bully my elder brother

27
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,233
should pay the price

28
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,900
I have warned you for times

29
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:28,900
Do not crawl like a dog and beg

30
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,333
for the construction payment everytime I get home

31
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:32,566
One might mistake

32
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:34,766
your abject humiliation for a son's mourning

33
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,700
Are you eager to take me as your sugar daddy?

34
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:38,033
A debt must be repaid

35
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,866
it's natural

36
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:50,500
In this world, the greatest truth is

37
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:53,733
people without means will never gain wealth

38
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,533
I won't give you a dime even if I have money

39
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,133
I'll make sure you can't earn a cent

40
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,633
What are you gonna do about it?

41
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,466
Next time you dare to come

42
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:08,733
remember to calculate

43
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,466
whether your life is strong enough in advance

44
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,300
I can't disturb my brother's sleep

45
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:28,333
My dear brother

46
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:29,966
I got back at them for you

47
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:31,866
Nobody can bully you

48
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,466
If my brother knew

49
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,133
would he abandon me?

50
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,133
Qi

51
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,733
Why were you sleeping here?

52
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:56,500
Are you feeling cold?

53
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:00,200
Brother

54
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,633
Are you in pain?

55
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,266
You are still concerned about me?

56
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:08,700
Why not come in?

57
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,866
You slept here for the whole night

58
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:11,366
Are you going to freeze yourself to death?

59
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,300
I was afraid of waking you up

60
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,300
I'm back here now

61
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,633
Are you happy?

62
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:20,833
I am so happy

63
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,466
I'm certainly happy

64
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,666
that you're back

65
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:25,533
Enough

66
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:26,733
Let's continue indoors

67
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:27,833
Hurry up

68
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:30,566
Take care

69
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:32,566
Qi

70
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:41,433
Brother

71
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,366
I 'm freezing

72
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,700
OK

73
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,933
Let's go inside

74
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,100
Come with me

75
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,100
Thirsty

76
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,066
Brother

77
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,533
Even if I mess everything up

78
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,133
you won't leave me alone

79
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:35,633
Right?

80
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,333
You're talking nonsense!

81
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,066
I'll never leave you alone

82
00:09:59,366 --> 00:09:59,933
Done

83
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:00,733
Thank you

84
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:12,433
Brother

85
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,300
Did you know?

86
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:17,033
Everytime...you smiled at others

87
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,666
but also at me

88
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,866
I was thinking

89
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:21,400
is there anything that's uniquely ours

90
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,033
something you can only do to me

91
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,266
and I only to you?

92
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:26,900
So?

93
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:29,366
Did you find it?

94
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:31,766
Not yet

95
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:32,633
I'm still searching

96
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,633
If there is one

97
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,166
can you help me achieve it?

98
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,500
Brother

99
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,300
Everytime I come back

100
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,133
I feel like the time with you flies too fast

101
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,533
If only I could be with you 24 hours a day

102
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:56,766
Well

103
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:58,433
let it be

104
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,900
24 hours

105
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:04,900
Seriously?

106
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,133
Yes

107
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,166
I'm on it

108
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:30,266
Welcome to...

109
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,500
My house was burned by somebody last night

110
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,833
Who did it? You son of bitch!

111
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,166
Ah? Don Chen

112
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,500
Your house...was burned?

113
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,233
You such a weenie

114
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:49,433
You don't have that nerve

115
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm looking for your damn younger brother

116
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,300
Not you!

117
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,266
I heard that he has come back

118
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:55,333
Where has he gone?

119
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:58,833
He wouldn't do such a thing

120
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,133
Besides, he is not here now

121
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,266
Leave him alone

122
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:08,500
Take it out on me

123
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,333
Enough with the fucking act already!

124
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,033
Put him out here today,or else

125
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:13,733
you'll find your gaming café  in ruins tomorrow

126
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,033
How dare you fucking touch my brother!

127
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:24,433
Qi

128
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:29,833
Chen Qing

129
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,033
I will dig a hole in your neck,want to have a try,ah?

130
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,266
OK

131
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:35,100
I won't hurt him

132
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,566
Calm down

133
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:38,233
Qi

134
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:39,566
Let me handle this

135
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,166
Set him free first

136
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,433
Fuck off

137
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:53,333
with your accomplices
