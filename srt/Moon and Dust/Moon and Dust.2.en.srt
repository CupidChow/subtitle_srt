1
00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:03,033
Fuck off！

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,000
Song Qi

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,400
I'll cut you some slack this time

4
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:08,566
But I've got you in my sights

5
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:09,466
Let's go

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:20,766
Brother!

7
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:21,933
Are you alright?

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,066
Is that hurt?

9
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,000
That's OK

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,100
As a man

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,833
that's nothing

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,900
It's OK

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,766
Let me do that

14
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:36,200
It's your birthday today

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,833
take a break

16
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,133
I'll clean up

17
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,900
I totally forgot about it  until you mentioned it

18
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:44,366
Oh dear Qi

19
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:46,200
you came back especially for celebrating my birthday

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,166
aren't you?

21
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,033
Absolutely!

22
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:49,033
Brother

23
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:50,633
tell me  your birthday wish!

24
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:54,033
What birthday wish could you have?

25
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:58,633
I wish that you can study harder

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
graduate successfully

27
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,466
and find a good job

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,800
If only we could get the construction payment back

29
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,666
the workers' sacrifice wouldn't be a waste

30
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,266
I'm too weak to help

31
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:14,966
Brother

32
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:17,433
Violence is the only way to fight with Chen Qing

33
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,933
You're way too nice

34
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:20,333
to deal with something like this!

35
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:21,933
Don't worry

36
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,700
I'll take care of it

37
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:28,800
Qi, your situation concerns me more

38
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:31,233
It feels like just yesterday

39
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:33,733
you're not a little kid anymore!

40
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,133
You can even protect me now

41
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,800
Nooo, don't hit my brother!

42
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:41,900
Don't hit my brother

43
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,200
Stop it!

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,466
I hit you!

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,733
You two are getting along so well!

46
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,900
Fuck off or you'll get the same!

47
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,833
Brother!

48
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,466
The bitch,where has she gone?

49
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,833
This brat disgusts me

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Do you remember?

51
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,533
When we were young,once he hit us

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,266
I shielded you in my arms

53
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,233
I'd already been a grown-up man for long

54
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:19,733
I'll try my best to protect you,my brother

55
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,800
I'll keep you safe

56
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,000
No one can hurt you while I'm here

57
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:24,600
Those who bully you,my brother

58
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,800
I'll devote my life to teach them a lesson

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,200
OK

60
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,700
I see

61
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,400
Damn it

62
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,133
Who the fuck are you?

63
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,100
Give me the construction payment

64
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:26,333
Or I'll certainly stab through your neck

65
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,400
The money, now!

66
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,200
You are just a lunatic

67
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,033
.A psycho!

68
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,266
I am a psycho!

69
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,266
I'm willing to spare no effort to help him

70
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Get a clue!Give the payment to me

71
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:40,533
Easy now!

72
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,033
Don't press it too hard！

73
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,733
Take it!

74
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:46,833
The code is 465384

75
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,066
Don't bother my elder brother anymore

76
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,466
Brother,see

77
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,400
your birthday wish comes true

78
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,600
Here is the construction payment.

79
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:28,866
You went to Chen Qing?

80
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:30,533
That guy

81
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:31,766
How on earth could you go to him?

82
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,233
Brother

83
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:34,866
Brother

84
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,700
I cut myself by mistake

85
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:45,100
Noting,it will heal soon

86
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:49,400
Follow me

87
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,233
Your fingers are so pretty

88
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,333
Stop talking nonsense

89
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,666
Don't do such dangerous things in the future

90
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,700
I can handle my own affairs

91
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,500
you don't have to worry about me

92
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,033
What will I do in the future

93
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,466
if I leave such a deep scar?

94
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,466
You don't even know how to take better care of yourself

95
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,933
Do you hear me?

96
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,600
Well

97
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:12,200
Brother

98
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,633
Everytime when you show your concern for me

99
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:19,233
I thought I was the happiest person on earth

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,800
Brother

101
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,766
Promise you'll let me do whatever I want from now on

102
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:24,400
Indulge me and don't stop me

103
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,633
I'm looking for your damn younger brother

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,533
How dare you fucking touch my brother!

105
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:05,933
Qi

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,166
Chen Qing

107
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,400
I will dig a hole in your neck,want to have a try,ah?

108
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,400
Happy birthday to you

109
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,100
Happy birthday,my brother

110
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,866
Brother

111
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:51,900
I bought the cake

112
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,100
Try some?

113
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,900
Brother

114
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:04,300
Just take a glance at it,ah?

115
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,233
Just once

116
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:08,466
I spent hours picking out this cake!

117
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:24,866
Brother

118
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,633
I'm wrong

119
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:28,266
I didn't consider your feelings

120
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:29,733
Brother

121
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:38,400
It's all my fault

122
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:39,533
I'm sorry

123
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,266
Oh no, you are burned

124
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:42,633
I'll go and get some ointment

125
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:44,800
Brother

126
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,500
brother

127
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,700
Don't leave me

128
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,733
It's my fault

129
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:49,433
Brother

130
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:57,066
Brother

131
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,266
What's the taste of the cigarette?

132
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,666
It calms you down,right?

133
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,900
It's no good..

134
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,733
Keep your hands clean

135
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,133
Qi

136
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:40,866
Brother

137
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,866
Don't do things that dangerous anymore

138
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:49,066
promise me, OK?

139
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,900
I adopted you and

140
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,066
loved you like a real younger brother

141
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,133
If anything bad happens to you

142
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,800
How could I survive the life without you?

143
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:06,133
I hope that you'd better grow up to be someone amazing

144
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,133
rather than struggle for my sake

145
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:13,633
Do you know?

146
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,333
Qi

147
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,300
You shall study hard

148
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:24,633
Here is not where you belong

149
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
There's a whole world out there to explore

150
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,166
I'm not worth you destroying yourself over

151
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,033
I knew

152
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,333
I knew all the time

153
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,066
I knew, brother

154
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,866
you are the one who concerned me more than I am

155
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,100
I swear

156
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,933
I swear

157
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:47,233
from now on,I would be obedient

158
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:04,333
brother

159
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,066
Don't do things dangerous like that never ever

160
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,833
Alright!

161
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:13,533
Brother

162
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,033
Let's eat the cake, shall we?

163
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:18,600
OK

164
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:20,066
OK

165
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,400
Brother,make a wish now

166
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:37,233
Birthday wishes always come true

167
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:49,400
I wish our Qi won't get hurt anymore

168
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,666
and can grow up healthy and happy

169
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:01,900
Brother

170
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Happy birthday!

171
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,666
Brother

172
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,066
you're studying

173
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:24,633
for  what?

174
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,066
I registered Adult Gaokao

175
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:31,133
I want to make progress with you together

176
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,066
OK

177
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:32,733
It's late at night

178
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:34,133
Go to bed and sleep now

179
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,733
Hurry, hurry

180
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:43,066
I want to sleep with you tonight

181
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,300
How can you be an adult

182
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,400
and still sleep with your brother?

183
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,066
My heart says yes

184
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:53,100
You've held me every night since I was a kid

185
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,500
And I want to sleep with you all my life

186
