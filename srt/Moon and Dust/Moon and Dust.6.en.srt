1
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,566
Why not go inside?

2
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,000
You're back here

3
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,300
Ugh

4
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,366
My father had an affair

5
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:29,433
He brought me a younger brother back

6
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,800
There's constant arguing in my family

7
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,733
So I'm hiding outside

8
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:35,800
Now, you're back

9
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:37,733
Can you put me up for few days?

10
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:39,166
Dream on!

11
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,400
Trying to run away from home?

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,600
Brother, I'm back

13
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,500
I won the national scholarship

14
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,500
Our Qi is amazing

15
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,766
It's time to have a celebration today

16
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:53,933
Count me in

17
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,300
So do I

18
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:57,100
OK, you all come

19
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:00,733
Let's go

20
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:05,233
Cheers

21
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:27,966
Stop

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,766
Come on, I'll drink with you

23
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:31,633
Come on

24
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:42,666
Brother

25
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,333
You're drunk. Stop drinking

26
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,766
Ugh, my life is so miserable

27
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,500
Not allowed to drink

28
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,233
Not allowed to go home

29
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,533
Inexplicably, I had a younger brother

30
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,900
My home is in chaos

31
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:58,500
Song Qi, you're so lucky

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,166
Your brother loves you so much

33
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,533
And you have a happy family

34
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,366
Who told you that it is bad to have a younger brother?

35
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:04,900
It's good to have a younger brother

36
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,900
Look, how outstanding our Qi is

37
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,966
Who?

38
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:09,933
Who said that?

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,100
Having a younger brother is good.Nonsense!

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,966
It is good. Really good

41
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:14,766
Take him home

42
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:15,700
Let's go

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,700
No, I don't wanna go

44
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:17,966
Don't touch me

45
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:18,566
Enough. Let's go

46
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,166
I'm not going home

47
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,333
I'm destined to be this bad dog

48
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:53,700
Here you are

49
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,500
Thanks

50
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
I was surprised when Sister Hong told me

51
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,000
that you asked me out

52
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,366
One should always keep moving forward in life

53
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:17,433
It's time for me to get married and settle down

54
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,033
It's getting late

55
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:26,166
I should go back now

56
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,566
OK. Bye bye

57
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:28,500
Bye bye

58
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:30,466
Bye bye

59
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:31,100
Bye bye

60
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:42,700
Who are you?

61
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:44,566
Take my advice-just give up on him already

62
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:45,766
Stay away from him

63
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:46,566
Do you hear me?

64
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:48,033
You don't deserve him at all

65
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,600
and he would never like you

66
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,933
Qi, you are back

67
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:04,333
I'm cooking

68
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,366
Wait a minute

69
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,633
What do you want to do?

70
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,500
Qi, let go of me

71
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,866
Hit me

72
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:45,900
Hit me to death

73
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,900
Brother

74
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,700
You kissed me yesterday

75
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,933
But today, you're dating with someone else

76
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,900
It is you who said you didn't want to get married

77
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:56,200
Why are you doing this to me?

78
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:02,933
Why?

79
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:08,800
You're leaving me behind, right?

80
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,133
Brother

81
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:10,933
Qi

82
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm begging you

83
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:15,500
This is wrong

84
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:16,766
It's my fault

85
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,333
I didn't raise you properly

86
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:19,933
It's all my fault

87
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,800
But you can't keep making the same mistake over and over again

88
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:39,266
Yes

89
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,900
Song Li

90
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,100
It's all your fault

91
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,633
You've seen all this, haven't you?

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
And

93
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,200
you've heard the words I said to Qi Yan, haven't you?

94
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,433
You know I love you

95
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:56,533
Song Li

96
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,133
When we was young

97
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,533
you knew it's me who pushed my foster father, didn't you?

98
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,566
But you didn't say a word

99
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,133
Song Li

100
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,233
It's you who have indulged me all along

101
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,800
It's you who have been trusting me all along

102
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,100
It's you who have been teaching me to be this way

103
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:18,333
It's you who have failed to guide me right

104
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,966
Please, I'm begging you, dad

105
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,766
Take my brother to the hospital

106
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,000
Or he'll die

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,400
Please

108
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,766
An ungrateful wretch

109
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:32,300
How dare you steal my money?

110
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,766
I'll beat you to death!

111
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:08,533
I wanna get treatment for him, that's all

112
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:34,833
Brother, I love you

113
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,400
Qi

114
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,533
I

115
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:56,366
Song Li

116
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:01,833
You definitely kissed me last night

117
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:05,200
You love me, don't you?

118
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,333
Enough!

119
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:13,166
That's not the case

120
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,900
Stop talking nonsense

121
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,266
Brother

122
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,900
I was drunk that night

123
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,666
and I was unconscious

124
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,433
You are my brother

125
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:24,000
How could I kiss you?

126
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:25,633
It's impossible

127
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:27,033
Impossible

128
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:33,000
Qi, listen to me

129
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,933
Restrain yourself

130
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:37,766
Leave yourself some time

131
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:39,600
And leave me some time, too

132
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,400
Brother

133
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,500
Please, don't leave

134
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:43,966
I am wrong

135
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,433
If you want to get married

136
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:48,633
then I can be your wife

137
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,633
We have lived together for long

138
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:51,666
I truly get you

139
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:54,233
Let me take care of you, okay?

140
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:55,200
Brother

141
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,933
I will definitely make a good wife!

142
00:11:58,633 --> 00:11:59,266
Brother

143
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:00,533
Song Qi

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,300
You're insane

145
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,200
I'm insane

146
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,433
Brother

147
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,533
Two men can be together too

148
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:20,000
Brother

149
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,366
We can make it, brother

150
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,366
Brother, that's OK

151
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,100
Brother

152
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,433
Enough! Enough!

153
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:27,033
Get out!

154
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:28,933
Get out of here!

155
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:30,966
Brother

156
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:34,333
I am wrong

157
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:35,366
You hit me

158
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:36,833
Hit me, hit me now

159
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,633
As long as you can forgive me

160
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,233
Hit me as you wish

161
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,733
How could I have taught you to be this way?

162
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,633
I don't know what to do, brother

163
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't know what I should do, brother

164
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:03,033
I really don't know what to do

165
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,300
I'm afraid of you knowing my feelings for you

166
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,933
But I'm also afraid of you not knowing my feelings for you

167
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,366
We're merely  brothers for a lifetime

168
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,333
Brother

169
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:19,333
Tell me

170
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,833
What should I do?

171
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:31,966
Qi

172
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:35,233
Go back to school now and stay there for some time

173
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,900
No, no

174
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,733
Brother, brother

175
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,300
Don't leave me alone

176
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:46,500
Brother

177
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,300
I'm not going anywhere

178
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,633
Brother

179
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:56,433
Brother

180
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:57,566
Brother

181
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:58,800
Let me in

182
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,600
Brother

183
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:01,400
I am wrong

184
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,766
I know I am wrong
