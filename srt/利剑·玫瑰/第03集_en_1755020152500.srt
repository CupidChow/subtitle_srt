00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,120
Take this.

4
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,840
Please extend my rent
for a few more days.

5
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,400
I'm trying...

6
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,040
Madam Zhang.

7
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,350
When will you ever pay up

8
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,390
at this rate?

9
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,360
My family needs the money.

10
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,520
I...

11
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,040
- Just a few more days.
- But...

12
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Yes.

13
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,640
I need to feed my family.

14
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,480
Madam Zhang...

15
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:54,950
How much more does she owe?

16
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,190
2000 yuan.

17
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,400
Here's 500 yuan.

18
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,400
Here's 1500 yuan.

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,120
That's enough, right?

20
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,710
Yes.

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,920
Okay, Madam Zhang.

22
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,240
So, please remember

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,790
to pay your rent earlier

24
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,680
to make everyone's lives easier, okay?

25
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,550
Sure.

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,200
I'm off, then.

27
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,680
Sure.

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,670
Enjoy your day.

29
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,150
Okay.

30
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,150
Thank you so much.

31
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,990
Qian.

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,950
Lawyer Sun.

33
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,680
I'm so sorry about this.

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,520
I...

35
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,830
It's a loan, okay?

36
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,800
As soon as I have the money,

37
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,470
I'll pay you back at once.

38
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:33,960
It's okay,

39
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,800
Madam Zhang.

40
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,880
I dine here often, after all.

41
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,320
If you feel bad about it,

42
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,680
think of it as

43
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,520
my rent

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,230
for working here.

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,550
You, working here?

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,760
This shabby eatery

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,440
isn't good enough for a lawyer like you.

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,510
I love the hustle

49
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,590
and bustle here.

50
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,640
By the way, Madam Zhang...

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,440
This girl here

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,760
is Luo Xiaoxing.

53
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,200
She's come to Linshan
to look for her brother,

54
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,240
and she's been

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,230
asking for help on the streets.

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,640
She hasn't had any food.

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,070
Do you think

58
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,320
you can hire her

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,830
and provide her

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,950
with a place to stay?

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,320
Madam Zhang.

62
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,880
Xiaoxing.

63
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,710
Hello, Madam Zhang.

64
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,120
Poor girl.

65
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,830
It must be tough for a girl like you
to be on the streets.

66
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,360
Why don't you

67
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,950
stay at my place?

68
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,640
You see,

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,960
everyone here

70
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,040
can be your family.

71
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,990
- Okay?
- Yeah.

72
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,000
Thank you, Madam Zhang.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,990
Get up.

74
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,710
Thank you!

75
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,270
This is my brother, Luo Xiaoyu.

76
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,360
I've been searching
for him for 15 years.

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,270
As long as I can find him,

78
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,950
I'll do whatever it takes.

79
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,590
Thank you.

80
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,150
There, there.

81
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,160
It's okay, Xiaoxing.

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
Look

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,380
at this wall.

84
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,260
(Missing)
All of them

85
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,670
are experiencing the same thing.

86
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,950
Don't worry.

87
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,150
We'll help you.

88
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,590
Lawyer Sun.

89
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,350
Leave her to me.

90
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,760
Rest assured.

91
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,710
Okay?

92
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,240
Don't cry.

93
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,400
Here.

94
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,670
Don't cry.

95
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,620
(June 25, 2009, Gambling Den
at the Outskirts of Linshan City)

96
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,350
Where's Zhao Dafeng?

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,270
What are you doing, Xie?

98
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,710
Where is he?

99
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,350
I don't know.

100
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,880
Untie me.

101
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,150
Where's Zhao Dafeng?

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I really don't know, Xie.

103
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,470
I really don't know.

104
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,590
What did Zhao Dafeng do?

105
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,200
He ran off with my money!

106
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:51,480
He promised me some goods,

107
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,160
and I found a buyer,
but now he's missing!

108
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,311
The buyer wants the goods now!

109
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:55,390
What am I supposed to give?

110
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,560
Listen,

111
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,150
if I can't find him,

112
00:05:58,177 --> 00:05:59,644
and I get ruined because of this,

113
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,830
everyone will be ruined too!

114
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,560
Fine.

115
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,640
Fine.

116
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,070
I have goods!

117
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,120
Xie, I have goods!

118
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
Xie, I have goods.

119
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,590
Xie, I do have goods.

120
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,440
Xie.

121
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,960
Xie...

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
They're young and pretty.

123
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:33,822
The goods are young and pretty.

124
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,000
Don't try to fool me.

125
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,800
My phone...

126
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
My phone's in my pocket.

127
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,240
Here.

128
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Xie.

129
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,880
Turn left.

130
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
Mr. Li.

131
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,120
Buddy.

132
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,440
What's up with you?

133
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,270
I haven't heard from you for days.

134
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,710
Relax, I've got the goods.

135
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,080
Top-notch, guaranteed.

136
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm on my way to pick them up now.

137
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,240
The price is the same, as discussed.

138
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,760
Okay, then.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,390
It's a fair deal.

140
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,270
Okay,

141
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,830
I'll send the goods to the usual spot.

142
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,480
Sure.

143
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,440
Talk to you later.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,720
Hurry up.

145
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,777
Check where he is now.

146
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,060
(Linshan PGIS Application Platform)

147
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,200
They're heading south.

148
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,000
Head out immediately.

149
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,880
How much are you planning to sell?

150
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,244
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

151
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,600
Where is it?

152
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,360
Are you fooling me?

153
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,150
No.

154
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,600
We're almost there. Head straight.

155
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,040
Almost there.

156
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,150
How much longer?

157
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,040
Rui's car is still moving.

158
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,400
He's 5 km away from us.

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,510
Yan Lei.

160
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,950
Drive faster, but keep safe.

161
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
Sure.

162
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,910
They're inside?

163
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,750
Yes.

164
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,460
(Unknown Number: Keep your goods
away from Xie, he's bogus.)

165
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,230
Where's the goods?

166
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,720
What's this?

167
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,560
Doing dirty on me?

168
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,750
Stop!

169
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,710
Police!

170
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,080
Arrest him.

171
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,440
Where are the girls?

172
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,560
What girl?

173
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,280
Keep an eye on him.

174
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,230
Xie,

175
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,200
you fooled me?

176
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,800
Keep an eye on him.

177
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,200
Are you sure those girls are here?

178
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,630
I think they are.

179
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,910
Everything seemed normal

180
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,911
since we arrived here,

181
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,030
until he suddenly

182
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,080
snatched my bag and ran off

183
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,870
for no apparent reason,

184
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:32,400
and then you guys arrived.

185
00:10:33,577 --> 00:10:34,555
Split and search.

186
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:35,230
Okay.

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,510
Turn around!

188
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,470
Don't be funny!

189
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,240
Go away!

190
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,200
Prepare for sedation!

191
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,750
Go!

192
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,710
Don't touch me!

193
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,920
Don't touch me!

194
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,870
Please, don't touch me!

195
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,470
Let them go!

196
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,440
No!

197
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,320
Don't touch me!

198
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,910
Sedate her!

199
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,550
Go away!

200
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,240
Zhou Min.

201
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,220
Zhou Min, she is a doctor.

202
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:19,910
Don't be afraid.

203
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,750
Don't touch me!

204
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,000
Don't touch me!

205
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,960
Calm down.

206
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,720
Are you her family?

207
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,080
I'm not.

208
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,577
Don't touch me!

209
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,750
Her family is on the way here.

210
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,360
Don't touch me!

211
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,680
We need to proceed with treatment.

212
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,600
Please leave the room.

213
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,222
I know, but she's in
a state of fear now.

214
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,030
Zhou Min.

215
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:31,769
Zhou Min.

216
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,279
- Get someone to help!
- They're doctors.

217
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,200
Don't be afraid. We're
in a hospital now, okay?

218
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,230
Help me!

219
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,830
Let go of me first.

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,750
Let go of me,

221
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,533
so that the doctor
can examine you, okay?

222
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:41,400
Don't go!

223
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,040
Don't be afraid.

224
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,320
Help me!

225
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,720
Help me!

226
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,510
Be gentle.

227
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,790
Be gentle. She's hurt.

228
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,390
Be gentle.

229
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,200
Don't go!

230
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,040
It's a trauma attack.

231
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,150
We need to deal with it now.

232
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:52,200
Please leave the room now!

233
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:52,990
Okay.

234
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:54,910
Please leave the room now!

235
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,390
Okay.

236
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,200
Be gentle on her.

237
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,150
She's injured.

238
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,110
Don't touch me!

239
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,230
Don't touch me!

240
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,630
Don't touch me!

241
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,270
Save me!

242
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,200
Take me away!

243
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,390
(Don't touch me!)

244
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,320
(Take me away!)

245
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,660
(Hospital)
(Keep Quiet)

246
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,960
Director,

247
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,960
you should go back.

248
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,870
I'll stand guard here.

249
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,590
Okay.

250
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,350
Call me when she wakes up.

251
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,560
Don't worry.

252
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,320
How is she?

253
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,990
She's still unconscious.

254
00:13:36,777 --> 00:13:38,520
Did the doctor say when she'll wake up?

255
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:40,590
They didn't give us a specific time,

256
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,466
so let's go back and
interrogate Whiteboard.

257
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:44,920
If we don't get anything
out of Zhou Min,

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,222
given the slickster he is,
Whiteboard won't say a word.

259
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:48,709
Zheng Weiwei hasn't been found yet.

260
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,666
The longer this drags on,
the more dangerous it is.

261
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,750
How can we interrogate her

262
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,230
when she's still in a coma?

263
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
Besides, she's mentally fragile now.

264
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,910
We should focus on

265
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,066
interrogating Whiteboard now.

266
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,870
Zhou Min.

267
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,440
You kidnapped her a month ago,

268
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,444
and then hid her in a house
at the city outskirts,

269
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,888
which you led us to, ironically.

270
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,470
She's my girlfriend.

271
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,840
Your girlfriend?

272
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,560
You keep your girlfriend

273
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,080
locked inside a house?

274
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,622
You've never had a girlfriend, huh?

275
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,120
You need to keep things
thrilling, you know.

276
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,870
She's been a naughty girl,
so she needs to be punished.

277
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:35,320
Enough with the nonsense.

278
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:38,222
If what you said was true,
why did you lead Xie there?

279
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,320
That's a good question.

280
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:42,480
He's your buddy,

281
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,830
so you should ask him.

282
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,510
Hey, are you a rookie cop?

283
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,510
Cut the crap.

284
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,990
We have gathered sufficient
evidence of your crimes.

285
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,670
If you come clean now

286
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,920
and reveal your accomplices,

287
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,440
you may have a chance
to lessen your sentence.

288
00:14:58,466 --> 00:15:01,040
Why don't you just bring her here
so she can corroborate my story?

289
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:03,270
You were the one who kidnapped Zhou Min.

290
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,511
What more evidence do you need?

291
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,840
Bai Wentao,

292
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,470
you can't get away with this.

293
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,320
Xie.

294
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,830
What's your real name?

295
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,280
What does it have to do with you?

296
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,390
We're now...

297
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,280
Whiteboard.

298
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,800
We're no longer kids.

299
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:31,533
Leaving this room won't be as easy

300
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,630
as how you entered.

301
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:34,960
The evidence you're demanding to see

302
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,280
will come in time.

303
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:37,750
Zhou Min is in the hospital now.

304
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:39,955
Once she wakes up, she will
identify you as her abductor.

305
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:40,990
You won't get away with it.

306
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,950
Do you know who I used to be?

307
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,630
No.

308
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,666
I used to be in the drug busting unit.

309
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,470
All the cases I handled

310
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,280
were major crimes at the highest levels.

311
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:09,400
I had to face real criminals,
lawless fugitives,

312
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,520
unlike petty crooks like you.

313
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,990
Seriously?

314
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,040
Of course.

315
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,030
So, let's not waste any more time.

316
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,280
Of course, we have the evidence.

317
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,600
Just tell us what you did.

318
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,520
You did something, so admit it.
Be a man.

319
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,750
So, again,

320
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,920
who else was involved?

321
00:16:25,977 --> 00:16:27,555
And have you kidnapped anyone else?

322
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,800
No.

323
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,320
Do you know her?

324
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,000
Fafa.

325
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,840
My daughter.

326
00:16:57,044 --> 00:16:58,120
You're her real father?

327
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,230
Absolutely real.

328
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,840
Stop fooling me.

329
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,680
I'm not.

330
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,560
A simple DNA test would tell.

331
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,550
She...

332
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,920
Fine, she's adopted.

333
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,190
I adopted her.

334
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,520
Legally adopted?

335
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,870
No.

336
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,720
You may not know this,

337
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,520
but where I come from,

338
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,160
there are many baby girls
abandoned at birth,

339
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,560
left on the streets just like that.

340
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,110
I happened to see her there.

341
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,270
She was such a cute baby,

342
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,190
so I took her in.

343
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,070
(Of course,)

344
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:26,960
(I know)

345
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,240
(that to adopt a child,)

346
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,510
I need to be married

347
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,800
and financially stable.

348
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,040
Me?

349
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,350
I'm neither of those.

350
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,160
That's why I adopted her

351
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,240
without any legal papers.

352
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,790
But I see her as my own...

353
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,630
Liar.

354
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,510
I'm not lying.

355
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,350
Go on, liar.

356
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:43,800
I'm not lying, really.

357
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,320
Where,

358
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,280
and when?

359
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,150
Back where I'm from.

360
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,630
It was...

361
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,520
2002.

362
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,190
During winter,

363
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,430
around November.

364
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,430
Bai Wentao,

365
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,670
do you actually believe your own lies?

366
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,550
I'm not lying.

367
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,790
This girl's name is Qiu Luoluo,

368
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,630
not Fafa.

369
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,040
You kidnapped her.

370
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,800
Qiu Luoluo?

371
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,800
That's a nice name.

372
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,830
I'm giving you your final chance.

373
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,080
Who else have you kidnapped?

374
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,150
Just her.

375
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,320
We've been taking care of Little Spud
since he was born.

376
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,560
We made sure no harm came to him,
not even a bruise.

377
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,670
He was safe with us.

378
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,280
But as soon as the other
grandmother offered to babysit,

379
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,960
he's gone!

380
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,790
That's not a fair statement!

381
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,520
Exactly.

382
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,270
That's too hurtful.

383
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,555
Besides, it was an accident.

384
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:55,640
An old woman suddenly
collapsed on the streets.

385
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,550
You expect my sister
to walk away like that?

386
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,129
Yes, it was right for her to help,

387
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,830
but she shouldn't have
left the baby alone!

388
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,390
You think she wanted that?

389
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,870
Why didn't she look after the baby?

390
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,590
How could you blame us?

391
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,190
No one wanted this!

392
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:11,480
You can't just...

393
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,630
Are you here to help?

394
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,080
If not, leave!

395
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,150
Look at yourselves!

396
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,640
You made her leave!

397
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,670
We? We're just...

398
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,190
That's enough.

399
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,111
What good does arguing bring?

400
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,070
You might as well

401
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,200
find a way to find the baby.

402
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,780
(Baby Missing)

403
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:48,980
(Baby Missing)

404
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,100
(Anti-abduction Office)

405
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,280
How's the interrogation?

406
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,720
Whiteboard is a tough nut to crack.

407
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,240
He spent the whole night

408
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,480
talking about useless gossip.

409
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,080
Director.

410
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,960
I'm sure Whiteboard

411
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,240
is just a minor leader

412
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,830
in the entire syndicate.

413
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:06,670
Unlike Zhao Liang and Hu Xifan,

414
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:08,350
Whiteboard refused
to reveal anyone else.

415
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,960
They must have planned this long ago.

416
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,830
Unfortunately, we have no evidence now.

417
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:16,480
We have. Zhou Min.

418
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,280
Given Zhou Min's current condition,

419
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:21,870
she's not fit enough
to provide any information.

420
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,440
And Fafa's too young

421
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,910
to have her statement used in court.

422
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,777
So, that leaves Whiteboard
as our only option.

423
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,355
We don't have time to contend with him.

424
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,640
Right now, we've only found Zhou Min.

425
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,590
What about Zheng Weiwei?

426
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,430
And Little Spud?

427
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,680
We've got no clues.

428
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,520
So, what now?

429
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,870
You're asking me?

430
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,030
How would I know?

431
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,870
I'm not the Director.

432
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,590
Hello?

433
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,000
We've got a lead on Little Spud.

434
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,840
Hello?

435
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,720
Okay, we'll head there now.

436
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,040
Director Deng.

437
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,350
You should take a nap.

438
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,110
I can't.

439
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,920
In our line of work,

440
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,240
we need to go with the flow

441
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,870
like him.

442
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,350
Rest up while you can.

443
00:22:43,688 --> 00:22:45,870
I'll get a good night's sleep
once we find the baby.

444
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,840
Mr. Yin.

445
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,110
You think that it's unlikely

446
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,430
to find the baby, don't you?

447
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,190
I just...

448
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:01,630
don't want to be happy too soon.

449
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,870
Hu.

450
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,950
Vice Director Yin.

451
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,650
This is our unit's director,
Director Deng.

452
00:23:21,844 --> 00:23:22,560
Nice to meet you.

453
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,600
This is Officer Hu from

454
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:24,700
Nanyangdian Police Station.

455
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,080
An auxiliary officer stationed here.

456
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:27,960
Vice Director Yin,
as I told you over the phone,

457
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,800
the baby was bought

458
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,990
by a man called Yang Yong,
who lives on the eastern side.

459
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,870
You should check

460
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,911
if he's the baby you're looking for.

461
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,960
Nanyangdian Village

462
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,060
was notorious as
a baby-trafficking hub in the 1990s.

463
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,190
The villagers here

464
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,755
are extremely wary of the police.

465
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,870
Stay safe.

466
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,280
Show us the way, then.

467
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,150
Here's the place.

468
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,590
Yang Yong!

469
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,440
Are you home?

470
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,320
Open the gate!

471
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,150
Yang Yong!

472
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,590
Who's there?

473
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,720
What's with all that banging?

474
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,800
Did someone die?

475
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,110
It's you, Director.

476
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,066
And Officer Hu, too?

477
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,360
Sir,

478
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,760
I didn't do anything illegal.

479
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,630
Why bring the police here?

480
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,950
Here's the thing.

481
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,910
The city is running

482
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,670
a law popularization campaign.

483
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:30,066
We're here for a random check.

484
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,190
Law popularization?

485
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,430
Open the gate.

486
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,350
Have a seat.

487
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,960
The police are here. Tidy up.

488
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,870
Hush, baby.

489
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:57,750
Leave it.

490
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,510
Just go, quick!

491
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,511
(I haven't fed him yet.)

492
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:03,720
How many rooms are there here?

493
00:25:04,955 --> 00:25:05,880
As many as you can see.

494
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,080
How old is your kid, then?

495
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,870
I don't have kids.

496
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,720
You don't?

497
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,270
Then, what's with the baby formula

498
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,110
and these toys

499
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,160
around your house?

500
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,240
Are they for you?

501
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,240
They're not for me.

502
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,110
So, I've been married for years,

503
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,280
but we haven't been
able to have a baby,

504
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,160
so we hope to attract some luck

505
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,150
by placing these items

506
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,390
around our house.

507
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,510
If you're having such problems,

508
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,790
you should see a doctor instead.

509
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,910
I'm just following a friend's advice.

510
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,240
Have a seat, Officer.

511
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,990
Come on, let's talk.

512
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,110
Come on.

513
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:39,911
So, have you learned anything from
the law popularization campaign?

514
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,480
A lot.

515
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,630
Officer?

516
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:44,720
What are you looking for?

517
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,670
The toilet.

518
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,520
It's not there.

519
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,030
Fine, you should search outdoors.

520
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,000
There's no toilet here.

521
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:53,790
The toilet's quite a distance from here.

522
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,320
It's okay.

523
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,280
He'll find it.

524
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,270
Do you know what Articles 240-241

525
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,960
of the Criminal Law states?

526
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,110
I don't.

527
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,680
Here, let me explain.

528
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,000
Article 240 of the Criminal Law

529
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,044
of the PRC state

530
00:26:05,044 --> 00:26:07,020
that whoever abducts or traffics
a woman or child

531
00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:08,860
may be sentenced to
5-10 years of imprisonment,

532
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:09,430
plus a fine.

533
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,960
In severe cases,
the death penalty is also possible,

534
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,466
as well as confiscation of assets.

535
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,750
I didn't do anything like that.

536
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,000
Where's the kid from, then?

537
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,430
You know,

538
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,510
buying children is also illegal.

539
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,910
I don't know.

540
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,870
You're teething, aren't you?

541
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:07,960
You're itching to bite
anything you see, hmm?

542
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,040
Here.

543
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,560
Give me that.

544
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,110
Give me that.

545
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,520
Mrs. Lin.

546
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,440
Hello?

547
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,280
Yan?

548
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,520
Any news on Little Spud?

549
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,040
Right now, we're...

550
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,240
Mrs. Lin,

551
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,555
we don't have any updates now.

552
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,390
I'll call you as soon
as there's anything.

553
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,590
I'm busy now.

554
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,870
Got it.

555
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,280
Call me once there's any news.

556
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,866
Sure.

557
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,950
Mr. Yin.

558
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,000
Why did you stop me from telling her?

559
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,920
We can inform the family

560
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,222
once the DNA results are out.

561
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:20,400
You claim you don't know
the person who sold the child.

562
00:28:20,511 --> 00:28:22,320
You should at least know
how he looks, then?

563
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,040
I really don't know.

564
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,350
Police enforcement is strict nowadays.

565
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,350
I didn't see him in person.

566
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,400
If you didn't see him,

567
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,644
how did you receive the baby?

568
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,280
We...

569
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,190
We...

570
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,520
We were told to go...

571
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,560
Yes,

572
00:28:38,622 --> 00:28:39,910
the east entrance of the village.

573
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,760
About 500 meters from there

574
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,390
is a row of willow trees.

575
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,630
There was a van

576
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,280
waiting under the trees.

577
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,590
A van?

578
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:49,688
What does the van look like?

579
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,150
It was

580
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,910
an ordinary van.

581
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,560
No car plates.

582
00:28:56,488 --> 00:28:57,390
It looked battered.

583
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,840
Very old,

584
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,520
probably heading to the junkyard soon.

585
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,480
(They put the baby in the van)

586
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,870
(for us to see.)

587
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,070
(The baby looked fine to us,)

588
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,190
(so as agreed, we left our payment)

589
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,480
(inside the van)

590
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,760
(and took the baby with us.)

591
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,910
Then, did you see anyone

592
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,910
get in the van after you left?

593
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,790
Well, we were so nervous back then,

594
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,000
so we didn't look back.

595
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,080
We didn't even notice

596
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,910
when the van left.

597
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,066
How did you contact that guy, then?

598
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,110
My wife has a distant cousin

599
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,870
who knew we were childless.

600
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,320
He was doing well in Linshan,

601
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,120
so...

602
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,430
So, we asked him

603
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,670
to get a child for us.

604
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,520
After that,

605
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,590
someone called us.

606
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,840
Your cousin?

607
00:29:53,866 --> 00:29:54,480
What does he do?

608
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,230
What's his name?

609
00:29:55,244 --> 00:29:56,390
What does he do in the city?

610
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,830
His name is Han Yougang.

611
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,190
I'm not really sure

612
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,040
what he does for a living.

613
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,600
Here.

614
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,560
Come on.

615
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,400
Tell Chief Xiao about your findings.

616
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,560
The baby wasn't who we were looking for.

617
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,520
We ran a DNA test,

618
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,790
and the baby isn't related

619
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,777
to the victim's family.

620
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,155
We've sent the baby's blood sample
for further testing.

621
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,520
Deng.

622
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,720
Finding a lost child isn't easy.

623
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,910
Don't feel defeated.

624
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,320
I'm not.

625
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,590
It's good that we rescued a child.

626
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:36,910
However, we still haven't found

627
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,755
any clues related to Little Spud's case.

628
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,430
Deng.

629
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,350
Solving abduction cases

630
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,350
isn't as simple as you think.

631
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,688
You need to be mentally prepared,

632
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,080
especially when dealing
with prolonged cases.

633
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,190
The chain of custody
is prone to breakage.

634
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,630
That's why every child saved
is a tremendous victory.

635
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,670
The key is planning your next move

636
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,200
with proper deliberation.

637
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,870
Right, Han?

638
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,320
Don't give up.

639
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,080
I'm here if you need help.

640
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,110
Chief Xiao warned me

641
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,560
that if I didn't support you,

642
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,830
he'd give me a painful lesson.

643
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,240
My dear comrade.

644
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,240
Try relaxing your face a little.

645
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,110
We set the date for this, didn't we?

646
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,870
She promised to join us for lunch today.

647
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
She's a unit leader

648
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,080
at work now, after all.

649
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,430
Of course, she has to focus on work.

650
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,480
I did some research

651
00:31:43,844 --> 00:31:45,955
about working
in the Anti-abduction Office.

652
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,760
It's not an easy job.

653
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,280
Yanyan is expected to work
at crime scenes in person.

654
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,150
I can't help but worry

655
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,110
that she'd land herself in danger.

656
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,400
You should know

657
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,390
how stubborn your daughter can be.

658
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,044
You think she'd listen to you?

659
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,320
(Actually, I know)

660
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,080
(why she insisted on joining
Anti-abduction Office.)

661
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,670
It's because of Lin Ran's case.

662
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:20,155
It's not Yanyan's fault
that this happened, though.

663
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,640
They were just hanging out.

664
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,630
Who'd expect

665
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,280
that Lin Ran would be kidnapped?

666
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,280
In my opinion,

667
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,350
now that Yanyan is delving into this,

668
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,480
if she doesn't
get the results she wants,

669
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,590
then...

670
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,830
Looks like she hasn't moved on

671
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,190
from that incident after so many years.

672
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,590
She's a grown-up now, though.

673
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,150
She can think for herself.

674
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,560
There's no need for us to worry.

675
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,480
Let's eat.

676
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,430
Xiaoguang?

677
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,840
Xiaoguang.

678
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,190
Xiaoguang.

679
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,000
Xiaoguang.

680
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,990
Daddy's here.

681
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,950
Let me kiss you.

682
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,750
Did I sting you

683
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,590
with my mustache?

684
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,600
Sorry.

685
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,520
I'm sorry.

686
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,190
Son,

687
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,190
let's go home.

688
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,800
You can watch me shave,

689
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,390
okay?

690
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,000
Here.

691
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,000
Come home with Daddy.

692
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,520
Come on.

693
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,150
What are you doing?

694
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,190
Let go of my son!

695
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,750
What are you doing?

696
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,830
Let go of my son!

697
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,510
Thief!

698
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,350
Hush, baby.

699
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,480
What were you doing?

700
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,280
Hush, baby.

701
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,240
I'm sorry.

702
00:34:02,488 --> 00:34:03,520
I mistook him for someone.

703
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,680
Mistook him?

704
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,790
Who are you trying to fool?

705
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,240
Mistaking my child for yours?

706
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:09,000
You must be one of those traffickers!

707
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,190
Call the police!

708
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,270
Now! Child trafficker,
that's what you are!

709
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,750
Hush, baby.

710
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,310
I mistook him for my own child.

711
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,750
Hush, baby.

712
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,840
Mommy's here.

713
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,160
I'm sorry.

714
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,400
I mistook him for my child.

715
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,150
Is your child okay?

716
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,510
He's fine.

717
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:33,080
My husband took him back home.

718
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,880
Allow me to explain.

719
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,590
He's not a child trafficker.

720
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,920
His own child was abducted
over 10 years ago.

721
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,377
He's a victim himself.

722
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,760
I apologize

723
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
on his behalf.

724
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,670
I'm sorry

725
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,670
for causing such trouble.

726
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,600
Forget it.

727
00:34:52,688 --> 00:34:53,640
Let's leave it at that.

728
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,880
I'm going home.

729
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,630
Sure.

730
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,400
I'm sorry for the trouble.

731
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,470
Lawyer Sun.

732
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,590
Wake up.

733
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,240
Wake up.

734
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,400
I'm looking for my son.

735
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,760
His name is...

736
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,960
His name is Sun Xiaoguang,

737
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,590
abducted at two years old

738
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,750
around Jinxiuyuan
at Fushan West Gardens.

739
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,320
Drink some water.

740
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,311
(People's Hospital, Nanjie District)
(After running some tests,)

741
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:49,244
(we've concluded that the patient
has not been sexually assaulted.)

742
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,630
(Other than bruises on
her limbs caused by tying,)

743
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,560
there are no visible wounds on her body.

744
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,270
She is healthy physically,

745
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,990
but

746
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,480
she has dealt with
serious emotional trauma.

747
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,230
As requested by her parents,

748
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,670
we will keep her under observation
in the hospital for a few more days.

749
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,790
I understand.

750
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,710
So, she's in normal condition

751
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,230
apart from her mental trauma, then?

752
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,150
Her blood tests have revealed

753
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,230
that she has high estrogen levels.

754
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,350
Abnormally high.

755
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,430
It's not a major issue, though.

756
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,040
Estrogen?

757
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,400
Careful, it's still hot.

758
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,590
Officer Deng.

759
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,430
Come in.

760
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,510
Have a seat.

761
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,590
It's okay.

762
00:36:40,622 --> 00:36:41,822
I brought some flowers for Min.

763
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,160
Thank you.

764
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,240
They're gorgeous.

765
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,030
Officer Deng,

766
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,760
thank you so much for your help.

767
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,600
It's okay.

768
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,720
Min,

769
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,270
Officer Deng is here to visit you.

770
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,240
Greet her.

771
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,040
Remember to thank her.

772
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,110
Thank you, Officer Deng.

773
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,920
It's okay.

774
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,230
We're just doing our job.

775
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,910
Mrs. Zhou.

776
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,870
Come with me.

777
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,550
Mrs. Zhou,

778
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,440
I'm here today

779
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,710
to ask her some details about the case.

780
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,920
We believe that there's
still another victim

781
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,377
held captive by the same syndicate.

782
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,150
May I ask Min to help us?

783
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,480
Officer Deng.

784
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,510
Min

785
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,880
is just beginning to recover.

786
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,360
She's not mentally ready.

787
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,670
Ask me anything you need to know.

788
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,070
But we

789
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:49,320
need to ask her in person

790
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,230
about some specific details of the case.

791
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,400
I thought you caught
those traffickers, didn't you?

792
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,840
Those heartless traffickers.

793
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,960
Can't you question them instead?

794
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,960
He refused to talk.

795
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,630
If we can obtain leads

796
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,000
directly from her,

797
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:08,110
we may be able to rescue
the other victims faster.

798
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,190
He refused to talk?

799
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,190
And there's nothing else
the police can do?

800
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,230
Can't you just...

801
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,880
Beat him up?

802
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,670
Scold him?

803
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,960
Or torture him so he'll talk?

804
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,066
Mrs. Zhou. Calm down.

805
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:22,110
We cannot force a confession
out of him like that.

806
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,022
And that justifies you
to torment my daughter?

807
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,480
That's not what I meant.

808
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,320
Look.

809
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,150
Look at my poor girl.

810
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,920
Every day, when she sleeps,

811
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,840
she gets nightmares.

812
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,440
She hasn't had a good night's rest.

813
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,480
I wish I could get inside her mind

814
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,230
and dig out those bad memories for her.

815
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:41,710
I'm sorry.

816
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,630
But now,

817
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,590
you want her

818
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,590
to relive those awful memories?

819
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Don't you think that this is too cruel

820
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,270
for a child to bear?

821
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,790
I'm sorry.

823
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,840
What happened?

824
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,840
Nothing.

825
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,750
Min, you're up.

826
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:12,560

827
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,280

Here.

832
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880

It's been suspended
due to unpaid bills,

Did you buy it for Zhou Min?

903
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,670
You wanted to stimulate
her sexual growth

904
00:42:40,711 --> 00:42:42,549
so that you could
force her into prostitution.
