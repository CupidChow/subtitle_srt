1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to make a new one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to make a new one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to make a new one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to make a new one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to make a new one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to make a new one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm going to make a new one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to make a new one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going to make a new one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to make a new one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to make a new one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to make a new one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to make a new one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to make a new one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 2

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is good.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hurry up!

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Over there!

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Stop!

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Stop!

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you okay?

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Stop!

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Stop!

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There are two kids.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm not crying.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's quiet inside.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll take you home.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not crying.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Go!

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Take me!

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't run!

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I want to find my mom.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I want to find my mom.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you know why I caught you?

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm still wondering why you caught me.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I just took a shower.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm fine.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I didn't do anything.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Where did you get the three kids?

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Three kids?

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't know.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm just a driver.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I took the car today.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I took the car today.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I took the car today.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I took the car today.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I took the car today.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You don't know anything?

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Do you know why you were here last time?

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Why is it so coincidental?

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Every time a kid is with you,

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
you're always with him.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let me ask you.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Who sent you to the gate of the bath?

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Who told you to go there?

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I just answered a phone call.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I went wherever they told me to go.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Meng Gui.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I thought your wife had left Yingshan.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let me tell you something.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Your peers have put the blame on you.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Now they're all waiting for the職人 to play with you and send you home.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now they're all waiting for the職人 to play with you and send you home.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
According to Meng Gui's explanation,

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
he's a driver.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's responsible for sending the kidnapped child to the person.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This time, Yang Yu

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
is a person named Hong Yi who supported him.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What did you find out about the Hongdu Mountain community?

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What did you find out about the Hongdu Mountain community?

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There's no news yet.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
There's no news yet.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Currently, we only have the name Hong Yi.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Currently, we only have the name Hong Yi.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But Meng Gui said he was in touch with Danxian.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So I asked Jia Jia to verify the communication.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So I asked Jia Jia to verify the communication.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,860
Subsequently we're not allowed to use the regime.

80
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,140
Understood, then.

81
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,140
Cut the crap.

82
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,140
Action.

83
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,480
莫 yr expected

84
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
that will cause the specialists to build 80 square meters of senile devils.

85
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,120
That will cause their

86
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
debut.

87
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,500
That's all.

88
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,900
OK, I'll leave you look around.

89
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,760
más Rapid Jane

90
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:32,080
Thank you

91
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,760
I think the child is really like that little jade.

92
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Little jade?

93
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,760
But everyone in the village thinks that it is the child of Zheng Mingguang.

94
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,760
And the forest in our village is quite united.

95
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,760
I'm afraid this matter will be easy to be solved.

96
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,760
But no matter what, we have to get the evidence first.

97
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,760
I think we should go back to the village and investigate.

98
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
It's easy to be solved.

99
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,760
But no matter what, we have to get the evidence first.

100
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,760
We'll go there, but there are too many people who don't want to go.

101
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Please.

102
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
Look at her.

103
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Hongmei, this is the government of Zheng Paishuoshuo.

104
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,760
They are here to check the population.

105
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Hello, we are here to check the population.

106
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Please have a cup of tea.

107
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Your name is Liu Hongmei, right?

108
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Yes.

109
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Your husband's name is Zheng Mingguang.

110
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Your child's name is Zheng Mendong.

111
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Yes.

112
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
How old is your child?

113
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Six months.

114
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,760
That's right. Liu Hongmei was born here.

115
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,760
But that child is a seven-month-old child.

116
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
I have a very deep impression.

117
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Bring me the household register.

118
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Okay.

119
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,760
I'll go get the household register.

120
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Okay.

121
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Okay, no problem.

122
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Sign and press the handprint.

123
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Okay.

124
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Put the child down.

125
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Okay.

126
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,760
Sign.

127
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Okay.

128
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Where should I sign?

129
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
You can sign it yourself.

130
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
You can spray it.

131
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Don't cry.

132
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
Okay, okay.

133
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
I feel wronged.

134
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Okay.

135
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Don't cry.

136
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
She is so heavy.

137
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
She eats so well.

138
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Is she not like my child?

139
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
You are so young.

140
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Here.

141
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Where is she young?

142
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
My child is in the hospital for three days.

143
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,760
I envy that the child is so kind.

144
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
The child's immune system is very fragile.

145
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,760
She is sick for three days.

146
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,760
The last time she came to see the patient was a few days ago.

147
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
The child was infected with pneumonia.

148
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,760
I suggest they let the child stay in the hospital for a while more.

149
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
But the couple saw the child getting better.

150
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,760
They thought the hospital fee was expensive.

151
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
So they let the child stay in the hospital.

152
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
She is always sick.

153
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
She is so busy.

154
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,760
It's not easy to take care of a sick child.

155
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Are you hungry?

156
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
She is crying.

157
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
She is peeing.

158
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Okay, go.

159
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
I will clean it.

160
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Is there anything else?

161
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
No, no.

162
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Okay.

163
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Slowly.

164
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Okay.

165
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Let's go.

166
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Thank you.

167
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Let's go.

168
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Let's go and check the files.

169
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,760
Where did the child go when we caught you?

170
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
I don't know.

171
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
I don't know.

172
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
I don't know.

173
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
I don't know.

174
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
Where did the child go?

175
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
I really don't remember.

176
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
It was arranged by Hong Yi.

177
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
I told him.

178
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
I am a hooligan.

179
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
You are a hooligan?

180
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,760
The 240th law of the People's Republic of China.

181
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
The child who is kidnapped by his father and daughter.

182
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
He is sentenced to 10 years in prison.

183
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
You are a hooligan.

184
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Officer.

185
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
I am a driver.

186
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
I didn't participate in the kidnapping.

187
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
I don't understand.

188
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Do you know what is a kidnapping?

189
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
The purpose of the kidnapping is to sell.

190
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Kidnapping, kidnapping, buying and selling.

191
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
Transferring and receiving.

192
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
It is one of the actions of the father and daughter.

193
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
You sell children on the line and buy children offline.

194
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
You are responsible for receiving.

195
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
This is the kidnapping.

196
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Where did I hurt the child?

197
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
It was a kidnapping.

198
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
I really don't know.

199
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
You have to earn some hard money.

200
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Menggui.

201
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
We have witnesses.

202
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
You drove a white car.

203
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Stopped at a surveillance point in the Jixing Park.

204
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Then your wife carried the child.

205
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
It was this child.

206
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
Your wife gave you this child.

207
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Then you put it in a big travel bag.

208
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
When we caught you.

209
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
There was your own child in the car.

210
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Because you have to take the real child.

211
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Transferred to that bread truck.

212
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Transferred to that bread truck.

213
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Right?

214
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Menggui.

215
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
It's boring.

216
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
It's boring.

217
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
You don't say it.

218
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
We are always like this.

219
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Finally you moved to the procuratorate.

220
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
You can't just say it here.

221
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
You can still reduce the salary at the procuratorate.

222
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
We are now.

223
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
It's useless to insist.

224
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
Menggui.

225
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
I'll tell you.

226
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
i won't help.

227
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,760
If you keep yelling,

228
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,760
I won't go over there.

229
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
Menggui...

230
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
I need to go home.

231
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
Thank you for being my friend.

232
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Young master.

233
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
What am I supposed to do in the car?

234
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
How can I earn that?

235
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Sadico recentlyirloyal

236
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
I didnt solve the case.

237
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Forget it that day.

238
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,720
So, according to his explanation,

239
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,040
the child Xiao Yangyu and the child we saved in the foster home

240
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,320
were probably bought by the Monggoi.

241
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,840
A few days ago, Hong Ting Yu asked me to send a little boy to a Nanyang store

242
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,160
to give him to a guy named Han You Gang.

243
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,040
I have contacted Han You Gang's phone and his contact information.

244
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,240
There was no result. He disappeared.

245
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,080
Han You Gang suddenly called me.

246
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,960
He asked if I had cash.

247
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,040
I told him that I had no cash.

248
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,720
He said that if I didn't have cash, he would find someone else.

249
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120
I thought that if I sent him money,

250
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,440
he would take the risk and earn that much money.

251
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,360
I thought that if I gave him a child,

252
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,760
I would earn the money.

253
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,640
I could also buy things for my child.

254
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,040
I agreed.

255
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,040
Then I thought that

256
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,920
in the area of Ximin Road,

257
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,280
there are always old people and old ladies taking care of their children.

258
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,840
So, I asked Han You Gang to prepare a child for me.

259
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
I didn't get it.

260
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
How is it?

261
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Is it still in stock?

262
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,760
Yes, it's still in stock.

263
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
It's old, right?

264
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
Yes.

265
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
This is also a lot.

266
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,440
We have two pairs of shoes.

267
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,720
This is not the first time I bought it.

268
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
I will buy it again.

269
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Let me try.

270
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
40,000.

271
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
50,000.

272
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,640
Okay, 50,000.

273
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
This is two.

274
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
A little.

275
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
I will carry it.

276
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Okay.

277
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Slowly.

278
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Don't move.

279
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
It's okay.

280
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Are you tired?

281
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
Drink some water.

282
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
This is the place where we first dated.

283
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Yes.

284
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
I still remember

285
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
you always took a pack of chips to eat.

286
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
I thought

287
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
it was because we were nervous about our first date.

288
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Then I found out

289
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,600
that you were a little too shy.

290
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
I thought you were a little too shy.

291
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
I thought you were a little too shy.

292
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
I thought you were a little too shy.

293
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
I thought you were a little too shy.

294
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
You just love chips.

295
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Then you told me

296
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
that since you love chips so much,

297
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
when we get married and have a child in the future,

298
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
let's call him Little Potato.

299
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Then you shook your head.

300
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
The name is too vulgar.

301
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
We have to call him a little more foreign.

302
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,280
So we called him Little Yang Yu.

303
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
Right.

304
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Lin Hao.

305
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Yes?

306
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
Let's get a divorce.

307
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
I know your mother didn't do it on purpose.

308
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
She did it to save someone.

309
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
But when I think about it,

310
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I feel so lost.

311
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,960
I can't sleep at all.

312
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Thank you.

313
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Lin Hao, I have no choice.

314
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
I really have no choice.

315
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
I don't even dare to go back to that house.

316
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm afraid I'll see him when I get home.

317
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
I know I shouldn't blame him.

318
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
But I blame him from the bottom of my heart.

319
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Why did he save that stranger?

320
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Because he was afraid of me.

321
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
He saved that stranger and gave him a bad chance.

322
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
The criminal kidnapped Little Yang Yu.

323
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Thank you.

324
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
My mother...

325
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
I know.

326
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
He didn't do it on purpose.

327
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Then I have to accept it?

328
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Because of him,

329
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,960
I lost my son Lin Hao.

330
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Thank you.

331
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Let's rent a house.

332
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
We'll move out.

333
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
This is unfair to him.

334
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
It's unfair to you, too.

335
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
I went to see the doctor.

336
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,960
After the injury, he was seriously injured.

337
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
He must be taken for a long time.

338
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,960
And during the time of taking medicine,

339
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
he can't have children again.

340
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
As long as we are together, it's not a problem.

341
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Lin Hao, we divorced.

342
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,960
It's the best choice for you and me.

343
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Xin Xin.

344
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
You left and Little Yang Yu has no home.

345
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Xin Xin.

346
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
I can't divorce you.

347
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Xin Xin.

348
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,960
Xin Xin.

349
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,960
The flower is blooming.

350
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
The flower is blooming.

351
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
The flower is blooming.

352
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
The flower is blooming.

353
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
The flower is blooming.

354
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Look, who's back?

355
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Dad is back.

356
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Dad is back.

357
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Why are you so drunk?

358
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
Where's Xin Xin?

359
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Xin Xin?

360
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Xin Xin doesn't want me.

361
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Xin Xin doesn't want this home.

362
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
She wants to divorce me.

363
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Nonsense.

364
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,960
My son, my son.

365
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
My son is dead.

366
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
My wife is dead.

367
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,640
Mom, why do you have to take Little Yang Yu to that park?

368
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
If you don't take her to that park,

369
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
this wouldn't have happened.

370
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
I told you.

371
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Didn't I tell you not to take the children to that park?

372
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
You waited for me to come back with them.

373
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,640
Why don't you go first?

374
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Why don't you go to that park?

375
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Impossible.

376
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Why?

377
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
Why, mom?

378
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Son, I'm sorry.

379
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
I'm sorry.

380
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
I'm sorry.

381
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Don't give us that face.

383
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
I'm going out.

384
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
What am I going out for?

385
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
I'm going out.

386
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Xiao Hao, Xiao Hao.

387
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
Don't be like this.

388
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Don't be like this.

389
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,320
It's all my fault.

390
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,320
It's all my fault.

391
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
You're not wrong.

392
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
I'm wrong.

393
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
You're not wrong.

394
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
It's all my fault.

395
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
If Little Yang Yu is not here,

396
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
I'm afraid of death.

397
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm sorry, mom.

398
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm sorry.

399
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Son,

400
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm sorry.

401
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Money,

405
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
look,

406
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
there's a whole area.

407
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Old Lin,

408
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
you said I saved people.

409
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
I saved the wrong person.

410
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,680
Tell me,

411
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,680
what should I do?

412
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
I'm sorry.

413
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,680
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
We have received a looped message from bottom of the guidance takes.

415
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,700
NARE Hall Chung Chao Pavilion.

416
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
You are disembarking.

417
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Pe unintentionally,

418
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,460

We are losing our smiles

421
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,300
Mr. Uno

422
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,140
The report coming out of that Shiba village's DNA

423
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,200
is about Lin

424
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,880
Look up

425
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,680
The rush to save Xiao Yang

Rat

427
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,440
Nice to see you

428
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,680
pressure room is not in

429
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,560
Not in

430
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
Your source am I right for you

431
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,520
But Liu Hongmei and the kids are all in the house

432
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,080
How about this, Jiajia?

433
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,400
Control Liu Hongmei later

434
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:00,900
Okay

435
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,900
We'll go to check the kids

436
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,200
Let's go

437
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,000
Okay, go

438
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Come

439
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
Liu Hongmei, you are suspected of buying and selling children

440
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,360
We are now arresting you according to the law

441
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,400
Where is Mingguang?

442
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
I didn't buy it

443
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,400
Let's talk about it at the police station

444
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,080
Come on, let's go

445
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
What are you doing?

446
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
You are bullying people?

447
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,080
The kid is here

448
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,080

449
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Article 6 of the Civil Code

450
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Children who are bought and sold

451
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
are not abused

452
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,080
and can be punished if they are not prevented from being rescued

453
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
I don't understand what you are saying

454
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Give me back the kid, okay?

455
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Give me back the kid!

456
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
You bought the kid

457
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
It's illegal

458
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
We have the right to arrest you

459
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,080
Do you understand?

460
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,080
I... I cooperate

461
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
I will wait for my husband to come back

462
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,080
We will find your husband, take him away

464
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Let me go, I can walk by myself

465
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Let me go

466
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
What's wrong with you?

467
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Go, hurry up

468
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
Let's go

469
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080

00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,080

What are you doing?

473
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Mingguang, where are you going?

474
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
Are you a man?

475
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Why are there so many police here?

476
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
Dehua, they robbed my kid

477
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,080
The kid is not mine

478
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
Please help me

479
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Don't talk nonsense

480
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Everyone, we are police

481
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
The kid was kidnapped

482
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
We will take him back

483
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
Please move aside

484
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,080
You lied to them

485
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
You are the one who bought the kid

486
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
Stop yelling

487
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,080
Mingguang, we all ate the kid

488
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
He gave us money

489
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
How could it not be him?

490
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
Yes

491
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
The police came to rob the kid

492
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,080
because they made a mistake

493
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Right, everyone?

494
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
Yes

495
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080

497
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
We will take him to see his parents

498
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080

Actually, niceants aren't fun.

559
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,140
Not fun at all.

00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,140
Uh, man.

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,140
Xin Xin, listen to me first.

569
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,140
My mom is gone.

570
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:43,100
싸 Kr feet

571
00:29:49,880 --> 00:30:04,700
by b intimidation

572
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,140
I'm so scared

573
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,140
What's wrong?

574
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,140
Is this the cartoon that Xiao Yang likes?

575
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,140
Taixin

576
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,140
Let me tell you

577
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,140
Director Deng

578
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,140
I'm so scared

579
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,140
My mother-in-law

580
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,140
My mother-in-law can't think of anything

581
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,140
She's busy with her work

582
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,140
I'm afraid she'll do something stupid

583
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,140
What?

584
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,140
This morning

585
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,140
She left Lin Hao a letter of apology

586
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,140
Where is Director Deng?

587
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
Taixin

588
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,140
Can you arrange someone to stop her?

589
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
No, no, no

590
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,140
Listen to me first

591
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
Lin Hao really wants to stop her

592
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,140
I know, listen to me first

593
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,140
Xiao Yang has already found her

594
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,140
Director Deng

595
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,140
Now this point can't fool her

596
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,140
She will never believe it

597
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,140
No, I didn't fool you

598
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,140
Because it's in my arms now

599
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,140
You're not a thief

600
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,140
All right, all right, all right

601
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,140
Calm down first

602
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,140
We'll go over right now

603
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,140
Chao Wei, go to Wangjiang Bridge on the way to Wangjiang

604
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,140
Director Deng said just now

605
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,140
Xiao Yang is here

606
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,140
Really?

607
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,140
I'm not sure

608
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,140
But what did he say?

609
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,140
Let's not worry about it

610
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,140
Let's go over first

611
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,140
All right, let's go

612
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,140
Aunt, what can you tell me slowly?

613
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,140
Nothing can't be solved

614
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,140
Calm down

615
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,140
So many people came to help you

616
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,140
Aunt, don't come over

617
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,140
Okay, Mom

618
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,140
Slowly

619
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,140
Mom, Mom

620
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,140
Don't go

621
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,140
Go slowly

622
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,140
Mom, Mom

623
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,140
Don't come over

624
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,140
Go over

625
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,140
I'll drop you

626
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,140
Don't kill me

627
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,140
Mom, get down first

628
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,140
Mom, calm down

629
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,140
Don't scare me

630
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,140
We're not divorced

631
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,140
We're not divorced

632
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,140
Mother, get down first

633
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,140
We're talking, okay?

634
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,140
Aunt, I'm sorry

635
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
It's all my fault

636
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,140
No

637
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,140
Calm down

638
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,140
Let's talk about it

639
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,140
Okay?

640
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,140
If Xiao Yang Nicknames are out

641
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,140
Grandma, what should I do?

642
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,140
Get down first

643
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,140
Don't scare me

644
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,780
The baby can't be found.

645
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,140
Find him back!

646
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,700
Find him back!

647
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,460
Mom, find him back!

648
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,820
Mr. Wang Yi!

649
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,060
It's gone.

650
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,460
Get out of here, mom.

651
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,660
Get down!

652
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,860
I'm sorry.

653
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,260
I'm sorry.

654
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,060
Mom, come here!

655
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,740
Dr. Lin, we found Dr. Yang.

656
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,100
Jiang Xin, let's go and see the doctor.

657
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,260
Mom!

658
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,500
Mom, this is Dr. Yang!

659
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,220
Mom, look! This is Dr. Yang!

660
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,460
Mom!

661
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,660
Let me see!

662
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,380
Mom!

663
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,180
Mom!

664
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,700
Dad!

665
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,500
Mom!

666
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,300
Mom, look!

667
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
It's gone.

668
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,140
Mom, look!

669
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,060
It's really Dr. Yang!

670
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,300
It's really Dr. Yang!

671
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,900
Mom, look!

672
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,260
Look!

673
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,860
It's really Dr. Yang!

674
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,580
It's really our baby!

675
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,500
It's really Dr. Yang!

676
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,260
Look!

677
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,900
Mom, look!

678
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,900
My baby!

679
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,900
My grandson!

680
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,380
Look!

681
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,060
Mom!

682
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,420
Mom!

683
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,420
Mom!

684
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,420
Mom!

685
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
Mom!

686
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,420
Mom!

687
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,420
Mom!

688
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,420
Mom!

689
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,420
Mom!

690
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
Mom!

691
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,420
Mom!

692
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,420
Mom!

693
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,420
Mom!

694
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
Mom!

695
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,420
Mom!

696
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,420
Mom!

697
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,420
Mom!

698
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,420
Mom!

699
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,420
Mom!

700
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,420
Mom!

701
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
Mom!

702
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,420
Mom!

703
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,420
Mom!

704
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,420
Mom!

705
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
Mom!

706
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
Mom!

707
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,420
Mom!

708
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,420
Mom!

709
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,420
Mom!

710
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,420
Mom!

711
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,420
Mom!

712
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,420
Mom!

713
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,420
Mom!

714
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
Mom!

715
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,420
Mom!

716
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,420
Mom!

717
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,420
Mom!

718
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
Mom!

719
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,420
Mom!

720
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,420
Mom!

721
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,420
Mom!

722
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
Mom!

723
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,420
Mom!

724
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,420
Mom!

725
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,420
Mom!

726
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
New story.

727
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,420
Yang Yu, who was missing for many days,

728
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,420
finally came back to his family.

729
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,420
His family

730
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,420
thanked the police and the kind ones

731
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,920
to help them find his baby.

732
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,420
You are also a mother who gave birth to a child.

733
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,420
You even lost a child.

734
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,420
You know that losing a child is a taste.

735
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,420
Why do you still want to buy someone else's child?

736
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,420
That is my child.

737
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,420
Why do you want to steal my child?

738
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,420
How dare you steal my child?

739
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,420
Don't be so agitated.

740
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,420
Give me back my child.

741
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,420
Give it back to me.

742
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
Give it back to me!

743
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,420
I really don't know him.

744
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,420
He insisted on buying someone else.

745
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,420
I have never seen this person.

746
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,420
If you don't know him, then you dare to buy him.

747
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,420
What's the use of me talking?

748
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,420
He is the one who manages the money in my family.

749
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,420
If he wants to buy someone else, what can I say?

750
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,420
Sir, comrade.

751
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Actually, the child is quite cute.

752
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,420
I really like him.

753
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,420
Although he is not a child,

754
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,420
he has feelings for me recently.

755
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,420
Can you discuss with him?

756
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,420
Give me back my child.

757
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,420
Can you add some money?

758
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,420
Is this a question of money?

759
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,420
Now you are breaking the law.

760
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,420
Illegal sale of people.

761
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,420
And you are also promoting the illegal police.

762
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,420
You should answer your question.

763
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,420
Give me back my child.

764
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,420
I will talk to you after I give it back.

765
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,420
Give it back to me.

766
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,420
Give it back to me!

767
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,420
Liu Hongmei is a maniac.

768
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,420
He is a maniac.

769
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,420
He is always shouting and yelling.

770
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,420
He can't control himself.

771
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,420
Zheng Mingguang always says

772
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,420
that he is right.

773
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,420
But he doesn't know anything.

774
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,420
Liu Hongmei is responsible for everything.

775
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,420
Think about it.

776
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,420
A person who lost hope in life

777
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,420
bought a child like Xiao Yangyu

778
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,420
to his home.

779
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,420
I believe he will have some real feelings for Xiao Yangyu.

780
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,420
So when Xiao Yangyu

781
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,420
was rescued by us,

782
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,420
he was not used to it.

783
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,420
It should be normal.

784
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,420
We need to give him some time

785
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,420
to get over this.

786
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,420
The real good person and bad person

787
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,420
are one step apart.

788
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,420
If you are not careful, you will make a mistake.

789
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,420
What is the real bad person?

790
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,420
It's those who are evil

791
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,420
and try to seduce others.

792
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,420
Director Yin,

793
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,420
you are so smart.

794
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,420
Write it down.

795
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,420
Why do you write it down?

796
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,420
I am writing it down.

797
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,420
You need to write it down.

798
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,420
The instructor said

799
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,420
you have an important situation to tell me.

800
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,420
You want to tell me?

801
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,420
Is the child your child?

802
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,420
Is the child your child?

803
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,420
We know your worries.

804
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,420
But only if you can tell us,

805
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,420
we can help you.

806
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,420
Mingguang.

807
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,420
Mingguang.

808
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,420
Mingguang.

809
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,420
I just heard

810
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,420
that the baby is gone.

811
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,420
Open your eyes.

812
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,420
The baby is gone.

813
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,420
You don't need to be sad.

814
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,420
If you can't, give birth to another baby.

815
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
He is sick. He can't give birth.

816
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,420
I am sorry.

817
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,420
I have to tell you

818
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,420
your father's assets.

819
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,420
I am worried too.

820
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,420
It's okay, Mingguang.

821
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
Don't cry.

822
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,420
If it's not okay, we can give birth to another baby.

823
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,420
The baby is almost a month old.

824
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,420
If you can give birth to another baby,

825
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,420
you can give birth to another baby.

826
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,420
Is there a baby?

827
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,420
As long as you have money, you can give birth to another baby.

828
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,420
How much?

829
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,420
I will call you later.

830
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,420
Wait a minute.

831
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,420
Meng.

832
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,420
It's this.

833
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,420
I need a baby now.

834
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,420
It's okay.

835
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,420
It's okay.

836
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,420
I will give you a baby.

837
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,420
Okay.

838
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,420
What's your name?

839
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,420
Han Yougang.

840
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,420
What's your relationship?

841
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,420
We are not that close.

842
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,420
We met when we were working

843
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,420
with my husband in Lingshan.

844
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,420
Did you contact him after you bought the baby?

845
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,420
No.

846
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,420
He kept turning off his phone.

847
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,420
The police told me.

848
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,420
You know he gave me 100,000 yuan.

849
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,420
Do you know where Han Yougang is most likely to hide?

850
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,420
I don't know.

851
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,420
If I knew, I would have gone to find him.

852
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,420
Now,

853
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,420
my husband's property

854
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,420
has to be confiscated.

855
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,420
We have no children and no money.

856
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,420
So,

857
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,420
I beg you,

858
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,420
please help me find this person.

859
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,420
Please get the 100,000 yuan back for us.

860
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,420
I don't have other requirements.

861
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,420
I can't give birth to another baby.

862
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,420
I can't give birth to another baby.

863
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,420
Where is 100,000 yuan?

864
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,420
Han Yougang has already sold two babies

865
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,420
in the Nanyang store.

866
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,420
We can't let him go.

867
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,420
Xiaoju has signed the arrest warrant.

868
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,420
As long as he turns up, he can't escape.

869
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,420
According to the current situation,

870
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,420
we have to go back to the crime scene.

871
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,420
Find Zheng Weiwei and the girl who stole the hideout.

872
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,420
This kid,

873
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,420
where is he going?

874
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,420
Children,

875
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,420
gather in the hall.

876
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,420
Slowly, slowly.

877
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,420
Gather in the hall.

878
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,420
Go down and gather.

879
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,420
Have you seen Fa?

880
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,420
Fa,

881
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,420
Fa.

882
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,420
Fa, Fa.

883
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,420
Children,

884
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,420
come here.

885
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,420
Who saw Fa when I was on vacation?

886
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,420
No one.

887
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,420
Then let's play.

888
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,420
Han Zhi called me.

889
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,420
He said we should go to visit

890
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,420
Bai Wentao.

891
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,420
I'll go with you.

892
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,420
This person,

893
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,420
where is he?

894
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,420
I really don't know.

895
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,420
You haven't seen him recently?

896
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,420
No.

897
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,420
He's dead.

898
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,420
He's dead?

899
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,420
I'm sorry.

900
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,420
I'm sorry.

901
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,420
I'm sorry.

902
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,420
I'm sorry.

903
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,420
I'm sorry.

904
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,420
I'm sorry.

905
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,420
I'm sorry.

906
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,420
I'm sorry.

907
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,420
I'm sorry.

908
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,420
I'm sorry.

909
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,420
I'm sorry.

910
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,420
I'm sorry.

911
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,420
I'm sorry.

912
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,420
I'm sorry.

913
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,420
I'm sorry.

914
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,420
I'm sorry.

915
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,420
I'm sorry.

916
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,420
I'm sorry.

917
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,420
I'm sorry.

918
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,420
I'm sorry.

919
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,420
I'm sorry.

920
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,420
I'm sorry.

921
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,420
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,420
I'm sorry.

923
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,420
I'm sorry.

924
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,420
I'm sorry.

925
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,420
I'm sorry.

926
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,420
I'm sorry.

927
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,420
I'm sorry.

928
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,420
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,420
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,420
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,420
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,420
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,420
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,420
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,420
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,420
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,420
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,420
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,420
I'm sorry.

940
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,420
I'm sorry.

941
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,420
I'm sorry.

942
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,420
I'm sorry.

943
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,420
I'm sorry.

944
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,420
I'm sorry.

945
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,420
I'm sorry.

946
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,420
I'm sorry.

947
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,420
I'm sorry.

948
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,420
I'm sorry.

949
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,420
I'm sorry.

950
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,420
I'm sorry.

951
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,420
I'm sorry.

952
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,420
