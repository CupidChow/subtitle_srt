=Episode 15=

3
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,460
Go away!

4
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,139
Go away!

5
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,029
This is just bullying!

6
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,472
Stop!

7
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,288
Who's bullying you?

8
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,261
Who is it?

9
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:52,261
Who's the landlord here?

10
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:53,341
I am.

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,140
60,000 yuan a year.

12
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,822
We'll rent for three years.

13
00:01:58,555 --> 00:01:59,220
Madam Zhang,

14
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,300
when did you get

15
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:01,333
such a wealthy friend?

16
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:03,755
Sir, how should we address you?

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,060
Can you accept it?

18
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:05,820
Yes.

19
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:10,644
Here's the deposit.

20
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:12,311
Sign the contract with him.

21
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,420
Sure.

22
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,260
Qian.

23
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:15,370
What about me?

24
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:16,149
Mr. Shi.

25
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,250
We'll talk about the penalty privately.

26
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,140
Privately. Let's step out and talk.

27
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,181
Not a penny less.

28
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,660
We'll talk it over.

29
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,700
You're holding things up.

30
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:27,422
Go.

31
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:35,660
You must be Madam Zhang.

32
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:36,581
Yes.

33
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:38,323
Don't worry, Madam Zhang.

34
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:39,887
Your Tuanyuan Restaurant

35
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:40,740
won't need to move.

36
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:42,660
We don't have to move?

37
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,341
Yes.

38
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,820
On behalf
of Dingshun Charity Foundation,

39
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:49,140
we've donated 210,000 yuan

40
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:50,260
to Tuanyuan Restaurant.

41
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,100
We hope

42
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:52,221
we can help you out.

43
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:54,380
210,000 yuan?

44
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:55,380
No.

45
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,061
Well...

46
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,221
Why would you

47
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,781
donate to us?

48
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:01,644
Mr. Ye is

49
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:03,377
Director Deng's cousin.

50
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:05,900
We heard about your situation.

51
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,940
Don't worry.

52
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,680
What matters to Director Deng
matters to us.

53
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,021
He's

54
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:11,460
Yanyan's relative.

55
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,301
No.

56
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,700
We can't trouble Yanyan.

57
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:14,581
No.

58
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:15,580
- Madam Zhang.
- No.

59
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:17,260
Don't worry.

60
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,301
Director Deng

61
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,061
can't decide on this matter.

62
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:22,700
It was a decision by our foundation.

63
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:24,380
Is that so?

64
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,860
Madam Zhang.

65
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,260
This is a good thing.

66
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:29,100
We should thank Director Deng.

67
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
Yeah, Zhang.

68
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,700
Otherwise,

69
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,140
where would we get that kind of money?

70
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,341
Then

71
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,901
we're thankful to the Dingshun Group.

72
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:39,420
Thank you.

73
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:42,061
Madam Zhang.

74
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:42,980
This

75
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:44,540
50,000 yuan

76
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:45,501
is from me.

77
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,741
We can't accept personal money.

78
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,621
No.

79
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:49,461
Madam Zhang.

80
00:03:50,221 --> 00:03:51,181
Just consider this

81
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,260
doing me a favor.

82
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,660
Give me a chance

83
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:55,461
to do something

84
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:56,780
for these children.

85
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,061
Thank you.

86
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:10,540
I'll accept it then.

87
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:16,381
Don't worry.

88
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,381
Every donation

89
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,941
will be clearly recorded.

90
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,180
We won't waste a single penny.

91
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:27,266
Please pass on our thanks

92
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,180
to the company.

93
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:28,980
Sure.

94
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,141
We've talked so long,

95
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,821
yet we still don't know
what your name is.

96
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:35,980
My surname is Wu.

97
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:36,701
Wu Bin.

98
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,933
The deputy general manager
of Dingshun Group.

99
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:40,266
Just call me Wu.

100
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:42,180
Here's my business card.

101
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,980
It has my number on it.

102
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:45,333
If you need anything,

103
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,540
call me at any time.

104
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:48,540
Then

105
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:50,341
thank you, Mr. Wu.

106
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,701
Thank you so much.

107
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:52,800
Sit for a bit.

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,341
Madam Zhang.

109
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:55,000
Actually, I've got other things to do.

110
00:04:55,177 --> 00:04:56,100
I'll take my leave.

111
00:04:56,844 --> 00:04:58,500
If anything happens, call me.

112
00:04:59,221 --> 00:04:59,581
Okay.

113
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:00,420
Alright.

114
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:00,900
Thank you.

115
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:01,821
Goodbye.

116
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:03,500
Thank you.

117
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:04,340
Don't walk me out.

118
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:04,740
Alright.

119
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:07,500
Thank you. Take care.

120
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,701
Thanks.

121
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,740
What a good person.

122
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:12,581
Such a good person.

123
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,860
Tuanyuan Restaurant is saved.

124
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,141
It's saved!

125
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:18,860
Quick.

126
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:19,540
Quick.

127
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:20,701
Let's clean up.

128
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,060
Uncle.

129
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:29,781
Eat.

130
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:30,381
Thanks.

131
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:31,420
It smells really good.

132
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:31,901
Thanks.

133
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:32,221
Auntie.

134
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:33,821
Xiuming went to Shencheng again?

135
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:35,021
Yes.

136
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,221
From now on,

137
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:38,860
he'll probably spend most
of his time in Shencheng.

138
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,701
But he told me specifically

139
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:41,821
before he left

140
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:43,941
to make sure
I take good care of you two.

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,300
Or he'll hold me responsible.

142
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:46,980
He also asked me to take you out

143
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,620
for a good meal every week.

144
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:49,777
That kid...

145
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,180
Uncle, Auntie, here's to you.

146
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,620
He grew up with us.

147
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,300
He's like our own son.

148
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,377
No need to be so polite.

149
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:57,100
Here.

150
00:05:57,701 --> 00:05:58,060
Thanks.

151
00:05:58,461 --> 00:05:58,901
Dad, Mom.

152
00:05:59,021 --> 00:05:59,459
Lin.

153
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,533
Yanyan, come in.

154
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:01,300
Where should I sit?

155
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,110
Sit next to your dad.

156
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:02,555
Alright.

157
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:07,100
Look how skinny you've gotten.

158
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,300
Here, we ordered a lot.

159
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:08,821
Eat more.

160
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:10,060
This is way too much.

161
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,155
We can't finish it all.

162
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:13,540
Now that everyone's here,

163
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,300
can I raise a glass first

164
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,461
to celebrate Yanyan

165
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,420
becoming director
of the Anti-abduction Office?

166
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:20,555
Alright, cheers.

167
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,381
Here.

168
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,820
Being a director is no easy job.

169
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,660
Uncle and Auntie must be really proud

170
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,821
to have such a treasure

171
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:29,660
in the family.

172
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:31,100
He's the proudest.

173
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:31,940
The proudest of all.

174
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:33,021
Aren't you proud?

175
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,221
Secretly thrilled?

176
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,100
Of course, I'm happy.

177
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:37,781
She's a leader now,

178
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,461
and she's doing great at work.

179
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:41,540
Of course, I'm happy.

180
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:44,341
All the achievements

181
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,420
belong to the team.

182
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,901
They're all excellent.

183
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:49,701
They helped me a lot.

184
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:52,020
Plus, the increase
in surveillance each year

185
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,060
is like an invisible net.

186
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:56,340
Criminals have nowhere to hide.

187
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,620
Look.

188
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,261
Now that you're a leader,

189
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,941
you talk the talk.

190
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:04,155
Yanyan's accomplishments

191
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:05,660
don't just make Uncle and Auntie proud.

192
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,980
Even I feel proud.

193
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:09,141
Even the girl at Dingshun's front desk
asked me,

194
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,781
"Are you related

195
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,020
to Officer Deng on TV?"

196
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:13,461
Then they all screamed.

197
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:16,044
They thought it was truly
a display of female brilliance.

198
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,060
Lin.

199
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:19,581
How did you know

200
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,580
Tuanyuan Restaurant was short on money?

201
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:23,980
About that...

202
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:25,980
We didn't want you to know.

203
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:27,660
Dingshun

204
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,461
has always had public welfare programs.

205
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,500
Uncle and Auntie told us

206
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,461
about Madam Zhang,

207
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,941
and Xiuming took it to heart.

208
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,620
He didn't tell you

209
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:37,180
because he didn't want to burden you.

210
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,540
This time,

211
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,141
we just contributed some money.

212
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,941
It didn't really solve the core issue.

213
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:47,155
I think it would be better
for Tuanyuan Restaurant

214
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:48,500
to move to somewhere more formal.

215
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:50,940
Recently, we've been trying to connect

216
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,266
with the non-profit organization,
Bring Lost Children Home,

217
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,781
to see if they can

218
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,500
merge with Tuanyuan Restaurant.

219
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:58,100
That way,

220
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,701
we can solve the venue issue

221
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,821
and also ensure

222
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:02,581
a basic guaranteed income for everyone.

223
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,180
This is great.

224
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,200
Alright, Lin.

225
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,021
Tell me more about it later.

226
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,660
I'll raise my glass with orange juice

227
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:09,461
to thank you.

228
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:10,740
You're too kind.

229
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,381
Cheers again.

230
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,941
We're all family, aren't we?

231
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,341
Right.

232
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:14,100
Cheers.

233
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,883
(Tuanyuan)

234
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:19,820
I've already spoken
with Bring Lost Children Home.

235
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:21,901
They agreed
to merge with Tuanyuan Restaurant.

236
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,420
You all can go there as volunteers,

237
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:26,021
and you'll even be paid.

238
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:28,821
Really?

239
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,821
Of course.

240
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:31,420
That's exactly why I came.

241
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,020
I wanted to tell Lawyer Sun first,

242
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,780
but I couldn't reach him earlier.

243
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,941
Lawyer Sun

244
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,821
has a lot of legal experience.

245
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,140
He could be the branch director.

246
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,100
Would you

247
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:45,620
all be willing?

248
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:46,740
Would you go?

249
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,900
Of course.

250
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,461
Liu and I are old.

251
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:54,500
We're slow learners,

252
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,860
and we don't know computers.

253
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:57,341
Will they

254
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,500
even want us?

255
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:01,941
Don't worry.

256
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,461
It's a non-profit organization.

257
00:09:04,581 --> 00:09:06,341
They'll assign you

258
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:08,260
roles based on your strengths.

259
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,581
That's right.

260
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,260
They need to eat.

261
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,661
I'll keep working as a cook then.

262
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:15,620
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

263
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,061
Well...

264
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,140
Having a job with pay?

265
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,140
That's perfect.

266
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:20,860
Well...

267
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,541
Will we have to split up?

268
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,060
Here's the thing.

269
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:28,419
Don't worry about that.

270
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,470
Once you're there,
we'll explain everything to them.

271
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,780
Then, you can all work together

272
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,301
and support each other.

273
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,221
That's great.

274
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,260
Alright.

275
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,461
I'm in.

276
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,140
Great.

277
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,580
Let's wait for Madam Zhang's return

278
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,061
and tell her the good news.

279
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:43,740
Okay.

280
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:44,140
Okay.

281
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:45,500
Here she is.

282
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:47,061
Madam Zhang.

283
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,100
Madam Zhang.

284
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:49,541
Director Deng said

285
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,620
we're merging

286
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,140
with a non-profit organization
called Bring Lost Children Home.

287
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,461
And we're moving to somewhere better.

288
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,461
That's great news.

289
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:05,620
Go ahead then.

290
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,740
What we meant was...

291
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:08,701
Madam Zhang...

292
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:10,100
Let's all go together.

293
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,740
I'm not going.

294
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:15,860
I'm staying right here.

295
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
I won't leave Tuanyuan Restaurant.

296
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,821
Zhang.

297
00:10:34,555 --> 00:10:35,311
It's okay.

298
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:36,421
I'll talk to her.

299
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:46,421
Madam Zhang.

300
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:52,100
Madam Zhang.

301
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:54,020
Well...

302
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,181
Tuanyuan Restaurant

303
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:58,060
merging with Bring Lost Children Home

304
00:10:58,461 --> 00:10:59,980
is good for us.

305
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:04,980
Yanyan.

306
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:07,701
I appreciate your kindness,

307
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:10,181
but

308
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,581
I really don't want to go.

309
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:18,061
I've just gotten used to living here.

310
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:19,541
I don't want to move.

311
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:20,940
I don't want to leave.

312
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:22,179
I'll stay here.

313
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,701
Here's the thing, Madam Zhang. Look.

314
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:25,061
Rent around here

315
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:26,341
is increasing.

316
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,701
If

317
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,900
we can merge
with Bring Lost Children Home,

318
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,421
at least

319
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,860
we won't have to
worry about rent anymore.

320
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:36,980
I can

321
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:39,181
sell the old house.

322
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:41,541
That should cover the rent.

323
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,061
That won't do. If you sell your house,

324
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:45,061
where would you live?

325
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,860
I'll eventually find somewhere to live.

326
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:48,780
Anyway,

327
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:50,301
I don't want to go.

328
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,421
Madam Zhang.

329
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,421
Is there something
you're not telling me?

330
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,581
Yanyan.

331
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:15,260
Look.

332
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,301
It's been over 20 years.

333
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:18,420
Everything outside

334
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,140
has all changed.

335
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,020
You might not remember,

336
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,140
but that mall across the street

337
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,221
used to be a convenience store.

338
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,221
And that park nearby

339
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,941
used to be a hardware store.

340
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,620
Everything

341
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:33,900
around here has been torn down.

342
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:36,701
But only this noodle shop

343
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:39,780
has been here since you were kids.

344
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,620
It's where you and Ranran used to play.

345
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,701
Ranran...

346
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,100
Ranran got lost

347
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,341
right around the corner ahead.

348
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:55,555
After Ranran went missing...

349
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,980
(I took over this shop.)

350
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,821
(Tell me.)

351
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:03,221
(If I move away,)

352
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,780
(this place)

353
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:05,941
(might)

354
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:09,421
get demolished, just like the others.

355
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,541
If Ranran comes back someday,

356
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:14,460
everything will be unfamiliar to her.

357
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:17,980
She won't be able to find her way home.

358
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,260
Anyway,

359
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:24,421
I'm not going anywhere.

360
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:25,740
I'll wait right here.

361
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,181
(When Ranran comes home,)

362
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,980
(I'll make)

363
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,061
(her favorite vegetarian rice noodles,)

364
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:33,260
(sweet-and-sour radish,)

365
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,941
(and spicy dried beef.)

366
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:38,581
I'm not going anywhere.

367
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,221
I'll wait right here.

Ranran.

375
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:45,740
Wait just a little longer.

376
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,540
I'll find you soon.

377
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,100

for over 20 years.

381
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:28,301

00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,661
was abducted on September 2, 1996.

387
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:41,941
Zhao Qihong

388
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,541
was abducted on July 24, 1994.

389
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:49,900
And this girl...

390
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:52,740
Do you recognize her?

391
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,500
(Dishwasher, Waitress)

392
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,821
No.

393
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:08,819
You think you can get away

394
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,755
if you don't talk?

395
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,620
This...

396
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:13,461
This child in the photo

397
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:15,260
was also abducted

398
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:16,140
by you.

399
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:17,980
This one?

400
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,780
I remember.

401
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:22,100
It was a joke.

402
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,061
Later on,

403
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:25,701
I sent the child back, didn't I?

404
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,380
You took 30,000 yuan as a joke?

405
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,461
It's a misunderstanding.

406
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:32,780
How about

407
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:33,940
I return the money now?

408
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,100
I'm asking you if you admit it.

409
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,221
I...

410
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:47,740
Do you remember Luo Xiaoyu?

411
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:50,821
No.

412
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:54,700
How about Sun Xiaoguang?

413
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,620
Well...

414
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,181
I'm not the person you're looking for.

415
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:00,780
You've got the wrong guy.

416
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,380
I'm just a farmer.

417
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,540
I'm just

418
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,540
an old bachelor
doing odd jobs in the city.

419
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:10,980
I just casually
wandered into the mountains.

420
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:12,580
Who knew

421
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,500
I was caught in a wild boar trap?

422
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,780
Luckily,

423
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:18,221
you rescued me.

424
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,500
Otherwise,

425
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,221
I'd be dead by now.

426
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,701
I wanted

427
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:24,901
to thank you properly

428
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:25,820
and give you

429
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,300
a banner in appreciation.

430
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:29,461
But who knew

431
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:30,580
I'd end up

432
00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:31,740
getting locked up instead?

433
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,500
I've really been wronged.

434
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:35,020
Wronged!

435
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:36,461
Are you done?

436
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,540
Officers.

437
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,221
I really don't know

438
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,820
what you said.

439
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:45,980
I don't know

440
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,701
the people in these photos.

441
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,340
How did it go?

442
00:17:58,688 --> 00:17:59,740
He denied everything

443
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:00,760
and said he knew nothing.

444
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,621
He won't even admit

445
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:02,780
to She Qinglin's case.

446
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:06,381
If he keeps denying, what can we do?

447
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:07,900
It's fine.

448
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:09,941
Even if he denies everything,

449
00:18:09,977 --> 00:18:11,460
he still has to sign the statement.

450
00:18:11,844 --> 00:18:14,333
We can use his signature
to verify the handwriting.

451
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:15,980
As long as it matches the handwriting

452
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:18,340
from the ransom note
in She Qinglin's son's case,

453
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,511
he won't be able to deny it.

454
00:18:19,822 --> 00:18:22,020
Let's settle
the case of She Qinglin's son first.

455
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:23,540
Deliver this to the tech department.

456
00:18:23,555 --> 00:18:24,700
Have them analyze it.

457
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:25,260
Okay.

458
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,780
Gang.

459
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:50,980
Didn't I tell you not to come?

460
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,933
Why are you here again?

461
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:53,580
Say what you have to say, or get lost.

462
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:56,340
Why are you so angry again?

463
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,861
Old Yellow Dog
has never even seen your face.

464
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:01,740
What are you afraid of?

465
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,340
You're always cautious,

466
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,555
not leaving a single trace.

467
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,980
My whole business is falling apart,

468
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:10,381
and you still want to joke?

469
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:12,141
Say what you have to say, or get lost.

470
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,020
It's just making money.

471
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,461
Just traffic more girls.

472
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:16,621
Easy for you to say.

473
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:18,459
Skinner's gone, and Fei Yan went abroad.

474
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,400
The police are after us.

475
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:20,777
How am I supposed to traffic girls?

476
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:23,020
Just because
they're watching us closely,

477
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:24,340
we should push harder.

478
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:25,622
What do you mean?

479
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,844
I have an idea.

480
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,260
You want to hear it?

481
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:31,861
What idea could you have?

482
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,621
This business

483
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:37,820
is hard to run in China now.

484
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,540
So don't do it in China.

485
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,660
We only recruit workers here.

486
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,580
Once they're abroad,

487
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,500
their whereabouts are up to fate.

488
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:46,220
Can we pull it off?

489
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,461
Of course.

490
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:52,901
You know what?

491
00:19:54,621 --> 00:19:56,421
That's not a bad idea.

492
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:00,740
The police are working around China,

493
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,290
and no one would suspect
that my business is still going strong.

494
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:05,181
If you ask me,

495
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:07,780
nothing is more vicious than a woman.

496
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:09,980
When a woman gets ruthless,

497
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,141
men don't stand a chance.

498
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,780
I like your style.

499
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,861
You're ruthless.

500
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:17,540
The moment I saw you,

501
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,621
I knew you were not like those fools.

502
00:20:21,141 --> 00:20:23,300
Only you can team up with me.

503
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:24,701
You're annoying.

504
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,060
Huang Chuan,

505
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:31,155
nicknamed Old Yellow Dog,

506
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,620
was born on August 12, 1953,

507
00:20:34,181 --> 00:20:35,540
in Pangge Village, Linshan City.

508
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,780
He left Linshan City at age 27

509
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:39,060
and moved to Xinyang Province.

510
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:42,500
Later, he moved around provinces.

511
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,380
He's a suspect
in multiple trafficking cases.

512
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,580
Over 50 years old

513
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:47,820
with

514
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:49,060
average height.

515
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,941
Slightly balding.

516
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:53,340
His most

517
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,340
noticeable feature

518
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,500
is a mole on his face.

519
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,141
Based on the description

520
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:01,340
given by Wang Guangqing,

521
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,239
we coincidentally caught Huang Chuan

522
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,390
(in a trail at the southern foot
of Shangrui Mountain.)

523
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,221
Don't touch...

524
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:06,941
Ouch.

525
00:21:09,488 --> 00:21:10,577
You're Old Yellow Dog.

526
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,220
(Though She Qinglin
didn't call the police in time,)

527
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,101
(which hindered our probe,)

528
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,379
(his wife)

529
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,333
(secretly kept evidence
of Huang Chuan's crimes.)

530
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:20,381
Jiajia.

531
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:23,660
Everyone,

532
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,221
this candied haw was found at the scene.

533
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:27,861
Surveillance at the scene

534
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:29,141
(proves it was used)

535
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:31,701
(by the suspect to lure the child.)

536
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,780
(The tech department's)

537
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,369
(trying to lift fingerprints from it.)

538
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,177
Cong!

539
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:36,060
(Besides that,)

540
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,461
a ransom note

541
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,911
(is under handwriting analysis.)

542
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:40,461
(Due to late reporting,)

543
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:43,020
(the family didn't store
the evidence properly.)

544
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:45,060
So the tech team still needs time

545
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:46,111
to extract evidence.

546
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:48,380
Once the fingerprints and handwriting

547
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:49,421
match Huang Chuan's,

548
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:51,580
the evidence chain for the case
will be complete.

549
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,701
We can then prosecute Huang Chuan.

550
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:55,980
We'll also have time to dig
into his old cases

551
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,141
and possible accomplices.

552
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,700
Comrades.

553
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,381
Huang Chuan's arrest

554
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:02,340
marks a milestone

555
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,060
in Linshan's anti-trafficking effort.

556
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,701
I have only one stance.

557
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,140
Anti-abduction Office,
stay sharp and keep digging.

558
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:10,333
Criminal Police Unit.

559
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,381
Find Huang Chuan's address
in Mangma Town.

560
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,780
Report any findings immediately.

561
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,461
- Yes.
- Yes.

562
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,740
Eat first, Rui.

563
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,740
Director.

564
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,260
He's lost in thought.

565
00:22:43,688 --> 00:22:44,820
Huang hasn't talked?

566
00:22:45,888 --> 00:22:47,780
He just won't cry
until he sees the coffin.

567
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:50,141
Experienced traffickers like Huang Chuan

568
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,740
are tough to crack.

569
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:52,901
Let's wait.

570
00:22:53,181 --> 00:22:54,540
Vice Director Yin said so too.

571
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:57,020
Speaking of,

572
00:22:57,181 --> 00:22:58,421
the tech department said

573
00:22:58,421 --> 00:22:59,621
the results are almost ready.

574
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:03,701
Haste makes waste.

575
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:05,488
The more you rush,
the less you get done.

576
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:11,300
I'll urge the tech department.

577
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:13,300
Rui, you...

578
00:23:15,444 --> 00:23:16,600
He's even skipping his meal.

579
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,580
Delicious.

580
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,180
(Anti-abduction Office)

581
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,222
You should eat when it's meal time.

582
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:44,780
Have you eaten?

583
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:45,580
I have.

584
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:49,911
How did it go?

585
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,500
We got the results?

586
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:54,701
The handwriting analysis is out.

587
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,340
It proves that he wrote the note.

588
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,381
More importantly,

589
00:23:57,444 --> 00:23:58,980
the DNA and fingerprints matched.

590
00:24:00,421 --> 00:24:00,980
Besides,

591
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:02,500
his DNA

592
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:03,300
also matched

593
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,421
the hair

594
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:06,181
found in Madam Hong's rental.

595
00:24:06,422 --> 00:24:07,460
Skinner was right.

596
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,621
They're a couple.

597
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,500
So?

598
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:11,460
Once you finish,
we'll go interrogate him.

599
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,181
Not yet.

600
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:14,380
Let him be.

601
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:16,420
Let him mumble to himself.

602
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:19,861
We still have one last card.

603
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,780
Ai Xin.

604
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:36,540
(Sorry for making you wait so long.)

605
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:37,500
It's okay.

606
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:39,221
I think your place is relaxing.

607
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:41,980
You must find it healing
to see them every day.

608
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,701
It's all thanks to Mr. Yin.

609
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:45,740
Back then,

610
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,060
if he hadn't told me to study grooming,

611
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,300
I might still not know a thing today.

612
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:52,181
Mr. Yin said

613
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,861
you're capable, hardworking,

614
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,780
and diligent.

615
00:24:56,701 --> 00:24:57,461
By the way, Ai Xin,

616
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,941
did you come to see me

617
00:24:58,941 --> 00:24:59,820
for something?

618
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:03,661
The trafficker who abducted you

619
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,141
has been caught.

620
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:13,060
Meiyu.

621
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:16,740
Do you remember his face?

622
00:25:18,661 --> 00:25:20,221
We need you to identify him.

623
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:23,940
Tile worker, take a look.

624
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,820
Hiring?

625
00:25:24,844 --> 00:25:25,860
Dishwashing and cooking.

626
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,780
Tile worker.

627
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,260
Sir.

628
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,580
What workers do you need?

629
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,580
Dishwasher and waitress?

630
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,780
Miss.

631
00:25:40,661 --> 00:25:42,101
Can you babysit?

632
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,540
Yes, I can do it.

633
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,580
I've got experience.

634
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,955
Choose me. I raised three kids.

635
00:25:48,977 --> 00:25:49,940
I've got experience.

636
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:50,421
I can do it.

637
00:25:50,941 --> 00:25:51,381
Get in.

638
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:54,621
He took the younger one.

639
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:56,340
Sit tight.

640
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,701
If you obey,

641
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,101
you'll suffer less.

642
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:19,820
Meiyu.

643
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,461
Are you ready?

644
00:27:24,555 --> 00:27:25,540
Don't be afraid.

645
00:27:31,977 --> 00:27:32,977
Let's go.

646
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,020
Let's begin.

647
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:39,980
Bring them in.

648
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,141
Just look here.

649
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,340
Can you see clearly?

650
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,181
Let's move closer.

651
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:22,901
Don't worry.

652
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:23,620
Come on.

653
00:28:37,622 --> 00:28:39,180
Raise your heads!

654
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,461
(If you obey, you'll suffer less.)

655
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,060
You'll suffer less.

656
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:24,260
Did you recognize him?

657
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,460
I think it's number 5.

658
00:29:44,622 --> 00:29:45,422
Thank you.

659
00:30:15,444 --> 00:30:16,340
Have some water.

660
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,421
You did amazing today.

661
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:21,941
Thank you.

662
00:30:31,181 --> 00:30:33,101
I'll never forget those things.

663
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,580
They beat me

664
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:39,380
and forced me...

665
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:43,500
All these years,

666
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,580
I've tried to forget everything,

667
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,101
but

668
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,861
even in my dreams,

669
00:30:53,181 --> 00:30:54,461
I still see his face

670
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,980
and what happened.

671
00:30:57,888 --> 00:30:58,860
Don't be afraid.

672
00:30:58,866 --> 00:30:59,820
It's all in the past.

673
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:09,621
Meiyu.

674
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:11,181
Listen to me.

675
00:31:11,461 --> 00:31:13,101
If you're upset, don't hold back.

676
00:31:13,101 --> 00:31:13,701
Let it out.

677
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,421
You'll feel better after crying.

678
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,260
No.

679
00:31:20,101 --> 00:31:21,141
I won't cry.

680
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:24,420
He should be the one crying.

681
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,181
Before seeing him,

682
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,181
I thought

683
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:32,060
I would be scared.

684
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:36,141
But while identifying him earlier,

685
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:39,060
I wasn't afraid.

686
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,700
He's the one
who committed a lot of sins.

687
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:44,740
He was caught.

688
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:47,260
I'm not afraid of him anymore.

689
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,181
Yes.

690
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:50,701
We're not afraid of him.

691
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:53,139
Do you know how brave you were

692
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,200
while you were in there?

693
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,661
You didn't just help us
identify Huang Chuan,

694
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:59,300
you helped many other victims.

695
00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:01,421
I thank you for them.

696
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:02,901
You're amazing.

697
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:06,733
It's all in the past.

698
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:20,661
I'm dying!

699
00:32:20,861 --> 00:32:23,461
I'm dying!

700
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:25,221
Ouch.

701
00:32:26,701 --> 00:32:27,421
Get a doctor.

702
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:29,260
It hurts so bad.

703
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,221
Get a doctor! Hurry!

704
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,020
I'm dying!

705
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,740
Cut the act.

706
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,540
That's enough.

707
00:32:43,901 --> 00:32:45,340
You're almost in your coffin.

708
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,421
Still no remorse?

709
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:58,060
This girl is Ruan Meiyu.

710
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,860
I showed you her photo yesterday.

711
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,300
You said you didn't know her,

712
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,260
but she just identified you.

713
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,141
You may forget her,

714
00:33:05,141 --> 00:33:06,461
but she'll never forget you.

715
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:08,381
You're over 50, right?

716
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:10,221
Think for yourself.

717
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,621
In your past years,

718
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:13,180
how many lives and families

719
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,461
have you destroyed?

720
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,101
Some of the people you abducted

721
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,419
are dead now.

722
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,400
Some might still be trapped
deep in the mountains.

723
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:22,780
You ruined many families.

724
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,901
Don't tell me you don't remember.

725
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:27,181
You should know fate at 50.

726
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:30,500
And your fate is to face justice.

727
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:33,180
This is evidence
from She Qinglin's case.

728
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:34,540
We've verified

729
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:36,044
that it matches your handwriting.

730
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,901
Including surveillance footage,

731
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:39,780
you can't escape.

732
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:41,820
Take this.

733
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:45,141
At the scene,

734
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:46,621
you heard something

735
00:33:47,381 --> 00:33:48,540
and rushed to grab the child.

736
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,155
Cong.

737
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,420
(But you didn't notice
you dropped a tanghulu.)

738
00:33:54,181 --> 00:33:56,221
(Even though She Qinglin
didn't call the police,)

739
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,621
(they still held on
to that piece of evidence.)

740
00:33:59,155 --> 00:34:00,620
(Your fingerprints are on it.)

741
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:03,540
You're probably wondering

742
00:34:03,901 --> 00:34:05,621
how we found She Qinglin.

743
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:06,701
Right?

744
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:10,981
Wang Guangqing.

745
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:13,780
(He told us everything.)

746
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,581
He described your appearance.

747
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:19,900
(After 20 years,)

748
00:34:20,044 --> 00:34:21,777
(we finally knew what you looked like.)

749
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:24,940
Wang Guangqing also gave us

750
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,221
one key lead.

751
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:27,940
He said you knew Madam Hong.

752
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,221
Who's Madam Hong?

753
00:34:30,581 --> 00:34:32,740
You two were more than acquaintances.

754
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,260
I don't know her.

755
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,380
He said you two were a couple.

756
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:41,780
Dog.

757
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,380
Looks like you found true love.

758
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,300
We lived together as a couple
for 20 years.

759
00:34:53,688 --> 00:34:55,740
Madam Hong
was also a habitual trafficker.

760
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:58,620
We found the rental
she stayed in long-term

761
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,701
and found some hair inside.

762
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:13,780
DNA comparison

763
00:35:15,311 --> 00:35:16,820
shows the hair belonged to you.

764
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,940
(Suspect's Hair)

765
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:20,740
Since

766
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:23,021
you've got evidence,

767
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:24,340
sentence me.

768
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,460
I did

769
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,940
all the things you said.

770
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,420
I know a bit about you.

771
00:35:35,101 --> 00:35:36,340
You're well-known

772
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,061
in your circle.

773
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,181
You're not dumb.

774
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:44,340
Tell me

775
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:46,181
why you were so stupid.

776
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:48,541
You were fooled by a woman.

777
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,661
Says who?

778
00:35:54,141 --> 00:35:55,181
Stop denying it.

779
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,860
Skinner already told us

780
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,021
Madam Hong ran off with your money

781
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:01,061
and left you to take the fall.

782
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,661
I'm telling you.

783
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,541
If you don't confess

784
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:07,740
to everything you two did,

785
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:09,460
we'll report you as the primary offender

786
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,380
to the prosecutor.

787
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:12,061
Madam Hong is amazing.

788
00:36:12,177 --> 00:36:13,460
She'd done a lifetime of crime

789
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,380
and found someone loyal
to take the blame.

790
00:36:20,021 --> 00:36:20,661
You won't talk?

791
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,820
Fine. We'll stop here.

792
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:23,780
We'll continue later.

793
00:36:26,661 --> 00:36:27,460
Wait.

794
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:28,581
Wait.

795
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:30,300
Officers.

796
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,541
I really don't know where she went,

797
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,061
but

798
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,101
I remember

799
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:39,101
the people I trafficked.

800
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:40,900
I'll tell you

801
00:36:41,621 --> 00:36:42,501
where they are now.

802
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:04,860
I remember

803
00:37:06,501 --> 00:37:07,340
this one.

804
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:09,940
Yang Caiyun,

805
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:11,061
was abducted at 16.

806
00:37:11,288 --> 00:37:13,380
Huang Chuan sold her
to a buyer in Wushun County.

807
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,661
Yang Caiyun,

808
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,940
was born on June 14, 1974.

809
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:21,740
She's from Wu Village,
Shuangjin County, Linshan City.

810
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,260
On August 3, 1990,

811
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,021
she was trafficked
at a market in Shuangjin County.

812
00:37:28,733 --> 00:37:29,844
How do you know so much?

813
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,820
It was my first case

814
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,220
after joining Anti-abduction Office.

815
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:34,940
Even though I solved many cases,

816
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:36,701
we never found

817
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,141
Yang Caiyun.

818
00:37:40,911 --> 00:37:42,044
What about her parents?

819
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,101
How are they?

820
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,621
They both passed away.

821
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:49,221
What a pity.

822
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:51,181
They died,

823
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,181
never seeing their daughter again.

824
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,581
I remember her parents

825
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:03,661
kneeling before us,

826
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:05,541
begging us to find their daughter.

827
00:38:12,221 --> 00:38:14,541
This case has been like a thorn

828
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:17,460
that's stuck in my heart.

829
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,980
(Huang Chuan, Ruan Meiyu, Yang Caiyun)

830
00:38:38,844 --> 00:38:39,900
Madam Zhang.

831
00:38:40,581 --> 00:38:42,260
Look, there are fewer and fewer

832
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,501
photos on the wall.

833
00:38:44,061 --> 00:38:44,780
Happy?

834
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:48,940
Yes.

835
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,541
Food's all served.

836
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,501
Seeing these families reunite,
one by one,

837
00:38:54,981 --> 00:38:57,101
I'm genuinely happy.

838
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:03,141
If our Ranran came back,

839
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,621
it'd be even livelier.

840
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:07,780
Yeah.

841
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:09,820
They're reuniting

842
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:10,981
one after another,

843
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:12,900
but we...

844
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:15,740
Yeah...

845
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:17,820
It's great.

846
00:39:20,101 --> 00:39:21,021
I wonder

847
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,621
how my son is doing.

848
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:27,701
Maybe he's with someone else too.

849
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:46,340
It's all my fault.

850
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,380
Enough about this.

851
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,340
Meilian.

852
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:53,900
We have to stay hopeful.

853
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,380
Look at Anti-abduction Office.

854
00:39:59,061 --> 00:39:59,541
They've

855
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:02,021
solved so many major cases.

856
00:40:02,141 --> 00:40:03,860
They found so many kids.

857
00:40:04,221 --> 00:40:05,460
We have to believe

858
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:08,621
we'll also reunite

859
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,300
with our families soon.

860
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:12,101
Yes.

861
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:13,900
I trust Director Deng.

862
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,141
Look.

863
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:16,780
She just took over,

864
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,820
and she has solved
many major cases already.

865
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:21,660
She'll definitely

866
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:22,460
find Xiaoyu.

867
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:24,740
Yes.

868
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,900
We have to believe
in Anti-abduction Office

869
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:30,380
and Director Deng.

870
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:31,501
We must have hope.

871
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,380
Have hope.

872
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:32,860
Yes.

873
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,141
Have hope.

874
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:34,780
Come on.

875
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,288
Let's eat hotpot.

876
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:38,621
Come on, dig in.

877
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,701
Tuanyuan Restaurant survived

878
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,581
because of you.

879
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,820
You've worked hard.

880
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,940
Let's eat hotpot.

881
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:45,780
Yes.

882
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,061
Let's eat.

883
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,260
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

884
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,222
(Huang Chuan confessed)

885
00:40:57,533 --> 00:40:59,500
(he and Madam Hong
trafficked over 30 kids.)

886
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:02,220
Their information
has been sent to local stations.

887
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:07,101
Did Huang mention where Madam Hong is?

888
00:41:08,022 --> 00:41:09,620
He kept saying he doesn't know.

889
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:12,260
What about Cripple?

890
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,181
Speaking of this,

891
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,021
it's strange.

892
00:41:20,661 --> 00:41:21,701
He told me

893
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,701
Cripple hasn't contacted him
for many years.

894
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:26,340
He even asked

895
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,666
if we had already caught Cripple.

896
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,701
(Madam Hong)

897
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:32,300
That's different from what Skinner said.

898
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,780
Does he know Fei Yan?

899
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:36,621
He said he never heard the name.

900
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:39,140
(Cripple)

901
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,101
Is it possible

902
00:41:42,422 --> 00:41:43,860
that Cripple is already dead?

903
00:41:44,221 --> 00:41:45,940
Someone else is just using his name?

904
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,501
Like Fei Yan.

905
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,541
It's possible,

906
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,820
but it's uncertain.

907
00:41:51,221 --> 00:41:52,820
We have to catch Fei Yan to confirm it.

908
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,340
All connections

909
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,900
might be related to Fei Yan,

910
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,061
but Fei Yan is missing.

911
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:03,701
With Fei Yan gone,

912
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,740
we don't know where to find Cripple.

913
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:08,580
Let's not overthink it first.

914
00:42:09,181 --> 00:42:10,981
Let's meet Mr. Yin
in Wushun County tomorrow.

915
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:13,900
You go ahead tomorrow.

916
00:42:13,977 --> 00:42:15,590
I have to visit Bring Lost Children Home

917
00:42:16,181 --> 00:42:17,141
to see if there are

918
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,260
other merger options.

919
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,061
I'll come after I'm done.

920
00:42:25,444 --> 00:42:26,555
(Cripple)

921
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,420
Tell me.

922
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,740
If Cripple's still alive,

923
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,621
where could he be hiding?

924
00:42:32,022 --> 00:42:33,700
(Wushun County Police Bureau)

925
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:35,501
After receiving the request,

926
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,181
we began verifying the location

927
00:42:38,777 --> 00:42:40,488
where Huang Chuan said

928
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:42,180
he sold Yang Caiyun in his confession.

929
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:45,740
There are 13 villages
matching the description.

930
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,780
We've gone through

931
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:48,981
all 13 villages,

932
00:42:49,621 --> 00:42:51,181
but we haven't found

933
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,300
anyone resembling Yang Caiyun.

934
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:57,221
In those 13 villages,

935
00:42:57,501 --> 00:42:58,380
were there

936
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,221
other similar cases

937
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:02,621
