It's okay

356
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You can buy this for me

357
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's not expensive

358
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000

359
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000

364
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
English four-character

It's okay

368
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's okay

369
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's not easy to learn

370
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's not easy to learn

371
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Look

372
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Zhou Min's case has not been solved yet

373
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's only a few days

374
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Another Zheng Weiwei was kidnapped

375
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Our Lin Shan City has been holding

376
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
a special organization for the kidnapping

377
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
How many days have passed?

378
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
13 days a month

379
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And there are still criminals

380
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
who are making trouble in the street

381
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It has caused a lot of trouble to the society

382
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
This painting is too unclear

383
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I think this man's work

384
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's not the first time he's done this

385
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And

386
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
People who can do this kind of thing in Lin Shan City

387
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Should know each other

388
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
This idea is good

389
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Officer Chang

390
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Do you have any opinions?

391
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I

392
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I have no opinion

393
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Listen to the leader

394
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
How about this?

395
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Jiajia, Lao Yi

396
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
You go and check Zhao Liang

397
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It turns out that you go to check Hu Xifan

398
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You and Officer Chang Wei

399
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Go to the scene one by one

400
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Everyone split up

401
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
it is good

402
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
This environment doesn't look like it

403
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
There is a surveillance camera that can shoot clearly

404
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
This is over

405
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It's a waste of time

406
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's a waste of time

407
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
They have to come

408
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
They have three new positions

409
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yes

410
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Come

411
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Come

412
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Come

413
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Come

414
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Come

415
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Come

416
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Come

417
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Come

418
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Where is it?

419
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
This shop

420
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Boss

421
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What do you want?

422
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Hello

423
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Please recall

424
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Around 11 o'clock last night

425
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Is there a couple

426
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Came to buy things

427
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
What does Zhao Liang have to do with you?

428
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Zhao Liang

429
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Zhao Liang, yes

430
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Zhao Liang is the one who turns people

431
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
He turned people yesterday

432
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I

433
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I just introduce some customers

434
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Make some middlemen

435
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It has nothing to do with me

436
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Hu Xifan

437
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I will ask you one last time

438
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
What does Zhao Liang have to do with you?

439
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And

440
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Do you remember the girl you kidnapped last night?

441
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
The tie is not bad

442
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
A plus

443
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
This age looks like

444
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
27.62

445
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I tell you

446
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
This

447
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I was originally caught

448
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
A gold three or four golds

449
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I have to get rid of it

450
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I caught this stupid

451
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I hit my shoulder

452
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Just this face

453
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
This body

454
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
As long as it is a gold

455
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
We will be rich

456
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
His real identity is the police

457
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You should know the consequences of kidnapping the police

458
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Think about it

459
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
This is your last chance to confess

460
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
No, no, no, I say

461
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I have to go to the county

462
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
This

463
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
This

464
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
This is a white lie

465
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
The police came to ask me once in the morning

466
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I will give you the surveillance

467
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
We have a lot of customers every day

468
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
That night

469
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I didn't see their face clearly

470
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Who is that black car?

471
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I do not know

472
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
That car has been parked there for several days

473
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
How do you know

474
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I have been in the store for a few days

475
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I also play with my classmates next to that car

476
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
go

477
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
According to this light, he is a subordinate of Hu Xifan

478
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Some orders are heard from Hu Xifan

479
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But the rest is not known

480
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
According to Hu Xifan's confession

481
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The white board is indeed his holy thread

482
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
This white board once said

483
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
He wants to make a big order

484
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
He must do it himself

485
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And he likes to use drugs

486
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
That is in line with the situation of Zheng Weiwei

487
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
If it can prove

488
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The white board is indeed involved in Zheng Weiwei's case

489
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
By then we can apply with the superior

490
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Make Zheng Weiwei's case and Zheng Ming's case a case

491
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But now Zheng Weiwei's case

492
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
We do not have any clear evidence to prove

493
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
This matter was done by the white board

494
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And the surveillance video is so vague

495
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Hu Xifan can't identify at all

496
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Is this person a white board?

497
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Contact the owner

498
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
it is good

499
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Do you know the person in the photo?

500
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
What are you doing?

501
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Sit down

502
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yes, he is the white board

503
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
He is actually the main criminal

504
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I am a subordinate

505
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
We all listen to him

506
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So, officer

507
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
If I say everything

508
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Can I...

509
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Answer what I ask you

510
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Do you know why I answer?

511
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Have you seen this person?

512
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I don't remember

513
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Think about it

514
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Look again

515
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It seems that

516
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It seems that

517
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
A month ago

518
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That

519
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I have seen

520
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
No, no, no

521
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That, that, that

522
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I, I, I

523
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I seem to have seen this girl

524
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Later, the white board took it away

525
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Where did they go specifically?

526
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I really don't know

527
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
According to Hu Xifan's explanation

528
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
The person who took away Zheng Weiwei in the video

529
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Is the white board, Bai Wentao

530
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It is also the big fish we caught last time

531
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Now the case of Zheng Weiwei has been confirmed

532
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
It is also related to this white board

533
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So I suggest

534
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Let Zheng Weiwei's case and Zhou Min's case be one

535
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So you are now playing the board

536
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Find this white board at the fastest speed

537
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
According to the current situation

538
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
The victim in his hand

539
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Not only Zhou Min and Zheng Weiwei

540
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
These two people

541
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I agree to the conscience of the case

542
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
We will handle the case

543
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Everyone

544
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Hanzhi has agreed

545
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Zheng Weiwei and Zhou Min's case

546
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's a case

547
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Now the white board is

548
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
The biggest suspect in this case

549
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
If we want to catch the white board

550
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
We must collect more evidence of his

551
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So, Mr. Zhang

552
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You go and collect some previous cases

553
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Maybe it has something to do with the white board

554
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
it is good

555
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Jia Jia, look at the video

556
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
See if there is anything

557
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Details related to the white board

558
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Yes

559
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Chaorui has more social relations

560
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
See if there are any clues about the white board

561
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Yan Lei, A Xin

562
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
You two go to interrogate Zhao Liang

563
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Okay

564
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Officer, I don't know anything

565
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
White board

566
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Do you know?

567
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
White board

568
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Zhao Liang

569
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
The suspect has been told

570
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
The white board is your superior

571
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
If you want to make a contribution

572
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
You'd better tell me now

573
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Okay, I'll tell you

574
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'll tell you

575
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
The white board is my boss

576
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I just called him and he answered

577
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But I don't know much about him

578
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I don't even know his name

579
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Really

580
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And?

581
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And the person who took the child

582
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Fan Fang

583
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
She is dating the white board's father

584
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Then she must be the daughter of the white board

585
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
She is with the white board all day

586
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Then she must know a lot

587
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I think you should go and ask that child

588
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
According to Zhao Liang

589
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Fan Fang is adopted by the white board

590
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So I am thinking

591
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Can we ask some things about the white board

592
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Through Fan Fang

593
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But Fan Fang has been living with the white board's father

594
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
for many years

595
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
She is very strange

596
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
She even thinks we are bad people

597
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I am a police

598
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I'll take you home

599
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Stop her

600
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Let me go

601
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
No

602
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I think it's hard to tell the white board from her

603
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But don't you think it's strange?

604
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Can a human like the white board

605
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
take a child legally?

606
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Or is this child their relative's?

607
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It's impossible

608
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Maybe

609
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
This Fan Fang

610
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
was also adopted by the white board

611
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
The person who is different from the other

612
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
is waiting in the dark night

613
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The brave person

614
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
What kind of identity

615
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
The unchanging is

616
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
the sincerity in the heart

617
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Finally, I became

618
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
such a person

619
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Every number

620
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
of memories

621
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
For love

622
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Who has

623
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
For the memory

624
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
and this life

625
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I can't help but be obsessed with the eyes

626
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I want to hold the hand

627
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
and keep walking

628
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I set the eyes

629
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I hold the hand

630
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
The softness of the blue

631
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
One moment is the dream

632
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I set the present

633
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I turn around

634
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
The warmness of time

635
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
is with her

636
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
There is no one standing

637
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
behind the time

638
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Hugging the years

639
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
She will never give up

640
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Just like my heart

641
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
She will never give up

642
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
The softness of the blue

643
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
She will never give up
