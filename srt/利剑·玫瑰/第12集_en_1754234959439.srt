Episode 2

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Calm down.

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The police are coming back with the baby.

4
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh my god.

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh my god.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
How can they eat so much?

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't touch him.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't touch him.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:25,480
Please understand my great(?)

10
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Jingjing, mom.

11
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Jingjing, mom.

12
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,480
I'm a police officer.

13
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,480
We brought Jingjing back to you.

14
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,480
Look.

15
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,480
She's grown up.

16
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Mom, I'm Jingjing.

17
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,480
I'm back.

18
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Jingjing.

19
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Look at me.

20
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,480
I'm Jingjing.

21
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
I'm back.

22
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Don't be like this, okay?

23
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,480
I won't leave you again.

24
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Be good, okay?

25
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,480
Don't be like this, okay?

26
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,480
Jingjing, mom.

27
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,480
Mom.

28
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
Be good, okay?

29
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Mom.

30
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,480
Jingjing.

31
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Mom.

32
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Jingjing.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Mom.

34
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,480
Jingjing.

35
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,480
Mom.

36
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Jingjing.

37
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,480
Mom.

38
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Jingjing.

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,480
Mom.

40
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
Jingjing.

41
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Mom.

42
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,480
Jingjing.

43
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
Mom.

44
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Jingjing.

45
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
I'm back.

46
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,480
I feel bad for her.

47
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,480
If you're back,

48
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,480
I'm going crazy.

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480
That criminal didn't mean it.

50
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,480
How could he do this to her?

51
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,480
Those people...

52
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,480
for money,

53
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,480
can do anything for free.

54
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,480
That kid is like a family.

55
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,480
There are things that can only be cured by time.

56
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Luckily, the child is back.

57
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,480
His mother should be able to make a difference.

58
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,480
So, as long as we don't give up,

59
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,480
there will be a day when we reunite, right?

60
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Right.

61
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,480
There will be a day when we reunite.

62
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,480
I'm going to make a wish.

63
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,480
I'm going to make a wish.

64
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,480
I'm going to make a wish.

65
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,480
I'm going to make a wish.

66
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm going to make a wish.

67
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,480
I'm going to make a wish.

68
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,480
I'm going to make a wish.

69
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,480
I'm going to make a wish.

70
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,480
I'm going to make a wish.

71
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Much love, 10000

72
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,240
Brother

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680

75
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,240
Yes

76
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
I'm afraid you should go to the girls.

77
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,800
But Ye темпер

78
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,440
Don't run or you are done.

79
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,240
You went back to bed.

80
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,280
They take you back to the suppche Dr. diarrhea,

81
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,640
Shadi,

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,400
They take you back to the suppche doctor.

83
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,900
You go to눈 있다고illä doubt

84
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,320
They take us to **

85
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,960
I think you should go to the girls.

86
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,320
à defile

87
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,640
I really don't expect that part 5،

88
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,240
The black isn't the case.

89
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,440
and Sir Ha is just a case that

90
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,080
you can't kill me if he makes such thing.

91
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,640
What should I do?

92
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,560
I should have killed 10 of them as a trained section guard.

93
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,280
Right.

94
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Okay.

95
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,480
Xiao Dan, this operation is very important.

96
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,280
Don't let Chengcheng take part in it.

97
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,680
Let her rest.

98
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,780
This is what Ms. Xiao means.

99
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,080
Didn't Director Feng ask you to rest?

100
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,580
Why are you here?

101
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,080
Where are they?

102
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,580
They went on a mission.

103
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
I don't know what mission it is.

104
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,080
I just know that they have informed Hongxi City Police.

105
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,080
If you can go, call Director Deng.

106
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,080
They just left.

107
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,580
Director Deng.

108
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,580
Hello.

109
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,080
This is Director Feng of Hongxi City Police.

110
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,080
Hello.

111
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,580
This is our new director Deng.

112
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,580
Hello.

113
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,080
Please tell us what's going on.

114
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,080
We received a call and the password has been sent.

115
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,580
Now we can confirm that Wang Guangqing is inside.

116
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,580
We can't confirm which room it is.

117
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,580
We are waiting for you to come and see how to capture him.

118
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
If we can catch this Qu,

119
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,080
we will be able to get through this case.

120
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,580
That's right.

121
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,580
We can't take care of him yet.

122
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,580
He might have a connection with Qu.

123
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,080
Keep watching.

124
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,580
Director Deng.

125
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Director Deng, you haven't eaten anything for a day.

126
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,580
Eat more.

127
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,580
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,580
Call.

129
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,580
Okay, Director Wang.

130
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,580
Director Deng, I have a situation here.

131
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,080
During the search and surveillance process,

132
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,580
I found that this Qu used a public phone to dial a number.

133
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,080
He also checked the number and said that it had been cancelled a few days ago.

134
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,080
The owner of the number has passed away in two days.

135
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,580
Roger that.

136
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,580
Director Deng, the contact number of the Qu has been cancelled.

137
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,580
Does that mean that Qu has given up on the Qu?

138
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
No.

139
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,580
Lao Yin said that Qu is a cruel person.

140
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,580
He would kill anyone who saw him.

141
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,580
The Qu did so many things with him.

142
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,080
He even brought him along.

143
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,080
Why didn't he kill the Qu?

144
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,580
So I think they might still have a connection.

145
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,580
Director Deng.

146
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,580
It's Brother Rui again.

147
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,080
If you really tell Brother Rui, I can't hold it anymore.

148
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,080
I haven't told him yet.

149
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,580
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,580
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,580
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,580
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,580
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,580
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,580
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,580
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,580
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,580
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,580
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,580
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,580
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,580
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,080
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,580
Director Deng is leaving the cave.

165
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,080
He's going to the river.

166
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,080
Follow him.

167
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,580
Got it.

168
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,080
Follow him.

169
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,080
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,080
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,080
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,080
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,080
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,080
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,080
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,080
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,080
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,080
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,080
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,080
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,080
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,080
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,080
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,080
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,080
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,080
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,080
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,080
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,080
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,080
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,080
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,080
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,080
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,080
Please pay attention.

197
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
I will be back in a minute

198
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,580
Director Deng

199
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
The water is not good

200
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,580
Let's do it

201
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,580
No hurry

202
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,580
We follow their purpose now

203
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
We just want to find out if he is alive

204
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,580
Let's see what he has in his mouth

205
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,580
Wang Guangqi

206
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,580
Changyuan

207
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,580
Action

208
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,580
The water is not good, send a ship

209
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,580
Roger

210
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,580
Police, catch him

211
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,580
Hurry up

212
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,580
Hurry up, pull the boat

213
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,580
Let me go

214
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,580
Let me go

215
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
Let me go

216
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,580
Let me go

217
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
Let me go

218
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
Let me go

219
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,580
Let me go

220
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
Let me go

221
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Changyuan

222
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
Changyuan

223
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,580
Changyuan

224
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,580
Calm down

225
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,580
Hurry up

226
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,580
Come on, take him away

227
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,580
Hurry up, let him take him away

228
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
Come on

229
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,580
Put your hands together

230
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,580
Changrui, you have no sense of distance

231
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,580
Once your head is hot, you will act without permission

232
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,580
You will change the whole plan

233
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,580
Your impulsive

234
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,580
The clue of lack of a solution may be broken

235
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,580
Can you bear this responsibility?

236
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,580
What do you want?

237
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,580
I just want to kill him

238
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,580
Changrui, you are so rude

239
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,580
Han, look at him

240
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,580
Do you still think you are a good man?

241
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,580
You are so restless

242
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,580
I tell you

243
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,580
I won't let you interrogate him again

244
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,580
Do you understand?

245
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,580
How can I calm down?

246
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,580
My father saved his life

247
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Now he has become a bad guy

248
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,580
My father died for nothing

249
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,580
If I kill him, I will atone for my father's sins

250
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,580
OK

251
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,580
The investigation team, tell your captain

252
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,580
to send two people to the office

253
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,580
Say something

254
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,580
No need to send people

255
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,580
I will go by myself

256
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,580
OK, you have the guts

257
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,580
Go by yourself

258
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,580
Changyuan

259
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,580
Changyuan

260
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,580
Xiaoju, Hanzhi

261
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,580
Xiaoju, calm down

262
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,580
As the leader of Changyuan

263
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,580
I should be responsible for this

264
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,580
Forget it

265
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,580
Let him go back and reflect on himself

266
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,580
Go out

267
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,580
Go out

268
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,580
What are you doing now?

269
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,580
What are you doing?

270
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,580
What are you doing?

271
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,580
Why are you still standing here?

272
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,580
Xiaoju, calm down

273
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,580
I know you are angry now

274
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,580
That's why you said these words

275
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,580
It's all because of Changrui's father's death

276
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,580
Is it normal for him to be sad?

277
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,580
I can't calm down

278
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,580
Wait, let me tell you

279
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,580
I know this thing a hundred times better than you

280
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,580
Changrui's father, Chang Yujun

281
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,580
He used to be my old comrade-in-arms

282
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,580
He is the most worthy partner I can entrust

283
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,580
Entrust

284
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,580
Do you understand?

285
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,580
I am gone

286
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,580
I have to discipline this son for his father

287
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,580
I understand

288
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,580
I understand

289
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,580
I understand

290
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,580
Director, is Rui Kui locked up?

291
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,580
Can you help him?

292
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
Or he is too dizzy

293
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,580
Go to the police station to check on Wang Guangqing

294
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,580
Wang Guangqing

295
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,580
Tell me about you

296
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
What's up?

297
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,580
I am fine

298
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,580
I am fine

299
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
I am fine

300
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,580
I am fine

301
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,580
What's up?

302
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,580
I don't know what's up

303
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,580
I don't know what's up with you

304
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,580
Then why did you arrest you?

305
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,580
Yes

306
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,580
I'm wondering too

307
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,580
Why did you arrest me and bring me here?

308
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,580
According to your police

309
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,580
Shouldn't you miss a bad person?

310
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,580
Can't you wrong a good person?

311
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,580
How can you put me like this

312
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,580
I caught it here

313
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,580
Old girl

314
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,580
How old are you?

315
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,580
How about this?

316
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
Today, I am a good person

317
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,580
Listen to me

318
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,580
You can change to a bigger size

319
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,580
Can't you live like Liu Qingyan?

320
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,580
Wang Guangqing

321
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,580
You be honest with me

322
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,580
Ok, sorry

323
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,580
Come on, let's start

324
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,580
Start

325
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Do you know Bai Wentao?

326
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,580
No

327
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,580
Do you know Zhao Dafeng?

328
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,580
No

329
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,580
The post station on the edge of the mountain and the river

330
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,580
I don't remember this

331
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,580
You don't know, do you?

332
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,580
You know Pan Ying?

333
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,580
Zheng Weiwei

334
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,580
I don't have any impression when I look at the photo

335
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,580
But you said the name seems to have some impression

336
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,580
Zheng Weiwei

337
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
I remember

338
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,580
Zheng Weiwei is my elementary school classmate

339
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,580
At that time, I was a little fat

340
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,580
I haven't seen her for more than ten years

341
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,580
I don't know what she's like now

342
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,580
What is this?

343
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,580
Youth and age are rough

344
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,580
Time goes by and never returns

345
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,580
Think about it

346
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,580
I'm so cold when I see you

347
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,580
Wang Guangqing

348
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,580
Stop talking nonsense

349
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,580
What we are talking about now is the Zheng Weiwei you kidnapped

350
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,580
Police comrade

351
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,580
You scared me

352
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,580
I thought you were going to hit me

353
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,580
We can't hit people in this legal society

354
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,580
Ok?

355
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,580
Ok, sorry, sorry

356
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,580
I was wrong

357
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,580
Well, I'm good at cooperating

358
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,580
I'm sure I'm good at cooperating

359
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,580
Let's do it again

360
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,580
Come on, ready

361
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
Go

362
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,580
Go

363
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,580
Every time they succeed in kidnapping girls

364
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,580
Wang Guangqing will pick a group of people to sell them

365
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,580
Then the rest of them will sell them to the remote mountain area to be a wife

366
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,580
So even if we pass Wang Guangqing

367
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,580
Can't find the missing clue

368
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,580
You can also find traces of Huang Chuan

369
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,580
But no matter how we interrogate, he doesn't talk

370
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,580
He doesn't look like he's afraid of boiling water

371
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,580
Wang Guangqing

372
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,580
How about we use the public information of Mr. Deng

373
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,580
Let him see those girls who are being controlled

374
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,580
Look miserable

375
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,580
Wang Guangqing is a roll

376
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,580
If any trick works on him

377
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,580
He won't commit a crime again

378
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,580
Then you can't just wait

379
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,580
Wang Yi

380
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,580
How about we try it in the morning

381
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,580
OK

382
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,580
Xiaojun, he doesn't dare to say

383
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,580
He is a fan

384
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,580
The normal interrogation style is that he can't be caught

385
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,580
I'm thinking if I can use a emotional card

386
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,580
But if you want to use a emotional card

387
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
Maybe you need to let him go

388
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,580
Can you let him go as soon as possible

389
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,580
This is your way

390
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,580
You want to let Chang Rui handle it in advance, right?

391
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,580
I tell you

392
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
Three days is three days

393
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,580
It's not even a minute away

394
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,580
Xiaojun

395
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,580
He should be punished for his mistakes

396
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,580
As a police officer, as a history child

397
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,580
You should be more strict and cautious

398
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,580
I don't believe you have other ideas

399
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,580
Deng Yan

400
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,580
Why did I transfer you to the police station?

401
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,580
Think about it

402
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,580
I'm not going to let you go

403
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,580
I'm going to let you go

404
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,580
I'm going to let you go

405
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,580
I'm going to let you go

406
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,580
I'm going to let you go

407
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,580
I'm going to let you go

408
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,580
I'm going to let you go

409
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,580
I'm going to let you go

410
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,580
I'm going to let you go

411
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,580
I'm going to let you go

412
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,580
I'm going to let you go

413
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,580
I'm going to let you go

414
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,580
I'm going to let you go

415
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,580
I'm going to let you go

416
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,580
Han, look at him

417
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,580
Do you still want to be a history child?

418
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,580
October 19th is a heartbreaking day

419
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,580
To save the young man Wang Guangqing

420
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,580
The chief of Nanyang branch, Chang Yongjun

421
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,580
Unfortunately drowned

422
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,580
Middle-aged 43 years old

423
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,580
Deng Yan

424
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,580
Why did I transfer you to the police station?

425
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,580
Think about it

426
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,580
I'm going to let you go

427
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,580
I'm going to let you go

428
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,580
I'm going to let you go

429
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,580
I'm going to let you go

430
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,580
I'm going to let you go

431
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,580
I'm going to let you go

432
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,580
Aunt Zhang

433
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,580
Ok, I'll come over right now

434
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Please enter

435
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,580
After Weiwei was discharged, she locked herself in the room and didn't come out.

436
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,180
I was really worried that she might do something stupid.

437
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,580
It's okay. Where?

438
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,380
In this room. You go and see her.

439
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,380
Weiwei.

440
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,180
Mom called me and said that you haven't been sleeping well these past few days.

441
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,380
She asked me to come over and spend time with you.

442
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,380
I'm sorry.

443
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,180
The weather is so nice today.

444
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,780
Looking at the kids outside,

445
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,780
I suddenly thought of a girl I just met recently.

446
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,580
Let me tell you about her.

447
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,780
This girl is very kind,

448
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,380
very brave, very smart.

449
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,780
And she's very talented.

450
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,580
She played drums. When she was 13,

451
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:14,180
she was the most famous music teacher in Lingshan City and was a closed-door disciple.

452
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,780
And she's also good at writing. She's very good at writing.

453
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,980
Her works were even published in Dengsheng magazine.

454
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,580
I'll copy this work and

455
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,980
read it for you.

456
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,980
Like a boat sailing in the sea,

457
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,580
like a kite floating in the air.

458
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,580
If there's no wind, the boat can't move forward.

459
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,380
The kite can't fly either.

460
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,580
But sometimes, or many times,

461
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,980
the wind direction doesn't always go smoothly.

462
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,980
Boats will face the wind and the tide.

463
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,580
The kite will also face the wind that's blowing.

464
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:09,580
Maybe this is what life is like for her.

465
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,780
Don't read it, Sister.

466
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,580
Don't read it.

467
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,380
Look at this work.

468
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,380
It was only two days ago that it won the gold medal.

469
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,980
Look.

470
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,180
Look.

471
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,180
When I was reading this article, I was thinking,

472
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,180
if I were the girl in the article,

473
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,380
facing the coming of the tide,

474
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,580
I could absorb all the laughter.

475
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,780
Would I be like this girl?

476
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,180
I could be so brave, I could concentrate on my job,

477
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,780
and finally, I could start a plane and take everyone to escape the sea.

478
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,580
The evil in the article

479
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,580
will eventually be exposed under the sun.

480
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,980
And those who hurt you,

481
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,580
will not be spared.

482
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,580
They sold me to a meeting.

483
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,580
There was a person called Boss Li who often came over.

484
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,580
If I didn't listen, they would scold me and hit me.

485
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,580
Once, I hurt Boss Li's hand.

486
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,580
They pulled my nail.

487
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,180
I've been busy lately. I forgot to cut your nails.

488
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,980
Qingping, come in.

489
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,580
What's wrong, Boss Li?

490
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,180
These girls' nails are a bit long.

491
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,180
You need to adjust them.

492
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,980
Sorry, Boss Li. I'll fix them right away.

493
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,580
Come.

494
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,180
Boss Li.

495
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,980
It's real.

496
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,980
Boss Li!

497
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,980
I can meet him every night.

498
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,980
In my dreams, I'm really scared.

499
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,580
You don't have to be scared now.

500
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,380
You have us.

501
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,780
You have your mom and dad.

502
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,380
I will protect you.

503
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,180
And...

504
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,980
you didn't have to be scared.

505
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,780
You chose to face it bravely.

506
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,180
Do you remember a girl called Pingjiao?

507
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,780
She was also strong and survived.

508
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,380
She even helped us catch those people.

509
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,380
How is she?

510
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,780
Don't worry about her.

511
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,980
She's back with you and her parents.

512
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,780
In my opinion,

513
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,780
you are all the brave girls in the article.

514
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,780
I'm sorry.

515
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,780
It's okay. Sit down.

516
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,980
She's asleep.

517
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,780
This child doesn't want to go to school anymore.

518
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,980
Her dad and I are worried about her.

519
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,380
But now, in our two families,

520
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,780
you know the situation.

521
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,380
I'm afraid it will be too much for her.

522
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,580
So I rented a house near the school.

523
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,580
But ever since she was discharged,

524
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,780
she's been locked up in her room.

525
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,180
I tried to persuade her but it didn't work.

526
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,580
I thought of you.

527
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,380
It's all my fault.

528
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,580
If I hadn't divorced her,

529
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,380
these things wouldn't have happened.

530
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,580
Mom, don't blame yourself.

531
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,380
And...

532
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,980
don't mention your family and school in front of her anymore.

533
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,380
When she's going through these things,

534
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,980
she needs your warmth and company.

535
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,580
And Weiwei is very thoughtful and self-respecting.

536
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:18,380
She doesn't want to face the family and school for now.

537
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,580
You need to talk to her dad.

538
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,980
You need to understand and support her and be there for her.

539
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,980
Of course, we can't be too anxious.

540
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,980
We need to take it slow.

541
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,180
The psychological treatment needs a process.

542
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,180
I'll listen to you, Director Deng.

543
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,580
I'll take good care of her.

544
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,980
Director Deng, you need to catch those scumbags.

545
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,380
I need to get them out of here.

546
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,980
Don't worry. We'll find them and catch them.

547
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,580
We'll get them out of here.

548
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,580
Thank you.

549
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,780
I went to see Zheng Weiwei. He mentioned two key people.

550
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,780
Boss Li and Mo Jinan.

551
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,780
Now, we need to catch them.

552
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,980
Jiajia, help me find the star of the day.

553
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,380
It should be when Zheng Weiwei first met Boss Li.

554
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,580
Have you seen this girl?

555
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,580
No.

556
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,580
She has seen you.

557
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,180
And you gave it to Boss Li.

558
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,980
What Boss Li? I don't know.

559
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:02,180
Boss, we'll come back another day.

560
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,780
I'll be waiting for you.

561
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,180
I'm sorry.

562
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,380
I forgot to tell you. We received a call a few days ago.

563
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,980
Your mom fell down. It's serious.

564
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,180
She's already in the hospital.

565
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,780
Impossible. My mom is fine.

566
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:39,180
Chen Amo, do you think we'll joke about your parent's situation?

567
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,180
Your mom fell down and is in the hospital. The doctor said it's serious.

568
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,380
What's going on? When did this happen?

569
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,780
When you were just caught.

570
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,180
She fell down in a hurry.

571
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,580
Is she okay now?

572
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,180
What did the doctor say?

573
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,780
Is she rich enough to be in the hospital?

574
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,580
It's your daughter's conscience.

575
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,180
You told your mom that you wanted to do some small business in Lingshan.

576
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,380
You wanted to be filial to her.

577
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,780
Now, you're going to be filial to her in prison?

578
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,580
I just want her to take care of herself.

579
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,380
I...

580
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,580
Is there anyone who can take care of her?

581
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,580
We've already arranged someone to take care of her.

582
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,880
Then I'll be fine.

583
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,880
Is Rench teng important to you?

584
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,780
Is it necessary?

585
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,180
Or will it probably be,

586
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,480
It can't be more important than if that baby reaches you at the last gave birth in prison.

587
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,980
Where would that baby be buried in?

588
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,780
How much 10 million Yuan is 200 million Yuan period?

589
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,660
Bracket

590
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,700
Save him

591
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,580
He Griffith

592
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,780
Are you sure?

593
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,700
I've been to the old man's house several times.

594
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,860
I can't be wrong.

595
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Honey.

596
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,140
It's time to eat.

597
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
It's hot.

598
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,620
Honey.

599
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,260
Come here.

600
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,780
It's time to eat.

601
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,620
You've been cooking these dishes for so long.

602
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,260
It's exquisite.

603
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,260
It's exquisite.

604
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,220
What's this?

605
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,140
I really forgot about this.

606
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,140
I...

607
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,740
Right.

608
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,740
Honey.

609
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
Honey.

610
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,780
Honey.

611
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,780
I really...

612
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
I really forgot about this.

613
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,780
I'm sorry.

614
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,780
What do you remember?

615
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,780
How many times have I told you?

616
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,780
I hate that smell.

617
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,780
I know.

618
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,780
I know.

619
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,780
I've been too busy with work lately.

620
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,780
I promise I'll remember it next time.

621
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,780
Work?

622
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,780
Who gave you work?

623
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,780
Can you have this work without our family?

624
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,780
Yes.

625
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,780
Well...

626
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,780
Well...

627
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,780
How about we make up for the sugar?

628
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,780
There are fish and shrimp.

629
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Let's eat first.

630
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
Let's go.

631
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,780
Eat it yourself.

632
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
I'm not hungry.

633
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
Where are you going?

634
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
Eat or not eat?

635
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,780
I'll kick you out.

636
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,780
Who is it?

637
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,780
Who are you?

638
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,780
I'm from the Public Security Bureau.

639
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,780
Lu Shan, right?

640
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,780
Come with us.

641
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,780
Why did you bring me here?

642
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,780
It's like a forced transfer notice.

643
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,780
What do you mean?

644
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,780
What's wrong with me?

645
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,780
Do you know this girl?

646
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,780
No.

647
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,780
What does she have to do with me?

648
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,780
You know her, right?

649
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,780
Police officer.

650
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,780
I see too many people every day.

651
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,780
How can I remember them?

652
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,780
Come on.

653
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,780
Look at it.

654
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,780
No one answered.

655
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,780
I'm sorry.

656
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,780
It's a problem that Zhen Weiwei can't come now.

657
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
Yes.

658
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,780
We can only do the next step

659
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,780
based on the situation of Chen Amo.

660
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,780
Identify

661
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,780
if there are people you know in it.

662
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,780
She.

663
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,780
I know her.

664
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,780
She's the one.

665
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,780
Robbery?

666
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,780
I robbed her.

667
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,780
I don't even know her.

668
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,780
I don't know her.

669
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,780
I don't know her.

670
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,780
She's the one.

671
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,780
I don't know her.

672
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,780
I don't know her.

673
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,780
Why do I have to ask her?

674
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,780
You must know her

675
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,780
because you don't know her, right?

676
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,780
I must say.

677
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,780
Do you know her or not?

678
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,780
I don't know her.

679
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,780
But she knows you.

680
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,780
She saw clearly

681
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,780
what you did to Wang Badan.

682
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,780
Chen Amo has already pointed you out.

683
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,780
You are the one who robbed the victim.

684
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
How do you explain it?

685
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
How do I explain it?

686
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,780
It's a slander.

687
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,780
It's a slander.

688
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,780
Who did I rob?

689
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,780
I don't know this person at all.

690
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,780
I tell you.

691
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,780
They just want to cheat me with money.

692
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,780
They want to rob me.

693
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,780
Police, you have to believe me.

694
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,780
They are two liars.

695
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,780
You have to believe me.

696
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,780
I'm a legal citizen.

697
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,780
Where's my lawyer?

698
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,780
Call the lawyer.

699
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
If my lawyer doesn't come,

700
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,780
I won't say anything today.

701
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,780
I think you're talking for them now.

702
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,780
You are police, you know?

703
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,780
Why is this person so bastard?

704
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,780
What's wrong with him?

705
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,780
It's because Lu Shao

706
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,780
has no idea.

707
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,780
He said he was innocent.

708
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,780
Director Deng.

709
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,780
Lu Shao's family is here.

710
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,780
They want to see you.

711
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,780
If you don't have evidence, you can arrest them.

712
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,780
You have to be legally responsible.

713
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,780
Don't you know the police?

714
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,780
Miss Cai.

715
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,780
We police won't arrest someone without reason.

716
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:48,780
We want to know what crime my client Lu was involved in.

717
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,780
Do you have any evidence?

718
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,780
Can you tell us?

719
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,780
Let us hear it.

720
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,780
Now this case is being processed further.

721
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,780
We can't reveal too many details to you.

722
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,780
What's wrong with you?

723
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,780
I'm not a criminal.

724
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,780
I'm a police.

725
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,780
