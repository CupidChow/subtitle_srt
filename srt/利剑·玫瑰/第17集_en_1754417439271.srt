1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here or not.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here or not.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here or not.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here or not.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here or not.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here or not.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here or not.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here or not.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here or not.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here or not.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
bolt

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:49,720
Fooooo

13
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,320
Grandma, your hands are so soft.

14
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,920
Yes, you're so cute.

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,320
Grandma.

16
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,520
Grandma.

17
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,320
Is it because of the sun?

18
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
It's because of the sun.

19
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,720
She just woke up. She's a bit noisy.

20
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,120
It's okay. It's okay.

21
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,520
Look at Grandma.

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,320
Sister Fu.

23
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,120
Uncle Liu.

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,920
Don't give up hope.

25
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,320
Don't worry. Your kids will find it.

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,320
Look, we found it.

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,720
You have to believe. You have to guess.

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,520
You will find it.

29
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Yes, yes.

30
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,920
Yes.

31
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,720
Good girl.

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Look at us.

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Good girl.

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,120
By the way, we have a new friend today.

35
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,320
He will share his story with us.

36
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Come on.

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Hello, everyone.

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,520
My name is Pingjiao.

39
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,120
I was kidnapped when I was seven.

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,720
My foster parents kidnapped me

41
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,120
to get a brother.

42
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,520
When I grew up, I wanted to run away.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,520
I wanted to find my biological parents.

44
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,520
But I was kidnapped again.

45
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,720
I was kidnapped again.

46
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,720
I almost lost my life.

47
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,120
Fortunately, I found my biological parents.

48
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,920
They were very nice to me.

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
That's great.

50
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,920
That's great.

51
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,120
You mean you were kidnapped when you were twelve?

52
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,520
I was kidnapped when I was seven.

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,720
Yes, yes. Seven years old.

54
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,920
You are seven years old now.

55
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,520
You are back after so many years.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,120
That's great.

57
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,320
So, you must keep going.

58
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,520
Don't lose hope. We will all go home.

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,120
Yangyang is right.

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,920
I am right.

61
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
You must keep going.

62
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,320
Keep going.

63
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,120
Yes.

64
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,920
Yes.

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,520
Yes, we will all go home.

66
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,920
That's great.

67
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,320
Come on.

68
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,520
Come on.

69
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,520
Come on.

70
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
By the way,

71
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,120
Pingjiao brought us his local specialties.

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,320
He brought us a lot of things.

73
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,120
He said he wanted to try them.

74
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,520
These are all grown by my parents.

75
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,320
He is still trying them.

76
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
They are all from Chunli.

77
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Come on.

78
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
Thank you.

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Let me do it.

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Thank you.

81
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Come on.

82
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Come on.

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Hello.

84
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Are you looking for a nanny?

85
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,320
This baby is so good.

86
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
This show is so long.

87
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
He is so good.

88
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
He is so quiet.

89
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,320
It's rare to meet a stranger who is not a bad person.

90
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Yes.

91
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
He is so good.

92
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
He is so good.

93
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
He is so good.

94
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
He is so good.

95
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,320
It's rare to meet a stranger who is not a bad person.

96
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Yes.

97
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
I have had many children.

98
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,320
So they are close to me.

99
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
How long have you been a nanny?

100
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Many years.

101
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,320
I have had children from the first to the fifth year of birth.

102
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,320
I can't have children from the first to the fifth year of birth.

103
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
That's because I am the youngest.

104
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Not everyone can do it.

105
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
What is your name?

106
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,320
My father and son worked in the province.

107
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
They wanted me to go there.

108
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
I am used to it in Linshan.

109
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
I don't want to go there.

110
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,320
So I came to find a job.

111
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Look.

112
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,320
This is my resume.

113
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,320
And this is my son's family.

114
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
They are all good.

115
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
But my wife is a little picky.

116
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,320
She wants to be my nanny.

117
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
I have been doing this for more than four years.

118
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,320
I can't bear to leave my child.

119
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Sister, here is the thing.

120
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,320
We are here to find a nanny.

121
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,320
But we need to find a suitable nanny in the family business.

122
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,320
You and my child are so close.

123
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Can you help us?

124
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Sure.

125
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,320
I am also looking for a job.

126
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
I have a good eye for children.

127
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Sure.

128
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
That's it.

129
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Let's register in the family business.

130
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,320
The family business has a lot of revenue.

131
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
You have a lot of money.

132
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
I have a little money.

133
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,320
We are not suitable for this job.

134
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Look.

135
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
This...

136
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
It's rare to meet a nanny who is not good at work.

137
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,320
How about we try her first?

138
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,320
We can ask her to put her resume here.

139
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
I will leave it here.

140
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
This is my resume.

141
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Look.

142
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
How about we go back and try her?

143
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Okay.

144
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Then you can go back with us today.

145
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Okay.

146
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Here you are.

147
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Okay.

148
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Let's go.

149
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Okay.

150
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Bye.

151
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Bye, baby.

152
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Hello.

153
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
What would you like to order?

154
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
I want to see...

155
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
How is your leg?

156
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
It hurts.

157
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
It hurts.

158
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,320
We found Yang Caiyun, the one you mentioned.

159
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
That's great.

160
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Sir, do I count as a crime?

161
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
It depends on your performance.

162
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
I will go to the police station.

163
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Okay.

164
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Bye.

165
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Bye.

166
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Bye.

167
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Bye.

168
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
Bye.

169
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Bye.

170
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Bye.

171
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Bye.

172
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Bye.

173
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Bye.

174
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Safeit Ran.

175
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
It was your fault we lost your good end.

176
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Then you should have saved me.

177
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Where's your end?

178
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Get out of my way.

179
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
You all know the man?

180
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
I thought about it.

181
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Tie Wugui, we saw him earlier rending his haired

182
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,320
in this tavern.

183
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,820
He was betrothed toINS"]

184
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,320
Wugui, that's too harsh to computational me.

185
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
The kid was also an extra,

186
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
an extra when someone studied.

187
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:39,120
��면

188
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,940
have

189
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,140
I haven't asked him.

190
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,460
His accent?

191
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,580
It sounds like he's from the Southwest.

192
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,500
Have you never seen his friends and family?

193
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,980
No.

194
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,340
You've been with him for so long.

195
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,700
You must know everything.

196
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,660
Good for him.

197
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,780
He's in our business.

198
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,260
He never asks me anything.

199
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,220
You know what he looks like, right?

200
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,420
Yes, of course.

201
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,380
Can you tell?

202
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,340
Yes, I can.

203
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,060
Huang Chuan's description is accurate.

204
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,780
We've shown the pictures to many people.

205
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,620
They all said it was Hong Yi.

206
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,540
Deputy Director Yin has contacted the police and the police station.

207
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,900
As of now, Hong Yi is still on the run.

208
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,060
The pictures show the battle at sea.

209
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,060
We're in search of him.

210
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,860
We have to get him.

211
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,180
We've been together for so long.

212
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,140
He's not a loser.

213
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,380
I'll go check on him.

214
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,060
Are you sure this is Hong Yi's real face?

215
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,900
Yes, it's him.

216
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,940
I remember him as Huacheng Hui.

217
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,060
Jiang Guai, have you caught him?

218
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,140
You've lived with Hong Yi.

219
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,700
Do you know anything about his life?

220
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,700
I don't know.

221
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
Do you know anything about Huo Qi Xin?

222
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,180
Life is like that.

223
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,180
That's life.

224
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,700
People like us

225
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,660
have to hide from the police

226
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,300
all day long.

227
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,820
Life is not that easy.

228
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,020
What does he like to eat?

229
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,100
Officer,

230
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,300
is it useful to ask?

231
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,620
Stop talking nonsense.

232
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,260
Just answer my question.

233
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,980
Okay.

234
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,620
As long as he makes money,

235
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,820
he'll go out to eat braised pork.

236
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,220
Where is it?

237
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,420
I don't know.

238
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,660
He said he didn't have money when he was a kid.

239
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,980
Now he has money.

240
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,980
He wants to eat all the braised pork

241
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,500
in the restaurant.

242
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,340
Is there anything special

243
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,180
besides eating?

244
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,900
Something special?

245
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,900
I don't know.

246
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,460
He likes to buy gold jewelry.

247
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,100
It's weird.

248
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,780
He doesn't like to dress up.

249
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,540
But when he makes money,

250
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,620
he always buys gold jewelry

251
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,620
behind my back.

252
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,940
And he buys a lot.

253
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,780
I touched his pocket a few times.

254
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,180
I found a few tickets.

255
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,180
There were gold bracelets,

256
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,820
gold bracelets, gold earrings and so on.

257
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,860
I asked him

258
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,580
why he bought these things

259
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,420
with his wife.

260
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,700
He was so anxious.

261
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,780
Have you seen him

262
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,100
wearing these jewelry?

263
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,220
No.

264
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,860
Not even once.

265
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,300
I don't know where he hid them.

266
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,380
Do you remember where you bought

267
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,460
the gold jewelry

268
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,740
when you just got the ticket?

269
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,940
I don't remember.

270
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,620
But I'm sure

271
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,980
he bought them in the mall in Linshan.

272
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:40,980
Director Dan,

273
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,180
Wang Yicun said something to me.

274
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,460
I like Linshan.

275
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,940
I don't want to go there.

276
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,660
He must still be here.

277
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,420
Auntie,

278
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,940
these are our earrings.

279
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,820
They look good on you.

280
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,460
Let's look at this one.

281
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,620
Gold. Which one do you like?

282
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,500
This one.

283
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,700
This one?

284
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,660
Auntie,

285
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,540
I told you you're good at acting.

286
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,340
This one is very popular in our store.

287
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,260
Come on.

288
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,260
Let's see.

289
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:15,940
This...

290
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,620
This bracelet?

291
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,700
This one?

292
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,340
It's thick.

293
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,740
Auntie, to be honest,

294
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,820
I got this one

295
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,820
for my mom

296
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,660
during the New Year.

297
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,900
My mom loves it.

298
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,660
This one.

299
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,260
This one?

300
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,780
This one?

301
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,660
Let me put it on for you.

302
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,380
There's more.

303
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,300
Let's see.

304
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,300
These ones?

305
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:35,900
Yes.

306
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,540
Okay.

307
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,020
These are all your choices.

308
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,380
Which one do you like?

309
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,980
I'll wear the one that fits me.

310
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,820
Fits you?

311
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,100
You have to trust your taste.

312
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,100
Here.

313
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,460
Do you want all these?

314
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,700
Didn't you say I'm suitable for this?

315
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,020
This is the man.

316
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,020
A month ago,

317
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,380
he bought a lot of gold and water

318
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,620
from a gold store.

319
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,980
I've confirmed with the shopkeeper

320
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,140
that this man's necklace

321
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,580
and Hongyi's portrait

322
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,700
are basically the same.

323
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,620
So at least now

324
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,740
we can be sure of one thing.

325
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,100
Hongyi was still in Lingshan

326
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,180
a month ago.

327
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,580
Huang Chuan has been waiting for Hongyi

328
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,420
in all the gold stores.

329
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,260
I've been thinking about Hongyi

330
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,420
but I've never met him.

331
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,020
When Huang Chuan is in Lingshan,

332
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,180
this man will show up.

333
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,780
Let's start from here.

334
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,340
Pay more attention to the place where he's been.

335
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,380
Zoom in on the number one.

336
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,260
Look at the plastic bag on his hand.

337
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,620
What does it say?

338
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,980
Lingshan Supermarket?

339
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,660
This is a supermarket's plastic bag.

340
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,780
It's full of household items.

341
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,740
Is it possible that

342
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,540
Hongyi has been hiding in the gold stores

343
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,940
and within the scope of this supermarket?

344
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,460
Rubio Bank

345
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:47,340
Wooding

346
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:47,500
Director,

347
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:47,700
I'll just take a look.

348
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,940
I've been to

349
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,480
the neighborhood nearby.

350
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,380
The Ancient Madam

351
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,620
has never been seen by anyone.

352
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,740
Is it possible that

353
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,740
Hongyi has been living in this neighborhood

354
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,940
all this time?

355
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,940
I just saw the picture the shopkeeper gave us.

356
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,940
I think we should change our search method.

357
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,940
Don't say that.

358
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,940
Hongyi's taste is really good.

359
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,940
The designs he picked are very design-oriented.

360
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,940
You think so too, right?

361
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,940
Huang Chuan told us that Hongyi

362
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,940
is a person over 50 years old.

363
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,940
He bought these jewelry to keep them.

364
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
If he wants to keep them,

365
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,940
he can buy gold bars and gold coins.

366
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,940
Why would he buy such a strong jewelry?

367
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,940
Does he have other purposes?

368
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,940
He doesn't just want to keep them

369
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,940
or keep them for himself.

370
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,940
Yes.

371
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,940
He should give us a strong image

372
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,940
of himself and our appearance.

373
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,940
He is very good at making jewelry.

374
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,940
So we should think about

375
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,940
how Hongyi should look like

376
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,940
when he is alone,

377
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,940
feeling safe and relaxed.

378
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,940
People like us

379
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
are always running around outside

380
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,940
and we are always being watched.

381
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,940
We don't have a good life.

382
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,940
It's weird.

383
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,940
He doesn't like to dress up.

384
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,940
But as long as he makes money,

385
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,940
he always buys me

386
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,940
some gold jewelry.

387
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,940
He is very rough.

388
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,940
How can we be interested in him?

389
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,940
I've been working with Hongyi for 20 years.

390
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,940
He is very cunning.

391
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,940
I'll ask him

392
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,940
why he buys these things.

393
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,940
Director, what are you looking at?

394
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,940
Is there any high-rise community nearby?

395
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,940
I know where he is.

396
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,940
Hello, welcome.

397
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,940
Hello.

398
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,940
We are the police.

399
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,940
We need your cooperation.

400
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,940
Okay.

401
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,940
Have you seen this man on the photo?

402
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,940
He looks familiar.

403
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
Please wait a moment.

404
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Okay, thank you.

405
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,940
This is good.

406
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,940
This is Hong Yaowen.

407
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,940
Ms. Huang.

408
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,940
He looks like the man on the photo.

409
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,940
He is a VIP client here.

410
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,940
He always makes some face-to-face interviews.

411
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,940
He spends a lot of money.

412
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,940
Can you help us contact him?

413
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,940
Okay, thank you.

414
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,940
Ms. Huang, please wait a moment.

415
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
I'll arrange a white-and-white interview for you.

416
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,940
Okay.

417
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
Please.

418
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,940
Thank you.

419
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,940
We finally meet.

420
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,940
Ms. Hong.

421
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,940
Hong Yin, the famous Hong Yin in the martial arts world.

422
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,940
You are the one, right?

423
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,940
Hong Yin, I don't know you.

424
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,940
You know this person, right?

425
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,940
I don't know him.

426
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,940
I don't know him.

427
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,940
You know this person, right?

428
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,940
Your old friend.

429
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,940
He said he knew you even when you turned into ashes.

430
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,940
Huang Chuan.

431
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,940
You call him the old yellow dog.

432
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,940
Everything you do,

433
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,940
Huang Chuan knows it very well.

434
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,940
You've lived with him for decades.

435
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,940
You don't have any impression, do you?

436
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,940
Police officer.

437
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,940
You can't listen to his nonsense.

438
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,940
I'm a very accurate person.

439
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,940
Look at his face.

440
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,940
He doesn't look like a good person.

441
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
Don't play tricks here.

442
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,940
If we don't have any evidence,

443
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,940
will we just arrest you?

444
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,940
Why are you so fierce?

445
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,940
How can I play tricks?

446
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,940
I'm really innocent.

447
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,940
I've been to your dorm.

448
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,940
This DNA test report says

449
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,940
that the part of hair DNA that Huang Chuan collected

450
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,940
matches your DNA very well.

451
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
Yes.

452
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
I admit I know him.

453
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
But I hate him.

454
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,940
I don't want to mention him.

455
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,940
I don't want to be with him.

456
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,940
He said that if I leave,

457
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,940
he'll kill me.

458
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,940
I have no choice.

459
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,940
I'm a woman.

460
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,940
I have to listen to him.

461
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,940
Or he'll beat me.

462
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,940
I'm also a victim.

463
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,940
Huang Chuan didn't say that.

464
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,940
He said you two are playing tricks together.

465
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,940
You're playing tricks on him.

466
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,940
And it's all your idea.

467
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,940
Playing tricks on him?

468
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,940
How is that possible?

469
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,940
Officer, don't wrong me.

470
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,940
I just cooked and cleaned the room.

471
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,940
I really don't know anything else.

472
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,940
I have a question.

473
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
You look so rich.

474
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,940
Where did you get the money?

475
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,940
I saved it.

476
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,940
Saved?

477
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,940
You live in such a high-class neighborhood.

478
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,940
You went to the beauty salon.

479
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
You wore such a high-class dress.

480
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,940
Tell me.

481
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,940
Which industry can save so much money?

482
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,940
Where did you get the money?

483
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,940
I've been working for so many years.

484
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,940
And I've been doing some investments.

485
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,940
Investments?

486
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,940
What kind of investments can save so much money?

487
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,940
Tell me.

488
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,940
Don't tell me you're a gold digger.

489
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,940
This is the money you've been saving for over 20 years.

490
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,940
Huang Chuan said

491
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,940
you took all the money.

492
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,940
Nonsense.

493
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,940
This is my money.

494
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,940
So you admit to working with Huang Chuan?

495
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,940
I didn't work with him.

496
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,940
He gave me the money.

497
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,940
What did he do?

498
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,940
He didn't tell me.

499
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
I didn't ask.

500
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,940
How many children did you kidnap?

501
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
How many families did you destroy?

502
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Don't think you can get through the door by pretending to be a fool.

503
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,940
Don't accuse me.

504
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,940
I really did nothing.

505
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,940
Why don't you believe me?

506
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,940
Why don't you believe me?

507
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,940
I did nothing.

508
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,940
You don't admit to the red dress.

509
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,940
You put everything on Huang Chuan.

510
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,940
I knew it.

511
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,940
If an old man like him

512
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,940
can't use evidence to attack him,

513
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,940
he'll keep getting better.

514
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,940
We don't know his real identity.

515
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,940
We don't know his name, where he came from,

516
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,940
how his family is.

517
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,940
We have the red dress photo.

518
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,940
I've asked the police to help investigate.

519
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,940
Find out if there's any similar information

520
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,940
in the DNA collection shop.

521
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,940
Director,

522
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,520
there's news about Lin Pingxian's

523
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,940
illegal illegal drug dealing.

524
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,940
There's a middle-aged woman

525
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,940
named Hong Jingfeng in their neighborhood.

526
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,940
She looks like the red dress.

527
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,940
Lin Pingxian got her phone number

528
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,940
from the local police station.

529
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,940
I didn't expect it to be Lin Shan's phone number.

530
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,940
That woman is Hong Jingfeng.

531
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,940
It's Hongyi?

532
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,940
Yes.

533
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,940
Lin Pingxian is Hongyi's hometown.

534
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,940
Her real name is Hong Jingfeng.

535
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
She was born in 1958.

536
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,940
There are five people in her family.

537
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,940
She has two younger brothers.

538
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,940
Hong Jingfeng left her hometown

539
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,940
and never came back.

540
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,940
Her family moved to another place in 1995

541
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,940
and never came back.

542
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,940
Can we contact her family?

543
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,940
Deputy Director Yin is investigating.

544
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,940
So,

545
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,940
we've found the original address of the suspect.

546
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,940
Okay, take her to Hongyi's hometown.

547
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,940
Let Yiyin contact her family.

548
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,940
Okay.

549
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,940
I heard from the old police officer

550
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,940
that her family moved away

551
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,940
decades ago.

552
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,940
Her old house is empty.

553
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,940
She never came back.

554
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,940
I see.

555
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,940
That's Hong Jingfeng's house.

556
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,940
This way.

557
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940
This way.

558
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,940
I didn't expect that Hongyi was a good student.

559
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,940
Jiajia, look at this.

560
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,940
What did you find?

561
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,940
A family photo.

562
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,940
It's not Hong Jingfeng's family photo.

563
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,940
This Hong Jingfeng is quite pitiful.

564
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,940
He didn't bring his family photo with him.

565
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,940
He had to live in the kitchen.

566
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,940
But,

567
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,940
since it's his family photo,

568
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,940
why didn't they take the photo

569
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,940
when they moved away?

570
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,940
Maybe they forgot.

571
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,940
They put the photo

572
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,940
in such an obvious place.

573
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,940
They forgot to bring it?

574
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,940
They didn't take it.

575
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,940
They forgot to bring it?

576
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,940
That means

577
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,940
this family photo

578
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,940
was left in this room on purpose.

579
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,940
Because someone wanted to see them.

580
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
If that's the case,

581
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,940
he never left.

582
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,940
This family photo was taken in 1970.

583
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,940
Hong Jingfeng was only 12 years old.

584
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,940
No matter what happened,

585
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,940
it must have been a big shock to him.

586
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,940
Otherwise, he wouldn't have kept this photo.

587
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,940
And he was a very good student.

588
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,940
He was a good student.

589
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,940
He was a good student.

590
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,940
He was a good student.

591
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,940
He was a good student.

592
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,940
He was a good student.

593
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,940
He was a good student.

594
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,940
He was a good student.

595
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,940
He was a good student.

596
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,940
He was a good student.

597
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,940
And when the investigation is over,

598
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,940
we'll bring more people there.

599
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,940
There should be other clues.

600
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,940
You're finally back.

601
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,940
Thank you, Master.

602
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,940
You're welcome.

603
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,940
How was the investigation?

604
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,940
Did you see his family?

605
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,940
I went to the north of the country

606
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,940
and finally found his family.

607
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,940
His parents have passed away.

608
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,940
I saw his brother.

609
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,940
What did you ask?

610
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,940
I showed him

611
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,940
Hong Jingfeng's photo.

612
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,940
He told me

613
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,940
the person in the photo is not his sister.

614
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,940
He said his sister had died.

615
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,940
How did she die?

616
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,940
They're brothers.

617
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,940
It seems that this family

618
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,940
doesn't want to recognize her.

619
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,940
If that's the case, it's harder to

620
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,940
confirm Hongyi's identity.

621
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,940
Although it's like this,

622
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,940
it's not that we can't hold her back.

623
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,940
We can still find someone.

624
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,940
Mr. Su,

625
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,940
please help us identify her.

626
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,940
Among the people who came in later,

627
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,940
please see if there are any

628
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,940
fake parents who took away Xiao Guang's photo.

629
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,940
There must be some changes

630
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,940
after so long.

631
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,940
It's normal that

632
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,940
we can't recognize her.

633
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,940
Just think about

634
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,940
if she has any accent or action.

635
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,940
Since today,

636
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,940
I've heard her clearly

637
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,940
even if she's dead.

638
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,940
Even if she turns into ashes,

639
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,940
I recognize her.

640
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,940
Bring her in.

641
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,940
Listen.

642
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,940
I'm sorry.

643
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,940
I'm sorry.

644
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,940
I'm sorry.

645
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,940
You're so cute.

646
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,940
She's already very healthy.

647
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,940
She's really cute.

648
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,940
She's so cute.

649
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,940
She's so cute.

650
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,940
She's so cute.

651
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,940
Are you looking for a nanny?

652
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,940
I've brought many kids.

653
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,940
So, they're naturally close to us.

654
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,940
I don't want to be a victim.

655
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,940
It's him!

656
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
It's him!

657
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
It's him!

658
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
It's him!

659
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,940
He took my bag and took it away!

660
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,940
It's him!

661
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
Mr. Sun, calm down.

662
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,940
Trust us.

663
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
Please confirm again.

664
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,940
Is it number six?

665
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
I think it's me.

666
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
It's me.

667
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,940
I'm so stupid.

668
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,940
I'm so stupid.

669
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,940
Officer,

670
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,940
I've said everything I should.

671
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,940
Huang Chuan did those bad things.

672
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,940
Why don't you believe me?

673
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,940
Huang Jinfeng,

674
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,940
what were you doing on September 18th, 1998?

675
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,940
1998?

676
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,940
How do I know what I was doing that day?

677
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,940
If I knew what I was doing, I would be a god.

678
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,940
You were a nanny at someone else's house, right?

679
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,940
Yes, I was a nanny.

680
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
Let me remind you again.

681
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,940
You were a nanny at a lawyer's house

682
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,940
and took a little boy from their house, right?

683
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,940
Right?

684
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,940
No.

685
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,940
I never did that.

686
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,940
The lawyer has already admitted it.

687
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,940
He said it was you.

688
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,940
He said I was the one.

689
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
So I am.

690
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,940
What if he got the wrong person?

691
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,940
I'm a good nanny.

692
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,940
I've never done that before.

693
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,940
Officer,

694
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
you should know better than me.

695
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,940
You should have evidence.

696
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,940
You can't frame a good person.

697
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,940
I really didn't do that.

698
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,940
Do you remember the people in this picture?

699
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,940
Do you know who they are?

700
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,940
I don't know them.

701
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,940
You don't know them?

702
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,940
They are your parents and brothers.

703
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,940
You don't know them?

704
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,940
You don't know them?

705
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,940
Then why did you keep this picture?

706
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,940
Could it be that this picture

707
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,940
can help you remember everything you've experienced?

708
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,940
That's why you kept it until now.

709
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,940
Hong Jingfeng,

710
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,940
we've been there.

711
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,940
We've seen your family in the village of Yalu.

712
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,940
Did you contact them?

713
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,940
We contacted your brother.

714
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,940
How did he say that?

715
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,940
He said you were dead.

716
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,940
Dead?

717
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,940
Yes.

718
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,940
Hong Jingfeng was dead.

719
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,940
Hong Jingfeng,

720
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
do you hate your parents?

721
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,940
Do you hate your parents?

722
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,940
You hate them.

723
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,940
You've never treated them fairly.

724
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,940
You hate them.

725
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,940
You've never treated them as your own daughter.

726
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,940
You've never treated them as your own children.

727
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,940
That's why you used all your hatred

728
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,940
to take revenge on them.

729
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,940
You took away so many children.

730
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,940
You made them lose their families and lives.

731
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,940
Do you know how many families you destroyed?

732
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,940
Everyone,

733
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,940
Hong Jingfeng's psychological defense line has begun to loosen.

734
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
But the testimony of Huang Chuan

735
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,940
and the testimony of Mr. Sun are not enough.

736
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,940
We need more key evidence.

737
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
How about this?

738
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,940
Yan Lei and Aisin will go to the old house of the Hong family

739
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,940
and see if there are any new findings.

740
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,940
Okay.

741
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Okay.

742
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,940
Go.

743
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,940
How is it?

744
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,940
Yan Lei,

745
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,940
this may be the gold that Hong Yi bought.

746
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,940
But what is it that is under the gold?

747
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,940
These are children's clothes that we found at the scene.

748
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,940
After the check,

749
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,940
it is related to the case of Duoqi's auction.

750
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
Judging from the new and old data,

751
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,940
there is a big gap in the time of his case.

752
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,940
The time interval of these clothes

753
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,940
is about 30 years.

754
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,940
In addition,

755
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,940
these clothes have obvious local characteristics.

756
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,940
It shows that his activity range is around the South.

757
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,940
In addition to children's clothes,

758
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,940
we also found a large amount of gold jewelry at the scene.

759
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,940
Combined with the clues that Huang Chuan got before,

760
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,940
after the auction of the gold,

761
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,940
he would buy gold jewelry with stolen money.

762
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,940
But he didn't wear it himself.

763
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,940
He put it together with the victim's clothes

764
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,940
and stored it.

765
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,940
This behavior is very abnormal.

766
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
It can be seen that the behavior of the auctioned child of the gold

767
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,940
makes him feel satisfied.

768
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,940
The clothes he collected are his possession.

769
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,940
The pervert is smart.

770
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,940
For this characteristic,

771
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,940
we lost a metal detector.

772
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,940
In the area around Lao Wuji,

773
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,940
we conducted a 24-hour continuous search.

774
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,940
Now we found 43 clothes

775
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,940
and the same amount of gold jewelry.

776
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,940
So there are 43 victims?

777
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,940
It may not be only.

778
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,940
The investigation is not over yet.

779
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,940
He may have other mole.

780
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,940
How is Hong Jinfeng's aunt?

781
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,940
According to the information we have,

782
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,940
Hong Jinfeng is only a pervert.

783
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,940
He won't intervene in the follow-up.

784
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,940
He only admitted three cases in total.

785
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,940
He doesn't know our findings yet.

786
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,940
Anyway,

787
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,940
this clue may help us find those children.

788
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,940
Under the high importance of the leadership of the provincial public security agency,

789
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,940
the Linxuan City Police Department has just received a report

790
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,940
that the Linxuan City Police Department

791
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,940
has taken effective measures to conduct an investigation.

792
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,940
Hong Jinfeng and Huang Chuan have been arrested.

793
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,940
I am the important person in the investigation.

794
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,940
Hong Yi is in the line?

795
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,940
Don't talk to me.

796
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,940
Will he get us into trouble?

797
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,940
Hong Yi has never seen me.

798
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,940
Every time, Fei Yan contacts him.

799
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,940
He can't find me.

800
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,940
But we really have to be careful.

801
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,940
Look, even the old Hong Yi has been arrested.

802
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,940
We can't underestimate this pervert.

803
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,940
So you have to be careful.

804
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,940
How is the case of the labor company we talked about last time?

805
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,940
The paperwork of the labor export company

806
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,940
is almost done.

807
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,940
But we still need an overseas contract to open it.

808
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,940
Otherwise, even if we find someone,

809
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,940
we won't let them go.

810
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,940
Okay, hurry up.

811
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,940
Okay, I'll go first.

812
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,940
I'll go first.

813
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,940
Lan Ran!

814
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,940
Look, you can't find me.

815
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,940
You're hiding well.

816
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,940
Master, help me find a pink dress.

817
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,940
Okay.

818
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,940
This is the file of the report.

819
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,940
Red shirt.

820
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,940
Black pants.

821
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,940
There's a cat's head in front of the school.

822
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,940
This is right.

823
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,940
Let's eat.

824
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,940
Come on, let's eat.

825
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:25,940
Let's try the fried egg with tomato and sweet potato.

826
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,940
It smells so good.

827
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,940
Okay, thank you.

828
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,940
Let's go.

829
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,940
Let's eat.

830
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,940
Have some more.

831
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,940
Thank you.

832
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,940
It's delicious.

833
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,940
It's delicious.

834
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,940
You're welcome.

835
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,940
Eat more.

00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,940
