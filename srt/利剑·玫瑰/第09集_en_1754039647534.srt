1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The next one is the most difficult one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's a very difficult one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's a very difficult one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a very difficult one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a very difficult one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The hardest ones are the easiest.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The hard ones are the easiest.

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,700
It's easy to forget if you've completed it you know they're not in their Х3..

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,720
It's easy to forget if you've completed it you know they're not in their O3..

10
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,740
It's easy to forget if you'll succeed it.

11
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,940
compensate more

12
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,740
Dongdong, Dongdong

13
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,740
Dongdong

14
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,740
Dongdong

15
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,740
Dongdong

16
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,740
Dongdong

17
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,740
Dongdong

18
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,740
Dongdong

19
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,740
Did you see a boy so tall?

20
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,740
Dongdong

21
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,740
Dongdong

22
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,740
Dongdong

23
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,740
Dongdong

24
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,740
Put the child down, okay?

25
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,740
Let go

26
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,740
Let go

27
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,740
Let go, brother

28
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,740
Let go

29
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,740
What are you doing, Xia Hao?

30
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,740
Get out of the way

31
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,740
I told you to sit there

32
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Why are you here again?

33
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,740
Why are you so ignorant?

34
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,740
Dongdong

35
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,740
Dongdong

36
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,740
Dongdong

37
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
Dongdong

38
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,740
Don't touch my son

39
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,740
Don't come over

40
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,740
Give the child back

41
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,740
Get up

42
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,740
What are you doing?

43
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,740
No, this is my son

44
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,740
Nonsense

45
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,740
We are divorced

46
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,740
The child is all mine

47
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,740
I have the right to explore if you are divorced, okay?

48
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,740
You want to take away my right to explore?

49
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,740
Come here

50
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,740
Enough

51
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,740
Let go

52
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,740
Get out of the way

53
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,740
Who are you?

54
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
I'm a policeman

55
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,740
You see it clearly

56
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,740
Police

57
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,740
What's the situation?

58
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,740
This is my son

59
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,740
We are divorced

60
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,740
The problem of your two couples

61
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,740
You can solve it by yourself

62
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,740
But you shouldn't

63
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,740
Take the child away in broad daylight

64
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,740
Right?

65
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,740
Yes, yes, yes

66
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,740
Thank you, comrade police

67
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,740
Come back

68
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,740
I saw that uncle was so sneaky

69
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,740
I thought he was not a good person

70
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
While that aunt was turning around

71
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,740
He took the little brother away

72
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,740
I thought he was a criminal

73
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,740
I'm sorry, Luoluo

74
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,740
I shouldn't have

75
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,740
Let you go

76
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,740
I'm sorry

77
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,740
I'm sorry

78
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,740
I'm sorry

79
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,740
I shouldn't

80
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,740
I didn't get things clear

81
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,740
I'm sorry

82
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,740
This is your daughter

83
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,740
Thank you for her help

84
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,740
No

85
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,740
It's okay

86
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,740
Dad

87
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Thank you

88
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,740
Let's go, let's go, let's go to play

89
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,740
Dad

90
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,740
Don't run, don't fall

91
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
Dad

92
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,740
I'm a dad

93
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,740
Slow down

94
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,740
Slow down

95
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
Dad

96
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,740
Look, my dad is here

97
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,740
I have a dad

98
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,740
He is my dad

99
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,740
Luoluo, don't run

100
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,740
Don't run

101
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,740
He is a policeman

102
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,740
He is awesome

103
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,740
Luoluo

104
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,740
This is my dad

105
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,740
He is a policeman

106
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,740
He is awesome

107
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,740
I have a dad

108
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,740
My dad is here

109
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Dad

110
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,740
It's obvious that Meng Gui

111
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,740
is behind the red carpet

112
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,740
But it seems that red carpet doesn't care

113
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,740
Instead, it listens to the people

114
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,740
Bai Ban is the subordinate of Qing Pi

115
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,740
I said the goods can't be destroyed

116
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,740
We have to kill one of them

117
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,740
They two

118
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,740
and red carpet, Meng Gui

119
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,740
are not on the same side

120
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,740
We have to re-arrange these two lines

121
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
I have a question

122
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,740
Don't you think that

123
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,740
Han Yougong's appearance is strange?

124
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,740
What if Han Yougong

125
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,740
is the one that Hong Yi

126
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,740
is looking for to cover up for himself?

127
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,740
Master Yao

128
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,740
Do you think

129
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,740
Han Yougong has something to do with Hong Yi?

130
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,740
It's possible

131
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,740
Hong Yi is very cunning

132
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,740
He is good at hiding himself

133
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,740
If Han Yougong

134
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,740
is really the subordinate of Hong Yi

135
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
Then he and Meng Gui

136
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,740
should have more than two children

137
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,740
Jiajia

138
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,740
You keep investigating Meng Gui's route

139
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,740
See where he has been

140
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,740
You keep staring at Qing Pi

141
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,740
I will go to Han Yougong with Cheng Rui

142
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,740
Jiajia

143
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,740
I need you to find out

144
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Meng Gui's recent route

145
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
Including the car that is in NIC 1798

146
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,740
and the car that is in NIC C0 Y30

147
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,740
I will find out

148
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,740
Find those areas

149
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,740
that have been stopped for a long time

150
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
and repeatedly stopped

151
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,740
Combine the lost report of the same period

152
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,740
Maybe you will find out

153
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,740
The car that is in NIC 1798

154
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,740
and the car that is in NIC C0 Y30

155
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,740
will be stopped

156
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,740
and the car that is in NIC C0 Y30

157
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,740
will be stopped

158
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,740
and the car that is in NIC C0 Y30

159
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
will be stopped

160
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,740
and the car that is in NIC C0 Y30

161
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
It will take half an hour

162
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,740
Let's eat something first

163
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,740
I will answer the phone, you go first

164
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
What do you want to eat?

165
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,740
No need to see, just two bowls of noodles

166
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
Do you want cold dishes?

167
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,740
No, how much?

168
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,740
16

169
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,740
Do me a favor

170
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
Ask your sister-in-law

171
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,740
Have you ever heard of a person called Qing Pi?

172
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,740
Boss, I want to ask you something

173
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,740
Have you ever seen this person?

174
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,740
No

175
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,740
Two bowls of noodles

176
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,740
Are you satisfied with the taste?

177
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,740
I have eaten all, look

178
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,740
Give him soup

179
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,740
So much

180
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Then we will have a good meal later

181
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
Ok

182
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Boss

183
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
Show me the menu

184
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,740
Give me the most expensive one

185
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,740
Half a kilo of meat, one piece

186
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,740
Ok, I will come right away

187
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,740
Yes, 68, right?

188
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,740
Here

189
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,740
Girl, you said you were looking for someone

190
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,740
I'm looking for someone, right?

191
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,740
I'm looking for someone

192
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
Ok, let me see

193
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Let me see if you have seen me somewhere

194
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,740
Have you eaten in your shop?

195
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,740
This is a little familiar

196
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,740
Think about it, have you seen me somewhere?

197
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Isn't this her?

198
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,740
Cheng Rui

199
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
Get out of the way

200
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,740
Get out of the way

201
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,740
Be careful

202
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Why are you chasing me?

203
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
Brother Han Yuan

204
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Come with us

205
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,740
Well, two leaders

206
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,740
You must have caught the wrong person

207
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,740
I am a good citizen who follows the law

208
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
Why are you running?

209
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,740
I, what, that

210
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,740
Misunderstood

211
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,740
I thought you were after the debt

212
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,740
People with white teeth don't say they are not cheaters

213
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,740
There is one who will say he is afraid of debt

214
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,740
I am a good citizen

215
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,740
I don't doubt it

216
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,740
It's ok, we are not in a hurry

217
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,740
Didn't Mo Gui have told us?

218
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,740
He sold the child

219
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,740
Let's just sit here

220
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
Ok

221
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,740
You caught Meng Ge too?

222
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,740
That

223
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,740
That leader

224
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,740
It's like this

225
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,740
You are

226
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,740
It's because someone asked me for help

227
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,740
I think

228
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,740
This is also a good thing for people to help

229
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,740
I actually took a little revenge

230
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,740
How many good things did you do for people to help?

231
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
What is your relationship with Hongyi?

232
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
I don't know Hongyi Lanyi

233
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,740
what

234
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,740
Not right

235
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,740
You said you can't match it with Meng Gui

236
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,740
I really don't know

237
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
It's me contacted by Meng Gui

238
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,740
Isn't he selling second-hand cigarettes?

239
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,740
We knew each other when we went one by one

240
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
I just mentioned the matter of buying a child with him

241
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
I didn't expect

242
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,740
He really sent a child over

243
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
He said it was all a thing

244
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
Just give us two children

245
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,740
It's that one

246
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,740
My cousin in Nanyang Hall

247
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
And one of the workers in Xibao Village

248
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
Gone

249
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
How many in the end

250
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,740
Really just two

251
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
How many in the end

252
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,740
It's really just two

253
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
That what

254
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,740
It's like this, listen to me explain

255
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
It's that

256
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,740
Meng Gui did say

257
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,740
Let me go to him when I buy a child

258
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
But I really didn't find him anymore

259
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,740
Because the cousin's child in Nanyang Hall

260
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
Once discovered

261
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
I was afraid

262
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,740
I ran away

263
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,740
I regretted it at that time

264
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
I really regret it

265
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,740
It seems that Han Yougong is not Hongyi's person

266
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Director, the data comparison diagram shows

267
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
Meng Gui's car accident record

268
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,740
It did show red on the scene of the two-step auction case

269
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,740
It means he stayed there

270
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,740
He stayed there

271
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,740
The same model appeared in Watai Village

272
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,740
But the strange thing is

273
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
There is no record of losing the child

274
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,740
Watai Village

275
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,740
Why do I feel like I'm somewhere

276
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,740
I've seen this name

277
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
It seems that a year ago

278
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
What is the announcement

279
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
There is this name

280
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Jia Jia

281
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
You search the nationwide DNA database

282
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
And that

283
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Investigate the announcement

284
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,740
it is good

285
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Yes, that's it

286
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,740
I remember this case

287
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
It was from Bingliu, Xinyang Province

288
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
The crime scene was outside

289
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
The person who reported it was from Watai Village

290
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
So I didn't pay much attention

291
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,740
Watai Village

292
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,740
Meng Gui

293
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,740
Wang Baozhu

294
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,740
That is Zhang Xuegui and Cao Guihua

295
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
The two of them

296
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,740
Was lost outside a year ago

297
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,740
His neighbor is called Wang Baozhu

298
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,740
His name is not asked

299
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
Baozhu

300
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,740
Director, why are you here?

301
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,740
These are

302
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
They are the leaders of the Lin Shan Bureau

303
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
Come to understand the situation

304
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
What can I know?

305
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,740
Nothing

306
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
Know what to say

307
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,740
Don't know, just say you don't know

308
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,740
Have you seen this car and this person?

309
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
I remember this car

310
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,740
It's for selling cigarettes

311
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,740
Just a few days before Xuegui's family left

312
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
I remember very clearly

313
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
Xuegui bought two

314
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,740
I still remember the contact information

315
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Is it him?

316
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
Yes

317
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,740
He sold it

318
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,740
The car stopped

319
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,740
The whole process was a bit of a mess

320
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
30 yuan cheaper

321
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,740
Impossible, that is

322
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,740
Xuegui

323
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,740
Are there guests at home?

324
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,740
No

325
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,740
He sold cheap cigarettes

326
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,740
You don't buy it

327
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,740
Come and see

328
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,740
Let me see

329
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
Think about it

330
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,740
Something was wrong

331
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,740
The one who sells cigarettes seems to like children very much

332
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,740
He kept staring at Zhang Hua

333
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,740
Later he was beaten for a long time

334
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,740
Hello

335
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,740
Jiajia

336
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,740
Director

337
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,740
You go to the DNA database and find information for me

338
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
You found the clue?

339
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,740
According to the clues you provided to Menggui

340
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,740
We caught the surveillance of the bread truck he drove before and after the incident

341
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
Now the situation is basically clear

342
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,740
The suspect followed Zhang Xuegui's family to the ice

343
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,740
He has been lurking near Zhang Xuegui's five-cent store

344
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,740
According to the car license information you provided

345
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,740
Nan C 1798B

346
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,740
We found a repair shop

347
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,740
Their surveillance shows

348
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
When Menggui came to repair the car

349
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,740
He was taken away by a motorcycle

350
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,740
That motorcycle is the same as the motorcycle that was photographed at the crime scene

351
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,740
Look

352
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,740
This is the process of the child's loss

353
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
Let's go

354
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,740
Why does Cao Guihua look a little weird?

355
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,740
You can see it too

356
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
After Zhang Xuegui called the police

357
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,740
We went to his house to know the situation

358
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,740
According to what Zhang Xuegui said

359
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,740
It's not normal for a person like Cao Guihua to be abnormal after giving birth

360
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Later, he couldn't even get out of the door

361
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,740
The criminals also saw this

362
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,740
After the child was lost

363
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,740
Cao Guihua's condition was worse

364
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,740
We also want to find the child as soon as possible

365
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,740
Help them solve the problem

366
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,740
But that village is too biased

367
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,740
Many facilities are not perfect

368
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,740
We searched many places and checked many surveillance

369
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,740
Then there is no more clue

370
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,740
One more thing

371
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,740
We recently rescued a woman who was kidnapped

372
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,740
She came from your Linshan

373
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,740
She is being rescued in the hospital

374
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
We only know her name is Liu Shumei

375
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,740
We want to contact you to confirm her identity

376
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,740
Then you came

377
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,740
I'm coming

378
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Isn't this Meng Gui's wife?

379
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,740
Police

380
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,740
You have asked me many times

381
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,740
I really didn't see Kong Li's lover

382
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,740
I don't know where she is

383
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,740
I have told you what to tell

384
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,740
We are not here to ask you about Hongyi

385
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,740
Let's talk about yourself

386
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,740
Meng Gui, how many children are there in total?

387
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,740
Only one

388
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,740
It's the one my wife took away from the Qixing Square

389
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
Only one

390
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,740
What about the child in Watai Village?

391
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,740
Watai Village?

392
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,740
Look at the photo

393
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,740
This place

394
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,740
Are you familiar?

395
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,740
Don't you think this place is familiar?

396
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
Didn't you go here a year ago?

397
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,740
You forgot

398
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,740
I used to smoke

399
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,740
I went to the island to sell

400
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,740
You sold this house to the Qishihu family

401
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,740
Zhang Xuegong bought your cigarette, right?

402
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,740
You still have a child in his house

403
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,740
I think it's a joke

404
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
It seems to be a joke

405
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,740
After the joke

406
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Zhang Xuegong went to the ice rink after two days

407
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,740
The child was lost

408
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,740
You went to the ice rink at the same time

409
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,740
You came back after the child was lost

410
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Is that so?

411
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,740
I really don't know

412
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
I don't know

413
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,740
I don't know if I should say you are stupid or stupid

414
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740
You don't know what you are now

415
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,740
Look at this

416
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,740
This is a man who was caught in Hexi a few days ago

417
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,740
He was sold by another man on the way

418
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,740
Aida is not less

419
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,740
Fortunately, the police found it in time

420
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,740
Still lying in the yard

421
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,740
Menggui

422
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,740
We don't want anyone to become like this

423
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,740
So we are helping you

424
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,740
If you can take care of everything you know

425
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,740
This can also help you reduce the punishment

426
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,740
You lied to me

427
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,740
You scared me

428
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,740
This is not my wife

429
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,740
My wife has run away

430
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,740
Police station

431
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
I'm sorry

432
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
I'm sorry

433
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,740
I'm sorry

434
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,740
Through Menggui's tape

435
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,740
We finally found Zhang Hao

436
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,740
A family that collapsed in the ice

437
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,740
Reborn

438
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,740
For us

439
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,740
This is the best return

440
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,740
The world is getting weaker

441
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,740
I want to try my best to light up for you

442
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,740
Until the end

443
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,740
When in the vast sea of ​​the world

444
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,740
Looking for your shadow

445
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,740
In addition

446
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,740
The falling point of the red seal is also re-established

447
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,740
In front of us

448
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,740
We seem to catch him

449
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,740
A step closer

450
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,740
Director

451
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,740
I found this account

452
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,740
Why are you still not happy

453
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,740
I want to see if there is more information in the bottom

454
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,740
Xiaoju, Hanzhi

455
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
Xiaoju, Hanzhi

456
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,740
Come

457
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,740
Xiaoju, Hanzhi, drink tea

458
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,740
Is it my tea?

459
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,740
Yes, it's the tea you gave

460
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,740
But it's almost gone

461
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,740
It's quite expensive

462
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,740
How to drink when you are hungry

463
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,740
A child named Zhang Hao was rescued from the ice

464
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,740
Is it the clue you provided?

465
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,740
Yes, I am responsible

466
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,740
What did we do wrong, Xiaoju?

467
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,740
Think about it

468
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,740
What are you missing?

469
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,740
Director Xiao, I caught this

470
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,740
I will be responsible for anything

471
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
Good

472
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,740
The leader's initiative

473
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,740
I tell you

474
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,740
You will be in the future

475
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,740
Hanzhi, what's the situation?

476
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,740
Ai Qing

477
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,740
This is the tea Xiaoju gave you

478
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,740
You are especially you

479
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,740
See for yourself

480
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,740
Hanzhi

481
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
The ice is the public security bureau, public cold

482
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,740
Zhang Hao's case was recently lost

483
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,740
The criminal crossed the province

484
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,740
We are very sad

485
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,740
To find a family

486
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,740
To light up hope and confidence for the general public

487
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,740
We suggest

488
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,740
How about it?

489
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,740
It's scary

490
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
We suggest

491
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,740
Go to the Lin Shan to be a steward

492
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,740
To collect the second class public honor

493
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,740
I want to be your star

494
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,740
The sky is bright and the moon is in the galaxy

495
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,740
You are not going to the second class?

496
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,740
You are not going to the second class?

497
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,740
You are not going to the second class?

498
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,740
Hello

499
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,740
Brother Rui

500
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,740
I found the person you asked us to investigate

501
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,740
He is actually the big fish that our sister-in-law wants to catch

502
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,740
This guy is not simple

503
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,280
He is a head of a

504
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,740
There are hundreds of good people under the boat

505
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,740
There are his shadows in the few night markets of Lin Shan

506
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,740
I followed him for a few days

507
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,740
Found him in a stronghold in Luojiaoxian

508
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
Brother Rui, is it them?

509
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,740
Wait outside, I'll go in

510
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,740
Okay, Brother Rui, slow down

511
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,740
Come on

512
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,740
Who are you looking for?

513
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,740
Come to drink tea

514
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,740
Big fish is on the way

515
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,740
Where is he?

516
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,740
What are you doing?

517
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,740
I didn't say that before I came

518
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,740
This is the rule

519
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,740
Wait outside, I'll come back

520
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
Wait outside, I'll come back

521
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,740
Get on the bed

522
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,740
Hurry up

523
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,740
Hurry up

524
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,740
Don't be afraid

525
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,740
I am a police officer

526
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,740
Police officer

527
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,740
Be quiet

528
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,740
I'll ask you a question today

529
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,740
What's your name?

530
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,740
Okay?

531
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,740
Did you get caught?

532
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,740
Yes

533
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,740
How long have you been here?

534
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,740
Three or four months

535
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,740
Are there any girls like you?

536
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,740
Yes

537
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,740
We have about

538
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,740
Eight girls

539
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,740
Do you know the people who are in charge of you?

540
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,740
Do you know the people who are in charge of you?

541
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,740
How many people are there?

542
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,740
How many people are there?

543
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,740
I have seen

544
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,740
Four or five people

545
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,740
Four or five people?

546
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,740
Look at this picture

547
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,740
The people who are with you

548
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,740
Have you seen him?

549
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,740
Are they together?

550
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Have you seen him?

551
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,740
Are you okay?

552
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
Are you okay?

553
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,740
Are you okay?

554
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,740
Are you stupid?

555
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,740
You have to listen to them

556
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,740
You have to listen to them

557
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,740
We'll have a chance to run out

558
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,740
I told you

559
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,740
I love you

560
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,740
Listen to me, okay?

561
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,740
Don't be stupid

562
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,740
Listen to them

563
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,740
We'll have a chance to run out

564
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,740
Listen to me, okay?

565
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,740
What are you doing?

566
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,740
What are you doing?

567
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,740
What are you doing?

568
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,740
What are you doing?

569
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,740
Zui Bei

570
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,740
Hurry

571
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,740
Do you usually stay here?

572
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
Do you usually stay here?

573
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,740
We always have our eyes closed

574
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,740
I don't know where you are

575
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,740
I don't know where you are

576
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,740

577
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,740

581
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,740
I'm Ping Jiao

582
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,740
Are you okay?

583
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,740
Are you okay?

584
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Are you okay?

585
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,740
I'm fine

586
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,740
I have a lot of time

587
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,740
I have a lot of time

588
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,740
I'm going

589
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,740
Take care

590
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,740
Hurry

591
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,740
Hurry

592
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,740
Hurry

593
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,740
Let's go

594
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,740
Catch Qingpi

595
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,740
Save those girls

596
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,740
Brother Mo

597
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,740
Go

598
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,740
No, Brother Qingpi said

599
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,740
This girl is in bad shape

600
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,740
Let's not touch her

601
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,740
It's up to you

602
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,740
Don't make it difficult for me

603
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,740
Open the door

604
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,740
Open the door

605
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,740
Don't hide in there

606
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
Make a false building

607
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,740
And charge into our back window

608
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,740
What are you hiding?

609
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,740
What are you hiding?

610
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,740
Don't move

611
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,740
Hurry up

612
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,740
Hurry up

613
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,740
Don't move

614
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,740
Don't move

615
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,740
Don't move

616
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,740
Don't move

617
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,740
Hurry up

618
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,740
Where is she?

619
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,740
Here

620
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,740
Director, the girl is on the second floor

621
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,740
Okay

622
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,740
Raise your head

623
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,740
Please stand up

624
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,740
What's your name?

625
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,740
No one I met last time

626
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,740
Okay, sit down

627
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,740
Hello, please stand up

628
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,740
What's your name?

629
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,740
I'm Xiao Zhan

630
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,740
Thank you

631
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,740
Where are the other girls?

632
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,740
I don't know where I came from

633
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,740
Look at me

634
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,740
Where is the girl you brought to me last time?

635
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,740
I really don't know

636
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,740
I'm asking you now

637
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,740
You tell me when you get in

638
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,740
Where?

639
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,740
You gave the boss yesterday

640
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,740
The boss said he had to find another way

641
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,740
Where did you send it?

642
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,740
I really don't know

643
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,740
You ask him, he's my boss

644
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,740
Weiwei

645
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,740
How are you?

646
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,740
This wound

647
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,740
My brother looks so painful

648
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,740
You just have to be honest

649
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,740
Come

650
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740
Take a look

651
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,740
Oh my god

652
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,740
I'm so scared

653
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,740
Get out

654
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,740
Are you sure it's here?

655
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,740
Yes, it's that room

656
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,740
Act now

657
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,740
Go

658
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,740
Sir, we didn't find anything

659
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,740
Let's get out of the car

660
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,740
What's inside?

661
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,740
The clothes inside

662
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,740
Are you sure it's here?

663
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,740
Cheng Rui

664
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,740
You dare to hit me?

665
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,740
Brother Rui

666
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,740
Where is the new skin?

667
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,740
Cheng Rui

668
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,740
You are so good

669
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,740
We are so many people

670
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,740
Surrounding you

671
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,740
The one in the room

672
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,740
The skinny one

673
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,740
He wanted to confess in the room

674
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,740
Do you know why he wanted to confess?

675
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,740
Because he can make a confession

676
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,740
Like you

677
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,740
The criminal who belongs to the police

678
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,740
Is not a criminal

679
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,740
You are not a criminal

680
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,740
You are not a criminal

681
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,740
You are not a criminal

682
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,740
You are not a criminal

683
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,740
If someone can tell you

684
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,740
If someone can tell you

685
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,740
Then he can make a confession

686
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,740
Do you understand?

687
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,740
Our director means

688
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,740
If you all cooperate with the investigation

689
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,740
It won't be much

690
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,740
But if you don't cooperate with the investigation

691
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,740
It's to give them a chance to reduce their punishment

692
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,740
In theory

693
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,740
They should thank you

694
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,740
Can you say it?

695
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,740
I think the situation inside

696
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,740
You don't have much time

697
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,740
You don't have much time

698
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,740
Tell me now

699
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,740
Don't worry about him

700
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,740
It's all clear inside

701
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,740
Take him back

702
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,740
Wait

703
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,740
What?

704
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,740
I'll take care of it

705
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,740
Bite me

706
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,740
What are you doing?

707
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,740
I told you not to move

708
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
Now the investigation is so serious

709
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,740
You are making trouble for me every day

710
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,740
I didn't move

711
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,740
He bite me

712
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,740
Are you okay?

713
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,740
I'm fine

714
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,740
I ask you

715
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,740
Am I a person?

716
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,740
Yes

717
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,740
How can I get a job?

718
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,740
Call

719
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,740
A new customer

720
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,740
But I don't know the emergency

721
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,740
Go out

722
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,740

723
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,740
Someone

724
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,740
Someone

725
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,740
Someone

726
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,740

Someone

731
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,740
Someone

732
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,740
Someone

733
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,740
Someone

734
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,740
Someone

735
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,740

00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,740
Someone

739
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:43,740
Hold her

740
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,740
Call

741
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,740
The dessert box

742
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,740
The dessert box

743
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,740
She isentreüyorum

744
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,740
The dessert box

745
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,580
I asked you

746
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,580
I didn't find anything

747
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,580
Open the door

748
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,580
Come

749
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,580
It's Zhou Weiwei

750
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,580
And please take her to the hospital

751
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,580
Ok

752
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,580
Brother

753
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,580
Is this Zhou Weiwei?

754
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,580
Yes

755
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,580
They left her in the refrigerator

756
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
Maybe they thought she was dead

757
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,580
Where is Qingpin?

758
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,580
I didn't find her

759
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,580
Go, go to the hospital

760
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,580
Go, go, go

761
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,580
Go, go, go

762
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,580
The End

763
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,580
This is the patient's family

764
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,580
Pay the bill

765
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,580
Let me

766
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580

768
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,580
Weiwei

769
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,580
Where is the emergency room?

770
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,580
It's in front

771
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,580
Weiwei

772
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,580

Weiwei

774
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,580
Weiwei

775
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,580
Weiwei

776
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,580
Weiwei

777
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,580
Weiwei

778
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,580
This is Weiwei's parents

779
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,580
Weiwei

780
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,580
Weiwei

781
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,580
Weiwei, I'm mom

782
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,580
Weiwei

783
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,580
Dad

784
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,580
What's going on?

785
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,580
The doctor is trying his best to rescue her

786
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,580
Rescue?

787
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,580
Yes

788
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,580
The doctor

789
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,580
No, no

790
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,580
She

791
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,580
Where is she?

792
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,580
Hurry

793
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,580
Aunt

794
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,580
Sit down

795
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,580
What's going on?

796
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,580
Where is she?

797
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,580
Why did you rescue her?

798
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,580
When we found her, she was weak

799
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,580
So we sent her to the hospital

800
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,580
She is still in danger

801
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,580
It's dangerous

802
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,580
Aunt

803
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,580
Weiwei

804
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,580
Calm down, aunt

805
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,580
The End

806
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,580
The End

807
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,580
The End

808
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,580
The End

809
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,580
The End
