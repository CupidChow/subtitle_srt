=Episode 19=

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,280
Well...

4
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Have you found his real parents?

5
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:45,200
Here's the thing.

6
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,111
We're not sure yet.

7
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,960
We still need another blood test

8
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,240
to confirm it.

9
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,280
Yuan.

10
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,970
Come here. Hurry, Yuan.

11
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,080
Hurry, sit here.

12
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,440
Who are they?

13
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,680
These two
are police officers from the city.

14
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:09,377
They're taking you to the city.

15
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,680
For what?

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,520
For school.

17
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,600
Yuan.

18
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,120
Here's the thing.

19
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,760
We came here today

20
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,880
to learn more about you.

21
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,530
I'm not going.

22
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:30,980
And then...

23
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,160
This is my home.

24
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,040
I'm not leaving.

25
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,440
Yuan, speak nicely to the officers.

26
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,080
I'm not going with them!

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,520
Going to school in the city

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,880
can help you get a good job
in the future.

29
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,040
I'm not going with them.

30
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,480
This is my real home.

31
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm not going with them.

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,960
I want to stay with you.

33
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,520
You want a life like mine?

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,760
I want to stay with you.

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,640
Get out!

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,040
Get out!

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,270
- You!
- Get out!

38
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,680
What's wrong with you?

39
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,040
Don't get upset.

40
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,200
Even you reject me now!

41
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Even you don't want me anymore?

42
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,120
Why did you pick me up at all?

43
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,920
Why didn't you let me die back then?

44
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,330
Yuan!

45
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,950
Yuan!

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Slow down!

47
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:53,480
Did you find her?

48
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
How did it go?

49
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,680
She's not home.

50
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,560
Did the call go through?

51
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,320
No.

52
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,888
I've been trying, but I can't reach her.

53
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:04,280
We've looked everywhere
we could think of.

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,840
What happened?

55
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,369
Director Deng, you're finally here.

56
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,333
What should we do now?

57
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:09,311
No, wait.

58
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,960
Don't panic.

59
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,720
One at a time.

60
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,622
Xiaoxing, you go first.

61
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:12,320
This morning...

62
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,160
This morning, Madam Zhang
and I came here together.

63
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,160
On our way here,

64
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,040
the hospital told me to get the report.

65
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,160
I went,
thinking it was just two blocks away.

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680
She could come herself.

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,890
I was about to call you
after getting the report.

68
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,280
And Ms. Meilian called to say

69
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,000
Madam Zhang never came.

70
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,160
So we started searching everywhere.

71
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,360
We can't reach her by phone,

72
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,733
and she's nowhere to be found.

73
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,680
We ran out of ideas.

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,040
Madam Zhang is
always the first to arrive.

75
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,980
When I came in today, she wasn't here.

76
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,140
I waited.

77
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,760
I thought she overslept, but...

78
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,620
No. Did she go home to rest?

79
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,422
No.

80
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:45,550
I heard about her illness.

81
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,880
Could she be in danger?

82
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,420
What illness?

83
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,520
Her illness must have

84
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,710
- made her confused.
- Director Deng.

85
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:50,660
She can't find her way.

86
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,160
Here's the report from this morning.

87
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,600
Yes.

88
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,830
Alzheimer's disease.

89
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:55,111
(Diagnosis: Mid-Stage Alzheimer)
Mid-stage.

90
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:55,777
Yeah.

91
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,040
What should we do?

92
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,240
We've searched malls, supermarkets,

93
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,240
parks, and so on.

94
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,520
I checked every place I could think of.

95
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,600
I can't find her.

96
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,160
Where else could she go?

97
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,080
Yeah.

98
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,590
Alright.

99
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,120
I know a few places

100
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,520
Madam Zhang might have gone to.

101
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,530
Let's split up and search.

102
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:11,955
Okay.

103
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,680
Hurry.

104
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,440
Kid, you're quite stubborn.

105
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,560
You cried?

106
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,260
How can a man shed tears?

107
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,360
Aren't you ashamed?

108
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,720
I'm not crying.
I don't need you to persuade me.

109
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
Who said I'm persuading you?

110
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,600
When I got sick,

111
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,160
my birth parents abandoned me.

112
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,560
Now that I'm well,

113
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,400
who gave them the right to take me back?

114
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,240
Who told you that?

115
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,760
Your birth parents

116
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,420
never abandoned you.

117
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,520
You

118
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,730
were abducted by human traffickers.

119
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,740
I believe

120
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,320
no parents hate their children.

121
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:00,444
They must've never stopped
looking for you.

122
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,666
I still refuse.

123
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,280
They live well in the city.

124
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,880
My dad's different.

125
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,760
He's old.

126
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,020
His back aches after collecting junk.

127
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,880
If I leave now,

128
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,880
who will care for him?

129
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,240
(I spoiled this child
since he was young.)

130
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,840
Don't mind it.

131
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,480
So...

132
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,110
Since you've raised him all this time,

133
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,800
why

134
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,100
look for his birth parents now?

135
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,570
I'm getting old

136
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,380
and have poor health.

137
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,090
Isn't he about to start middle school?

138
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,970
If he stays with me,

139
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,600
he'll just be a junk collector too.

140
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
I picked him up

141
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
and treated him as my own son.

142
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,680
I want the best for him.

143
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,060
So,

144
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,120
letting his parents in the city
take him back

145
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,360
and let him study in the city

146
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,360
is better than staying with me.

147
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,760
But have you thought about

148
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,120
what you're going to do alone

149
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,000
if he leaves for the city?

150
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,000
Yuan...

151
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,320
Yuan...

152
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,080
(If you stay,)

153
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,066
(how will you care for him?)

154
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,000
Collect junk?

155
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:35,422
Do physical work to take care of him?

156
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:44,355
Yuan.

157
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,880
You have good grades.

158
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Mr. Qi

159
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
holds high hopes for you.

160
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,920
He wants you to leave the mountains,

161
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,920
get into university,

162
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,170
live your own life,

163
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,880
and make something of your life.

164
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,510
Only in that way

165
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,060
can you take good care of him.

166
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:08,400
Right?

167
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,040
I've said so much

168
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,680
not to persuade you.

169
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,360
I just want to tell you

170
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,480
what I felt

171
00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:38,222
after experiencing all these.

172
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,550
What did you experience?

173
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:57,850
Nothing.

174
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,680
You ran off crying.

175
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,120
Mr. Qi must be worried.

176
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,160
Let's head back.

177
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,240
Wipe your tears.

178
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,520
Men don't cry.

179
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,620
(Songtao Road)

180
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,100
(Linnan Primary School, Linshan City)

181
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,940
Madam Zhang?

182
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,360
Why are you here?

183
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,840
Come on.

184
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,040
Everyone's worried.

185
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,760
Go back with me.

186
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,480
Head Nurse Zeng?

187
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
Aren't you on duty today?

188
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,680
You came to pick up Yanyan?

189
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,200
Ranran still hasn't come out.

190
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:58,088
I wonder if the teacher
is holding the class back again.

191
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,360
Madam Zhang.

192
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,390

are playing at my house.

Come over to my place.

196
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,680
Ranran went to your place again?

197
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,000
That girl

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,240
didn't even tell me.

Alright, let's go.

200

I thought you were on duty.

201
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,880
Running off like that

202
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,240
will worry your dad.

Hurry and wipe your tears.

Apologize to your dad. Good boy.

207
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,640

208

211
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,850
I shouldn't have hit you.

212

213
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,911
I can't bear to part with you.

214
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't want to leave.

215
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,120
I want to stay by your side.

216
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,800
Once you move to the city,

217
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,280
listen to the grown-ups.

218
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,640
How is she?

219
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,960
She's fine.
She's already asleep. Don't worry.

220
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,880
Here, have a seat.

221
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,130
Can this illness be cured?

222
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,880
Xiaoxing.

223
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,440
What did the doctor say?

224
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,410
The doctor said

225
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,480
medication only helps

226
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,800

227
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,560
Most importantly,

228
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,780
she needs
her family's care and companionship.

229
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,920
That means there's no cure.

230
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,600
We can only hope Madam Zhang's illness

231
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,970
progresses slowly.

232
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,350

Usually, people with this illness

233
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,290
don't even know they have it.

234
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,960
How do we tell her?

235
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,570
Yeah, should we

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,360
tell her or keep it from her?

237
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,800
The doctor said

238
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,040
it's best not to tell her at this stage.

239
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,840
Or it could trigger her.

240
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,220
I'll come to Tuanyuan Restaurant often

241
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,440

242
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,120
I hope you all

243
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,330
can also look after her.

244
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,550
Of course.

245
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,680
Don't worry.

246
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,960
I'll be extra cautious from now on.

247
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,770
Don't blame yourself.

248

they abandoned me

00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,920

just to find their children.

531
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,000
But others

532
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,990
didn't mean to give up their children...

533
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,080
They just

534
00:35:38,088 --> 00:35:39,555
couldn't provide for them.

535
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,260
Life has to go on after all.

536
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,710
I get it.

537
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:48,533
What do you plan to do now?

538
00:35:49,222 --> 00:35:50,866
I live with my adoptive parents,

539
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,120
but

540
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
my biological parents

541
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,280
want me to go back

542
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,920
so that the four of us

543
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,760
can start anew.

544
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,940
Are you going back with them?

545
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,120
They never had other kids

546
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,790
for me.

547
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,120
I'm all they have.

548
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,830
Seeing Sun Xiaoguang and Mr. Qi

549
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,840
made me think of us.

550
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,400
So you asked me out for drinks

551
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,240
to ask what I'd do?

552
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,280
I think

553
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,960
you already knew the answer

554
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,050
the moment you asked me out.

555
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,720
You just couldn't decide.

556
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,030
If you return
to your biological parents,

557
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,888
your adoptive parents will be hurt.

558
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,520
But if you don't go back,

559
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,180
your biological parents

560
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,822
will always regret it.

561
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,010
But that's how life is.

562
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,480
Nothing is perfect.

563
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,520
But I think

564
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,380
the wound didn't happen overnight.

565
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,320
So it won't heal overnight.

566
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,400
Give yourself time.

567
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,960
And give both families time.

568
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,288
What do you think?

569
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,160
Rui.

570
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,720
Actually,

571
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:57,088
I joined Anti-abduction Office
for a different reason than you.

572
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,160
When I got into the police academy,

573
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,088
I already wanted to join
Anti-abduction Office.

574
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,480
I wanted to fight trafficking

575
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,000
because I don't want other kids

576
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,240
to be like me.

577
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:21,729
Let's talk about something cheerful.

578
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,520
(Madam Hong's arrest)

579
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,390
(led to the discovery
of several missing kids.)

580
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,480
(Rui.)

581
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:27,355
(Let's keep working hard.)

582
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:35,660
(Help Find My Daughter.
Tuanyuan Restaurant)

583
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,080
Liu, you're here.

584
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,560
Meilian.

585
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,910
Congratulations.

586
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,080
How has it been
after Xiaoxiao came home?

587
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,280
Are you getting along well?

588
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,160
Here, tell me all about it.

589
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,360
Grandpa and grandchild

590
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,266
are family after all.

591
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,200
Blood is thicker than water.

592
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,280
Is that so?

593
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,760
Liu's here.

594
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,480
How is it?

595
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,110
Your precious grandson is back.

596
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,760
That's what I asked.

597
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,960
Look how light his steps are.

598
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,040
He must enjoy being a grandpa.

599
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,800
Right?

600
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,520
I waited day after day

601
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,400
and finally got him back.

602
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,560
It feels just like a dream.

603
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,480
I want to hold him all day long

604
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,320
and never let him leave my side.

605
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,800
But I can't do that, can I?

606
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,750
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

607
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,200
Your grandson is back.

608
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,720
You should spend more time with him.

609
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,040
You don't need

610
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,022
to come here every day.

611
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,080
Go home.

612
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,080
Yes, Liu.

613
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,920
You finally reunited with your grandson.

614
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,080
You should focus on your family.

615
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,480
Are...

616
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,520
Are you kicking me out?

617
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,160
We're not kicking you out.

618
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,520
We're just saying

619
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,200
spending time with your grandson

620
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,960
matters more than staying here.

621
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,310
- Go home!
- Yeah.

622
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,200
Liu.

623
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,080
Go home. I...

624
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,140
Listen.

625
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,520
I came back

626
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,400
to see you all.

627
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,840
And also...

628
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,460
(Missing Person)

629
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,840
We should remove Xiaoxiao's photo.

630
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,200
Well...

631
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,240
Liu.

632
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,720
You do it.

633
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,600
You do it yourself.

634
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:25,920
Alright.

635
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,540
(Missing Person)

636
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,960
Xiaoxiao...

637
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:41,960
is home now.

638
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:46,460
(Missing Person)

639
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,822
All the children will go home.

640
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,920
Yes.

641
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,200
With Yanyan there,

642
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,560
they'll all go home.

643
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,680
Yes.

644
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,080
They'll all come home.

645
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,440
We'll find them.

646
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:24,820
(Missing Person)

647
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,720
(Missing Person, Name: Lin Ran)
We'll gather all the kids

648
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,520
and make them a big feast.

649
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:32,840
Zhang.

650
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,480
You'll make your signature dumplings.

651
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,280
Meilian, you can make cold dishes.

652
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,960
Let's give them a proper reunion

653
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,520
and a good time.

654
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,200
Yes.

655
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,520
I'll make them dumplings.

656
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,320
Yes.

657
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,800
Everyone will gather together.

658
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,400
Yes.

659
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,880
It'll be fun.

660
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,780
Yes.

661
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,580
(Missing Person)

662
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,860
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

663
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,720
As Skinner,

664
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,680
Huang Chuan, Madam Hong,

665
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,240
and other traffickers were arrested,

666
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,760
several cold cases

667
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,500
surfaced again.

668
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,240
Through joint efforts,

669
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
we found Bai Xiujing, abducted in 1994,

670
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,930
Sun Xiaoguang, abducted in 1998,

671
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,830
and rescued
the recently abducted Zheng Weiwei,

672
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:17,500
Little Spud,

673
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,270
and other abducted people.

674
00:42:19,644 --> 00:42:21,430
This shows
Linshan's anti-trafficking work

675
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,630
has achieved a partial victory.

676
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,960
Next,

677
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,680
we'll focus on Cripple.

678
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,200
From confessions
we've gathered from those arrested,

679
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,480
Cripple is likely

680
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,080
still hiding in Linshan.

681
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,760
We've long wanted to capture

682
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,130
that trafficker, Cripple.

683
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:41,020
He was very active in the early 90s.

684
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,960
He was involved in nearly every case.

685
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,920
He was once the biggest trafficker

686
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,640
in Linshan City

687
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,080
and nearby areas.

688
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,920
But in the last decade,

689
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,160
news of him

690
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,600
vanished abruptly.

691
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,640
It's like he disappeared.

692
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,080
Even without further leads,

693
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,440
we must not let down our guard

694
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,160
