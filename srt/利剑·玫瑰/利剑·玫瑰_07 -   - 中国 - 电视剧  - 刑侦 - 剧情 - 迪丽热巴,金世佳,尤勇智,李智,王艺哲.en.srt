3
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,120
This one is great.

4
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,700
Hurry! Everyone this way!

5
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,950
Over there!

6
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,430
That way!

7
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,230
Quick! That way!

8
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,644
Where do you think you're going?

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,040
- Stop!
- Freeze!

10
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,960
Get down!

11
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:01,777
Are you okay?

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,760
Stop right there!

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,150
- Don't move!
- Get down!

14
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,760
- Freeze!
- Stay there!

15
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,640
Freeze!

16
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
There are two kids here.

17
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,590
Don't cry. It's okay now.

18
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,760
Let me take that off for you.

19
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,080
I'll take you home.

20
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,160
We'll find your mom.

21
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:15,177
There you go.

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,270
Don't cry. It's okay now.

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,320
Let's go.

24
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,990
Stop!

25
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,790
Go! Move!

26
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:31,488
There are more over there!

27
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,710
I want my mommy.

28
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,480
I want my mommy.

29
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,110
Meng Gui.

30
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:57,710
Do you know why we arrested you?

31
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,880
No idea.

32
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm confused myself.

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,710
Why did you arrest me?

34
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,280
Officer,

35
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,830
I was just taking a bath.

36
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,222
I didn't even go upstairs.

37
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:07,111
I didn't do anything.

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,930
Then what about those three kids
in your car?

39
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:09,950
Where did they come from?

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,230
Three kids?

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,670
I have no idea.

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,760
Officer,

43
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,230
I'm just a driver for hire.

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,590
I just picked up the car today,

45
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,320
and then drove it to the bathhouse.

46
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,933
And someone else took it from there.

47
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,640
I don't know anything else.

48
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,510
You don't know anything?

49
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,230
Do you remember
why you were here last time?

50
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,470
Funny coincidence, isn't it?

51
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,830
Every time kids are involved,
you show up.

52
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,870
Let me ask you,

53
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,230
you drove to the bathhouse.

54
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,480
Who told you to go there?

55
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,040
I got a call.

56
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,360
I go wherever I'm told.

57
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,560
Meng Gui,

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,680
do you think your wife

59
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,222
has already left Linshan?

60
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,830
Let me tell you something.

61
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,310
Your accomplices

62
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,830
are blaming everything on you.

63
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:03,870
They're all waiting to testify
against you

64
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,920
to get an early release.

65
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,980
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,190
According to Meng Gui,

67
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,160
he's just the driver.

68
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,460
He was responsible for delivering
kidnapped children

69
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:15,333
to the traffickers.

70
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,830
This time, with Little Spud,

71
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,333
he was acting under the orders
of someone called Madam Hong.

72
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,080
Any updates from the
Hongtoushan Residential Area?

73
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,350
No news for now.

74
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,120
At the moment, all we have

75
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,760
is the name "Madam Hong".

76
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:39,444
But Meng Gui says he only had
a single point of contact,

77
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,640
so Jiajia is still verifying
the contact list.

78
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,190
Lawyer Sun.

79
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,750
Take it easy.

80
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,670
There's plenty more.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,430
Thanks.

82
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,350
Don't mention it.

83
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,190
Vice Director.

84
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,430
You're unbelievable.

85
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:09,590
I bailed you out
in the middle of the night,

86
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:10,910
and you didn't even say thanks.

87
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,800
Mo Lin goes up
the mountain every day,

88
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,180
picking mushrooms or chopping wood.

89
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,844
There's nothing much for me to do there.

90
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:19,533
So Rui let me come back
to change clothes.

91
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,400
Director Deng.

92
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,640
Lawyer Sun.

93
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,310
What happened?

94
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,760
I brought him back last night.

95
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,990
Luckily,

96
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,470
it wasn't a wasted trip.

97
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,760
He brought us news about Little Spud.

98
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,920
(Harmony and Happiness)
Yeah.

99
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,200
That kid really does look like
Little Yam.

100
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,120
It's Little Spud.

101
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,320
But in the village, everyone thinks

102
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
that's Zheng Mingguang's own child.

103
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,910
Besides, the villagers here

104
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,390
really stick together.

105
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,080
I'm afraid this won't be easy.

106
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,560
But no matter what,

107
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,350
we need evidence first.

108
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,680
We'll go check it out,

109
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,390
but we shouldn't bring too many people.

110
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,350
After you.

111
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,560
Drooling again, huh?

112
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,000
Watch the door.

113
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,550
Hongmei.

114
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:39,070
These people are from
the township police

115
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,133
and the local government.

116
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,200
They're here for the population census.

117
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:44,844
Hi, there. We're doing
a population survey.

118
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,440
You're Liu Hongmei, right?

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,720
Yes.

120
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,560
Your husband is Zheng Mingguang?

121
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:52,911
And your child is Zheng Wendong?

122
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,840
That's right.

123
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,190
How old is the baby?

124
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,670
Six months.

125
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,190
That's right.

126
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,510
Liu Hongmei gave birth
here in our hospital,

127
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,080
but the baby was born prematurely
at seven months.

128
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:04,822
(Birth Certificate)
I remember it clearly.

129
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:06,422
Please get your household register.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,920
Okay.

131
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,200
I'll go get the household register.

132
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,800
Looks good. No problem.

133
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:31,470
Please sign and give a thumbprint.

134
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,080
Okay.

135
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,710
Put the baby down.

136
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,680
Alright.

137
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,510
Mommy

138
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,800
needs to sign something.

139
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,950
You lie down right here.

140
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,110
Where do I sign?

141
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,510
Don't smack yourself.

142
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,270
Just sneezed.

143
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,830
Don't cry.

144
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,240
There, there.

145
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,150
Poor baby, so upset.

146
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,750
It's alright now.

147
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,880
No more tears, Sweetie.

148
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,120
Wow, so heavy!

149
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,720
Must've been eating well, right?

150
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,830
Not like my kid.

151
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,390
You're so young and already
have a child?

152
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,750
Come here.

153
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,870
Sweetie.

154
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,333
You kidding? I'm not young anymore.

155
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,200
My kid is always in the hospital.

156
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,155
Seeing how strong and healthy
other kids are,

157
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,150
I get so envious.

158
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,600
This child's immune system
is really fragile.

159
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,950
Always getting sick.

160
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,910
The last time they came in
was just recently.

161
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,270
The child had recurring pneumonia.

162
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,480
I recommended

163
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,511
that they let the child stay
in the hospital longer

164
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:33,190
for observation.

165
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,710
But the parents saw that their child
was getting better

166
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:37,377
and thought the fees were too high,

167
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,320
so they checked out.

168
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,110
Can't let a kid stay sick like that.

169
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,360
And your job keeps you so busy.

170
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,960
Caring for a sick child on top of that

171
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,110
is not easy.

172
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,630
Are you hungry?

173
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,560
You're crying.

174
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:51,190
He needs a diaper change.

175
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,360
Alright, you go ahead.

176
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,710
Take care of it.

177
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,120
That's all from us, right?

178
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes, yes.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,422
Great.

180
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:57,288
Take care, then.

181
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,520
There, there.

182
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,040
We're leaving now. Thank you.

183
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,440
Let's go.

184
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,360
We'll check the records.

185
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,830
When we caught you,

186
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,080
where was the child?

187
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,830
I really don't remember.

188
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,550
It was wherever Madam Hong told me.

189
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,644
I already said everything.

190
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,230
I've got no sense of direction.

191
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,590
You're saying you're
terrible with directions?

192
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,200
According to Article 240

193
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,400
of the Criminal Law of the PRC,

194
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,270
those who traffic women or children

195
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,120
shall be sentenced
to 5 to 10 years in prison

196
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,040
and fined.

197
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,230
It's not worth it, isn't it?

198
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,950
Officer,

199
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,800
I'm just the driver.

200
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:05,440
I wasn't part of the trafficking.

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,920
It probably

202
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,110
isn't a big deal, right?

203
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:09,830
Do you even know what trafficking means?

204
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,630
Trafficking is committed with the intent
to sell the victim.

205
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,600
It involves luring, kidnapping,
buying, selling, transporting

206
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,440
or transferring women or children.

207
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,750
Handlers sold the child.

208
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,000
Buyers bought the child.

209
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,222
And you handled the transport.

210
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,470
That is trafficking.

211
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,870
How would I know
the kids were trafficked?

212
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,350
I really didn't know.

213
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,720
I'm just the errand guy

214
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,844
trying to make some money.

215
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,640
Meng Gui.

216
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,870
We have an eyewitness.

217
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,120
You were in a white car,

218
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,822
parked in a surveillance blind spot
near the Central Garden Square.

219
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,230
Then your wife came out
carrying the child.

220
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,440
This child.

221
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,560
Your wife handed the child to you,

222
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,230
and you packed him in a big travel bag.

223
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
When we arrested you,

224
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,440
the baby in the car was indeed your own.

225
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,110
Because you'd already transferred
the trafficked child

226
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,280
to that other van.

227
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,360
Isn't that right?

228
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,880
Meng Gui.

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,920
This is pointless.

230
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,190
Completely pointless.

231
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,960
If you won't talk,

232
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,350
we'll just sit here forever.

233
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:18,311
Eventually, you'll be handed over
to the prosecutor's office.

234
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,320
Might as well speak now.

235
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,222
At least you could get
a lighter sentence.

236
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,470
Right now,

237
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,990
you're just wasting time.

238
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,160
Alright, I'll talk.

239
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,280
So, based on his statement,

240
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,750
Little Spud and the child

241
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,470
we rescued from Yang Yong's place

242
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,350
were both bought from Meng Gui.

243
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,710
A few days ago...

244
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,040
Madam Hong told me
to deliver a little boy

245
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,710
to a guy named Han Yougang
in Nanyangdian Village.

246
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,222
I tried Han Yougang's phone

247
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:21,080
and his relatives' contacts.

248
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,590
No luck. He disappeared.

249
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,230
(Then suddenly, Han Yougang called me)

250
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,830
and asked if I had any stock.

251
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,520
He said if I didn't,
he'd find someone else.

252
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,830
So I thought,

253
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,440
moving kids around

254
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,377
comes with a lot of risk
but barely any money.

255
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,720
I may as well

256
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,977
sell him one of my own kids.

257
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,200
I could take the entire cut

258
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,022
and use the money
to buy stuff for my kids.

259
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,950
So I agreed.

260
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,830
Then I figured,

261
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,920
that at the Central Garden Square
on Xinmin Road,

262
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,080
there are always old people
out there with kids.

263
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,160
So over those few days, I told

264
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,350
Han Yougang to get ready.

265
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,520
What do you think?

266
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,920
Is the kid okay?

267
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,470
Yeah, looks good to me.

268
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,920
Same deal as always?

269
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,430
Sixty thousand.

270
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,710
Come on, Meng.

271
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,080
We're old friends,

272
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,600
and this isn't my first time buying.

273
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,555
I'll buy more in the future,
so give me a deal.

274
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,520
Forty thousand.

275
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,920
Fifty.

276
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,200
Alright, fifty it is.

277
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:28,911
Here's twenty thousand.

278
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,470
Count it.

279
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,390
I'll hold him now.

280
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,310
Alright.

281
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,310
Careful, careful.

282
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
I'm off, Meng.

283
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,310
You must be tired.

284
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,160
Have some water.

285
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,920
This is where we had our first date.

286
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,120
Yeah.

287
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,040
I remember.

288
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:35,990
You were eating a bag of chips
the whole time.

289
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,670
I thought

290
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,080
you were just nervous
about our first date.

291
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,520
Then I found out

292
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:46,080
you just really love chips.

293
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,680
Then you told me,

294
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,520
"Since you love chips so much,

295
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,590
when we get married
and have a kid someday,

296
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
let's name him Little Potato."

297
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,920
And then you kept shaking your head,

298
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,470
saying that name was too silly.

299
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,990
You wanted a more stylish name.

300
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,800
So we called him

301
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,710
Little Spud.

302
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,400
Lin Hao.

303
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,230
Let's get a divorce.

304
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,200
I know your mom didn't mean it.

305
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,110
She was trying to save someone.

306
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,080
But every time I think about it,

307
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,710
I've got this awful weight on my chest.

308
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,160
It keeps me up night after night.

309
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,830
Xin...

310
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,590
Lin Hao, I can't do this anymore.

311
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,320
I really can't.

312
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm scared to even go home now.

313
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,040
I'm afraid that if I see her...

314
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,520
I know I shouldn't blame her,

315
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,520
but deep down, I do.

316
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,550
Why did she have to

317
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,320
save a stranger?

318
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,440
It was because she stopped to help

319
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,320
that the traffickers got their chance.

320
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,630
That's how Little Spud got taken.

321
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,480
Xin,

322
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,400
my mom...

323
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,950
- She...
- I know.

324
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,400
She didn't mean to.

325
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,920
But do I...

326
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,630
Do I just have to accept all of this?

327
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,590
Because of her...

328
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,680
I lost my child, Lin Hao.

329
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,280
Xin...

330
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:42,790
Then we'll rent a place.

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,920
We'll move out.

332
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,110
That's not fair to her.

333
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,230
And it's not fair to you.

334
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:00,230
I saw a doctor.

335
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,670
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

336
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,910
Severe depression.

337
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,760
I have to be on medication long-term.

338
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,630
And while I'm on meds,

339
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,960
I can't have another child.

340
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,640
Xin, as long as we're together,

341
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,510
none of that matters.

342
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,430
Lin Hao.

343
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,880
Let's get divorced.

344
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,910
It's the best choice

345
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,480
for both of us.

346
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,120
Xin.

347
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:44,644
If you leave, Little Spud
won't have a home anymore.

348
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,555
Xin...

349
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,590
We can't divorce, Xin.

350
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,720
Xin...

351
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,830
Little drum...

352
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,830
Under the bridge
in front of our house...

353
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,720
A group of ducks swims past...

354
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,240
Look who's home!

355
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,000
Daddy's home!

356
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,360
Hao.

357
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,830
Why are you drunk?

358
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,430
Where's Xin?

359
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,950
Xin...

360
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
Xin doesn't want me anymore.

361
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,190
She doesn't want this family anymore.

362
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,430
She wants a divorce.

363
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,870
Nonsense!

364
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,870
Daddy doesn't rock you as well, huh?

365
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,630
My child is gone.

366
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,960
My wife is gone.

367
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,240
Mom...

368
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,830
Why did you have to take Little Spud

369
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,511
to that park?

370
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,400
If you hadn't taken him there,

371
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,670
none of this would've happened!

372
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
I told you.

373
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,270
Didn't I tell you?

374
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,480
Don't take the kid out alone.

375
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,422
Wait for me to come home
and we'll go together.

376

Why?

380
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,590
Why, Mom?

381
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,600
Hao,

382
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,430
I'm sorry.

383
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,280

Don't pinch our cheeks.
The baby is drooling.

386
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,510
I shouldn't have gone out.
Why did I go out?

387
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,110
Why did I...

388
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,030
Hao!

389
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,670

390
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,933
Don't be like this.

391
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:21,720

I'm sorry.

395
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,111
You did nothing wrong.

396
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:25,960
It's my fault!

397
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,200
You didn't do anything wrong.

398
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,110
It was me, Mom. I'm the one to blame.

399

If we lose Little Spud too,

400

461
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,044

462
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:22,240

464
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,870

465
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,190
Save it for the station.

466
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,750

00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,110

471
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,710
Here's the child.

472
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,000
Article 241, Paragraph 6
of the Criminal Law

473
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,920
clearly states,

474
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,790
whoever buys a trafficked child

475
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,866
but doesn't abuse them
or obstruct rescue efforts

476
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:43,800
may receive a lighter sentence.

477
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:45,480
I don't understand what you're saying.

478
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,160
Please give me back my child.

479
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,310
Give me back my baby!

480
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,133
If you bought the child,
it's still illegal.

481
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:52,177
We have the right to arrest you.
Do you understand?

482
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,250
I...

483
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,960
I'll cooperate,

484
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,066
but at least wait until
my husband gets back.

485
00:23:58,111 --> 00:23:59,822
We'll find him ourselves. Take her away.

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,400
Go!

487
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,960

495
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,520

496
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,870

497
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,720

498
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,280
Dekuan, they're taking my child.

499
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:24,550
They keep saying he's not mine.

500
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,466
Stop talking nonsense.

501
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:26,270
Please help me!

502
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,240

506
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240

509
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,977
We held a full-month banquet
for the baby.

510
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:36,866
- Stop shouting.
- You were all there.

511
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,129
We attended that banquet.

512
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,800
- Please help us!
- We even gave gifts.

513
00:24:39,822 --> 00:24:40,870
How could he not be theirs?

514
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,000
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

515
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,220
The police made a mistake.
They just want to take the kid.

516
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,000
Isn't that right?

517
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
- Yes!
- Yes!

519
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,960

521
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,440
Please clear the way, okay?

522
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,550
We don't care!

523
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,550

00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,470
Clear the way!

564
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,160
Go...

565
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,510
Go!

566
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,270
Back up.

567
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,520
Don't let them take him!

568
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,110
No way!

569
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,280
I paid so much money for that child!

570
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,320
We can't let them take him!

571
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,240
Director Deng!

572
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,960
Step back.

573
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,430
Jiajia, go! Now!

574
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,990
Leave the child!

575
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,240
Don't go!

576
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,160
Leave the child!

577
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,480
Leave the child!

578
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,400
Don't move! Back up!

579
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:51,440
Back up! Police!

580
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,360
Back up!

581
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,110
Put that down!

582
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,590
Put it down!

583
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,510
Calm down!

584
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,550
Step back!

585
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,470
Everyone, step back!

586
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:58,790
Don't move.

587
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,710
Put it down.

588
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,320
Seize him.

589
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,280
- Stop!
- Stop!

590
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,560
Don't run.

591
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,640
Mom.

592
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,950
Mom.

593
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,840
(Hao,)

594
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,590
(your dad came to see me last night.)

595
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,240
(I told him)

596
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,430
(I'd leave with him today.)

597
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,150
(I'm going to find him.)

598
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,550
Hello, Uncle?

599
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,520
Is my mom with you?

600
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,880
Okay, got it. Thanks.

601
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,830
Okay.

602
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,750
Hello, Mrs. Luo.

603
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,800
Is my mom with you?

604
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,280
Okay, I understand. Thanks.

605
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,950
Hello, Xin?

606
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,600
Listen to me first.

607
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,120
Mom is missing.

608
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,440
Okay.

609
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,830
We're heading over now.

610
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,760
Thanks so much.

611
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,720
Lin Hao, don't worry.

612
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,350
The police found her on surveillance.

613
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,440
She's at Mangjiang Bridge.

614
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,777
They've already dispatched a car.

615
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,280
Okay, let's go now.

616
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,240
Look, he's staring.

617
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,190
We're going home.

618
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,830
Isn't this your favorite cartoon?

619
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,920
Cai Xin.

620
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,400
Listen...

621
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,040
Director Deng, bad news.

622
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,030
My mother-in-law
is not thinking straight.

623
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,422
She's at Mangjiang Bridge right now.

624
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,690
She might do
something foolish!

625
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,030
What?

626
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,920
This morning,

627
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,550
she left a suicide note for Lin Hao.

628
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,680
Director Deng, where are you?

629
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,910
Wait, Cai Xin...

630
00:30:35,155 --> 00:30:35,960
Wait for a second.

631
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,720
Just listen to me.

632
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,030
- Please...
- I know.

633
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,088
Please hear me out first.

634
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,400
We've found Little Spud.

635
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,310
Director Deng,

636
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,190
that won't convince her anymore.

637
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,030
No, I'm not lying.

638
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,830
Little Spud is right here in my arms.

639
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,960
Can't you hear him?

640
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,750
Alright, calm down.

641
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,870
We're heading over now.

642
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,750
Chang Rui,

643
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,822
take Mangjiang Road up ahead
to Mangjiang Bridge.

644
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,590
Director Deng said

645
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,320
they've found Little Spud.

646
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,800
Is that for real?

647
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,520
I'm not sure either.

648
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,480
But she...

649
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,630
That's what she said.

650
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,680
Alright.

651
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,600
Let's just go there.

652
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,550
Alright.

653
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,550
Let's go.

654
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,830
We'll talk when we get there.

655
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,390
Madam, you can talk to me.

656
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,390
There's nothing that
can't be worked out.

657
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,630
Please calm down.

658
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,440
We're all here

659
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,360
to help you.

660
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:34,960
Madam...

661
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,880
Don't come any closer.

662
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,440
Take it easy.

663
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:36,920
Mom!

664
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,310
Stop!

665
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,110
You're her son, right?

666
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,480
Yes!

667
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,200
Mom, calm down!

668
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,240
Mom!

669
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,160
Go slowly.

670
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,070
Mom!

671
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,990
Don't come any closer!

672
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,480
Come any closer and I'll jump!

673
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,590
Please come down first, Mom!

674
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,240
Mom, please come down.

675
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,222
- Calm down!
- You're scaring us.

676
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,110
We won't get divorced, I swear!

677
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,750
Mom, come down first.
Let's talk, alright?

678
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,350
I'm sorry...

679
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,270
Mom...

680
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,150
It's all my fault.

681
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:57,960
No.

682
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,720
I'm sorry...

683
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,680
Come down first.
Let's talk it through, okay?

684
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,110
If Little Spud loses his grandma,

685
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,750
what would we do?

686
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,110
Please come down first, okay?

687
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,350
Don't scare me like this!

688
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,240
We can't get the child back.

689
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,830
We can!

690
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,830
He's gone...

691
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,550
We'll get him back, Mom!

692
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,670
We'll get him back!

693
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,160
Mom, please come down!

694
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,390
He's gone...

695
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,190
I'm begging you, Mom.
Please come down...

696
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,510
I'm so sorry...

697
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,480
Mom, come down quickly!

698
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,400
Mrs. Lin!

699
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,800
Mrs. Lin, we found Little Spud!

700
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,070
Cai Xin.

701
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,240
Hurry, bring him to Mrs. Lin!

702
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,750
- Mom!
- Mom!

703
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,888
Mom, it's really Little Spud!

704
00:32:30,888 --> 00:32:31,400
Look, Mom!

705
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,350
It's really Little Spud!

706
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,710
Mom.

707
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,190
- Show him to Mom.
- Let me hold him.

708
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,310
I've got the baby.

709
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:37,790
Mom.

710
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,640
I've got him.

711
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,400
Look, Mom.

712
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,200
He's gone...

713
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,350
- Look, Mom, it's really Little Spud!
- Gone...

714
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,440
It really is Little Spud!

715
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,270
Mom,

716
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,190
look.

717
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:46,950
Look.

718
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,560
It really is Little Spud...

719
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,190
It's really your grandson.

720
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,800
It really is Little Spud.

721
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,510
Look.

722
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,000
Mom, look.

723
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Little Spud...

724
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,220
My precious grandson...

725
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,510
Look at him, Mom.

726

Liu Hongmei.

733
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,480
You're a mother too.

734
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,520
You've given birth.

735
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,320
You've even lost a child before.

736
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,133
You know what it feels like
to lose a child,

737
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,044
so why did you still buy
someone else's child?

738
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,360
That's my child.

739
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,310
What right do you have to take my child?

740
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,670
What right do you have to take my child?

741
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,590
Calm down.

742
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,110
Give me back my child.

743
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,510
Give him back.

744
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,000
Give him back!

745
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,040
I didn't know anything about it.

746

I never even met the person.

748

You bought a child from a stranger?

749
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,550
What could I say?

750
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,070
She's the one in charge
of the finances.

751
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,920
If she wanted to buy,

752
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,444
what could I do?

753
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,840
Officer,

754
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,110
the kid's really adorable.

755
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,590
I truly like him.

756
00:35:26,777 --> 00:35:28,488
Even though he's not my flesh and blood,

757
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:30,000
we've formed a bond.

758
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,790
Do you think you could maybe
talk to them,

759
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,088
see if they'd let us keep the child?

760
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,400
We can pay.

761
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:38,022
Do you think this is about money?

762
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,230
You committed a crime.

763
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,110
Illegal child trafficking.

764
00:35:42,177 --> 00:35:44,933
You even incited the villagers to
block police and obstruct justice.

765
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,150
You'd better come clean.

766
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,230
Give me back my child.

767
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,750
Give him back
and I'll tell you everything.

768
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,630
Give him back.

769
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,880
Give him back!

770
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,400
Liu Hongmei is completely
ignorant of the law.

771
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,933
She just screams when questioned.

772
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:04,150
Completely out of control.

773
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,644
We can't get anything out of her.

774
00:36:05,644 --> 00:36:07,560
Zheng Mingguang, on the other hand,
talks a lot.

775
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:09,360
He says all kinds of things,

776
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,960
but he knows nothing.

777
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,088
All the real decisions were made
by Liu Hongmei.

778
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,240
Just think about it,

779
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,040
a mother who had lost all hope in life

780
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,630
brought Little Spud,
a little baby, into her home.

781
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,590
She must have developed

782
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,150
some real affection for him.

783
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,190
So after we rescued Little Spud,

784
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,230
it's normal for her to feel
a sense of loss

785
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,520
and disorientation.

786
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,190
We need to give her some time

787
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,150
to get through this.

788
00:36:40,288 --> 00:36:42,149
The line between a good person
and a bad one

789
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,310
is razor thin.

790
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,040
One wrong step
and you're on the wrong path.

791
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,190
So what's a truly evil person?

792
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,150
Someone who does evil

793
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,190
and lures others into doing the same.

794
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,760
Vice Director Yin,

795
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,080
that was truly quote-worthy.

796
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,710
Jiajia, write it down quick.

797
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,440
Why don't you write it down?

798
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,710
I already memorized it.

799
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,840
You need to write it down.

800
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,110
You told the guard

801
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,750
you had something important to tell me?

802
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,150
Ready to talk now?

803
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,880
Is the child biologically yours?

804
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,000
We understand your concerns.

805
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,480
But we can only help you

806
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,840
if you speak up.

807
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,070
Mingguang.

808
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,680
Mingguang.

809
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,670
I just heard

810
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,720
you've lost your baby.

811
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,720
Try to move on.

812
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,000
The baby's gone.

813
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,150
No point being upset.

814
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,680
It's okay.

815
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,190
Let's just have another one.

816
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,880
She's sick. She can't have kids.

817
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,790
Won't your dad's inheritance

818
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,310
all go to your brother?

819
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,310
That's why I'm so stressed.

820
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,080
Alright, Hongmei.

821
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,550
Stop crying.

822
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,880
If there's no other way,
you can adopt one.

823
00:38:31,466 --> 00:38:32,840
It's just a few-month-old baby.

824
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,790
They're all the same.

825
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,080
Once you hold it in your arms,
it's yours.

826
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,750
Is there a way, Yougang?

827
00:38:40,844 --> 00:38:43,088
As long as you have the money,
you can get one.

828
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,320
How much?

829
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,400
Let me call and ask.

830
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,400
Hold on.

831
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,280
Hello, Meng.

832
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
Yeah, it's me.

833
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,590
I'm in urgent need of a baby right now.

834
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,270
About six months old.

835
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,560
Around six months is fine.

836
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:10,533
- I want a boy.
- Don't cry.

837
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,800
Okay.

838
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,030
Okay.

839
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,110
What did you say his name was?

840
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,270
Han Yougang.

841
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:38,955
What's your relationship with him?

842
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,710
We're not that close, actually.

843
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,320
Back in Linshan,

844
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,520
he worked with my husband, that's all.

845
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,488
Did you keep in touch
after buying the baby?

846
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,320
No.

847
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,520
His phone's always off.

848
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,560
Officer,

849
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,080
did you know he took 100,000 yuan
from me?

850
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,800
Do you have any idea

851
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,230
where Han Yougang might be hiding?

852
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,560
No idea.

853
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,040
If I knew, I'd have
gone after him myself.

854
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,240
Right now,

855
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,230
my father-in-law's inheritance
is going

856
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,230
to my brother-in-law.

857
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,840
Our child's gone,

858
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,000
and the money's gone.

859
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,070
So,

860
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,190
Officers,

861
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,880
I beg you, please help me find this man.

862
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,360
Help me get my 100,000 yuan back, okay?

863
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,070
That's all I ask.

864
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,400
I don't need the kid,

865
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,630
but I can't do without the money.

866
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,360
That's 100,000 yuan!

Including the one
in Nanyangdian Village,

869
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,270
Han Yougang has already
sold two children.

870
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:34,480
We can't let him get away.

871
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,630
Chief Xiao has signed the warrant.

872
00:40:36,688 --> 00:40:38,360
The moment he shows his face, he's done.

873
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,750
Based on what we know now,

874
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,750
we still need to get back
to our current case.

875
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,360
We need to find Zheng Weiwei

876
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,311
and the girl who fled to Pengcang Town.

877
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,520
That guy...

878
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,040
Where's he headed?

879
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:21,230
Kids, gather in the main hall.

880
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,800
Slow down.

881
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,960

00:41:34,022 --> 00:41:35,444
Go down and join the group.

00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Have you seen Fafa?

No, I haven't.

during nap time?

- No.
- No.
