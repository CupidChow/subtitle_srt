3
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,070
Calm down.

4
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,000
The police brought our child back.

5
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,680
Oh, my Jing!

6
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,590
Why were you there?

7
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,230
You disappeared so suddenly.

8
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,480
Don't run off again. Do you hear me?

9
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
Ma'am.

10
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,640
Ma'am.

11
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,190
I'm a police officer.

12
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,150
We brought your daughter back to you.

13
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,310
Look at her.

14
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
She is all grown up now.

15
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,310
Mom,

16
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,400
it's me, Jing.

17
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
I'm home.

18
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,200
Jing?

19
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,720
You...

20
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,510
Look at me.

21
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,870
It's me, Jing.

22
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,430
I'm home.

23
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,190
Please stop this.

24
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,310
I'll never leave you again.

25
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,430
Please be all right.

26
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,630
Please?

27
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
It's me, Mom. I'm Jing.

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,520
Mom...

29
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
Please be okay...

30
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,280
That poor family.

31
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,520
Their daughter is back,

32
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,866
but the mother has lost her mind.

33
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,120
Human traffickers have no conscience.

34
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,688
How could he bring himself to do it?

35
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,080
People like that

36
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,830
will do anything for money.

37
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,950
Nothing is beneath them.

38
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,240
A child is the heart of a family.

39
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:22,560
Once a child is taken,

40
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:24,044
the whole family falls apart.

41
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Some wounds

42
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
can only be healed by time.

43
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:32,244
But the good thing is,
the daughter is home now.

44
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,222
I'm sure her mother
will get better with time.

45
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,670
So,

46
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,270
as long as we never give up,

47
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:43,066
there will always be a day
the families reunite again, right?

48
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,030
Yes.

49
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:55,000
There will be a day
when families reunite.

50
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,310
That'll be 76.

51
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:14,400
Did you pack the duck eggs?

52
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,590
Yes.

53
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,440
Thank you.

54

(Wanted: Wang Guangqing)

55
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,950
We received a tip from a local

56
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,940
that a suspicious man
resembling Wang Guangqing

57
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,511
was seen in the outskirts
of Hongxi City, in an urban village.

58
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,950
I want the Anti-Abduction Office

59
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,070
and the Criminal Police Unit
to act together.

60
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,400
We can't let Wang Guangqing
get away again.

61
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,320
Understood.

62
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,630
Deng,

63
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,600
this operation is critical.

64
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,080
Leave Chang Rui out of it.

65
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,540
Let him rest.

66
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,510
That's Chief Xiao's instruction too.

(Linshan City Police Bureau)

68
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,430
Director Deng told you to take a break,
didn't she?

69
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,511
What are you doing here?

70
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:18,177
Where's the rest of the unit?

71
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,630
They're out on a mission.

72
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,750
I don't know the details.

73
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,260
I just know they contacted
the Hongxi City Criminal Police Unit.

74
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,600
If you really want to go,
give Director Deng a call.

75
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,977
They just left not long ago.

76
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,020
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

77
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,980
Captain Wang.

78
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,200
Hello.

79
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,000
This is the captain
of Hongxi City's Criminal Police Unit.

80
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:53,390
Hello.

81
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,120
This is our new Director Deng.

82
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,377
Nice to meet you.
Please tell us the situation.

83
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,800
We got the call
and came over immediately.

84
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,120
We're certain
that Wang Guangqing is hiding inside.

85
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,720
We just can't confirm which unit yet.

86
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,600
We've been waiting for you

87
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,022
to decide how to proceed.

88
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,750
If we can catch Cripple

89
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,160
through Skinner,

90
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,160
that would really help the case.

91
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,230
Yes.

92
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,310
We can't act yet.

93
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,511
He might still be in contact
with Cripple.

94
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,870
Keep watching.

95
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,710
Director Deng,

96
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:07,910
you haven't eaten all day.

97
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,040
Eat something.

98
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,390
The phone.

99
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,160
Yes, Captain Wang.

100
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,270
Director Deng, I have an update.

101
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,080
While checking surveillance,

102
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,510
Captain Wang found
that Skinner once used a public phone

103
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,720
to call a number.

104
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,120
He checked it out

105
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,600
and found the number
was disconnected a few days ago.

106
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:49,200
The person registered to that number

107
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,133
died two years ago.

108
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,110
Got it.

109
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,840
Director Deng,

110
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,840
if the number is disconnected,

111
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,200
does that mean Cripple
has already cut ties with Skinner?

112
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,990
No.

113
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,240
Mr. Yin said

114
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,870
Cripple is ruthless.

115
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,790
He kills every trafficker
who's seen him.

116
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,870
But Skinner has worked with him
on many cases

117
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,480
and is still alive.

118
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,870
Why would Cripple let him live?

119
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,390
I bet

120
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,150
they're still in contact.

121
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,280
Director Deng,

122
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,150
it's another call from Rui.

123
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:35,600
Are we really not going to tell him?

124
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,870
I can't keep this up.

125
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Not yet.

126
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,088
Director Deng, Skinner is on the move.

127
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,960
He's heading toward the riverbank.

128
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,840
Everyone, follow him.

129
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,800
Copy that.

130
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,080
Move out!

131
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,540
(July 29, 2009,
River Cargo Dock, Linshan City)

132
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,750
Skinner's likely trying
to escape by water.

133
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:19,040
All units, stay alert.

134
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,440
Copy that.

135
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,040
Attention, all units.

136
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,070
Suspicious boat spotted.

137
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,350
Director Deng,

138
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:04,822
we can't move freely on the water.

139
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:05,870
Should we make a move now?

140
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,710
Not yet.

141
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,480
We want him

142
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,510
to lead us to Cripple

143
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,622
and whoever he answers to.

144
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:12,266
Let's see who else is on that boat.

145
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,510
Wang Guangqing!

146
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,720
Chang Rui?

147
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,080
Move in!

148
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,650
Call the water police! Stop that boat!

149
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,560
Copy.

150
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,120
It's the police! Run!

151
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,960
Hurry!

152
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,120
Pull Chang Rui out!

153
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,800
Let go of me!

154
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,200
Rui!

155
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,480
Let go of me!

156
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,390
Let me go!

157
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,350
Rui!

158
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,870
Let go of me!

159
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,390
Rui!

160
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,630
Chang Rui! Chang Rui!

161
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,200
Chang Rui! Calm yourself!

162
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,440
Hurry!

163
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,910
Take him away.

164
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,080
Quickly!

165
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,400
Get him secured and take him away.

166
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,280
Regroup.

167
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,510
Chang Rui,
you were completely out of line!

168
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,480
You acted without orders

169
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,150
the moment you got emotional.

170
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,960
You ruined the whole plan!

171
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,244
Because of your impulsiveness,

172
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,670
we might have lost the lead on Cripple.

173
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,666
Can you take responsibility for that?

174
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,270
What were you thinking?

175
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,120
I wanted to beat him to death.

176
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,080
Chang Rui, watch your language!

177
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,910
Han, look at him.

178
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,960
Does this look like
the descendant of a fallen hero?

179
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,270
You're reckless.

180
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,350
I'm telling you right now,

181
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,000
you're done questioning suspects.

182
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,600
Do you hear me?

183
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,850
How am I supposed to stay calm?

184
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,390
My father saved that man's life.

185
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,920
Now he's turned into a criminal.

186
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,310
That means my dad died for nothing.

187
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:07,110
I want to kill him

188
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,110
to make up for it.

189
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,560
Fine.

190
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,350
Inspection Unit, tell your captain

191
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,600
to send two officers to my office.

192
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,450
Keep your mouth shut!

193
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,670
No need.

194
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,320
I'll go myself.

195
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,720
All right, you've got guts. Go ahead.

196
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,240
Chang Rui!

197
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,820
(Chief's Office)

198
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,910
Chang Rui?

199
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,750
Chief Xiao. Captain Han.

200
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,310
Chief Xiao, please calm down.

201
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:33,369
As his superior,

202
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,422
I should take responsibility
for what Chang Rui did.

203
00:17:35,444 --> 00:17:36,480
Forget about the brig.

204
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,720
Let him reflect for a few days...

205
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,310
Both of you, get out.

206
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,310
Now you want to play the good guys?

207
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,270
Where were you during the operation?

208
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,480
Where? Huh?

209
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,720
Why are you still here?

210
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,430
Chief Xiao,

211
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,350
please calm down.

212
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,830
I know you're saying this

213
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,070
out of anger.

214
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,200
Chang Rui is grieving his father.

215
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,270
Anyone would be upset.

216
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,750
I won't calm down!

217
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,350
Deng Yan, listen up.

218
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,720
I understand this situation

219
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,560
better than anyone.

220
00:18:14,044 --> 00:18:15,590
Chang Rui's father, Chang Yongjun,

221
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,160
was my comrade-in-arms.

222
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,920
The partner I trusted most.

223
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,390
Trusted.

224
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,400
Do you understand?

225
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,790
Now he's gone,

226
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,510
it's my responsibility
to discipline his son!

227
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,150
I understand.

228
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,220
(Brig)

229
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:46,310
Director Deng, Rui is being held
in disciplinary detention?

230
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,160
Can't we help him?

231
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,270
It's not fair to him.

232
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,680
We'll question Wang Guangqing first.

233
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,580
(For The People)

234
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,380
(Interrogation Room)

235
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,240
Wang Guangqing,

236
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,070
talk.

237
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,960
Talk about what?

238
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,880
I don't even know why I'm here.

239
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,680
You don't know?

240
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,070
Why do you think we brought you in?

241
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,920
Honestly,
I'm just as confused as you are.

242
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,400
Why was I arrested?

243
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,550
You cops always say

244
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,200
you can't let a bad guy go,

245
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,460
but you also can't pin something
on someone innocent.

246
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:21,960
So, how could you arrest

247
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,270
a good guy like me?

248
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,920
How old are you,

249
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,320
Miss?

250
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,800
Listen.

251
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,880
I'll play

252
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,160
the good guy today.

253
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,200
Here's a tip.

254
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,640
Bring in someone older
and more experienced

255
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,000
to question me.

256
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,400
All right?

257
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,510
Wang Guangqing.

258
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,310
Cut it out.

259
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,110
Okay, okay.

260
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:46,950
Sorry.

261
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,550
Come on.

262
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,390
Let's get started.

263
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,560
Let's begin.

264
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,310
Do you know Bai Wentao?

265
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,270
No.

266
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,350
What about Zhao Dafeng?

267
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:05,640
Don't know him either.

268
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,960
Mangshan Villa,
and the station by Mangjiang?

269
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,960
That place?

270
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,790
I don't really remember.

271
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,590
So you don't know anything.

272
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,480
But you do know Zheng Weiwei, right?

273
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,590
Looking at the photo,
I don't really recognize her,

274
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,920
but the name sounds familiar.

275
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,720
Zheng Weiwei...

276
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
I remember now.

277
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,170
Zheng Weiwei was in the class
next to mine back in elementary school.

278
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,310
She was cute,

279
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,160
just a little chubby.

280
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:49,590
It's been over a decade
since we last saw each other.

281
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,266
I have no idea what she looks like now.

282
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,960
What do they say again?

283
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,270
Time flies.

284
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,720
Youth doesn't come back.

285
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,110
Now,

286
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,270
I'm just old.

287
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,110
Wang Guangqing!

288
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,880
Enough with the nonsense.

289
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,070
We're talking

290
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,070
about the Zheng Weiwei you kidnapped.

291
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,760
Officer,

292
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,510
you scared me.

293
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,590
I thought you were going to hit me.

294
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,750
This is a law-abiding society.

295
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,200
We don't go around hitting people.

296
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,270
Sorry,

297
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,110
I was out of line.

298
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,920
I'll cooperate.

299
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,110
I will.

300
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,200
Let's start over.

301
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,350
Ready? Go.

302
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,380
(Wang Guangqing)

303
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,600
After every successful abduction,

304
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,066
Wang Guangqing picks a group of girls

305
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:39,400
and forces them into prostitution.

306
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,590
The rest are sold off

307
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,790
to remote mountain villages as brides.

308
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,680
Even if we can't get a lead on Cripple

309
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,110
through Wang Guangqing,

310
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:48,133
we might still uncover clues
about Huang Chuan.

311
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,880
But no matter how hard
we interrogate him,

312
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,790
he won't say a word.

313
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,790
He's completely unfazed.

314
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,510
Should we try Director Deng's tactic

315
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,440
and show him

316
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,488
the miserable lives of the girls
he trafficked?

317
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:04,750
Wang Guangqing is a shameless,
contemptible lowlife.

318
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,480
If anything could break him,

319
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,133
he wouldn't still be committing crimes.

320
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,110
Well, we can't just sit idly.

321
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,400
Mr. Yin,
should we let Chang Rui have a shot?

322
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,280
All right.

323
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,920
Chief Xiao, Skinner isn't talking.

324
00:23:26,044 --> 00:23:27,110
He's a repeat offender.

325
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,000
The usual interrogation tactics
won't work on him.

326
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,450
I'm thinking an emotional approach
might be worth a try.

327
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,270
But if we go that route,

328
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,920
we might need to bring Chang Rui in.

329
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,510
Can we get him released early?

330
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,400
That's your solution?

331
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,000
You want to release Chang Rui early?

332
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,480
Let me be clear.

333
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,000
Three days means three full days.

334
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,590
Not a minute less.

335
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,790
Chief Xiao...

336
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,750
He broke the rules

337
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,550
and must face the consequences.

338
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
As a police officer

339
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,400
and the child of a hero,

340
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,960
he should hold himself

341
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,088
to an even higher standard.

342
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:02,490
I don't buy that you don't have
any other investigative options.

343
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,000
Deng Yan,

344
00:24:07,222 --> 00:24:09,720
do you know why I transferred you
to the Anti-abduction Office?

345
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,920
Think about it.

346
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,070
(Han, look at him.)

347
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,266
(Does this look like
the descendant of a fallen hero?)

348
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,480
(October 19)

349
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,640
(is a heartbreaking day.)

350
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,110
(To save a drowning boy
named Wang Guangqing,)

351
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,088
(Chief Chang Yongjun
of Nanyangdian Police Station)

352
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:01,510
(tragically drowned.)

353
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,830
(He died at the age of 43.)

354
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,060
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

355
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,950
(Deng Yan,)

356
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:14,088
(do you know why I transferred you
to the Anti-abduction Office?)

357
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,310
(Think about it.)

358
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,110
Mrs. Zheng.

359
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,480
All right.

360
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,510
I'll be right there.

361
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,190
Please come in.

362
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,790
Director Deng, I'm so glad you're here.

363
00:25:45,955 --> 00:25:47,680
After Weiwei was discharged
from the hospital,

364
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,955
she locked herself in her room
and wouldn't come out.

365
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,550
I'm worried

366
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,920
she might do something reckless.

367
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,088
I understand. Where is she?

368
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,190
She's in this room.

369
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,200
Please check on her.

370
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,040
Weiwei,

371
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:16,239
your mom called me.

372
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,160
She said you haven't
been sleeping well recently

373
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,844
and asked me
to spend some time with you.

374
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,680
The weather's nice today.

375
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,680
Looking out at the kids playing outside

376
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,160
reminded me of a girl

377
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,070
I met recently.

378
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,880
Let me tell you her story.

379
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,000
She's incredibly

380
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,070
kind,

381
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,070
brave,

382
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,590
smart,

383
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,070
and talented.

384
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,160
She plays the guzheng.

385
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,310
At just 13,

386
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,960
she became the last disciple
of the most famous

387
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,600
traditional music master
in Linshan City.

388
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,680
She's also

389
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,510
a gifted writer.

390
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,110
Her work has even
been published in magazines.

391
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,720
I brought a copy of one of her pieces.

392
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,000
I'll share it with you.

393
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:42,000
"A sailboat drifts across the ocean,

394
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,720
like a kite floating in the sky.

395
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,510
Without wind,

396
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,720
the boat cannot move forward,

397
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,310
and the kite cannot soar.

398
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,790
But sometimes, often even,

399
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,680
the wind doesn't blow in your favor.

400
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,750
The boat must face calm seas
or strong currents.

401
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,310
The kite must fight
against howling winds.

402
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,550
Maybe

403
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,590
that's just like life itself..."

404
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,790
Stop.

405
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,760
Just stop.

406
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:29,590
That piece won a gold award

407
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,510
just a few days ago.

408
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,390
See?

409
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,960
When I read it, I wondered,

410
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,400
if I were that girl,

411
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,160
facing a tsunami ready

412
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,960
to swallow everything,

413
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,550
could I be

414
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,160
as brave?

415
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,920
Could I stay calm, think fast,

416
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,720
and ultimately pilot the plane

417
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,750
that leads everyone to safety?

418
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,160
In the story, all the villains'

419
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,550
evil deeds were uncovered,

420
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,070
and every person who hurt you

421
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,720
was held accountable.

422
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,160
They sold me to a nightclub.

423
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,920
Someone called Mr. Li
would come by all the time.

424
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,070
If I didn't behave,

425
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,790
they'd yell at me and even hit me.

426
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,310
One time, I scratched Mr. Li's hand,

427
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,720
and they pulled out my nails.

428
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,880
I've been busy lately.

429
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,270
I must've forgotten to trim your nails.

430
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,070
Skinner, get in here!

431
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,150
What is it, Mr. Li?

432
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,480
This girl's nails
are getting a little long.

433
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,720
Take care of it.

434
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,310
Sorry, Mr. Li.

435
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,422
We'll handle it right away.

436
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,688
Come here!

437
00:30:25,711 --> 00:30:26,270
No!

438
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,110
Hold still!

439
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,480
Oh, you're really going to do it.

440
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,400
I see him in my dreams

441
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,070
every night.

442
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,480
I'm so scared.

443
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,920
You don't have to be scared anymore.

444
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,880
You have us now.

445
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,000
You have your mom and dad.

446
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,250
We'll protect you.

447
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,320
And back then,

448
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,070
you weren't afraid.

449
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,880
You chose to be brave.

450
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,920
Do you remember Pingjiao?

451
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,960
She survived too.

452
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,160
She even helped us
catch those criminals.

453
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,480
How is she?

454
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,760
Don't worry about her.

455
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,930
She's back with her parents now,
just like you.

456
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,750
To me,

457
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,044
you're both just like
the girl from the story.

458
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:46,920
Brave enough to stand firm
in the face of a tsunami.

459
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,550
Please sit down.

460
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,070
She's already asleep.

461
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,070
She refuses to go back to school.

462
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,920
Her father and I are very worried.

463
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,310
But with both of our family situations
being what they are,

464
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,600
you know how tough it's been.

465
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,510
We didn't want to upset Weiwei,

466
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,880
so we rented a place close
to the school.

467
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,550
Still, ever since she left the hospital,

468
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,480
she's been locked up in her room,

469
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,590
and nothing I say seems to reach her.

470
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,590
In the end, I thought of you.

471
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,310
This is all my fault.

472
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,920
If I hadn't gotten divorced,

473
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,680
maybe none of this would have happened.

474
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,510
Mrs. Zheng,

475
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:55,933
please don't blame yourself so much.

476
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,590
Right now,

477
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,720
try not to bring up family

478
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,000
or school issues around Weiwei.

479
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,720
After all she's been through,

480
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,680
what she really needs is your care

481
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,110
and quiet support.

482
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,790
Weiwei is sensitive

483
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,400
and proud.

484
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,070
She probably isn't ready to face family

485
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,480
or school just yet.

486
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,480
Please talk to her father too.

487
00:33:28,622 --> 00:33:29,510
You two need

488
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,070
to be there for her, to understand

489
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,070
and support her.

490
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,070
We can't rush things.

491
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,270
We have to take it slow.

492
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,750
Healing

493
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,400
takes time.

494
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,790
All right,

495
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,630
Director Deng.

496
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,920
I'll take good care of her.

497
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,390
Director Deng,

498
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,920
you have to catch those scumbags.

499
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,350
I want every last one of them taken down.

500
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,270
Rest assured. We'll find them,

501
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,200
arrest them,

502
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,480
and bring them to justice.

503
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Thank you.

504
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,300
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

505
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,533
(I went to visit Zheng Weiwei.)

506
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:14,760
She mentioned two key figures.

507
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,550
Mr. Li and the man with sunglasses.

508
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,190
Since Skinner isn't talking,

509
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,760
we'll start with those two.

510
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:21,511
Jiajia, pull up the surveillance footage

511
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:22,888
from the Play House raid.

512
00:34:23,022 --> 00:34:23,710
That should be

513
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,666
the first time Zheng Weiwei saw Mr. Li.

514
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,460
(Play House Security Corridor)

515
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,760
Do you recognize this girl?

516
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,550
Do you?

517
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,160
No.

518
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,870
No?

519
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,510
She recognizes you,

520
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,110
and you were the one
who handed her over to Mr. Li.

521
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,550
Who's Mr. Li?

522
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,200
I don't know him.

523
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,430
All right, then.

524
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,110
We'll come back another time.

525
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,960
By the way,

526
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,590
we got a call a few days ago.

527
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,760
Your mom had a bad fall.

528
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,360
She's in the hospital now.

529
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,110
That can't be true.
My mom's perfectly healthy.

530
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:39,950
Chen A'mo,

531
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,800
do you think we'd joke

532
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,920
about something like that?

533
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:45,460
She fell and had to be admitted.

534
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,920
The doctor said it's serious.

535
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,200
What happened?

536
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,030
When did this happen?

537
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,030
Right when you got arrested.

538
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,920
She panicked and fell.

539
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,710
Is she okay now?

540
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,400
What...

541
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
What did the doctor say?

542
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,710
Does she have money for treatment?

543
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:14,844
I see you do have some conscience left.

544
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,760
You told your mom

545
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,360
you wanted
to start a small business in Linshan

546
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,030
and take care of her.

547
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,800
You planning
to take care of her from prison?

548
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,550
I just wanted
to give her a better life. I...

549
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,110
Is someone looking after her?

550
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,933
We've already arranged
for someone to help her out.

551
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:45,960
Chen A'mo,

552
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,510
you know your options.

553
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:50,920
Think hard about what you want to do.

554
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,960
Based on Zheng Weiwei's testimony

555
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,150
and what the two girls we rescued

556
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,710
during the Play House raid said,

557
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,070
I've identified 17 adult men

558
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,880
who were at the club during that time.

559
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,800
Print out all their photos for me.

560
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,640
Yes.

561
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,350
That's him.

562
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,590
That's Mr. Li.

563
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,800
Are you sure?

564
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,710
Skinner and I have seen him a few times.

565
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,870
I know it's him.

566
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,640
Honey.

567
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,320
Food's ready.

568
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,800
Honey!

569
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,320
Come here!

570
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,760
Let's eat.

571
00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:20,060
You were in the kitchen for so long,
and this is all you made?

572
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,480
I just wanted to make the meal perfect.

573
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,240
What's this?

574
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,190
I completely forgot...

575
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:35,360
I... Honey...

576
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,070
Honey.

577
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,070
Honey, I really...

578
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
I really forgot.

579
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,760
I'm sorry.

580
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,360
What do you ever remember?

581
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,150
How many times have I told you

582
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,280
that I hate that smell?

583
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
I know.

584
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
Things at the company
have been so hectic lately.

585
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,110
I promise I'll remember next time.

586
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,070
The company?

587
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,590
And who gave you the company, huh?

588
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:06,066
Without my family,
would you even have that company?

589
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,760
Yes, well...

590
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,960
Forget about the soup.

591
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,710
I made fish

592
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,670
and shrimp too.

593
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,280
Let's have some fish.

594
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,400
Eat it yourself. I've lost my appetite.

595
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,200
Where are you going?

596
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,070
Whatever.

597
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,960
The nerve of that woman...

598
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,150
Who is it?

599
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,990
Who are you?

600
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,511
(Yan Lei, Police)
We're from Linshan City Police Bureau.

601
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:46,466
You must be Lu Sheng.

602
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:49,022
We'll need you to come with us.

603
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:49,540
(Summons)

604
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,420
(Interrogation Room)

605
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,000
Why did you bring me here?

606
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,320
You even had a mandatory police summons.

607
00:40:03,622 --> 00:40:04,880
What's the meaning of this?

608
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,320
What did I even do?

609
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,920
Do you know this girl?

610
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,800
No.

611
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,920
What's she got to do with me?

612
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,320
You must know this guy at least.

613
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,190
Officer,

614
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,600
I see so many people every day.

615
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,350
How could I possibly remember
all of them?

616
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:26,840
Take a good look at him.

617
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,200
No idea who he is.

618
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,070
Zheng Weiwei not being able to come
is definitely a problem.

619
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,070
Yes, for now,
we'll have to rely on Chen A'mo's ID

620
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,320
to figure out our next move.

621
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,510
Look at the lineup.
Do you recognize anyone?

622
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,510
Him.

623
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,350
I know him.

624
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
That's Mr. Li.

625
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,480
Rape? I raped her?

626
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:18,880
I don't even know her.

627
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,390
Why would I rape someone I don't know?

628
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,000
You'll probably say

629
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,550
you don't know this guy too, right?

630
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,510
Of course...

631
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,000
Do you know him or not?

632
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,070
I don't know him.

633
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,590
But he knows you.

634
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,190
He saw all the filthy deeds

635
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,070
you committed.

636
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,960
Chen A'mo has already identified you

637
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,110
as the one who raped the victim.

638
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:56,150
How do you explain that?

639
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,280
Explain what?

640
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,150
This is a setup! A false accusation!

641
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,230
I didn't do anything.

642
00:42:00,422 --> 00:42:02,510
I'm telling you, I've never
even seen those people.

643
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,760
They're just trying
to scam me for money!

644
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,022
They're extorting me!
Officer, you've got to believe me!

645
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,360
They're lying.

646
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:08,880
Believe me!

647
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,480
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

648
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,760
Where's my lawyer?

649
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,710
Call my lawyer.

650
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,920
I'm not saying another word
until my lawyer's here.

651
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,280
I think you're on their side.

652
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,400
You're the police,

653
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,240
you know that?

654
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,400
That scumbag's a real piece of work.

655
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,550
What's going on?

656
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,880
Lu Sheng denies

657
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,960
everything.

658
00:42:28,511 --> 00:42:30,244
He keeps insisting he's innocent.

659
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,920
Director Deng,
Lu Sheng's wife just arrived.

660
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,760
She wants to see you.

661
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,590
Arresting someone without evidence

662
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,280
is a legal risk.

663
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,280
Surely the police understand that?

664
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,150
Ms. Cai,

665
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,760
we don't arrest people without cause.

666
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,440
We'd like to know what crime

667
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,840
Mr. Lu is suspected of.

668
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,800
Can you at least tell us

669
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,110
what evidence you have?

670
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,960
The case is still under investigation.

671
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,800
We can't share
too many details right now.
