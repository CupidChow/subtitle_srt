00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Is there a girl in the family who wants to find a boyfriend?

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No, it's not a girl. It's a boy.

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes, I remembered it wrong. He's a boy.

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Does he have a boyfriend?

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You're looking for a boyfriend for Mo?

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That boy is nice.

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He has only one child.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He's kind and kind.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He's kind and kind.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Their economic conditions are the best.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Really?

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He must have a girlfriend.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
She's kind and kind.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Is she your wife?

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes, she is.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There is a girl in the family.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But she is a mute.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
She is a distant relative.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
She is very poor.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
A few days ago, someone came to trouble her.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Actually, her husband is a nice person.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He's adopted her.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can come to the west of this street.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
They live in the west.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Her house is in the west?

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How much?

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
36 dollars.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't worry, 40 dollars.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Thank you.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're welcome.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
See you next time.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So, everything is done?

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Thank you.

43
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:45,960
Money money will always be

44
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,600
lighter.

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,800
Just kidding, they're not here.

46
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,200
And I had another lenses shot.

47
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,840
No one has named except my sister,

48
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,600
I was in the reconstruction,

49
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,160
you see?

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,560
Suddenly I seem the neighbor of the neighbor.

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,880
Knowing this's true,

52
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,400
I've inherited qualities from our family.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,040
Really.

54
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Too good…

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:24,080
Really!

56
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,960
Be careful,道具!

57
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,240
We will find the right location.

58
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,960
Twenty thousand?

59
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,880
Too much!

60
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,240
Mom!

61
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,800
We only have 20,000 Qing chinese shares.

62
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,040
We don't have much money.

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
I'll look for it.

64
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,560
Will we see the child immediately after we pay?

65
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,320
Are they liars?

66
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,280
What did you say?

67
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,800
Mom, I'm not a liar.

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,280
I'm not a liar.

69
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,480
We have photos.

70
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,720
Hurry up, send them to me.

71
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,240
I'll ask Lin Hao to send them to you.

72
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,520
We saw the photos.

73
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,040
And we asked in the town.

74
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,640
Someone saw Xiao Yangyu.

75
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,240
Mom, it can't be. It's fake.

76
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
I'll go to the hospital.

77
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,760
I'm going to see my relatives.

78
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,560
Mom.

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
Mom, you can't go to see your relatives.

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,800
They told us to inform you

81
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,080
that they are in danger.

82
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,400
You can't tell your relatives.

83
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,400
Mom, you're too much.

84
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
If you say too much, it may be bad for Xiao Yangyu.

85
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,880
Don't tell anyone.

86
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,680
Yes, mom.

87
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,880
If the police know,

88
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,680
you'll never see Xiao Yangyu again.

89
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,600
I know. I know.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,360
Don't worry.

91
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,640
Don't worry.

92
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,160
I won't tell anyone.

93
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,400
I'll figure it out myself.

94
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
You have to listen to us.

95
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,560
I'll listen to you.

96
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,680
Okay, I'll hang up.

97
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,320
Honey.

98
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,720
Wait.

99
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,200
Hello.

100
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,880
We're from the police station in Lingshan.

101
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,240
Police officer.

102
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,680
What's up?

103
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,000
I heard that a girl from your family came here.

104
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
Yes, yes.

105
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,320
A relative came here for a few days.

106
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
She's gone.

107
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
A distant relative?

108
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,160
Yes.

109
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,880
She's gone?

110
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,440
Yes.

111
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,240
She's from my wife's family.

112
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,960
She said she was poor.

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
She's been living here for a few days.

114
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,040
She's gone.

115
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,200
She's a distant relative?

116
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,800
Yes.

117
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,520
She's gone?

118
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,200
Yes.

119
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,000
She's from my wife's family.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,440
She's a poor girl.

121
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,240
She wants to find a job.

122
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,600
But she's a mute.

123
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,720
How can she find a job?

124
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,960
So she couldn't find one.

125
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,600
So my wife sent her back.

126
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,360
I'll go and check.

127
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,680
Go ahead.

128
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,440
What's her name?

129
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,680
She's a distant relative from my wife's family.

130
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,080
And she's not that close to me.

131
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,120
I don't know.

132
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,880
Who's this?

133
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,800
This is my son.

134
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,480
Mo Li.

135
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,560
Why are you so rude to say hello?

136
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,360
Go back to your room.

137
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,680
Stop playing.

138
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,320
Please don't get used to it.

139
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,160
I'm used to it.

140
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,520
There must be something wrong with them.

141
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,120
We need to find that mute girl.

142
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,880
She's the key to our problem.

143
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,440
I'll ask her next time.

144
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,800
Go and clean up the mess.

145
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

146
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,680
I'll ask someone to keep an eye on it.

147
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,960
Hello, Yan Blockchain.

148
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Ole.

149
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,880
Ole.

150
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
relations

151
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,320
If you want to sell magicaries,

152
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
they understand.

153
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,260
When I was in college,

154
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,380
I had

155
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
a teacher who asked me

156
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,960
But you said I've changed since I was a kid.

157
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
What about Xiaoyu?

158
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,960
I wanted to draw her, but I realized that she's just a little bit blurry.

159
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Xiaoxin, I often look after Xiaoguang.

160
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,960
She's probably a middle school student.

161
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
She's grown up.

162
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,960
She had big eyes when she was a kid.

163
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Guess what? Her nose is like mine, but her mother is like mine.

164
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Then my son must be like my mother.

165
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,960
I've been listening to you two for a long time.

166
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:31,960
I've been thinking, when she grows up, what will she be like?

167
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,960
She should be like my father.

168
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
But she's fatter than my father.

169
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,960
She was very greedy when she was a kid.

170
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
Her face was red.

171
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Her nose has a black mole.

172
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,960
I wonder if she's still here after she grows up.

173
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
She should be.

174
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,960
I've only had this photo for so many years.

175
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Nothing else.

176
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,960
I've been thinking, if one day Xiaoyu really stands in front of me,

177
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,960
will I be able to recognize her?

178
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Yes, you will.

179
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
I'm sure you will.

180
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Didn't Xiaosu say that there's a professor who said that

181
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,960
a person's heart is a reflection of the other person's.

182
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
I believe that.

183
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
I believe that too.

184
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Okay.

185
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Auntie, your house is a little older,

186
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
but it's going to be a new school.

187
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,960
I heard that there's a school for the famous.

188
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,960
You have to think it over before selling it.

189
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Nobody lives in the house that has just been divided.

190
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,960
If you need money, sell it.

191
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Let me tell you again.

192
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
This is a new school.

193
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
It's very popular.

194
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
If it's popular, then sell it.

195
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
The faster, the better.

196
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
How fast do you want it?

197
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
I want it all.

198
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
I want cash.

199
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Then the price is...

200
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,960
It's a little bit less.

201
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Can you sell it?

202
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Some people have left their intentions.

203
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Wait, I'll call and ask.

204
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
The price is as you said.

205
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
How much do you want?

206
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Wait, I'll ask right now.

207
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
I have a client who can pay right away.

208
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,960
But the price may be reduced to 20,000.

209
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Okay, okay.

210
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
It's good to sell it.

211
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
I'll ask.

212
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
I'll ask.

213
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
I'll ask.

214
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Apply at the earliest.

215
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
If you give me two days, you'll get it.

216
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Aren't you sharp?

217
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Of course.

218
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
But I don't trust your lock.

219
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,960
You are right in front of vast public eyes.

220
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Be done with it.

221
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I'll dare to get it after.

222
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I'll see to it.

223
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
I hate family only...

224
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
what if I see a dog outside my house?

225
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
What if my 2nd puppy is in danger?

226
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Then I won't stand in the way.

227
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Wish this could have happened in the past.

228
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,960
I think we haven't seen the child yet.

229
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,960
We should give them half of the money during the insurance period.

230
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
What do you think?

231
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Yes, yes, it's safe.

232
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Okay.

233
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Wait a moment.

234
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Give him the money.

235
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Okay.

236
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Happy and Xiao Hao found the little lamb girl.

237
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,960
It's not easy to see the child after giving him 200,000.

238
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Aunt Lin, this is a scam.

239
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Don't believe it.

240
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
We didn't find the little lamb girl.

241
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,960
I was thinking the same thing.

242
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
I was thinking the same thing.

243
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
I was thinking the same thing.

244
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
That's why I called you.

245
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
But I've already returned the money to Lin Hao.

246
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
What should I do?

247
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Thank you.

248
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Okay.

249
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Come back.

250
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Come back.

251
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
What did you say?

252
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
I've already told you.

253
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
I've already asked the location.

254
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Mr. Zhang, you drive.

255
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
I'll take you there.

256
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Okay, okay, let's go.

257
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Aunt Lin, don't worry.

258
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
I'll call Lin Hao.

259
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Call him.

260
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
Send me Lin Hao's address first, okay?

261
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Okay.

262
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Cheng Rui.

263
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Here.

264
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
The child is also in the third house.

265
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,960
Cheng Rui, let's go to the hospital.

266
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Cheng Rui, let's go to the hospital.

267
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Cheng Rui, let's go.

268
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
What are you doing?

269
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm taking the child home.

270
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
What?

271
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
You go inside.

272
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,960
Can you take the child away from us at home?

273
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
Listen to me.

274
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
If you take the child away,

275
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,960
you can find a chance to take the child home.

276
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Okay.

277
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Mr. Lin, I'm not very comfortable here.

278
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
I'll go first.

279
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
Thank you.

280
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Remember to find a chance.

281
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Aunt Xia.

282
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Aunt Xia.

283
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Aunt Xia.

284
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
No, no, no.

285
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Just us two.

286
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,960
Do you want to ask Mr. Deng?

287
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
What do you mean?

288
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
It's too late.

289
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
I'll go get milk for you.

290
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
Wait a minute, baby.

291
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
He's gone.

292
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
You drive the car.

293
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
I'll bring the child here now.

294
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Go.

295
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
It's the doctor.

296
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Honey.

297
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Go, go, go.

298
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Let go of the child.

299
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Let go of the child.

300
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Mom is taking you home.

301
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Go home.

302
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Let go of the child.

303
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Let go of the child.

304
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Let go of the child.

305
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Mom.

306
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Let go of the child.

307
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
I'll go to the hospital.

308
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
I'll go to the hospital.

309
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
I see you.

310
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,960
No, I can't.

311
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
I'll put the car down.

312
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
The car is not parked.

313
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Or I'll crash into the window.

314
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
What are you doing?

315
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
You idiot.

316
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Let go of the child.

317
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
The car is not parked.

318
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
It's my child.

319
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
If you don't listen to me, I'll crash into you.

320
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
I'll go to the hospital.

321
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
I'll crash into you.

322
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
What are you doing?

323
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
You're a coward.

324
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
I'll let you run away.

325
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
What are you doing?

326
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Let go of the child.

327
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Don't be afraid.

328
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
I'll go to the hospital.

329
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Open the door.

330
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Don't be afraid, honey.

331
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
I'm coming.

332
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Let go of the child.

333
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Let go of the child.

334
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
What are you doing?

335
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
Don't be afraid, honey.

336
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
I'll go to the hospital.

337
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Let me go.

338
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
I'm coming.

339
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Let go of the child.

340
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Open the door.

341
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Open the door.

342
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
I got you.

343
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Open the door.

344
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Open the door.

345
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Open it, honey.

346
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Don't run.

347
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Open the door, honey.

348
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Open.

349
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,960
Let go of the child.

350
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
Open the door.

351
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
Open the door.

352
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
Open the door.

353
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Don't run.

354
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Open the door.

355
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Open the door.

356
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Go!

357
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Go! Go!

358
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,840
Hello?

359
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,920
Director Deng is in trouble.

360
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,320
Lin Ao and Cai Xin took a child.

361
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,840
They just passed the North Station.

362
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
What?

363
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Okay, I got it.

364
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,800
Okay, I'll be there soon.

365
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,360
Director, go to the North Station.

366
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Don't move!

367
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,240
Don't come over!

368
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,920
Stop!

369
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Don't come over!

370
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,320
Don't come over!

371
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Don't come over!

372
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,800
If you come over, I'll jump off!

373
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,280
Don't push yourself!

374
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,360
Don't try to take my child away!

375
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,840
Listen to me!

376
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,320
Put my child down first!

377
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,120
I'm not your child!

378
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,880
You're my child!

379
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,680
I'm not your child!

380
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,240
Don't move!

381
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,080
Don't push yourself!

382
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Don't push yourself!

383
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
Don't push yourself!

384
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
If you die, I'll jump off!

385
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,080
Director, is Cai Xin really crazy?

386
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
She's not crazy.

387
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,720
She's going to be like this.

388
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Don't push yourself!

389
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,520
What are you doing?

390
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
Don't push yourself!

391
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
Don't push yourself!

392
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
What's going on?

393
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
He's taking my child away!

394
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
No, honey!

395
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,520
This is it!

396
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
This is it!

397
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
They...

398
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
This is the child they kidnapped!

399
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
This is my child!

400
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
You can't kill him!

401
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
This is not my child!

402
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Do you know if this is your child?

403
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
No!

404
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Look!

405
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Look!

406
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Did they take him?

407
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
They took your child!

408
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Hold him!

409
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
Hold him!

410
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
What are you going to do?

411
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
What are you going to do?

412
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
Hold him!

413
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Don't move!

414
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
Don't move!

415
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
Don't move!

416
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
What are you going to do?

417
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,880
Calm down, get up!

418
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,760
This is the emergency department!

419
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,120
They are up there. Come with me.

420
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
Let's go.

421
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,120
Huo, Huo, be careful.

422
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
Be careful.

423
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
What's going on?

424
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
This lady is very excited.

425
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Master, master, please don't be excited.

426
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Can you tell her?

427
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Xiaoxiao, leave it to me.

428
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Is this the kid's parents?

429
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,120
They are not parents.

430
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,120
Xiaoxiao, it's me.

431
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Deng Yan, do you remember me?

432
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Director, director, you are here.

433
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
Hurry, arrest them.

434
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
They are all criminals, they are all liars.

435
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
You are not allowed to arrest my child.

436
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
You are not allowed to arrest my child.

437
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
They are all criminals.

438
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
They have just admitted it.

439
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
Take her away.

440
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Give it back.

441
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Jiang Xin, they have already left.

442
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Now no one is going to talk to you.

443
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,120
You believe me, okay?

444
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,120
Jiang Xin, I'm sorry.

445
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
We didn't find Xiaoyang Yu in time.

446
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
You found Xiaoyang Yu yourself.

447
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
We are the same.

448
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
We did something wrong.

449
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,120
Did you hear Xiaoyang Yu calling you?

450
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Yes.

451
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
There is a mole behind her.

452
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Mole?

453
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
I saw it.

454
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
The same position.

455
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Okay, don't go forward.

456
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,120
If you go forward, Xiaoyang Yu will be in danger.

457
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Think about it.

458
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,120
Xiaoyang Yu didn't see her mother for so long.

459
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
She is very sad.

460
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
If you hold the child and go one step forward,

461
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
the consequences will be unimaginable.

462
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Think about the child.

463
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
How scared she is.

464
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
She is scared.

465
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,120
Dad, I can't hold her.

466
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
She is scared.

467
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
She is scared.

468
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
Why is she not crying?

469
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
Why is she crying?

470
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
Is she hungry?

471
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Let me see.

472
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,120
She hasn't cried for a long time.

473
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
Let me see.

474
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Xiaoxin, come here.

475
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
She is Xiaoyang Yu.

476
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
No one can take her away.

477
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Xiaoxin.

478
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Then you just look at me.

479
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
I just look at you.

480
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
I'll look at you and return you, okay?

481
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Let me see.

482
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Xiaoyang Yu.

483
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Look, she is scared.

484
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
What's wrong, Xiaoyang Yu?

485
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
She is Xiaoyang Yu.

486
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
She was taken away by them.

487
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
She is crying.

488
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
She is looking at her mother.

489
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
She is crying.

490
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
She is crying.

491
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
She is crying.

492
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
She is crying.

493
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
She is crying.

494
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
What's wrong?

495
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
Take her to the DNA test.

496
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
It's okay.

497
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
It's okay.

498
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
It's okay.

499
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
It's okay.

500
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
It's okay.

501
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
It's okay.

502
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
It's okay.

503
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
She is safe.

504
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
She is safe.

505
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
Comrade police officer.

506
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
We have seen the photo.

507
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
It's really our child.

508
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
It's really.

509
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
We have also done a DNA test for the child.

510
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
She is not Xiaoyang Yu.

511
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
It's impossible.

512
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
You must have done it wrong.

513
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
You were cheated.

514
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,120
These people used the search and stay channels you posted.

515
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
They know the specific situation of Xiaoyang Yu.

516
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
And they found a child who looks like her.

517
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
The purpose is to cheat you.

518
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
During this time,

519
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
the people who provide you with clues,

520
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
the people who lead you,

521
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,120
even some of your passers-by,

522
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
they are all liars.

523
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
They were cheated.

524
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Liars.

525
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
But don't worry.

526
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
The two Wang brothers who cheated you,

527
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
they have caught them.

528
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,120
But they have transferred the money to Zhao Zhilong.

529
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
Zhao Zhilong has not been found yet.

530
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
How much money did you give them?

531
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
200,000.

532
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Don't worry about the money.

533
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,120
The colleagues of Qin Zhen will find out the situation.

534
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
We don't have money.

535
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
Xin Xin.

536
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Don't say that.

537
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
I don't want to.

538
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
We don't have money.

539
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Xin Xin.

540
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
No matter how much money we spend,

541
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
we have to find the child.

542
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
We have to find the child.

543
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Director, you go first.

544
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Dr. Mei is here.

545
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
Mom.

546
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
What's going on?

547
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
Why did you bring us here?

548
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Didn't you say you found the child?

549
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Where is Xiaoyang Yu?

550
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
Where is Xiaoyang Yu?

551
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
It's all my fault.

552
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Xiaoyang Yu.

553
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
It's all my fault.

554
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Xin Xin.

555
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
Say something.

556
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
Where is the child?

557
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Where is the child?

558
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
It's all my fault.

559
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
Yan Yan.

560
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
What's going on?

561
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Didn't I ask you to find them?

562
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Why didn't you bring the child back?

563
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Where is the child?

564
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
Mom.

565
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Mom.

566
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
We were cheated.

567
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,120
The child is not Xiaoyang Yu.

568
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
Mom.

569
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
Mom.

570
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
It's all my fault.

571
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
It's all my fault.

572
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
I was too anxious.

573
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
It's all my fault.

574
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
I was too anxious.

575
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
I was too anxious.

576
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,120
I thought Xiaoyang Yu was found.

577
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
The child could really come back.

578
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
Our family could reunite.

579
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
How could this happen?

580
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,120
How could this happen?

581
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
How could this happen?

582
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
It's all my fault.

583
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
It's all my fault.

584
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Mom.

585
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Mom.

586
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,120
After you came back to my family, I'm sorry.

587
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
I'm sorry, Xiaoyang Yu.

588
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
I'm the sinner of this family.

589
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Mom.

590
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
I'm sorry.

591
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
I'm sorry.

592
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
I'm sorry.

593
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,120
Xiaoyang Yu's clue is broken again.

594
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,120
I was not used to it even though I came to Dalaben for so long.

595
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,120
That family is broken and broken.

596
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
They are sad and sad.

597
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
I always wanted to help them.

598
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,120
But now all the clues are scattered.

599
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,120
If only we could make a comprehensive database,

600
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
we could greatly improve our efficiency.

601
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
What is it?

602
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
I'll tell you.

603
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
We need to build a space in the server

604
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,120
to record all the information and data of Dalaben.

605
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
As long as we enter the keywords,

606
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,120
we can quickly find the clues and information we need.

607
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Is it complicated?

608
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
It takes some time.

609
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
Can you do it?

610
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Of course.

611
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
I'll show you.

612
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Okay.

613
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Director Deng.

614
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Yes.

615
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
We've checked it.

616
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
The child is not from the third generation.

617
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
They were adopted by the legal procedure.

618
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
And the procedure was rejected.

619
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
It's a good news.

620
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,120
Otherwise, if we don't find the child,

621
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
we'll be in trouble again.

622
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
Okay.

623
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
You should rest early.

624
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Yes.

625
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Bye.

626
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
No rush?

627
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Did you see that video?

628
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
The family was in a hurry to jump off the building.

629
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
All right.

630
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
Let me know if you have any news.

631
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,980
See you

632
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,600
You just joined the team.

633
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,000
I understand that you want to show your best.

634
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,600
But if a team needs time to grow,

635
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,640
you need to care about your colleagues.

636
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,280
Only then you can be a part of the team.

637
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,600
I told you to let go of your hands and feet.

638
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,240
I and the sales department will support you.

639
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,240
Okay?

640
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,320
Take care of your colleagues.

641
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,920
Okay, I got it.

642
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,640
Thank you for informing me.

643
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,720
Okay.

644
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,600
Which team is this?

645
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,360
Next.

646
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,760
They both got what they stay for.

647
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,720
Yes.

648
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,560
I want to ask, is 38 Bed Yin Jing Sheng?

649
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,760
He doesn't seem to be here.

650
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,320
Yes, it's him.

651
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,040
But he said he had something to do at home.

652
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,800
He said he had to go home first and come back later.

653
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,000
You...

654
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,520
Eat.

655
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,320
I'm so tired.

656
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,280
I'm hungry.

657
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,240
What are you eating?

658
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:49,760
Eat.

659
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,360
You eat it.

660
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,800
I'll eat it.

661
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,720
Yes, look.

662
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,240
Where is your chicken?

663
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,760
Jiang?

664
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,600
Jiangtai chicken?

665
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,160
Jiang?

666
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,880
Jiang chicken?

667
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,680
What are you doing here?

668
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,000
I'll just take it and go.

669
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,200
Master, where is Xiaoqi?

670
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,800
Xiaoqi, why are you here?

671
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,760
I just want to chat with you.

672
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,880
Okay.

673
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,760
What's up?

674
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,280
You've been having a hard time lately?

675
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,480
You're indeed a master.

676
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,520
You're so bright.

677
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,400
Actually,

678
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,120
I just want to say something to you.

679
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,640
I came here to work as a manager.

680
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,600
I found that you're a little different from what I thought before.

681
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,880
Your work and your work content

682
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,920
are much more complicated than I imagined.

683
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,760
What's wrong?

684
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,920
Are you stressed?

685
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,480
Director and Director Xiao

686
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,480
asked you to be the director.

687
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,520
They think you're a good person

688
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,840
and a good person.

689
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,520
I heard that you're in the hospital.

690
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
Are you in a good shape now?

691
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,440
Yes.

692
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,320
You're here.

693
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,840
What are you doing in this mysterious place?

694
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,800
I'm going to send you a meal.

695
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,960
Why are you so unwilling?

696
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,760
You only found out from the nurse when I came.

697
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
You've been busy these days,

698
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,080
but you're asking for help behind my back.

699
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,280
How come I didn't know that you're such a good person?

700
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,760
Where did you go?

701
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
I'm bored.

702
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,160
I'm going for a walk.

703
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
You should stay and watch your husband.

704
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,760
You can investigate him if you want.

705
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,320
Who's responsible for what happened to Zhenyao?

706
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,560
I know him.

707
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,960
He's a good person.

708
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,160
He's a good person.

709
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
I know.

710
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,760
It's all an old habit.

711
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,000
As for Jiansheng,

712
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,600
his character and ability are all good.

713
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
He's a good person.

714
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,000
He's not a bad person.

715
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,720
You can find a paper and look it up.

716
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,200
He can definitely tell you the same.

717
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
It's a case.

718
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,000
You only care about cases, right?

719
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,080
Jiansheng,

720
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,080
you should think about yourself,

721
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,760
not me.

722
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
Hello?

723
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
Okay.

724
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
Oh, come on.

725
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
What are you laughing at?

726
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,160
You're making fun of me.

727
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Who's making fun of you?

728
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,600
Where are you going?

729
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,880
According to Yin's age and experience,

730
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,200
you should leave the position of the head of the department.

731
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,320
You should let him be the head of the department,

732
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
not me.

733
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,760
Jiansheng is a retired soldier.

734
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,080
He only has a high school degree.

735
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,640
I've told him many times.

736
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,880
You should get a high school degree.

737
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,720
But he's just a kid.

738
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,640
He's a young man.

739
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,640
He's not a good person.

740
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,240
It's not easy to be a doctor.

741
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,840
When you're not here,

742
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,600
you always ask me about Lin Ran.

743
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,760
You know,

744
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,400
there are few clues in the past.

745
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,080
The environment is complicated.

746
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,560
The technology is poor.

747
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,760
It's not easy to find someone.

748
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,280
And the buyer's legal awareness is weak.

749
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,080
Their ignorance has led to the market

750
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,840
to keep flowing.

751
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,600
This requires that we must be strong

752
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,000
in order to control the people's will.

753
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,480
We must not give up.

754
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,240
You did a good job.

755
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,440
Xiaodeng, I'm telling you,

756
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,000
Jiansheng can't be idle in the hospital.

757
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,400
Let him rest for a few days.

758
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,480
Then call him back.

759
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,240
If there's a case,

760
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,840
he'll recover faster.

761
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,960
I see, Director Wang.

762
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,480
I'll go with you to play chess.

763
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,080
Let's go.

764
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,520
Go.

765
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,560
Hello, Officer Lu.

766
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,920
I want to ask you for a favor.

767
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,920
It's about the case of Yang Yu.

768
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,440
I...

769
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,240
38th floor,

770
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,960
turn off your phone and rest.

771
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,720
Don't you know what's going on with you?

772
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,040
You'll get a headache if you keep going on.

773
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,000
Okay, I know.

774
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,600
Rest.

775
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,760
Okay, okay, I'll be right there.

776
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,160
Right, right.

777
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,760
I'll go to you in person.

778
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,680
What are you doing?

779
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,400
Hello, I want to ask if there's a patient named Ying.

780
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,480
Yes, 38th floor.

781
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,040
38th floor, thank you.

782
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,680
Wait, you can't go in.

783
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,840
It's too late.

784
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,720
Yes, I know.

785
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,760
But the patient named Ying is a police officer.

786
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,600
So I want to visit him.

787
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,240
No.

788
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,280
Why?

789
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,480
It's too late.

790
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,320
Everyone is resting.

791
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,320
You can come tomorrow.

792
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,240
So strict.

793
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,080
Go.

794
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,320
It's not worth it.

795
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,160
Go, go, go.

796
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,000
먹어봐.

797
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,200
Okay, I got it.

798
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,480
I'll give you backs.

799
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,960
Uncle Ying.

800
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
The nurse didn't scold you?

801
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,160
I'm telling you, they didn't scold me.

802
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Here, flowers.

803
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,160
I wanted to buy you a fruit.

804
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,160
But I thought you were diabetic.

805
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
How are you feeling now?

806
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,160
I'm fine. I'll be fine in a couple of days.

807
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,160
How's your team doing?

808
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,160
I'll be there soon.

809
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,160
I'll be there soon.

810
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,160
How's the case with Yang Yu?

811
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,160
Any new leads?

812
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
Not yet.

813
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,160
But Jia Jia is looking for a cool guy.

814
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,160
He said he could help.

815
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
Are you sleeping, sir?

816
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Director Deng, why are you here?

817
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,160
I came in the day and saw you weren't here.

818
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,160
So I came in the night.

819
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,160
I hope I didn't disturb you.

820
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
You're too kind.

821
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
I'll put it here.

822
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
Sit down.

823
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,160
Okay, come out.

824
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,160
You're so small, Director Deng.

825
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,160
I'm sorry.

826
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,160
Hello, Director Deng.

827
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,160
I'm afraid of nurses.

828
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,160
No, not that.

829
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,160
I'm afraid of breaking the rules.

830
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
You two talk.

831
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,160
I'm not here. You talk.

832
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Master, did Han Zhiduan tell you to rest?

833
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,160
If we all listen to the doctor,

834
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,160
we'll fill the hospital with the police.

835
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
I'm fine.

836
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
I can't die of illness.

837
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,160
He's right.

838
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,160
What did he say?

839
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,160
He said you were checking the case.

840
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
He's right.

841
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Since that's the case, let's talk.

842
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,160
What's the situation with Yang Yu's case?

843
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,160
We'll talk tomorrow.

844
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,160
The most important thing is to rest.

845
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,160
You can't be the only one.

846
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
Okay.

847
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,160
What's going on with him?

848
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
It's not a big deal.

849
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,160
He's just a man.

850
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
He's a man.

851
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Han Liang, listen.

852
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
Listen to the doctor.

853
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
He needs to rest.

854
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,160
Director Xiao is worried about Yang Yu's case.

855
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
He has no clue.

856
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
He can't find Yang Yu.

857
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,160
He's not well.

858
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
So we need to hurry up.

859
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,160
You're a leader.

860
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,160
Wait, Director Xiao.

861
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Director Xiao, Han Zhiduan, you want to see me?

862
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Come on.

863
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
Sit down.

864
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
Sit down.

865
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,160
The public is interested in Yang Yu's case.

866
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,160
What's your opinion?

867
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Recently, there are many cases of child abuse.

868
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,160
Yang Yu's case is also highly popular.

869
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,160
I think it's a very important opportunity for the public to join the anti-corruption movement.

870
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
The public is aware of the importance of anti-corruption.

871
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
And we have to take a serious action.

872
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,160
We can control these crimes.

873
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Okay.

874
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
From the public to the public.

875
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:13,860
This is the

876
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
great idea.

877
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,860
You have the right to cooperate.

878
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,860
Okay, I understand.

879
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,860
I was two years old when my daughter was lost.

880
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:34,860
It's been 13 years and five months.

881
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,860
Her mother and I took her to the mall.

882
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,860
We had a little fight.

883
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,860
Nobody noticed.

884
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:46,860
She disappeared.

885
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,860
I ran away with my child.

886
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,860
I was crying and chasing after her.

887
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,560
Director Deng, as the director of the anti-corruption department of the Lingshan Public Security Bureau,

888
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,560
thank you for accepting our interview today.

889
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,560
The family of the victim was introduced to us.

890
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,560
The anti-corruption method can be said to be a good example.

891
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,560
Once it happens to every family, it's a huge disaster.

892
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,560
How should we prevent it?

893
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,560
If there is a case of child abuse, please don't panic.

894
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,560
You must call the police.

895
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,260
We will try to find the victim as soon as possible.

896
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,260
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

897
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,260

899
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,260

00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,260
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

907
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,260
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

908
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,260
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

909
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

910
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

911
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

912
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

913
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

914
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

915
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960

916
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

917
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

918
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

919
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

920
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

921
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

922
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,960
We hope that the parents of the lost children will not panic.

923
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:21,660
I want to ask him to draw a boy's portrait of you.

924
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,660
Maybe it will be your brother's after he grows up.

925
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,660
Okay. Thank you.

926
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,660
Be careful.

927
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,660
Think about it.

928
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,660
It's done.

929
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,360
Is this the database you mentioned?

930
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,360
It's done so quickly.

931
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,360
It's not that fast.

932
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
This is a demo version.

933
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,360
I've made all the information about the little girl

934
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,360
