1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The next one is the most difficult one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's a very difficult one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's a very difficult one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a very difficult one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a very difficult one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's a difficult one.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's a difficult one.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's a difficult one.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a difficult one.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This one is more difficult.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,580
I'm going to make a

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:54,640
I'm going to make a

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,540
I'm going to make a

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,280
I'm going to make a

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,740
I'm going to make a

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,540
I'm going to make a

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm going to make a

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,580
I'm going to make a

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,080
I'm going to make a

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,580
I'm going to make a

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,080
I'm going to make a

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,580
I'm going to make a

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,080
I'm going to make a

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,580
I'm going to make a

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm going to make a

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,580
I'm going to make a

27
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,080
I'm going to make a

28
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,580
I'm going to make a

29
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm going to make a

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm going to make a

31
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,080
I'm going to make a

32
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,580
I'm going to make a

33
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,580
I'm going to make a

34
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,580
I'm going to make a

35
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,580
I'm going to make a

36
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,580
I'm going to make a

37
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,580
I'm going to make a

38
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,580
I'm going to make a

39
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,620
I'm going to make a

40
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:26,900
I'm going to make a

41
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,140
I'm going to make a

42
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm going to make a

43
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,140
I'm going to make a

44
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,860
Let's go

45
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,860
Take a photo

46
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,840
We've met today

47
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,400
I just had a better bike

48
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,940
It was a manual

49
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,740
So we're going to do some

50
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,240
JK instead

51
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,460
Sandra

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,160
Can't you see

53
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,500
No, I'm so good

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,860
I won't

55
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,860
Xiao Yang Yue?

56
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,860
The phone number of 120 to 9-6 is 16.12.

57
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,860
This person came out at 16.13.

58
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,860
He's the closest person to the time.

59
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,860
He might have missed it during the check-in.

60
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,860
I think we should find this person

61
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,860
and ask what happened.

62
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,860
There's no video that can capture his face.

63
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,860
Only his legs.

64
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,860
Wait. Is there anyone next to the car?

65
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,860
There really is.

66
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,860
Director, you're amazing.

67
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,860
What are you doing?

68
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,860
Be more careful.

69
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,860
Where did he see me?

70
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,860
Take out the video of Meng Gui's check-in.

71
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,860
Let me see his feet.

72
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,860
He was not in a good position during the check-in.

73
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,860
His feet were moving around.

74
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,860
So I had an influence on his blood.

75
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,860
Look at the time he left the park.

76
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,860
He's back.

77
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,860
He was 3 minutes away.

78
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,860
The blind spots are where he lost his child.

79
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,860
They used this time to transfer the child.

80
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,860
I told you he didn't tell the truth.

81
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,860
Can we catch him now?

82
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,860
We can't.

83
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,860
We can't be sure if there's a child in the bag.

84
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,860
We can't just use our shoes to call him.

85
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,860
We have to find more evidence.

86
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,860
There's a video of him.

87
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,860
Let's go and check.

88
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,860
We have to find more evidence.

89
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,860
We have to find more evidence.

90
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
I saw the child calling us.

91
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,860
We have to find more evidence.

92
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
Hello, are you a student?

93
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,860
I'm a student.

94
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,860
Thank you.

95
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,860
Call us if you see anything.

96
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,860
Don't call us.

97
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,860
Director Liu.

98
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,860
Yexin, should you be back?

99
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,860
You don't know about this project?

100
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,860
The child is in a bad condition.

101
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,860
You should let him go.

102
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,860
Director Liu, I can't.

103
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,860
You can't?

104
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,860
There's a police.

105
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,860
You've been standing here for so long.

106
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,860
You know how worried this project is?

107
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,860
You know I lost my child?

108
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,860
Okay, I quit.

109
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,860
Don't call me.

110
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,860
Honey.

111
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,860
Why are you standing there?

112
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,860
Hello.

113
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,860
I lost my child.

114
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,860
Call us if you see anything.

115
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,860
We have to find more evidence.

116
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,860
Hello.

117
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,860
What?

118
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860
Okay, I'll be there.

119
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,860
Okay.

120
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,860
Okay, I'll be there.

121
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,860
Okay.

122
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,860
Let's go.

123
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,860
Here it is.

124
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,860
What's wrong?

125
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,860
Xinxin was not well.

126
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,860
And she's been under a lot of stress.

127
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,860
What are you doing?

128
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,860
Let's go.

129
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,860
Let's go to the supermarket.

130
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,860
The child loves meat.

131
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,860
Let's eat meat.

132
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,860
This is a big chicken.

133
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,860
Look.

134
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
Look, she's eating.

135
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,860
You're the one who's laughing.

136
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,860
She's not eating or sleeping because of this little lamb.

137
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,860
She fainted today.

138
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,860
I sent her to the hospital.

139
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,860
Officer Deng.

140
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
I really can't do anything.

141
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,860
I wanted to call you and ask you to come and persuade her.

142
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
It's okay.

143
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,860
What will you say after you see the doctor?

144
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,860
It's nothing big.

145
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,860
It's just that the economic rope is broken.

146
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,860
Since the child was lost,

147
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,860
she has been thinking about it.

148
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,860
She lost her job.

149
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,860
Except for looking for a child,

150
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,860
she basically doesn't do anything.

151
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Let go of me.

152
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,860
This is not right.

153
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,860
Let go of me.

154
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,860
Xinxin.

155
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,860
Xinxin.

156
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,860
What are you doing?

157
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,860
I'm Dr. Han.

158
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
Xinxin.

159
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,860
Don't kill me.

160
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,860
Xinxin.

161
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,860
We're not that poor.

162
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,860
What else can we do?

163
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,860
Xinxin.

164
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,860
Jiaxin.

165
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,860
What else can we do?

166
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,860
Jiaxin.

167
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,860
Trust me again.

168
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,860
I'll find Xiaoyong.

169
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,860
Trust me.

170
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Don't lie to me.

171
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,860
The child is back.

172
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,860
The child is back.

173
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,860
Xinxin.

174
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,860
Xinxin.

175
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,860
Don't hurt me.

176
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,860
Xiaoyong will be homeless when he comes back.

177
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,860
No matter where he is,

178
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,860
I'll bring him back.

179
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,860
Trust me, okay?

180
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,860
I...

181
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,860
I can't be homeless anymore.

182
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,860
We can't be homeless.

183
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,860
We can't be homeless.

184
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,860
Bring him back.

185
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,860
I'll bring him back.

186
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,860
Promise me.

187
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
I promise you.

188
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,860
I'll bring him back.

189
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Jiaxin.

190
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,860
I'll take good care of you.

191
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,860
I'll be with you.

192
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,860
I'll be with you.

193
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
Promise me.

194
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,860
I promise you.

195
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,860
I promise you.

196
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,860
What's the progress

197
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,860
on Luo Xiaoyu's case?

198
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,860
Mr. Sun, be careful.

199
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,860
We're still investigating.

200
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,860
There's no...

201
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Mr. Sun, you're new here.

202
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Didn't Mr. Deng agree to help me find my brother?

203
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
It's been a long time.

204
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,860
Why is there still no clue?

205
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,860
Is this how the police talk?

206
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,860
Officer An, you were there that day.

207
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,860
Mr. Deng was in uniform.

208
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,860
Forget it. You can't count on me.

209
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,860
I asked someone to draw this portrait.

210
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,860
Please open the work based on this.

211
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,860
What do you mean?

212
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,860
We can't count on you.

213
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,860
How do you know we didn't work hard?

214
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,860
After Mr. Deng came back from the criminal investigation,

215
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,860
the technical department drew a portrait

216
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,860
based on Luo Xiaoyu's old portrait.

217
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,860
At the same time,

218
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,860
we also gave this portrait to the police.

219
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,860
They also investigated it.

220
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,860
Please read it yourself.

221
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,860
Why didn't you tell me?

222
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,860
Right. If I don't show this today,

223
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
you won't show me this either.

224
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,860
No, then our case...

225
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
Mr. Sun, be careful.

226
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,860
Although we have issued a notice

227
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,860
to investigate the new portrait,

228
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,860
there's still no news.

229
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,860
Before we find new clues,

230
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,860
we can't communicate with the family.

231
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,860
I hope you understand.

232
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,860
Mr. Sun,

233
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,860
we've seen a lot of things you've done.

234
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,860
Thank you.

235
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,860
Xiaoxin, we can understand your feelings.

236
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,860
What we should do now is to cooperate with Li Jiming.

237
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,860
Please believe us.

238
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,860
Mr. Dong, thank you for today.

239
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,860
It's okay.

240
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,860
Lin Hao, I suggest you

241
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,860
take him to see a psychologist.

242
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,860
He's in a state of

243
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,860
probably a trauma.

244
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,860
Mr. Xiaoxin, come in.

245
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,860
Go.

246
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,860
Your mother just recovered.

247
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,860
Don't bother her.

248
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,860
Take care of her.

249
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,860
Thank you, doctor.

250
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,860
I'm sorry.

251
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,860
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,860
I'm sorry.

253
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,860
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,860
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,860
I'm sorry.

256
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,860
I'm sorry.

257
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,860
I'm sorry.

258
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,860
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,860
I'm sorry.

260
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,860
I'm sorry.

261
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,860
I'm sorry.

262
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,860
I'm sorry.

263
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,860
I'm sorry.

264
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,860
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,860
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,860
I'm sorry.

267
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,860
I'm sorry.

268
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,860
I'm sorry.

269
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,860
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,860
I'm sorry.

271
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,860
I'm sorry.

272
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,860
I'm sorry.

273
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,860
I'm sorry.

274
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,860
I'm sorry.

275
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,860
I'm sorry.

276
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,860
I'm sorry.

277
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,860
I'm sorry.

278
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,860
I'm sorry.

279
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,860
You told us that

280
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,860
Hua Hua's family found it.

281
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,860
Hua Hua waited in the reception room every day.

282
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
Poor child.

283
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,860
Seeing other children being adopted

284
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,860
and taken away.

285
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,860
She didn't eat at night.

286
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,860
Which kid doesn't want a family to come to her?

287
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,860
I'm going to bed.

288
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,860
Fanfan.

289
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,860
Fanfan, do you still remember me?

290
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,860
Did my dad and mom come too?

291
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,860
Director.

292
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,860
This is Director Deng from our team.

293
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,860
He's our scene director.

294
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,860
Hello, Director Deng.

295
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,860
Hello, Director Deng.

296
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,860
Luoluo.

297
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,860
Sister?

298
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,860
Yes, Luoluo.

299
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,860
I'm sister.

300
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,860
I'm Luoluo.

301
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,860
I'm sister.

302
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,860
They are dad and mom?

303
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,860
Luoluo, your dad and mom have left.

304
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,860
I never thought I could find you.

305
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,860
Dad and mom have been looking for you.

306
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,860
When they were looking for you,

307
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,860
there was a car accident.

308
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,860
Grandma died of illness.

309
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,860
I was the only one left.

310
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,860
Then,

311
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,860
this dad and mom adopted me.

312
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,860
Sister,

313
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,860
can we live together in the future?

314
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,860
What are you playing?

315
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,860
To be honest,

316
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,860
our family can't afford two kids.

317
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,860
I'm sorry.

318
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,860
It's okay. I understand.

319
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Really?

320
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,860
Let's go home.

321
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,860
But,

322
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,860
you must come to pick me up.

323
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,860
I will.

324
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,860
The kid is a good kid.

325
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,860
He's very smart.

326
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,860
He'll understand what adults say.

327
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,860
The thing that the foster parents mind is

328
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,860
the kid's background is too complicated.

329
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,860
We can't lie to the foster parents, right?

330
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,860
We can understand that.

331
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,860
I'm worried about dad's mental state.

332
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,860
He was so excited before.

333
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,860
And today,

334
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
I'm worried he'll do something

335
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,860
that's not normal.

336
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,860
We have a social worker

337
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,860
who takes care of the kid's mental state.

338
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,860
We will pay attention to his changes.

339
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,860
Okay, we can rest assured.

340
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
You can contact us anytime.

341
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,860
Okay.

342
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,860
Thank you.

343
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,860
You go help him.

344
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,860
Where's Chang'an?

345
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,860
What do you like to eat?

346
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,860
Jiajia, how's the investigation?

347
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,860
I searched all the surveillance cameras.

348
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,860
No one has a camera that can capture the man's face.

349
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,860
The key is that even if one or two cameras were captured,

350
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,860
it's useless to be blind.

351
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,860
What about the shoes?

352
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,860
Did the manufacturer contact the shoes?

353
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,860
They did, but they haven't been found yet.

354
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,860
Yan Lei isn't here.

355
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,860
I don't know where Rui went.

356
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
The foster father is hospitalized again.

357
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Xin and I called everywhere to check the information.

358
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,860
We found a lot of manufacturers.

359
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,860
But there are too many kinds of shoes.

360
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,860
We can't find them.

361
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,860
How do we get them?

362
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,860
Deputy Director,

363
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,860
Mr. Fang,

364
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,860
are you okay?

365
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,860
I'm fine.

366
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,860
Come on.

367
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,860
Tell us how the case is going.

368
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,860
Here's your food.

369
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
Enjoy your meal.

370
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
Thank you.

371
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,860
Mr. Sun,

372
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,860
are you busy?

373
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,860
My husband said you took over his case.

374
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,860
Come on, sit.

375
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,860
I'm here to sign the contract.

376
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,860
This is the deposit.

377
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860
And you take this first.

378
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
That's enough.

379
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
No, no, no, no.

380
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,860
Keep it for the child.

381
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,860
I'll take it.

382
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,860
No, no, no.

383
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,860
Keep it for the child.

384
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,860
You've already lost a lot of money.

385
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
Mr. Sun, no, no, no.

386
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,860
Listen to me.

387
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,860
Keep it.

388
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,860
Take it.

389
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,860
Thank you.

390
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,860
Thank you, uncle.

391
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,860
Uncle is a good man.

392
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,860
Mr. Sun,

393
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,860
are you looking for the child

394
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,860
named Yang Yu?

395
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
That's it.

396
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,860
Director Sun, Mr. Sun.

397
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
Mr. Sun,

398
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,860
I'm sorry.

399
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,860
Jia Jia told me everything.

400
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,860
I didn't see you.

401
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,860
No, I didn't come for that.

402
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,860
I want to tell you about Lin Yang Yu.

403
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,860
It's about Yang Yu.

404
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,860
What about Yang Yu?

405
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,860
I want some clues.

406
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,860
Let him tell you.

407
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,860
When the child was lost,

408
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,860
I was also in the square.

409
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,860
Everyone was busy saving people.

410
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,860
I saw a woman far away

411
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,860
holding the child

412
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,860
and going to a car.

413
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,860
I didn't care at the time.

414
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,860
But two days ago,

415
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,860
I saw Mr. Sun sending a message

416
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,860
saying he was looking for the child.

417
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,860
I thought it was strange.

418
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
Why didn't the woman

419
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,860
look at the car?

420
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
And I saw the video

421
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,860
of the mother of the child

422
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,860
jumping off the roof.

423
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,860
I remembered it.

424
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,860
So I came to see Mr. Sun.

425
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,860
Do you remember

426
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,860
the woman?

427
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,860
It was too far away.

428
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,860
I didn't see it clearly.

429
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,860
What about the car?

430
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,860
What kind of car did you see?

431
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,860
It should be a broken

432
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,860
bread car.

433
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
Are you sure it's a bread car?

434
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,860
If the car was really

435
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,860
the one that Sun Wenhan brought,

436
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,860
it was a woman

437
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,860
who took the child away.

438
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,860
Then the direction she left

439
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,860
was exactly the same

440
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,860
as the direction of this surveillance camera.

441
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,860
Then this woman

442
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,860
could have a relationship with Meng Gui.

443
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,860
The time and direction are the same.

444
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,860
It just solved our question.

445
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,860
This Mr. Sun

446
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,860
really helped a lot.

447
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,860
I'll find Meng Gui first.

448
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,860
The key is to find the car

449
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,860
near the crime scene.

450
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,860
The car of Lin Shan

451
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,860
in the C1G98B.

452
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,860
According to the surveillance,

453
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,860
this car will appear

454
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,860
near the agricultural wholesale market

455
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,860
in Qingluo Town

456
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,860
every day.

457
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,860
The car of Lin Shan

458
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,860
in the C1G98B.

459
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,860
According to the surveillance,

460
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
this car will appear

461
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,860
near the agricultural wholesale market

462
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,860
in Qingluo Town

463
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,860
every day.

464
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
The car of Lin Shan

465
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,860
in the C1G98B.

466
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,860
According to the surveillance,

467
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,860
this car will appear

468
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,860
near the agricultural wholesale market

469
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,860
in Qingluo Town

470
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
every day.

471
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,860
According to the surveillance,

472
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,860
this car will appear

473
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
near the agricultural wholesale market

474
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,860
in Qingluo Town

475
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,860
every day.

476
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,860
According to the surveillance,

477
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
this car will appear

478
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,860
near the agricultural wholesale market

479
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,860
in Qingluo Town

480
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,860
every day.

481
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,860
Get down!

482
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,860
Get down!

483
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Get down!

484
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,860
This way!

485
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Get up!

486
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,860
What's your name?

487
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,860
Mr. Wang.

488
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,860
Why did you run away

489
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,860
when you saw us?

490
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,860
I thought you were buried.

491
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,860
I borrowed a loan from the high-end

492
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
and didn't pay it back.

493
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,860
They...

494
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,860
They harassed me every day.

495
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,860
I... I couldn't stand it.

496
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,860
I...

497
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,860
I knew you were police officers.

498
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,860
So I didn't run away.

499
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
Now I think

500
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,860
it's safer

501
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,860
in the public security area.

502
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,860
No,

503
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,860
police officers.

504
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,860
You... you...

505
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,860
You have to protect me,

506
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,860
police officers.

507
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,860
Do you know Meng Gui?

508
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,860
Who?

509
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,860
Meng... Meng Gui?

510
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,860
I don't know him.

511
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,860
Is this white bread truck

512
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,860
yours?

513
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,860
It's... it's mine.

514
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,860
You've never seen this truck before?

515
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,860
No way.

516
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,860
I have to wait for the man

517
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,860
to deliver goods

518
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,860
to the big sea market every morning.

519
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,860
I... I bought that car

520
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,860
and now I drive it every day.

521
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,860
It's impossible

522
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,860
to borrow it.

523
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,860
There are two types of this license plate.

524
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,860
So one of them is a set license plate.

525
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,860
I suspect

526
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,860
this is the car

527
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
Tang Yi usually drives to the sea.

528
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,860
What's the clue of the other car?

529
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,860
This car was in the same time period

530
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
and appeared in the forest market.

531
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,860
It's Meng Gui.

532
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,860
So he has another set license plate.

533
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,860
Now the clue of the shoe is also right.

534
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,860
I've checked with the supermarket.

535
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,860
Mr. Wang is honest.

536
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,860
He's telling the truth.

537
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,860
This man is so unlucky.

538
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,860
He doesn't even know

539
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,860
he's been set up.

540
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,860
I've already informed Jin Zhen.

541
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,860
Maybe I can help him

542
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,860
solve the problem of the high-end.

543
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,860
This kid is really lucky.

544
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,860
He drives a set license plate

545
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,860
and never pretends.

546
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,860
I suspect he has many license plates.

547
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,860
If he pretends once, he changes it once.

548
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
Be careful.

549
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,860
Where is his car now?

550
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,860
Where is it now?

551
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,860
The last time this car appeared

552
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
was at eight o'clock last night

553
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,860
in a friendship mall in Lingnan.

554
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,860
Then it was registered.

555
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,860
Before that,

556
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
there was no rule

557
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
for its whereabouts.

558
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,860
Look.

559
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,860
Yesterday in Lingnan,

560
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,860
the day before yesterday in Lingjiang,

561
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,860
and before that in Hongxi.

562
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,860
In a month,

563
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,860
it has been to so many places.

564
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,860
There are also some lines in Lingshen.

565
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,860
There is no problem.

566
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
If this car really

567
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,860
was a kid,

568
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,860
he wouldn't have gone to the police.

569
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,860
He is in a difficult situation.

570
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,860
So we have to expand the search range.

571
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,860
And I think

572
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,860
Menggui's group

573
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,860
should be a group of criminals.

574
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,860
They won't be alone.

575
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,860
As long as we find Menggui

576
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,860
and follow him,

577
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
we can forget about

578
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,860
this criminal group.

579
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,860
I agree with Dongyue's analysis.

580
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,860
According to our previous guess,

581
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,860
if this criminal group

582
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,860
has a connection

583
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
with the Guai Man Shao group,

584
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,860
then we can definitely

585
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,860
find this criminal group

586
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,860
through this hole.

587
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,860
Mr. Sun.

588
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
What's wrong with the clue

589
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,860
you mentioned yesterday?

590
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,860
I had a colleague before.

591
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,860
He said that they had a family.

592
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,860
Last year, they had a child.

593
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,860
But the child disappeared

594
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
in a few days.

595
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,860
But he went back a few days ago.

596
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
He also attended

597
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
the birthday party of the child

598
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
on the fourth day of the week.

599
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,860
I think this is quite strange.

600
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Do you think this

601
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,860
has something to do with the child?

602
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,860
Tell me.

603
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,860
What is his name?

604
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,860
Where does he live?

605
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
He is a child.

606
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,860
He is a child.

607
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,860
He is a child.

608
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
Tell me.

609
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
What is his name?

610
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,860
Where does he live?

611
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,860
Hello.

612
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,860
Dacheng.

613
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,860
Are you still in the West Village of Shanyang?

614
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,860
I'll be back soon.

615
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,860
What's wrong?

616
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,860
Dacheng.

617
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
I'll be right there.

618
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,860
We need to get together.

619
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,860
We'll be careful later.

620
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,860
Bring the information.

621
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,860
This way.

622
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,860
Go to the house next to the building.

623
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,860
Go.

624
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,860
I can't wait.

625
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
Be careful.

626
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,860
I'll be right there.

627
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,860
Drink some more, okay?

628
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,860
Drink some more.

629
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,860
Okay?

630
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,860
Come on.

631
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,860
Drink some more, okay?

632
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,860
Who is it?

633
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,860
Hello, Miss.

634
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,860
I have something to ask you.

635
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
Fan Dacheng lives in this village, right?

636
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
You mean Fan Langshan?

637
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,860
He lives in this village.

638
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,860
You are?

639
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,860
I'm his friend.

640
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,860
You're his friend?

641
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,860
Where does he live?

642
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,860
I'm a lawyer.

643
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,860
We met in the city.

644
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,860
He said he lived in the West Village.

645
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,860
I've never been there.

646
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,860
I happened to pass by today.

647
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,860
I want to see him.

648
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,860
He's at home.

649
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,860
He went to work early.

650
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,860
He's at home.

651
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,860
I'll go and visit him.

652
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,860
His parents are here.

653
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,860
I'll point it out to you.

654
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,860
Just go down this road.

655
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,860
Go straight.

656
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
When you see the first intersection,

657
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,860
turn right.

658
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,860
The third one is the right one.

659
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,860
Okay, thank you.

660
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,860
This kid is so cute.

661
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,860
He seems to be sick.

662
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,860
His face is a little pale.

663
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,860
We've eaten too much these two days.

664
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,860
It's time to eat.

665
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,860
Right?

666
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,860
So the bat we just got...

667
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,860
What are you doing?

668
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,860
What are you doing?

669
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,860
I'll help him look.

670
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,860
Are you a doctor?

671
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,860
This is...

672
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,860
Hello.

673
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,860
He insisted on taking pictures of the child.

674
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,860
He's a doctor for a while,

675
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,860
and a lawyer for a while.

676
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,860
I think your kid is cute.

677
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,860
Why are you taking pictures?

678
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,860
He seems to be sick.

679
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,860
I'm not sick.

680
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,860
Why are you taking pictures of your kid?

681
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,860
No, he seems to be sick.

682
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,860
He's cute.

683
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,860
You're not taking pictures of him.

684
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,860
I...

685
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,860
Take pictures now.

686
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,860
Okay.

687
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,860
I'm sorry.

688
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,860
I just saw your kid was cute.

689
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,860
I took pictures of him.

690
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,860
Look.

691
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,860
Don't misunderstand.

692
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,860
I'll go find Fan Dacheng.

693
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,860
Thank you.

694
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,860
What's going on?

695
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,860
Fan Dacheng...

696
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,860
He said he saw his kid was sick.

697
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
He took pictures of him.

698
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,860
He said he was a lawyer for a while,

699
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,860
and a doctor for a while.

700
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,860
Could it be a human?

701
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,860
Close the door.

702
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,860
Pay attention to strangers.

703
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,860
Open the door.

704
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,860
I found it.

705
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,860
The two police cars appeared.

706
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,860
Where did these two cars appear?

707
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,860
Linan, Jijiang, Changqing, Hongxi.

708
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,860
The last place they appeared was the nine-level line of Hongxi City.

709
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,860
That means they would pass Lin Shan no matter where they went.

710
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,860
Lin Shan is their destination.

711
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,860
Yes.

712
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,860
If these people really hid in Lin Shan,

713
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,860
they could escape from our previous investigation.

714
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,860
Anyway, he's very strong.

715
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,860
Now if we find this car,

716
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
we can find the clue of the kid.

717
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,860
Zheng, check the car and find the clue of Lin Shan.

718
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,860
Okay.

719
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,860
This car is very cunning.

720
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,860
It almost avoided most of the cameras on the road in Lin Shan.

721
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
For such a long time,

722
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,860
only four cameras caught this car.

723
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,860
Renmin Road and Xiangyun Street.

724
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,860
Renmin Road and Nan Sheng Street.

725
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,860
Hongshan Road and Xiangyun Street.

726
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,860
Hongshan Road and Nan Sheng Street.

727
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,860
That means

728
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,860
these four roads are the only way to get through this car.

729
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,860
And there must be a fixed parking space for this car in this place.

730
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
It's such a big area.

731
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,860
Should we ask the police station and the police team to help?

732
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,860
Absolutely not.

733
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,860
These people are very vigilant.

734
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,860
If you ask them to help,

735
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,860
I guess it's a big deal.

736
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,860
I decide to do this.

737
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,860
Four of us will park at a roadside.

738
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,860
But this car appeared in Jijiang today.

739
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,860
It hasn't returned to Lin Shan yet.

740
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,860
It's too early for us to park so early.

741
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,860
No.

742
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,860
Look at the rules.

743
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,860
It will return to Lin Shan every three days.

744
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,860
It hasn't been back for three days now.

745
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,860
It's about time.

746
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,860
How about this, Wang Ying?

747
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,860
You keep an eye on the roads of Renmin Road and Nan Sheng Street.

748
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,860
Chang Rui,

749
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,860
keep an eye on the roads of Nan Sheng Street and Hongshan Street.

750
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,860
Jiajia,

751
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,860
you should keep an eye on Tian Yan.

752
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,860
It's okay.

753
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,860
I can ask the traffic control department for help.

754
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,860
Is that okay?

755
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,860
Yes.

756
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,860
Okay.

757
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,860

00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,860
Do you know this is called a drama?

953
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,860
Boss

954
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,860
This is a human trafficker

955
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,860
He's secretly taking pictures at my door

956
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,860
He's trying to steal my child

957
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,860
Get down!

958
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,860
Get down!

959
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,860
Go!

960
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,860
Go to the committee and explain

961
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,860
Come on

962
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,860
Let's go back and make a comparison

963
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,860
There are many of these bread trucks

964
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,860
They all look similar

965
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,860
The factory's truck is very rough

966
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,860
But you have to pay attention to its exterior

967
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,860
There is a very obvious curve

968
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,860
I see

969
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,860
I'm exhausted

970
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,860
I'm so dizzy

971
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,860
Okay, drive slowly

972
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,860
Thank you, Menggui

973
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,860
Let's go

974
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,860
Attention, everyone

975
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,860
Menggui has appeared

976
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,860
Where is it?

977
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,860
The center of the Sky and Water System

978
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,860
Menggui has entered

979
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,860
Menggui

980
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,860
Menggui

981
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,860
Menggui

982
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,860
Menggui

983
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,860
Menggui

984
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,860
Menggui

985
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,860
Menggui

986
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,860
Menggui

987
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,860
Menggui

988
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,860
Menggui

989
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
Menggui

990
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,860
Menggui

991
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,860
Menggui

992
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:48,860
The target vehicle is moving

993
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,860
The target vehicle is moving

994
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,360
Go

995
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,860
Changlin, go to the car accident meeting. The police are coming with me.

996
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,860
I'm already here.

997
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,860
Please be careful.

998
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,860
The car is now heading to the parking lot of the mountain area.

999
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,860
Please help.

1000
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,860
Is this the only person?

1001
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,860
You only have this exit, right?

1002
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,860
Please come in.

1003
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,860
Please go to the car accident meeting.

1004
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,860
Please help.

1005
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,860
Please come in.

1006
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,860
Please help.

1007
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,860
Please come in.

1008
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,860
Please help.

1009
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,860
Please come in.

1010
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,860
Please help.

1011
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,860
Please come in.

1012
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,860
Please help.

1013
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,860
Please come in.

1014
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,860
Please help.

1015
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,860
Please come in.

1016
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,860
Please help.

1017
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,860
Please help.

1018
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,860
Please help.

1019
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,860
Please help.

1020
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,860
Please help.

1021
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,860
Please help.

1022
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,860
Please help.

1023
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,860
Please come in.

1024
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,860
Please help.

1025
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,860
Please help.

1026
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,860
Please help.

1027
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,860
What are you doing? You're so dirty.

1028
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,860
You've got to take a shower in a rush.

1029
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:51,860
He's stillconscious.

1030
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,940
I think it's a inland debris.

1031
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,500
But he's wary of it.

1032
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,840
Show the Lavender

1033
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,540
You, come here

1034
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,940
Come here

1035
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,840
Hamster

1036
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,300
Sit

1037
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,160
You're seated

1038
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:18,500
You want to be a person

1039
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:25,500
Light others in the dark night

1040
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:33,500
Brave people, what kind of identity

1041
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:39,500
What doesn't change is the sincerity in the heart

1042
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Finally, I became such a person

1043
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:52,500
Every number is a memory of youth

1044
00:43:52,500 --> 00:44:00,500
For love, heartache, for the past, and this life

1045
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:36,500
If you have a fixed identity, you won't go back

1046
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:43,500
The time of greeting is with him

1047
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:50,500
When someone is standing, the light of hope is bright

1048
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:59,500
Hugging the past, he will never give up

1049
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:07,500
Just like my heart, he will never give up

1050
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:16,500
The blue heart, he will never give up

1051
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:24,500
Thank you for watching
