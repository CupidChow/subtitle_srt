1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The next one is the most difficult one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's a very difficult one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's a very difficult one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a very difficult one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a very difficult one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There are two hidden in total.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,580
I'm going to make a

00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:54,640

I'm going to make a

I'm going to make a

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
I'm going to make a

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
I'm going to make a

00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
I'm going to make a

38
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
I'm going to make a

39
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,540
Boyfriend

40
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,720
Episode 21

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,960
Day 3

42
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,600
You're crying because you cry

43
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,880
Thank God

44
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,300
If Wayo was with me

45
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,480
this wouldn't have happened

46
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,160
No need toemorated

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,280
It's because you insisted on getting divorced

48
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,100
If you didn't blame my daughter

49
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,820
I wouldn't have got into this

50
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,160
Don't get too worked up

51
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,540
Doctor said that she would do her best

52
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,540
Who are you?

53
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,100
This is our officer Chang.

54
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,700
He's responsible for saving Weiwei.

55
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,900
You told me

56
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,740
to save my daughter as soon as possible.

57
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,980
And you did it.

58
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,580
What do you police officers do?

59
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,540
Sir, don't get too excited.

60
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,620
We've done our best.

61
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,700
We've caught the criminal.

62
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,660
Criminal?

63
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,260
I don't care what criminal.

64
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,980
I just want to ask you

65
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,060
why you didn't save my daughter earlier.

66
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,540
If my daughter had a good life,

67
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,420
I wouldn't be with you.

68
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,220
You're too much.

69
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,300
Calm down, Su.

70
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,220
Don't be impulsive.

71
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,460
I'm not impulsive.

72
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,220
My daughter is dead.

73
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,340
I don't know.

74
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,340
All right.

75
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,340
Stop talking.

76
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,340
Sit down.

77
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,340
The police officers saved my daughter.

78
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,340
Why did you do this?

79
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,340
Weiwei.

80
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,340
Do you know

81
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,340
how we've been living

82
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,340
for the past month?

83
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,340
You're parents.

84
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,340
I'm lying in the hospital.

85
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,340
You're lying to me.

86
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,340
I just want to ask you

87
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,340
why you didn't save my daughter earlier.

88
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,340
Why did you let my daughter suffer so much?

89
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,340
Look at my poor daughter.

90
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,340
Don't listen to your school.

91
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,340
Close your eyes and do nothing.

92
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,340
I can't wait to

93
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,340
put it in her head

94
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,340
and pull out her memories.

95
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,340
Hurry up and arrest them all.

96
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,340
They're all in the same room.

97
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,340
They've been hiding in the same room

98
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,340
and I've been holding them.

99
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,340
I'm sorry.

100
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,340
I'm sorry, Yang Yu.

101
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,340
Because of your daughter,

102
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,340
people are more depressed

103
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,340
because of you.

104
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
Come on.

105
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,340
Come on.

106
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,340
Come on.

107
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,340
Zheng Weiwei's family.

108
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,340
I'm her mother.

109
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,340
The patient is out of danger.

110
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,340
Great.

111
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
You can't come in.

112
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
Weiwei.

113
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,340
Weiwei.

114
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,340
Weiwei.

115
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,340
Don't be afraid.

116
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,340
I'm waiting for you outside.

117
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,340
Let's go.

118
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
Director.

119
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
Director.

120
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,340
I have a document for you.

121
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,340
Pay attention.

122
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
According to the document

123
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,340
developed by the provincial police,

124
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,340
a group of girls like Qingpi

125
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
who are forced to sell their camp

126
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,340
must be arrested.

127
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,340
And Hongyi.

128
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,340
We must track them down.

129
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,340
But now we have no clues.

130
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,340
Keep investigating.

131
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,340
Officer.

132
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,340
I really don't know

133
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,340
what they did.

134
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,340
I'm just responsible for sending girls.

135
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,340
Where did the girls come from?

136
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,340
The girls are all the bosses.

137
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,340
Qingpi brought them here.

138
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,340
Sometimes they come here for a few days.

139
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,340
Sometimes they come here for a few days.

140
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,340
I'm really responsible for beating them up.

141
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,340
I swear to God.

142
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,340
I didn't...

143
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,340
Enough. Stop talking nonsense.

144
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,340
If it weren't for you, who else would it be?

145
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,340
Qingpi?

146
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,340
Or is there someone else?

147
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,340
Say something.

148
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,340
I said it.

149
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,340
I said it.

150
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,340
I didn't say anything.

151
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,340
Officer.

152
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,340
Let me think.

153
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,340
Qingpi mentioned...

154
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,340
the mid-term.

155
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,340
Hurry up.

156
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,340
Don't waste time.

157
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,340
Hurry up.

158
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,340
It's your turn.

159
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,340
I'm here.

160
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,340
Big Brother.

161
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,340
Are you free?

162
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,340
Are you free?

163
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,340
I have work,

164
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
but I don't have many girls.

165
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,340
Big Brother.

166
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,340
Do you want to have two more?

167
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,340
The girl from last time...

168
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,340
is really good.

169
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,340
Don't say anything you shouldn't say.

170
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,340
What kind of girl can you touch?

171
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,340
I'm especially giving you a position.

172
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
Hello.

173
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,340
Is there still a delivery at the mid-term?

174
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,340
Mid-term?

175
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,340
Yes.

176
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,340
He said so.

177
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,340
He said it several times.

178
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,340
Where is it?

179
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,340
We haven't been there.

180
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,340
Those girls...

181
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,340
Oh, right.

182
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
Those girls were sent from there.

183
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,340
This mid-term...

184
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,340
should be what the director said before.

185
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,340
These two should be the same.

186
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,340
But when they went there,

187
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,340
they were blindfolded...

188
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
and scared.

189
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,340
They didn't know the details.

190
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,340
Did Lian Qiao know anything...

191
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,340
about the mid-term?

192
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,340
No matter what,

193
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
we have to figure out...

194
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,340
where the mid-term is.

195
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,340
This is very important to them.

196
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,340
It's also important to us.

197
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,340
We can find the missing evidence.

198
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,340
Let's go find Lian Qiao.

199
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,340
No.

200
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,340
Why are you here again?

201
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,340
What do you want?

202
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,340
Don't be agitated.

203
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,340
How can I not be?

204
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,340
You know my child has no food.

205
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,340
She doesn't drink water or talk.

206
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,340
She locked herself up in the house for days!

207
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
What if anything happens to her?

208
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,340
What if she's sick?

209
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,340
We're here to treat her.

210
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,380
You guys check it.

211
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,540
You think you're the boss?

212
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,500
Why are you here?

213
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,020
Hold on.

214
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,140
Let's..

215
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,500
Wait.

216
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,940
It's my first time late tonight.

217
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,900
What happened?

218
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,820
Why is there a türko all in the living room?

219
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,380
Just a shadow,

220
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,540
but not a much difference on the outside.

221
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,900
Why is it best to open itupbeat?

222
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,340
You are here for no reason

223
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,780
Where else can I go except for you?

224
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
How do I know?

225
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,180
Even if I know, I won't tell you

226
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,020
You took him away

227
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,460
Is it just to send him home?

228
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,260
Who said I would send him back?

229
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,700
We have a few important questions now

230
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,540
Need to ask him

231
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,420
Mo Lin, we talked about it before

232
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,100
You should trust us

233
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,580
Just say we are the people's police

234
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,340
Let's make a deal, okay?

235
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,900
I don't believe you

236
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,300
He told me

237
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,580
The police came to find him

238
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,900
Just to send him back

239
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,780
Why are you so stubborn?

240
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,460
Where are you?

241
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,460
I'm just so stubborn

242
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,900
I carried him in, okay?

243
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,060
You guys catch me

244
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,060
You caught me, so you don't need to catch him

245
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,820
Catch me

246
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,980
Catch you?

247
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,900
What are you doing?

248
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,220
Don't walk, come here

249
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:53,940
Don't go up

250
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,180
Put down the knife, Mo Lin

251
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,940
Mo Lin, Mo Lin, calm down

252
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,780
Put down the knife, let's talk

253
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,580
Get out

254
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,420
Mo Lin, put down the knife

255
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,500
Let's talk

256
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,820
Don't be so excited, okay?

257
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,460
I want to hear you, put down the knife

258
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,700
Put down the knife

259
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,820
Mo Lin

260
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,260
Mo Lin

261
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,500
I believe in you

262
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,700
Why do you believe in us?

263
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,980
Because I'm afraid the rescue station won't let me out

264
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,580
I want to see Mo Lin

265
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,460
He can't appear in the recording

266
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,540
Yan Qiao

267
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:53,920
Our вторna정 molt

268
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,580
But is there any special buildings?

269
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,580
Or what kind of scenery have you seen?

270
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,580
I think I have seen some.

271
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,580
But there are mountains there.

272
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,580
Nothing is different from other mountains.

273
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,580
Water sound.

274
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,580
We seem to have passed a small river.

275
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,580
The river is very urgent.

276
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,580
Then we walked not far away.

277
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,580
We arrived at that house.

278
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,580
But in the house, we can still hear the river sound.

279
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,580
Water sound.

280
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,580
Right.

281
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,580
That house is very old.

282
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,580
Unlike the one we see now.

283
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,580
There is nothing else.

284
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,580
Thank you.

285
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,580
Thank you.

286
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,580
Director, you are here.

287
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,580
Come in.

288
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,580
Sit down.

289
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,580
Well.

290
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,580
Yan, I have to congratulate you first.

291
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
What?

292
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,580
Look.

293
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,580
This is not good.

294
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,580
You always talk nonsense.

295
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,580
This is recommended by Director Deng.

296
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,580
He asked for the opinion of all comrades in the investigation team.

297
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,580
Everyone agrees.

298
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
Who will say nonsense?

299
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,580
It's a rule.

300
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,580
I...

301
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,580
I am modest.

302
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,580
This...

303
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,580
Don't be old.

304
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,580
How can I not hear your modesty?

305
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,580
Come.

306
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,580
Okay.

307
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
I will go back to work.

308
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,580
Director Lin, did you find Shen Qiuxiu?

309
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,580
According to the story of Lian Qiao.

310
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,580
Combined with the time he escaped.

311
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,580
And all the information we have.

312
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,580
Basically, we can confirm.

313
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,580
One of the three ancient positions on the banks of the river.

314
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Is the location of the central station.

315
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,580
These three positions are separated by the water.

316
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,580
It's not easy to find.

317
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,580
If we go like this.

318
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,580
Not only waste our energy.

319
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,580
It's also possible to clean up and let them run away.

320
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,580
How about we touch all three places?

321
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,580
How can we touch them all?

322
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,580
You touch them.

323
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,580
Bai Yu Men is right.

324
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,580
You don't waste your energy.

325
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
We need to find the right position.

326
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,580
Hello.

327
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
Liu.

328
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
Did you move to the southern area recently?

329
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
In Ma Ma Town, right?

330
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,580
I found the right place for you.

331
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,580
I have a serious matter.

332
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,580
I want to ask you to help me.

333
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,580
We found a place for a girl.

334
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,580
It's in your suburb.

335
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,580
It should be an abandoned forest station.

336
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,580
Do you have any impression?

337
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,580
I said, don't be too big.

338
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,580
I want a very accurate location.

339
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,580
Please.

340
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,580
I mean, Yin.

341
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,580
Can you sleep?

342
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,580
Last time we came to the provincial council meeting.

343
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,580
We lived in the same room.

344
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,580
You called me all night to find clues.

345
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
I'm half an hour behind you.

346
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,580
It will be better in a while.

347
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,580
Hello.

348
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,580
Okay, you talk slowly.

349
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,580
I'll write it down.

350
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Here.

351
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,580
Hello, Yin.

352
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
Really?

353
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,580
Okay, I got it.

354
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,580
Don't look for it.

355
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,580
Yin has found it.

356
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,580
It's here.

357
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
I'll write it down.

358
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,580
Yin.

359
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
Yin.

360
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,580
Yin.

361
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Yin.

362
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
Yin.

363
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,580
Yin.

364
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,580
Yin.

365
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,580
Yin.

366
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,580
Yin.

367
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,580
Yin.

368
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,580
Yin.

369
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,580
Yin.

370
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,580
Yin.

371
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,580
Yin.

372
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,580
Yin.

373
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,580
Yin.

374
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,580
Yin.

375
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,580
Yin.

376
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,580
Yin.

377
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,580
Yin.

378
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,580
Yin.

379
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,580
Yin.

380
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,580
Yin.

381
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,580
Yin.

382
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,580
Yin.

383
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,580
Yin.

384
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,580
Yin.

385
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,580
Yin.

386
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,580
Yin.

387
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,580
Yin.

388
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,580
Yin.

389
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,580
Yin.

390
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,580
Yin.

391
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
What do you mean?

392
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
Don't look at it.

393
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
I can't.

394
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,580
It's here.

395
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
Come on.

396
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,580
It's here.

397
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
It's here.

398
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
Come on.

399
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,580
Hurry up.

400
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
Hurry up.

401
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,580
Hurry up.

402
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
It's here.

403
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
There is a railway track here.

404
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,580
Just go straight along the railroad track.

405
00:15:49,580 --> 00:16:05,400
待って Lee

406
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,460
and then another terrible thing

407
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,460
Are you afraid?

408
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,460
A little bit.

409
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,460
Then do you believe us?

410
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,460
Thank you for your trust.

411
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,460
We will definitely protect you.

412
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,460
If we are not sure,

413
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,460
we will definitely bring you back safely.

414
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,460
We are leaving.

415
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,460
All of you, get in.

416
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,460
In front.

417
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,460
Be careful.

418
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,460
Be careful.

419
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,460
I've been here.

420
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,460
It's here.

421
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,460
Don't be afraid.

422
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,460
Xu, help him.

423
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
We will go in first.

424
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,460
No, sister.

425
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
Let me go with you.

426
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,460
Can you?

427
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,460
You two stay here and watch the watchtower.

428
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,460
We will go in first.

429
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,460
Go.

430
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,460
We can't get in there.

431
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,460
The map is on the top.

432
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,460
Can we go in?

433
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,460
Brother, are you a forest guard?

434
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,460
What are you doing?

435
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,460
We are hiking.

436
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,460
We are just looking around.

437
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,460
Brother, I want to ask.

438
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,460
If we can't get in here,

439
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
can you tell me if there is a toilet?

440
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,460
There are so many people.

441
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,460
What are you filming?

442
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,460
We can't get in here.

443
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,460
These girls...

444
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,460
What are you doing?

445
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,460
There is no toilet.

446
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,460
Why are you so fierce?

447
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,460
I just want to go in.

448
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
We have been hiking for a long time.

449
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
We want to find a place to rest.

450
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
Do you have one?

451
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,460
There is a rule.

452
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,460
We can't let outsiders rest.

453
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,460
Let's go back.

454
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
We are all old.

455
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,460
Who can know?

456
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,460
How much can we pay?

457
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,460
It's not about money.

458
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,460
There are so many houses.

459
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,460
They are all abandoned.

460
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,460
The toilet is dirty and smelly.

461
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
You can't rest.

462
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
It's okay.

463
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,460
It's not convenient for girls to stay here.

464
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,460
Brother, we won't go in.

465
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,460
Can we sit here for a while?

466
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,460
Okay, let's sit here for a while.

467
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,460
Come on.

468
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
Boss, leave them.

469
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,460
We need to go back.

470
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,460
We are short of money.

471
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,460
No.

472
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,460
We need to buy more goods.

473
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,460
Don't cause trouble.

474
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,460
You should go.

475
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,460
We can make more progress.

476
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,460
Besides, you are not alone.

477
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,460
You brought three girls.

478
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,460
This girl...

479
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,460
Have we met before?

480
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,460
Who?

481
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,460
Me?

482
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,460
Where have you met me?

483
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,460
Brother, you are too old.

484
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,460
Have I met this girl before?

485
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,460
How many years ago?

486
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,460
I just met my wife.

487
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,460
I said the same thing.

488
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
Brother, you are not smart.

489
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,460
What are you doing?

490
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,460
Why are you staring at me?

491
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,460
You are scaring me.

492
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,460
What's wrong?

493
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,460
Let's go.

494
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,460
Stop talking.

495
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,460
Let's go.

496
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,460
Why are you staring at me?

497
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,460
Stop talking.

498
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,460
You are scaring me.

499
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Why are you staring at me?

500
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,460
I have never seen a girl before.

501
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,460
There will be a wedding tonight.

502
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,460
I will go to the wedding hall.

503
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,460
I will go to the wedding hall.

504
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,460
There will be a wedding tonight.

505
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,460
Don't make trouble.

506
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,460
That girl...

507
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,460
She looks strange.

508
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,460
I think so too.

509
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
Are you okay, Lian Qiao?

510
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,460
Sister, I remember them.

511
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,460
It's them.

512
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,460
They locked us in that room.

513
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,460
They didn't let us talk.

514
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,460
They will beat us if we talk.

515
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,460
It's over.

516
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,460
It's all over.

517
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,460
We won't let this happen again.

518
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,460
How about this?

519
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,460
You go back with Mr. Zhan first.

520
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,460
No, I won't go.

521
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,460
Lian Qiao, listen to me.

522
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,460
The wedding will be very dangerous.

523
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,460
We can't guarantee your safety.

524
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,460
We will see you when we are done.

525
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,460
Okay?

526
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
Xu, take care of her.

527
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,460
Inform the chief to prepare for action.

528
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,460
Okay.

529
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,460
This guy left his camera here.

530
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Let me see.

531
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,460
This...

532
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,460
It looks like a new model.

533
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
I think it's not cheap.

534
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,460
Do they have a problem?

535
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
Why did they suddenly come back?

536
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,460
They won't.

537
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,460
If they come back,

538
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,460
they will be in trouble.

539
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,460
I don't think so.

540
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,460
They are not that bad.

541
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,460
They are not that bad.

542
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,460
They are not that bad.

543
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,460
No.

544
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
If they come back,

545
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,460
they will be in trouble.

546
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,460
Just send them the message.

547
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,460
Maybe they will remember the camera

548
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,460
and go down the mountain.

549
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,460
This family looks pretty good.

550
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,460
Isn't she the girl?

551
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,460
She is pretty.

552
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,460
This girl has long legs

553
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,460
and has a lot of blood.

554
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,460
I think she can handle a lot of things.

555
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,460
I must take care of this bull.

556
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,460
Rui Ge, you are well prepared.

557
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,460
Thank you, Jia Jia.

558
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
Let's go.

559
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,460
You two be careful.

560
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,460
Don't delay the night.

561
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,460
I know it's not easy.

562
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,460
No wonder.

563
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,460
I was so fierce just now.

564
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,460
They didn't fight.

565
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,460
They are in trouble tonight.

566
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,460
Dong Ge,

567
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,460
you hid the good wine, didn't you?

568
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,460
Drink some more.

569
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,460
We are going to pick up the goods tonight.

570
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,460
You can't drink.

571
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,460
I've been starving all night.

572
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,460
I'm really hungry.

573
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,460
Okay, we didn't eat anything.

574
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,460
Say a few words and you won't be hungry.

575
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
Here.

576
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,460
Dong Ge,

577
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,460
I heard that

578
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,460
the security guard took them away.

579
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,460
He took them away.

580
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,460
It has nothing to do with us.

581
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,460
Really?

582
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,460
Yes.

583
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,460
Have you been here for half a year?

584
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,460
Have you seen anyone on the other side?

585
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,460
No.

586
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,460
They haven't seen you either.

587
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,460
Even if you want to spit,

588
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,460
you can't spit anything out.

589
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,460
It seems that this line

590
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
is deeper than we thought.

591
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Hello?

592
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,460
I'll change it.

593
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Leave it to me in time.

594
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,460
I'll buy it.

595
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,460
What should we do?

596
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,460
I can't hear you.

597
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
We are all together.

598
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,460
Why is Dong Ge still calling him?

599
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,460
What do you know?

600
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,460
The less you know, the better.

601
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,460
Our security is still high.

602
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,460
What?

603
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,460
That line is also down.

604
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,460
Then let's trade tonight.

605
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,460
What are you going to do?

606
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,460
Okay.

607
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,460
Here, good.

608
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,460
Purple medicine.

609
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,460
Okay.

610
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,460
Chili.

611
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,460
Work, work.

612
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,460
Why hasn't he come yet?

613
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,460
Isn't it the security guard?

614
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,460
Don't worry.

615
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,460
Let's squat a little bit more.

616
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,460
Have some patience.

617
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,460
I squat all day long.

618
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,460
It's a week.

619
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,460
Hurry up.

620
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,460
Go.

621
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
There are four men.

622
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,460
But three women came.

623
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,460
The top said that the wind has been blowing these two days.

624
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,460
Let's catch the wild as soon as possible.

625
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,460
What?

626
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,460
The courage on the top is getting smaller and smaller.

627
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,460
This time it's different.

628
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,460
My mother and I were caught.

629
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,460
The power in the city was also cut off.

630
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,460
Be careful.

631
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,460
Go.

632
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
Go.

633
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,460
Go.

634
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,460
No, Jia Jia.

635
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
I can't hear the sound.

636
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,460
Is there no problem?

637
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,460
Everything is normal.

638
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,460
There will always be a long way to go.

639
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,460
Go.

640
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,460
Go.

641
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,460
Go.

642
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,460
Hurry up.

643
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,460
Go.

644
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,460
Come.

645
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,460
Brother Long.

646
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,460
Be careful.

647
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,460
Brother Long.

648
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,460
Why should we go together?

649
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,460
The top said that it was not too far.

650
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,460
Let's go with this wave.

651
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,460
What about the station?

652
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,460
Why are you talking so much?

653
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,460
Just go.

654
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,460
Jia Jia.

655
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,460
Is the leader of the gang connected?

656
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
No connection.

657
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,460
The light is out.

658
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,460
What are you doing?

659
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,460
We have to wait for reinforcements.

660
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,460
What if you are injured?

661
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,460
Hurry up.

662
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,460
Hurry up.

663
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,460
Go.

664
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,460
Hurry up.

665
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,460
Hurry up.

666
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
Get up.

667
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,460
Get up.

668
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,460
Hurry up.

669
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
I don't know.

670
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,460
Hello, Chief Ge.

671
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,460
Where are you?

672
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,460
The target has now changed direction.

673
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,460
The direction of the southeast direction.

674
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,460
It took about five minutes.

675
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,460
OK.

676
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,460
OK.

677
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,460
OK.

678
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,460
OK.

679
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,460
OK.

680
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,460
OK.

681
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,460
OK.

682
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,460
OK.

683
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
OK.

684
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,460
OK.

685
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,460
OK.

686
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,460
OK.

687
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,460
OK.

688
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,460
OK.

689
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,460
OK.

690
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,460
OK.

691
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,460
Hurry up.

692
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,460
Stop.

693
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,460
Don't move.

694
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,460
Stop.

695
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,460
There is a runaway.

696
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,460
Stop.

697
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,460
Don't move.

698
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,460
Stop.

699
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,460
Don't run.

700
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,460
Don't run.

701
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Stop.

702
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,460
Stop.

703
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,460
Don't run.

704
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,460
Stop.

705
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460
Don't run.

706
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,460
Stop.

707
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,460
Stop.

708
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,460
Stop.

709
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,460
OK.

710
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,460
Be good.

711
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
Go.

712
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
Don't run.

713
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,460
Don't touch me

714
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,460
Stop

715
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
Don't come here

716
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,460
Put down the knife first

717
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,460
Don't come here

718
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,460
Don't move

719
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,460
I didn't move. Put down the knife

720
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,460
We don't have any weapons

721
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
Put down the knife first

722
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,460
We can talk. Calm down

723
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,460
Let me go. I'm a girl

724
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,460
You have no way out

725
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,460
Your head is surrounded

726
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,460
You push that girl over and we let you go

727
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,460
We are the police

728
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,460
It's okay

729
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,460
It's okay

730
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,460
Master

731
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,460
You sit like this for a while

732
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,460
You have to take care of yourself

733
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,460
I'm just a servant

734
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,460
We can finish the job

735
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,460
On the way

736
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,460
Ke Liang seems to have answered a phone

737
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,460
What can he tell me?

738
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,460
Police officer

739
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,460
I'm just a servant

740
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,460
We just got the girl

741
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,460
Then the boss let us go

742
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,460
We just let them go

743
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,460
We can finish our job

744
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,460
We can finish our job

745
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,460
We can finish our job

746
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,460
We can finish our job

747
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,460
We can finish our job

748
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,460
I'll leave after I finish my job

749
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,460
Who is your boss?

750
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,460
I know his name is boss

751
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,460
He contacted me alone

752
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,460
I'm a guard

753
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,460
I provide a place to rest

754
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,460
I earn some money

755
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,460
You said you were a salesman

756
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
I didn't participate

757
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,460
I'm a salesman

758
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,460
I earn money

759
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,460
You know what is sales?

760
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,460
You are involved in the mid-term

761
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,460
It's also a salesman

762
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,460
Why are you running?

763
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,460
What are you worried about?

764
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,460
You are not going to take over the hostage

765
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,460
That spirit

766
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,460
Is it you use to specifically

767
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,460
Close people?

768
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,460
Can't close people

769
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,460
Li Danong

770
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,460
The second largest criminal law

771
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,460
Chinese People's Congress

772
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,460
Rule 240

773
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,460
Threatening a daughter to rape is more than three people

774
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,460
Highest orders can be changer

775
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,460
Don't remind you

776
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,460
But we're helping you

777
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460
Your students

778
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,460
They made it

779
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,460
If you don't confess

780
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,460
optimal

781
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,460
We can't

782
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,480
See how advances

783
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,200
I know your rules

784
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,460
Otherwise

785
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,960
Are good people

786
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Right?

787
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
But you really think we are jealous?

788
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
If you don't say it, we can't solve this case.

789
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
You guys...

790
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Can you really help us?

791
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Let's see how much you can take.

792
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
I'll say it.

793
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
I'll say it all.

794
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
Who is the person who said it?

795
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
Ke Liang.

796
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Aibai.

797
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
Brother Zhao.

798
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Just the few of them.

799
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Who arranged it?

800
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
It's a man.

801
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,960
It seems to be called Brother Fei.

802
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,960
But he always comes to drive us out.

803
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
I didn't see what he looked like.

804
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Oh, right.

805
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,960
There was a time when there were many people.

806
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
It seems that there was their boss.

807
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
It's...

808
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
It's a cripple.

809
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
What did you say the cripple looked like?

810
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
I can't see clearly.

811
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
I don't have a chance to get in.

812
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
I can't hear anything.

813
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
I'm always being chased out.

814
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
I really don't know.

815
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
I didn't see it clearly.

816
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Have you ever met them?

817
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
I can't hear.

818
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,960
There are some old people.

819
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
What does it have to do with them?

820
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,960
They are responsible for picking up people.

821
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,960
I heard that a few years ago,

822
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,960
the pretty ones were all picked up by the cripple.

823
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,960
The cripple looked ugly.

824
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
He was sent to the countryside by the old man.

825
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
He sold it to someone else as a wife.

826
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Is there a reason?

827
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
They called me.

828
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
They used the public phone in different places.

829
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
They couldn't get back.

830
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,960
We'll find out if we can get back, right?

831
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,960
And then I'm back...

832
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Director Deng, you OK?

833
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,080
screen

834
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,320
screen

835
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,120
oh

836
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:28,880
The student

837
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,840
Attorney Sun

838
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,520
Aunt fossil

839
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,200
have some

840
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,720
Thank you

841
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,680
uncle

842
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,240
I'm thinking of changing the material of our small house

843
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,520
Change it all

844
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,880
Then it's solidified

845
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,680
Then tear this pillar apart

846
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,400
In this case, at least two tables can be put down

847
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
Can put two more tables

848
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,560
Yes

849
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,000
Great

850
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,440
Mr. Sun, thank you so much

851
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,200
You're welcome

852
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,160
Draw it first

853
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,240
That Mr. Sun

854
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,720
I have another idea

855
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,880
I want to trouble you to see if you can

856
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,880
Can you make another room in my place?

857
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,560
Room

858
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,080
Not a dining room

859
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,120
It's the one that can live

860
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,800
You mean the room

861
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,600
Yes, yes, yes

862
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,240
See if you can make another small room

863
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,120
It's like this

864
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,080
These children

865
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,920
Many of them came from outside the house

866
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,560
He came here to find the children

867
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,360
If he can temporarily stay here

868
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,080
So they can save some money

869
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,600
You know, it's not easy to find a child

870
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,520
The conditions of the family are not very good

871
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,320
We can help a little bit

872
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,600
Do you think it's okay?

873
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,680
Aunt Zhang, it's too small

874
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,520
You think too much

875
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,320
Let me see

876
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,360
I

877
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,160
Then you see if you can

878
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,920
This is the kitchen

879
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,680
Open it

880
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,240
Make a large storage room inside

881
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,520
Put things below

882
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,000
Put a bed above

883
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,360
Isn't that good?

884
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,600
OK

885
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,520
You are so nice

886
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,720
This brother

887
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,200
We were wanted many years ago

888
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,160
But then

889
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,920
He disappeared

890
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,600
He hasn't appeared for years

891
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,480
This old yellow dog

892
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,080
Also an old man

893
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Should be called Huang Chuan

894
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,440
We analyzed at the time

895
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,040
He and Hong Yi are on the same path

896
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,680
It seems that

897
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,040
Everything is clearer

898
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,880
This general skin injury

899
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,480
Is led by Brother Que

900
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,280
Divided into one-third of the skin and yellow川

901
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,200
One is responsible for forcing girls to sell yin

902
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,040
One is responsible for deceiving women and children

903
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,480
This brother

904
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,160
Hiding behind the skin and yellow川

905
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,120
So many years

906
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,960
Raised so many children

907
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,440
Not only forcing girls to sell yin

908
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,480
And deceiving women and children

909
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,920
So simple

910
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,600
I guess

911
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,320
He should have a bigger goal

912
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,080
Director Deng has a good analysis

913
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
This brother

914
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,880
It can't be so simple

915
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,720
Now we are right about the direction of investigation

916
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,240
As long as we can catch this young man

917
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,120
And Hong Yi

918
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,240
Maybe

919
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,480
Can find this legendary brother

920
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,600
Can know

921
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,400
The real problem behind them

922
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,600
But this Hong Yi

923
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,840
Disappeared without a trace

924
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,600
This Huang Chuan

925
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,280
I don't know where he is

926
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,240
So now we

927
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,320
He forced girls to sell yin

928
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,040
Next

929
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,800
The old Qin Zhi'an's team asked the whole city

930
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,240
To increase the power of cleaning the yellow

931
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,600
We can get them out

932
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,840
Go go go

933
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,200
Director Li, over there

934
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,000
Go

935
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,560
Police, lock the door

936
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,520
Lock the door

937
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,920
Come down

938
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,720
Police

939
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,320
Get off

940
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,720
Squat down

941
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,440
Hurry

942
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,760
Squat down

943
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,200
Director, we have a situation

944
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,680
This is the news from the Niu Pan Tang police

945
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,560
Said it was found by a ranger

946
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,320
Really

947
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,760
He is too shy to call the police

948
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,880
He was arrested

949
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,400
Said it was a prostitute

950
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,600
In the process of prostitution

951
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,080
Go, go to Niu Pan Tang

952
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,600
Yes

953
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,480
Yes

954
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,680
That note

955
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,600
I handed it to the police

956
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,760
I was ignorant before

957
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,720
Blind

958
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,920
Made mistakes

959
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,600
After your police education

960
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,200
I have changed my mind now

961
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,680
I

962
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,640
Who gave you

963
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,360
Just

964
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,360
I was just going to wash my feet

965
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,120
Isn't this also for health?

966
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,760
Right

967
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,720
I am

968
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,560
The biggest problem is softness

969
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,840
This poor person

970
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,560
I ask you

971
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,760
Who gave you the note

972
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,640
I don't know

973
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,760
Who gave you the note

974
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,440
Where is it?

975
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,680
Yes

976
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,640
Yes

977
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,760
I will explain

978
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,880
I will explain

979
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,480
That is

980
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,200
Half a month ago

981
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,720
Boss, enjoy it

982
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,240
Sister

983
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,000
How old are you?

984
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,880
Pretty

985
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,880
OK, brother Feifei

986
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,240
What are you crying for?

987
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,120
I didn't think you were not good at service

988
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,160
Really

989
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,880
Forget it

990
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:38,800
Come on

991
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,040
This

992
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,120
This money

993
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,640
You take it

994
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,960
Really

995
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,120
Brother Feifei

996
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,440
What are you doing here?

997
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,120
Brother Feifei

998
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,840
Brother Feifei

999
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,560
Brother Feifei

1000
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,120
Brother Feifei

1001
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,760
Brother Feifei

1002
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,480
Brother Feifei

1003
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,920
Brave person

1004
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,120
What kind of identity

1005
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,720
What does not change is the sincerity in the heart

1006
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,080
Finally became such a person

1007
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:52,800
Every number is not clear

1008
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,200
Love publically

1009
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,200
For술

1010
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,560
Hulke

1011
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,840
I need to be governed

1012
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,920
E ft

1013
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,440
I would leave

1014
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,640
One morning

1015
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,640
Thank you

1016
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,200
Never

1017
00:44:51,200 --> 00:45:00,200
Holding on to the years, it will never be deep

1018
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,200
Just like my heart, it will never be deep

1019
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:16,200
Just like my blue heart, it will never be deep

1020
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,200
Just like my blue heart, it will never be deep
