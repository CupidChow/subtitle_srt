When Ranran comes back,

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,280
I'll still be in my right mind.

Yanyan.

6
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:21,133
I'm also doing this for my own good.

7
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,680
It's alright. You can still...

8
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,599
bring me back here.

9
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,840
(You're being shortsighted.)

10
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,288
(If something had happened,)

11
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,866
(you wouldn't even know how you died.)

12
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,520
(Your life isn't worth much.)

13
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,039
(I can't protect you, get that?)

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,420
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

15
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:05,879
Director Deng,

16
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,159
Tong Xiaoling's parents
left the guesthouse.

17
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,719
Why?

18
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,879
I'm not sure either.

19
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:13,000
The staff said they left
early this morning.

20
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,311
They didn't even have breakfast.

21
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,319
Go find them.

22
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:15,680
Got it.

23
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,160
When we passed by earlier,

24
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,639
there was a restaurant over there
hiring dishwashers.

25
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,959
Go try it tomorrow.

26
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:46,770
I'll go check out
construction sites tomorrow

27
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,888
and see if I can get a job.

28
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:48,750
Sounds good.

29
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,759
They provide meals.

30
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,000
I forgot to get hot water

31
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,480
when we left the guesthouse.

32
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:19,822
Feeling better now?

33
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,800
Mr. Tong, Ms. Shao,

34
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,480
it's really you.

35
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,680
What are you doing here?

36
00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:27,950
We've been looking for you all day.

37
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,759
We were so worried.

38
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,199
Officers,

39
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,040
why are you here?

40
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:32,780
Is there any news about Xiaoling?

41
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,199
Not yet.

42
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,519
Why didn't you

43
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,360
stay in the guesthouse?

44
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,870
We didn't want to trouble
the government.

45
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,800
We're able-bodied.

46
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,266
We can still earn our keep.

47
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:46,822
Where are you going to sleep tonight?

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,680
Here.

49
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,879
It can keep the wind and rain out.

50
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,439
That's not okay.

51
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,600
Mr. Tong, Ms. Shao,

52
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,240
I know a place

53
00:05:58,466 --> 00:05:59,711
that provides meals and lodging.

54
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,759
Besides,

55
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,920
it's better than this place.

56
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,422
It's just that you need
to look after an elderly person.

57
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,688
Would that be okay?

58
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,399
Of course.

59
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,680
We've troubled you again, Officers.

60
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:13,155
It's no trouble.
I'll go make arrangements.

61
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Mr. Tong, Ms. Shao,

62
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,600
were you really planning to stay here?

63
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
It's damp

64
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,720
and has no shelter.

65
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,319
It's alright.

66
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,839
We're used to it.

67
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,959
But seeing this breaks our hearts.

68
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:41,839
Yan Lei.

69
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,120
Director Deng,

70
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,040
we've found them.

71
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,759
They were afraid

72
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,240
to be a burden to us,

73
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:49,800
so they planned to stay under a bridge.

74
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:51,488
I'd like to send them
to Tuanyuan Restaurant.

75
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,160
It'll solve their food
and shelter needs,

76
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,790
and they can help
look after Madam Zhang.

77
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,560
That sounds great.

78
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,439
Take them there.

79
00:06:59,439 --> 00:06:59,839
Okay.

80
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:01,800
I'll take them there first.

81
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,444
Don't worry.

82
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,380
(Tianhai Lucky)

83
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,439
Careful.

84
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:28,555
Please come again.

85
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,720
I compared

86
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,069
the video of Kui's kidnapper

87
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,130
with the one showing Zhen Ni
walking toward a jeep.

88
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,310
Their pace matches.

89
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,790
That suggests they're the same person.

90
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,360
Very well.

91
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,759
This is a major discovery.

92
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,759
There's more.

93
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,879
Zhen Ni,

94
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,279
32 years old. She runs a yoga studio

95
00:08:27,377 --> 00:08:29,239
and also Mixin International
Labor Company

96
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,200
as its legal representative
and general manager.

97
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,030
She earns a lot.

98
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,519
She owns a fully paid apartment
in Tianhai Haoting,

99
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,720
valued at around 500,000.

100
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,600
She carries luxury bags,

101
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,679
wears designer jewelry,

102
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,039
and drives a fancy car.

103
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,440
However,

104
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,000
when we looked into her identity,

105
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,200
we discovered it was fake.

106
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,120
The real Zhen Ni

107
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,840
(Emigrated)
emigrated with her family

108
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:50,840
back in 1995.

109
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,279
This Zhen Ni

110
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,639
resembles the photo

111
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,866
on the household registry.

112
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,799
She found someone

113
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:00,120
with a similar face,

114
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,080
and that person

115
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,399
had moved overseas,

116
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:03,444
which made it easier

117
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:04,440
to assume her identity.

118
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,644
Don't you think
that's too much of a coincidence?

119
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:11,111
What if she had plastic surgery?

120
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,960
To assume

121
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,679
the real Zhen Ni's identity,

122
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,519
she changed her appearance

123
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,480
and impersonated her,

124
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,519
so she could start a new life

125
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,559
using her face.

126
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,080
Chang Rui,

127
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:25,955
your theory makes a lot of sense.

128
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,519
Follow up on the plastic surgery lead.

129
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,639
Yes, Sir.

130
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,869
We'll reach out
to major cosmetic surgery clinics

131
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,044
and see if there are any records
of this fake Zhen Ni.

132
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,960
The clue about Zhen Ni

133
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:37,266
could be really valuable.

134
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,000
Any other progress?

135
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,440
Yes, Tianhai Lucky.

136
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,480
Several recent cases are linked to it.

137
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,200
The owner is named Liu Gang.

138
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,279
He also appeared

139
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,799
in that group photo Wai swallowed.

140
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,240
So clearly there's something

141
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,360
going on between them.

142
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,960
I think we should put Liu Gang
under surveillance now.

143
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,559
Okay.

144
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,879
The Anti-abduction Office
will handle this.

145
00:09:58,044 --> 00:09:59,466
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

146
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,620
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

(Medical Cosmetic Records)

148

(Case File)

149
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:14,759
Guys,

150
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,960
I found something.

151
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:17,666
Xin, take a look.

152
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,360
This is

153
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,000
Zhen Ni's cosmetic medical record

154
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,840
from 1996,

155
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,422
and a photo of her
before surgery.

156
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,799
This photo

157
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,879
was provided by Wan Guizhi's parents

158
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,399
when they reported her missing

159
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,480
on March 2, 1995.

160
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,840
Take a look.

161
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,039
What do you see?

162
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,120
They look so alike.

163
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,679
So,

164
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,480
it's highly likely

165
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,440
that Zhen Ni is actually Wan Guizhi.

166
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,080
I remember back then,

167
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,320
when we were assigned
to a joint investigation,

168
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,510
Deputy Director Yin
specifically flagged this girl.

169
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,822
We searched for years,

170
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:03,960
but couldn't find her.

171
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,799
So the case was left open.

172
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,240
Wan Guizhi was 16
when she was abducted.

173
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,960
Almost an adult.

174
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,120
She would still have
some memory of home.

175
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:14,622
At that time, Deputy Director Yin
proposed two possibilities.

176
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:15,440
Either

177
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,679
she was dead,

178
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,360
or she didn't want to go home

179
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,559
or she couldn't go home.

180
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,720
So,

181
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,919
maybe Wan Guizhi

182
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,960
never left Linshan.

183
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,000
Do you remember

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,777
when Wan Guizhi's mother came
a while ago?

185
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,200
That old lady kept saying

186
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,279
she had seen her daughter.

187
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,080
We thought that couldn't be possible.

188
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:33,400
Deputy Director Yin,

189
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:34,840
I really saw Guizhi.

190
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,759
You have to believe me.

191
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,919
I believe you.

192
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,919
Where did you see Guizhi?

193
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,960
Near the Yimei Shopping Mall.

194
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,840
She was wearing a floral dress.

195
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,919
I'm sure this time.

196
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,200
It was her.

197
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,879
So the person her mother saw

198
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,320
could very well have been Zhen Ni.

199
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,320
If

200
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,519
Zhen Ni really is Wan Guizhi,

201
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,399
then she went from a victim

202
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,320
to a criminal suspect.

203
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:01,711
What on earth happened

204
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,759
in between?

205
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,480
Think about it.

206
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,510
Zhen Ni owns a car, a house,
and a company now.

207
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:10,200
She seems
to be doing pretty well, right?

208
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,600
Wan Guizhi was 16 when she was abducted.

209
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:15,240
There's every reason for a naive girl
who just left a remote village

210
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,799
to be blinded by the bright lights.

211
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,480
The photos do look alike.

212
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,679
But

213
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,279
this can't prove
that Zhen Ni is Wan Guizhi.

214
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,120
We need solid proof

215
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:33,440
before making a conclusion.

216
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,279
Didn't we collect

217
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,279
her parents' DNA samples?

218
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:40,440
As long as we can get a DNA sample
from Zhen Ni,

219
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,360
we'll be able to find out.

220
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,488
I'd like to request
to go along for that.

221
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,519
Well,

222
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,240
who goes and how we do it,

223
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,279
we'll need to report
to Director Deng first.

224
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,000
Alright, then.

225
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,399
No matter when

226
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,200
or who's going,

227
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:54,577
I want to come along.

228
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,519
I want to learn.

229
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,240
Okay.

230
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:57,466
Here's what we'll do.

231
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:59,670
I'll report what we discussed today

232
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,039
to Director Deng.

233
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,159
Once there's any progress or update,

234
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,200
we'll discuss it later.

235
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,799
Okay?

236
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,200
Okay.

237
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,919
Thank you, Xin.

238
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,690
(Keep a close eye on Zhen Ni.)

239
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,240
(Get ready to collect her DNA sample.)

240
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,039
(Yes.)

241
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,559
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

242
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,080
Chief Xiao, we really have to thank

243
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,720
the woman who was abducted, Ruan Meiyu.

244
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
She was incredibly smart.

245
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,919
Besides, I contacted the local police.

246
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,150
They successfully rescued
twenty abducted women.

247
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,080
Five of them are injured

248
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,639
and need treatment there,

249
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,600
and for the rest,

250
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,933
arrangements have been made
to send them back to China.

251
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,799
We also have an informant.

252
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,679
They tipped us off

253
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,000
that the ringleader is called Tai.

254
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,960
I suspect he's a fugitive

255
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,399
who escaped abroad.

256
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,600
The informant took a photo of Tai.

257
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,400
Go and identify him right away.

258
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,200
Fei's real name is Fei Yan.

259
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,640
(Fei Yan)
After Fei Yan dropped off Skinner in Hongxi City,

260
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:40,969
he flew straight to Qinmang.

261
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,711
(Youwo International Airlines,
Name: Fei Yan)

262
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:48,355
Chief Xiao, Captain Han,

263
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:49,080
as matters stand,

264
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,822
Cripple has changed
his trafficking method.

265
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:53,080
He used Zhen Ni to
legally recruit workers here

266
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,639
and smuggle these girls abroad
to Fei Yan,

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,240
who holds them captive
and forces them into prostitution.

268
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,240
News of this rescue operation in Qinmang

269
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,279
will definitely reach Linshan.

270
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,759
Zhen Ni will try to run.

271
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,120
Get a trace on this person.

272
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,440
Alright, I'm on it.

273
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,960

Hello.

277
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,519
The subscriber you've dialed
is currently unavailable.

278
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,919
(Recently, the Linshan Police Bureau
Anti-abduction Office)

279
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,279
(cracked
a cross-border trafficking ring,)

280
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,320
(rescuing twenty young women.)

281
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,440
(They arrived safely in Linshan
earlier today.)

282
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,120
Keep it down.

283
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:23,955
Madam Zhang is taking a nap.

284
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:24,759
Alright.

285
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,222
Mr. Tong, Ms. Shao,

286
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,888
we've brought Tong Xiaoling back.

287
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,039
Xiaoling!

288
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,159
Ling.

289
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:43,919
Xiaoling.

290
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,759
Mom.

291
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,360
- Xiaoling.
- Ling.

292
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,559
Where were you?

293
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,600
We were worried sick.

294
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,920
Officers, thank you so much.

295
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,599
Thank you so much.

296
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,319
Thank you for bringing my daughter home.

297
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,599
It's what we should do.

298
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,519
You're all good people.

299
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,680
If Ling hadn't made it back,

300
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,680
I don't know how we'd carry on.

301
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,720
Thank you so much.

302
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,519
You've saved our family.

303
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,960
No need to thank us.

304
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,279
We'll leave you

305
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,240
to your reunion.

306
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,319
Reach out to us if anything comes up.

307
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,480
Sure. Thank you.

308
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,000
We'll be going.

309
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,240
Mom, Dad.

310
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,400
Come and sit down.

311
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,039
Madam Zhang.

312
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,519
Have you eaten?

313
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,519
Madam Zhang.

314
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:50,044
- You're here.
- Madam Zhang.

315
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,519
What happened?

316
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,480
Did anyone bully you?

317
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,759
I'm back.

318
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:57,270
Yes, you're back.

319
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,880
That's good.

320
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,400
Don't cry.

321
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,200
There, there.

322
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,400
Don't cry.

323
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,600
- You're back.
- Madam Zhang.

324
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,079
My daughter's back.

325
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,920
Come here, Ling.

326
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,440
Your daughter's back?

327
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,640
Hello, Madam Zhang.

328
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,839
It's good you're back.

329
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:15,599
It's good.

330
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,200
Sit down. Come.

331
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,039
Meilian,

332
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,839
make them some noodles.

333
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,079
Come on and sit down.

334
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:24,920
Sit.

335
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,160
It's so good you're home.

336
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,711
Meiyu,

337
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,970
make a bowl of vegetarian noodles
for everyone.

338
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,559
Liu,

339
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,920
how have you been?

340
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,480
Listen,

341
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,960
you have to listen to your parents

342
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,039
and don't wander around outside.

343
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,440
There are a lot of bad people out there.

344
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,480
Madam Zhang,

345
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,720
my daughter's back.

346
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,200
Ranran will be home soon, too.

347
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,079
You know,

348
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,559
as long as
the Tuanyuan Restaurant is here,

349
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,240
Ranran will definitely make it back.

350
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,440
Hello?

351
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,160
The DNA results are out?

352
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:31,720
Okay. Thank you.

353
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,789
The results are out.

354
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,711
Zhen Ni is confirmed to be Wan Guizhi.

355
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,880
Zhen Ni's really something.

356
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,070
She thought of plastic surgery
that early.

357
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,480
I think that must've been
Cripple's idea.

358
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:47,822
Zhen Ni was still young back then.

359
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:49,530
How would she come up
with something like that?

360
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,319
If that's the case,

361
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,069
if we catch Zhen Ni,

362
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,490
we might be able to get to Cripple.

363
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,279
But

364
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,880
she's the closest one to Cripple.

365
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,119
Getting her to talk

366
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,599
will be tough.

367
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,400
We'd better interrogate her now.

368
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,920
What if Cripple escapes?

369
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:08,799
Feng,

370
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:11,200
has Director Deng seemed anxious
these days?

371
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,880
No.

372
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,480
She's been calm.

373
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,079
If she's not anxious,

374
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,640
it means she has a plan.

375
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:04,960
Hello?

376
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:08,066
You've probably heard
what happened in Qingming.

377
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,880
It was my people's fault.

378
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,920
They got tricked by a wrench.

379
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,400
I told you

380
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,279
to put the labor business on hold.

381
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,480
I think the problem wasn't your people.

382
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,200
You've just lost your mind over money.

383
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,440
Yes, it's all my fault.

384
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,480
I'm to blame.

385
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,839
I'll fix it.

386
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:31,640
Foolish.

387
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,309
At this point,

388
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,266
what's left to fix?

389
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,319
You'd better run

390
00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:37,790
before the cops lock onto you.

391
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,640
Yes, okay.

392
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,039
The thing is...

393
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,920
All my savings from these years

394
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,644
are in your hands.

395
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,799
If I run now,

396
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,680
I only have a bit of emergency cash.

397
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,519
Shouldn't you

398
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,977
wire me my share?

399
00:21:58,177 --> 00:21:59,440
Value money more than your life?

400
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,288
I'll have someone meet you
at the border.

401
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:02,711
Find your own way out of here.

402
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,640
If I get caught,

403
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,720
you won't get away either.

404
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,000
Name.

405
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:47,880
Zhen Ni.

406
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,279
You used the name
of an overseas labor company

407
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:52,640
to traffic young women

408
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,799
and force them
into prostitution overseas.

409
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,319
Was that you?

410
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:00,799
Yes.

411
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,559
It was me.

412
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
You used Ding Shuncheng to abduct Kui

413
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,880
and hand her over to Fu Haochen.

414
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,559
That was also you?

415
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,240
Yes.

416
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,799
Every case I mentioned just now

417
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,480
was done by you alone?

418
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,559
Yes, I did it all myself.

419
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,640
And the girl with the heart condition.

420
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,440
I hired Zhou Hongcai for that.

421
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,680
Officers,

422
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,960
I've told you

423
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,839
everything.

424
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,680
You can give me a paper and a pen.

425
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,440
I'll write it down.

426
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,279
Taking all the blame

427
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,200
won't do you any good.

428
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:59,311
What's your relationship with Liu Gang?

429
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:17,440
Wan Guizhi.

430
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,279
You're not Zhen Ni.

431
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,960
Your real name is Wan Guizhi.

432
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,319
We also found out

433
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,319
that you were abducted 14 years ago.

434
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,039
By Cripple.

435
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,119
Can you help us identify him?

436
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,559
I'm not Wan Guizhi,

437
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:56,720
and I don't know
who you're talking about.

438
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,279
It's always

439
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,400
just been me.

440
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,309
These 14 years,

441
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,088
we don't know what you've been through,

442
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,039
but we hope you'll cooperate with us

443
00:25:13,066 --> 00:25:14,488
and tell us the truth.

444
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,200
Officer.

445
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,200
Sentence me as you please.

446
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,960
I admit everything.

447
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,640
From the visit Jiajia made

448
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,279
with Wan Guizhi's family,

449
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,279
her parents have always wanted her back.

450
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,920
So I just don't get it.

451
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,559
She was never physically restrained.

452
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,319
Why didn't she ever try

453
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,119
to go home?

454
00:25:49,244 --> 00:25:51,422
Is it possible
she just didn't want to go home?

455
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,880
Think about it.

456
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,200
Wan Guizhi

457
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,933
spent the most time with Liu Gang.

458
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,000
They completely trust each other.

459
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,400
I suspect

460
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,599
Wan Guizhi might
be mentally manipulated

461
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,680
by Liu Gang.

462
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,079
If that's the case,

463
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,200
it's going to be tough.

464
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,359
Could it be

465
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,319
that Wan Guizhi

466
00:26:28,777 --> 00:26:31,111
doesn't know her parents
have been looking for her?

467
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,160
All these years,

468
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,000
Liu Gang has brainwashed her

469
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,319
into believing she was abandoned.

470
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,319
Over time,

471
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,160
she would've become dependent on him.

472
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,599
So the key now is

473
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,559
how to expose Liu Gang's lie.

474
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,022
Did you collect the money
I asked you to chase up last time?

475
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,319
Gang,

476
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,350
those were all signed
under strict contracts.

477
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,240
They're not due yet.

478
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:06,577
I can't get the money back.

479
00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:07,177
You!

480
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,359
Can't you figure something out?

481
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,266
Losing a bit of interest is fine.

482
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:14,519
Gang,

483
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,640
those people are tough.

484
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,180
I really can't get anything out of them.

485
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:20,920
But Wang said he could lend you 20,000
from his own pocket.

486
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,222
Ridiculous!

487
00:27:22,488 --> 00:27:23,830
Brushing me off like a beggar?

488
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,799
Scram!

489
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:47,519
Hello?

490
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:49,844
You haven't made your move yet?

491
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,240
Everything is ready.

492
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,559
Right away.

493
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:55,730
Waiting for the cops
to come pick you up or what?

494
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:56,266
No.

495
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,119
Don't get mad.

496
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,789
I'm ready to go,

497
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,960
but the person meeting me
needs a bit more time to prepare.

498
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,359
I'm leaving right away.

499
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,440
I work my arse off for you.

500
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,800
Why keep breathing down my neck?

501
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,039
I've told you everything I know.

502
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:05,155
You can sentence me however you want.

503
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,839
Stop wasting your time on me.

504
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:10,444
Even though you wouldn't admit it,

505
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,640
your DNA

506
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,559
matches the DNA

507
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:17,066
we obtained from Wan Guizhi back then.

508
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,400
You are Wan Guizhi.

509
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,440
All these years,

510
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,119
how come it never crossed your mind

511
00:29:26,644 --> 00:29:27,688
to go home?

512
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,079
I don't have a home.

513
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,799
My parents abandoned me.

514
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,920
Take a look at this.

515
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,733
(This is the house.)

516
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,079
We visited your home recently

517
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,160
and filmed this.

518
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,079
(Madam Li,)

519
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,359
(I'm here.)

520
00:29:55,555 --> 00:29:56,844
(You're here, Officer Zhang.)

521
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,240
(Hello.)

522
00:30:02,822 --> 00:30:03,933
(Officer Zhang,)

523
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,359
(have you found my Zhi?)

524
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,269
(Madam Li, here's the thing.)

525
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,666
(We haven't confirmed anything yet.)

526
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,279
(It's just a routine visit.)

527
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:12,519
(Wan.)

528
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,359
(Wan.)

529
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,240
(Wan.)

530
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:19,640
(Wan.)

531
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
(Is Zhi back?)

532
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:26,519
(She'll be home soon.)

533
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,359
(Officer Zhang,)

534
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,880
(I'm begging you.)

535
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,799
(Please find Zhi soon.)

536
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,640
(Look at her father.)

537
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,440
(It's been over ten years.)

538
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,319
How could it be?

539
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,000
All these years,

540
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,030
they've been looking for you.

541
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,720
As you saw,

542
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,720
your bedridden father
still hasn't forgotten you.

543
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,777
This can't be true.

544
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,119
He told me

545
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,640
my parents

546
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,759
sold me to him.

547
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,222
It was he who gave me a new life.

548
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,200
I only survived because of him.

549
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
The truth is clear.

550
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:18,133
He lied to you.

551
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,079
To manipulate you

552
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:22,799
and use you,

553
00:31:25,755 --> 00:31:26,640
he lied.

554
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,839
How could it be?

555
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,160
Just how?

556
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,519
He fooled me.

557
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,119
He fooled me...

558
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,200
I did so much for him.

559
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,039
All these years,

560
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,440
he's been lying to me.

561
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,160
Wan Guizhi.

562
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,155
We truly sympathize

563
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:07,377
with what you and your family

564
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:10,066
have been through.

565
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,519
I did so much for him.

566
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,270
He's been lying to me

567
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
all these years.

568
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,400
But Wan Guizhi,

569
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,319
there are many others

570
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,519
like you.

571
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,759
They're still living in the dark.

572
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,039
So we hope

573
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,799
you'll work with us

574
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:37,400
and tell us the truth.

575
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,559
The man who's been lying to you...

576
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:52,777
Was he the one who abducted you?

577
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,640
Was Cripple the one who took you

578
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,079
Liu Gang?

579
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,119
It was him.

580
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,640
It was him.

581
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,519
(Gang,)

582
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,079
(I can't reach Zhen Ni.)

583
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:57,839
San.

584
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,119
I need a favor.

585
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,319
The cops are onto me.

586
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:08,955
You have to find a way to get me out.

587
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,360
My little chubby baby,

588
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,840
doesn't this little lamb look like you?

589
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,000
All chubby and soft, right?

590
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,519
Right?

591
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,320
Mr. Wu's here, Zilin.

592
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:22,679
Ms. Fang.

593
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,360
You're here.

594
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:25,133
I need to trouble you for a signature.

595
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,440
Oh, how is it trouble for me?

596
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm always the one troubling you.

597
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,320
Why are you bringing so many toys again?

598
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,119
I told you

599
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:33,800
you're going to spoil the kid.

600
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,039
Don't do this again.

601
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:35,920
Alright.

602
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,960
What's wrong, Qian?

603
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,599
Look, Goddad's here.

604
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,666
Do you like them?

605
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:44,444
Look at these.

606
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,239
Do you miss me?

607
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,360
What's wrong?

608
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:50,679
Come.

609
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,088
Let me hold you.

610
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,711
Come here.

611
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,760
Let me hold you. Good.

612
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,559
Thank you so much

613
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,920
for making the trip
to send the documents over.

614
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,079
It's nothing.

615
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,119
You see,

616
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:02,639
since Qian came,

617
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,933
have you really decided
to work from home, haven't you?

618
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,000
It's because

619
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,559
Xiuming and I both trust you.

620
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,079
Right, Qian?

621
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,400
Besides,

622
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,360
with such a cute little baby at home,

623
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,333
how could I bear to leave her
with a housekeeper?

624
00:35:14,377 --> 00:35:14,866
Right?

625
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,159
Right.

626
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:17,840
If I had a daughter like Qian,

627
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:19,288
I'd be working from home every day.

628
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,400
Why haven't you thought about

629
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,280
settling down?

630
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,460
When are you going to
bring a girlfriend over

631
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:26,155
for us to meet?

632
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,559
I'm not rushing it.

633
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,559
Daddy.

634
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:33,199
It's Goddad.

635
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,360
Goddad.

636
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,679
Good girl.

637
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,920
Your daddy is upstairs.

638
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,880
- Wu.
- He's not Daddy.

639
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,000
Mr. Ye.

640
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:41,960
You're here.

641
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,440
You bought so many toys for Qian again.

642
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:45,960
No wonder she's so close to you

643
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:47,266
and even calls you "Daddy".

644
00:35:48,377 --> 00:35:50,577
Can you come down
and spend some time with your girl?

645
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:51,960
If you keep this up,

646
00:35:52,022 --> 00:35:53,800
she's going to be closer to
everyone but you.

647
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,840
Come on. Get down here.

648
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:56,800
Let me finish these files.

649
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,022
Let's talk after that.

650
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,159
Look at him.

651
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,519
Mr. Ye's busy.

652
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:06,600
Let's ignore Daddy.
We're not talking to him.

653
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,360
Come.

654
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,679
It's about time.

655
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:11,599
Shouldn't we go to bed now?

656
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,039
Madam.

657
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,960
Take her to bed.

658
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:18,000
Qian.

659
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:19,599
Alright.

660
00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:20,900
She's such a good girl.

661
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,733
Say bye-bye to Goddad.

662
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:24,679
Bye-bye.

663
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,000
I didn't know you were so fond of kids.

664
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,880
Next time,

665
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,760
just have your assistant
send the document.

666
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,222
You don't have to come here yourself.

667
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,679
No, I just wanted to see Qian.

668
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:37,630
Well, I'll head back, then.

669
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,670
Let Mr. Ye know I won't wait for him.

670
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,360
Sure, no problem.

671
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,488
Alright, then.

672
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,320
Bye.

673
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,360
(I'm at the back door.
The car is ready.)

674
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,580
(Tianhai Lucky Entertainment Center,
Cripple, Wan Guizhi)

675
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,400
Director Deng.

676
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,920
How's it going?

677
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,911
Captain Han approved
the arrest of Liu Gang.

678
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,880
We should move out now.

679
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:58,559
Got it.

680
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,000
Let's check over there.

681
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,719
Li.

682
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,000
Rui, Liu Gang ran off.

683
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:19,960
Hello, Rui.

684
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,400
We checked the CCTV.

685
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,679
Two cars left this place.

686
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,039
One's black SUV,

687
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:26,679
plate number South C45860.

688
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,440
The other's

689
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,679
a silver sedan,
plate number South C29437.

690
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,880
Liu Gang took the silver one.

691
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:34,749
Alert the Command Center

692
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,679
about the plate number

693
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,840
to track Liu Gang's car.

694
00:39:37,911 --> 00:39:38,990
We can't let him get away.

695
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,400
Got it.

696
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:57,519
(Director,)

697
00:39:57,888 --> 00:39:59,440
(Jiajia found that before we got here,)

698
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,200
(two cars had
already left Tianhai Lucky.)

699
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,039
(Liu Gang got into the silver sedan.)

700
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,600
The traffic department

701
00:40:04,622 --> 00:40:06,070
is tracking both cars across the city.

702
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:07,800
Okay, got it.

703
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,088
Chief Xiao, Captain Han,

704
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,159
the departments are tracking

705
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,159
Liu Gang's vehicle.

706
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,280
I remember
during Zhen Ni's interrogation,

707
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,960
she said

708
00:40:18,022 --> 00:40:20,044
Liu Gang wanted to
leave the country with her

709
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,320
and asked Fei Yan to meet them.

710
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,039
When was Liu Gang planning

711
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,400
to take you to Qinmang?

712
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,800
I don't know the exact time,

713
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,519
but he said

714
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,519
he had arranged for a friend

715
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,440
to meet me at the border.

716
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,119
Who?

717
00:40:40,377 --> 00:40:40,920
Fei Yan.

718
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,679
Maybe

719
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,960
Liu Gang is heading toward

720
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,039
the border right now.

721
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,920
(Linshan Police Bureau Command Center)

722
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,400
Chief Xiao,

723
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:52,377
if Liu Gang's trying to
sneak out of the country,

724
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,109
the most likely route

725
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,466
would be through the border area.

726
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,599
We've divided that area into zones.

727
00:40:57,844 --> 00:40:59,590
Once Liu Gang enters
our surveillance net,

728
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,760
we'll be able to track him.

729
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,159
Also, through further investigation,

730
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:05,159
we identified two possible exits
leading abroad.

731
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,440
Dayuguo,

732
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,239
Fengweizhu,

733
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,639
Xiaoyakou, and Xiaoliekou.

734
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:09,760
These four exits.

735
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,320
Han, I'll stress two things here.

736
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,320
The border terrain is
rugged and complex.

737
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,866
Make sure those four exits
are properly guarded.

738
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:19,519
Second,

739
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:20,519
time.

740
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,629
We're racing against time.

741
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,280
We must stop Liu Gang
as quickly as possible

742
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,599
before he crosses the border.

743
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:26,822
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

744
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,519
Wan Guizhi,

745
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,079
we need your cooperation on something.

746
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,200
This is your chance to help yourself.

747
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:54,039
Call Liu Gang.

748
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,559
Why did you hang up?

749
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,039
It's a code we agreed on
for emergencies.

750
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:26,960
Hanging up after three rings

751
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,280
means it's safe.

752
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:30,920
Do your best to stall him.

753
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,280
That'll help our tech team

754
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,266
to pinpoint his location
more accurately.

755
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:38,639
Hello?

756
00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:40,444
Why haven't you contacted Fei Yan?

757
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:41,719
Gang,

758
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:42,880
I...

759
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
I'm still in Linshan.

760
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,199
What?

761
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:48,239
Why didn't you listen to me
and go to Qinmang?

762
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:49,679
I...

763
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:51,679
I'm scared.

764
00:42:52,422 --> 00:42:54,355
The police are everywhere
looking for me.

765
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:56,239

766
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:57,711
you need to help me.

767
00:42:57,733 --> 00:43:00,060

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,320
