Gang, where are you now?

00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,220
(Ask him to pick you up.)

5
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,760
Can you come pick me up?

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,800
Where are you?

9
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,590
Bye.

10
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:10,444
Where's the usual place?

11
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,000
Ake Valley.

12
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:42,920
Director,

13
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,760
we got word from the tech department.

14
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,760
They've located Liu Gang's phone.

15
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,640
He's heading toward Ake Valley.

16
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:51,880
Got it.

Hands up.

22
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,760
Come out.

23
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,030
Get out.

24
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,222
Where's Liu Gang?

25
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't know.

26
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,266
Take him away.

28
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:35,066
Liu Gang escaped.

Gang.

30
00:03:57,777 --> 00:03:59,440
Drive my car to the cabin in Ake Valley.

31
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,320
Got it.

32
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,080
Chief Xiao,

33
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,920
Liu Gang knows how to avoid detection.

34
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,640
He not only deceived Zhen Ni,

35
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:31,000
but he also anticipated
every step of our operation.

36
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,320
What we can confirm is
that after switching cars,

37
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,066
Liu Gang headed to Changxing South Road.

38
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,360
Lock it down now.

39
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:38,720
Yes, Sir.

and got away.)

(He's heading toward
Changxing South Road.)

45
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,022
(Get over there immediately.)

46
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,560
(Copy that.)

47
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,640

Any more details?

Our team in the woods nearby

53
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,311
snapped photos of him at the scene.

54
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:51,200
Zoom in on the photo.

55
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,688
Okay.

56
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,160
That's him.

57
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,360
Seal off the area now.

58
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,080
Fei Yan

59
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,560
is likely there to meet Liu Gang.

60
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,333
If we catch him,
we'll get a lead on Liu Gang.

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,120
Stop. Freeze.

62
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,650
Pull over.

63
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:01,711

Liu Gang!

65
00:07:18,577 --> 00:07:19,333
Don't move.

66
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,440
Stop.

67
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,640
Easy.

68
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,440
We caught him, Rui.

69
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,720
He's not Liu Gang.

70
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:35,600
We got tricked.

71
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,555
Hold him down.

72
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:05,330
Share the location with Director Deng.

73
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:05,844
Got it.

74
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,130
Okay.

76
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,080
Chief Xiao,

77
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,830
Liu Gang shook off Chang Rui's team
and headed into the mountains.

78
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,360
Right now, he's near the area
where Fei Yan was caught.

79
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:15,800
We can play along with it

80
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:17,280
and use Fei Yan to lure Liu Gang.

81
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,440
That's a good idea.

82
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,320
Han,

83
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
go with Deng Yan.

84
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,080
We must bring Liu Gang in this time.

85
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:24,844
Understood.

86
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:25,577
Understood.

87
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:14,960
Don't move.

88
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:16,960

(Dingshun Group)

93
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,200
How's the discussion with the investor?

94
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,040
Well,

95
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:16,466
this investment company
is based in Gangcheng.

96
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:18,570
I've been dealing with them
for some time,

97
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:19,840
and I've looked into them.

98
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,810
They seem quite reliable.

99
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,533
I'd say there's about an 80% chance.

100
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,880
What are their terms?

101
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:26,920
Well.

102
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
They're very optimistic about Dingshun,

103
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,720
especially

104
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,400
our Southeast Asia business.

105
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,400
They want to further optimize
our business structure.

106
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,320
Their goal is
to take the company public.

107
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,320
But...

108
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,240
There's no need to hesitate.

109
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,080
Just say it.

110
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,880
They only want to

111
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,680
cooperate with our parent company.

112
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,222
They don't want to be involved with

113
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,520
Shencheng's tech company.

114
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
What does it mean?

115
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,000
That doesn't sound sincere at all.

116
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,680
Apparently, they don't have faith

117
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,120
in the future of the tech company.

118
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,000
Then what's the point
of working with them?

119
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,560
Their

120
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
main concern is

121
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,280
that the tech company
demands too much capital.

122
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:16,600
I don't think we should
cooperate with them.

123
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,320
They want Xiuming to spin off
the tech company from Dingshun?

124
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,880
Are you kidding me?

125
00:11:22,644 --> 00:11:24,888
That's basically kicking us
out of the game.

126
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,066
I think you should keep looking for
other investors.

127
00:11:28,444 --> 00:11:29,511
What do you think?

128
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,840
No, Zilin.

129
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,320
Until now,

130
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,444
we've met with
at least 70 or 80 investment firms,

131
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,720
if not a hundred.

132
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,111
The market is extremely competitive.

133
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:42,555
Funding is hard to come by.

134
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,480
Plus, Dingshun

135
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,240
is having financial difficulties.

136
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,960
The tech company also needs cash flow.

137
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,040
Mr. Ye,

138
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,920
I agree with Ms. Fang.

139
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
The more desperate we are,

140
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,760
the calmer

141
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,160
we need to be.

142
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,680
Agreed.

143
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,760
We can't just grasp at straws.

144
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,240
Even though we've met
with many investors,

145
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,333
we still need to wait.

146
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,040
This deal just doesn't make sense.

147
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:12,977
What if things spiral out of control

148
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,160
after the tech company is split off?

149
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,590
Are we just going to
let someone else take over?

150
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:19,733
Have you thought
through the consequences?

151
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:29,800
Spin off the company.

152
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,288
Let's do this.

153
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,440
Wu Bin will hold

154
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,888
my shares.

155
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,960
From now on,

156
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,160
both of you

157
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:39,160
will take full charge of Dingshun Group.

158
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,960
I don't agree, Xiuming.

159
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,430
You're making a reckless decision.

160
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:45,533
I don't agree either.

161
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,970
Technology innovation

162
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,466
has the potential to change the era.

163
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,440
We must secure this investment

164
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,720
for Dingshun first.

165
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,080
That way,

166
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,560
we can stabilize Dingshun Group

167
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,680
and later figure out

168
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,560
how to reinvest in the tech company.

169
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,880
We're out of options now.

170
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,480
It's worth taking the risk.

171
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,200
How about this?

172
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:21,590
I'll try to negotiate with them
once more.

173
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,640
We can make a decision after that.

174
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,160
I agree.

175
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,200
Let's not

176
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,670
be overly optimistic

177
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,733
or delude ourselves.

178
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,600
We must prepare for the worst.

179
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,533
You talk to them first.

180
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:35,266
We'll discuss again after that, okay?

(Linshan City Police Bureau)

182
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,760
Are you here to question me

183
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,450
why I didn't let you
interrogate Liu Gang?

184
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,240
You know the reason.

Give me one good reason

187

why you should interrogate Liu Gang.

based on clues related to Cripple.

192
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
I have to interrogate him.

193
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,800
I need to confirm
if he really is Cripple.

194
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,288
That reason isn't strong enough.

195
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:16,644
Anything else?

196
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,320
Captain Han,

197
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,190
even though I can't be 100% sure

198
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,000
that he is Cripple,

199
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,520
as long as I get to question him,

200
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,879
I'll be able to know whether or not
he's connected to Cripple.

201
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,620
Once I confirm that,

202
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,880
I'll be able to find Lin Ran.

203
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm only one step away!

204
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,800
I knew

205
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,120
this would come back to Lin Ran.

206
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,760
Deng Yan,

207
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,240
I understand how you feel right now.

208
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,030
But I need to remind you.

209
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,480
The Anti-abduction Office
isn't just looking for one Lin Ran.

210
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,880
We're looking for many Lin Ran.

211
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,666
Chief Xiao and I were worried
your personal emotions

212
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,640
might cloud your judgment on the case,

213
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,844
so we didn't let you
interrogate Liu Gang.

214
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,510
Deng Yan,

215
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,920
we're the people's police.

216
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,240
Hopes of countless families
are on our shoulders.

217
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,640
It's our responsibility.

218
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,520
Especially when a case
is at its most critical stage.

219
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,222
We can't afford the slightest mistake.

220
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:08,933
One slip, and everything's in jeopardy.

221
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:09,960
So,

222
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:12,600
both Chief Xiao and I decided

223
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,180
not to let you handle the interrogation.

224
00:15:15,688 --> 00:15:17,800
But Chief Xiao asked me
to pass on a message.

225
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,840
Don't worry.

226
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,760
Everyone

227
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,110
in the Linshan Police Bureau

228
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,010
is with you.

229
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,960
We will find Lin Ran.

230
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,133
(A labor company in our city)

231
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:34,580
(is suspected of human trafficking.)

232
00:15:34,622 --> 00:15:36,320
(Key personnel
have already been arrested)

233
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,844
(and were linked to multiple cases)

234
00:15:37,844 --> 00:15:39,088
(of abduction and trafficking.)

235
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,680
The investigation is still ongoing.

236
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,510
(Not even a dead cop
can stop you all.)

237
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,240
(Want to catch me?)

238
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,480
(I doubt you have the skills.)

239
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,100
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

240
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,440
Liu Gang.

241
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,400
This is the testimony
of Wan Guizhi and Fei Yan.

242
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:01,520
According to their statements,

243
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,960
you forced young women into prostitution

244
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:06,666
and you're the mastermind
behind a series of trafficking cases

245
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,480
involving young women and children.

246
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,320
I just trafficked a few.

247
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,800
What's the big deal?

248
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,000
Just trafficked a few?

249
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,040
You're suspected

250
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,288
of being involved in
multiple heinous trafficking cases.

251
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,320
We have both witnesses and evidence.

252
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,100
I advise you to come clean.

253
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,920
It's better for you.

254
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm not a sore loser.

255
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,960
Since you've caught me,

256
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,400
I admit it.

257
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,680
According to Wan Guizhi,

258
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,080
you are Cripple.

259
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:44,600
Is that true?

260
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Yes. So?

261
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,640
These children

262
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
were abducted by you.

263
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,280
Where are they now?

264
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,880
(I know my condition.)

265
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,600
(I just...)

266
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,120
(I just wish)

267
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,640
(I could slow down)

268
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,320
(how quickly I'm starting to forget.)

269
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
I hope when Ranran comes back,

270
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,200
I'll be in my right mind.

271
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,400
(We're the people's police.)

272
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,670
Hopes of countless families
are on our shoulders.

273
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,080
It's our responsibility.

274
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,880
Especially when a case
is at its most critical stage.

275
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:02,577
We can't afford the slightest mistake.

276
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,200
One slip, and everything's in jeopardy.

277
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,840
Who are these kids?

278
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,240
Don't play dumb.

279
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,720
I can give you some leads

280
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,360
about these kids.

281
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,960
But

282
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,360
I want to make a deal.

283
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:41,577
You're in no position
to make a deal with us.

284
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,480
The police never negotiate

285
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,920
with criminals.

286
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,840
You have only one way out now.

287
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,200
Confess, and you might get leniency.

288
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,040
Don't you want to know

289
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,630
who the Cripple really is

290
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,130
and where these kids are?

291
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,520
Aren't you Cripple?

292
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,730
Yes, I am,

293
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,955
and I'm not.

294
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,920
Actually,

295
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,120
this information is very important.

296
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,080
My request is simple.

297
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,000
Well,

298
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,080
there's wine in my cabinet.

299
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Can you bring it to me?

300
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,080
I'm craving it.

301
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,280
Cut your nonsense.

302
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,800
We only believe in evidence.

303
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,320
And all the evidence points

304
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,400
to you

305
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,880
being Cripple.

306
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,720
You can stay silent if you want.

307
00:19:33,977 --> 00:19:35,600
But Liu Gang, let me warn you,

308
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,280
you're involved in multiple
egregious human trafficking cases.

309
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,000
Besides, you attacked a police officer,

310
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,640
causing his death.

311
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,520
Your crimes

312
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,760
are enough for the death penalty.

313
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,080
Death penalty?

314
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,600
I... I didn't kill that cop.

315
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,755
Zhou Hongcai was being held captive
by you, right?

316
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,760
Also, you staged that car accident

317
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,040
that caused an officer's death.

318
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,755
Are you saying that has nothing
to do with you?

319
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,040
I honestly didn't kill that cop.

320
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,160
It was Wu.

321
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,640
He works for Cripple.

322
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,120
It was Cripple's order.

323
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,840
Cripple had Wu watching me
the whole time.

324
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,840
So, what's your relationship
with this Cripple?

325
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,960
He's my boss.

326
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,680
I work for him.

327
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Over twenty years ago,

328
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,555
I met an illegal dog dealer named Wai.

329
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,960
Wai and the limping guy,

330
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,480
that's Cripple,

331
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,320
were in that kind of business.

332
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,533
Cripple has quite a reputation

333
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,760
on the streets.

334
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
I started helping them to find "goods".

335
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,280
Yes, kids

336
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,400
and young women.

337
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,960
It paid well and wasn't hard work.

338
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,000
Of course, I was happy to do it.

339
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,360
That's how I got connected to him.

340
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
Cripple had the network,

341
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,760
I found the goods,

342
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:54,200
and Wai transported them.

343
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,280
Officers,

344
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,560
he's the real boss.

345
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,400
I'm just a runner.

346
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,080
But he paid quickly,

347
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,120
so I kept doing it.

348
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,040
All this time working together,

349
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:11,511
and you never met him in person?

350
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,022
Do you expect us to believe that?

351
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,720
It's true.

352
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,360
We only spoke on the phone.

353
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,440
I've never seen his face.

354
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:19,177
In this kind of business,
the less you know, the better.

355
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,360
As long as they pay.

356
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:26,150
Then why did you claim
to be Cripple at first?

357
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,760
Later,

358
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,840
Wai

359
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,120
got arrested for another case,

360
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:34,881
and Cripple

361
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,120
stopped showing up.

362
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,600
He sent me instead.

363
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,440
Over time,

364
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,640
everyone assumed I was him,

365
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,160
and I didn't deny it.

366
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,000
I was blinded by greed.

367
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
I wanted to quit,

368
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,600
but it's hard to make money

369
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,240
these days.

370
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,720
Honestly,

371
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,240
I'm not Cripple.

372
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,760
I just borrowed his name.

373
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,120
I faked a limp.

374
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,040
Please trust me.

375
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,360
Right. I have records

376
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,480
of all our transactions.

377
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,400
You can check them.

378
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,680
Many of the crimes were on his orders.

379
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,240
That girl, Kui.

380
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
He told me to take her.

381
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,040
So,

382
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,880
you only became Cripple
in the past decades?

383
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,720
Yes.

384
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,280
I'm a victim, too.

385
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,440
A victim?

386
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,860
What about the people you hurt?

387
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,680
I've confessed everything.

388
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,960
Does this count as cooperation?

389
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,760
Can I get leniency?

390
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,160
Liu Gang,

391
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,320
write down everything

392
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,800
you've done over the years.

393
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,840
Don't take any chances.

394
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,920
What you confess now

395
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,160
will determine your future.

396
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,400
Fine, I'll tell you everything I know.

397
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,200
Director,

398
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,600
based on the statement,

399
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,880
there's likely someone behind Liu Gang,

400
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,520
and that person could very well

401
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,800
be the real Cripple.

402
00:23:07,044 --> 00:23:09,200
What about Fei Yan?
How's it going on that side?

403
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,720
He's confessed everything.

404
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,650
He doesn't know

405
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,933
Cripple's real identity either.

406
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,111
Cripple only contacted him
through a single line.

407
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,110
Have you looked
into the phone number he provided?

408
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,080
It's not registered under a real name,

409
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,780
and we can't trace
the actual subscriber.

410
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:27,920
But we've asked the relevant department
to track

411
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,240
and see if we can find any leads.

412
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,840
Earlier, Liu Gang mentioned

413
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
some of Tianhai Group's profits

414
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,250
might be transferred overseas.

415
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,280
Check where that money

416
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,400
is going.

417
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,280
Got it.

418
00:23:50,182 --> 00:23:54,262
(Dingshun Group)

419
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,840
I'll say it again.

420
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:03,177
If they want to spin off
the tech company

421
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:04,155
to invest in Dingshun,

422
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,760
I'm against it.

423
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,240
I've thought long and hard about this,

424
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,680
and this is the best outcome.

425
00:24:09,911 --> 00:24:11,219
For the sake of the tech company,

426
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,500
I'm willing to make the sacrifice.

427
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,480
Mr. Ye,

428
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,520
I understand this is your dream,

429
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,720
but...

430
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,440
Enough.

431
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,160
The decision is made.

432
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,600
Ye Xiuming,

433
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,760
this company isn't yours alone.

434
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,230
We've been through so much,

435
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,177
built it from scratch,

436
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,920
and run it together all the way
until now.

437
00:24:28,955 --> 00:24:30,760
Why are you making this decision
on your own

438
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,800
and letting someone else take over
the company?

439
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,300
- I'm the president.
- Why did you...

440
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,850
This matter is settled.

441
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,755
Do you want me to call a board meeting?

442
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,310
How about this?

443
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,760
Transfer the shares

444
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,600
to Ms. Fang and me for now.

445
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,640
Once the company pulls through,

446
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,280
we'll transfer them back to you.

447
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,200
Deal.

448
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,580
Deal.

449
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,933
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Ye.

450
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
This tea smells great.

451
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,920
Please try it.

452
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,240
Your son is such a refined young man.

453
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,444
You flatter him.

454
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,760
Greet Mr. Wu.

455
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,120
Hello, Mr. Wu.

456
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,360
Hello.

457
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,270
We're very grateful you could make time

458
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,840
to visit us.

459
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,440
Dingshun is a well-known enterprise
in Linshan.

460
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,920
It's my good fortune

461
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,410
to be able to work with Dingshun.

462
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,480
That's very kind of you.

463
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,280
I'd say Dingshun is the lucky one

464
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,680
to have an investment from you, Mr. Mu.

465
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,266
You're too humble, Mr. Wu.

466
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,680
To be honest, I see a good prospect

467
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,280
in Dingshun's core business
in Southeast Asia.

468
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,270
This should be a win-win collaboration.

469
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,760
Right.

470
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:28,840
A win-win.

471
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,440
Have some tea.

472
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:30,590
Have some tea.

473
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:35,990
Nice.

474
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:37,960
Mr. Wu,

475
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,000
the conditions we agreed on

476
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,880
must be clearly stated in the contract.

477
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,480
Everything I promised you

478
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,840
will be delivered.

479
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,150
As of now, Dingshun has completed
the handover with Mr. Ye.

480
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,120
Mr. Ye

481
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,320
is no longer serving as president.

482
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,866
Okay.

483
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,760
To be frank,

484
00:26:58,311 --> 00:26:59,844
I personally have never had much faith

485
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:01,560
in tech companies.

486
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,866
It's a money pit.

487
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,960
A bottomless one.

488
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,080
Don't worry, Mr. Mu.

489
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,177
Dingshun and Mr. Ye

490
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,000
have completed the share transfer.

491
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,360
Mr. Ye has no ties with us.

492
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,780
I personally agree with you.

493
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,520
There's no future

494
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:24,111
in investing in tech.

495
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,240
I know the Southeast Asia market well.

496
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,240
Mr. Mu, trust me.

497
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,880
You won't be disappointed.

498
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,440
If so,

499
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:35,466
that's settled, then.

500
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,360
How long do you and your son
plan to stay in Linshan?

501
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,200
Hard to say.

502
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,480
We'll see.

503
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,280
Zhou,

504
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,000
arrange a schedule
for Mr. Mu's stay in Linshan.

505
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:53,760
You'll accompany him the whole time.

506
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,480
Yes, Mr. Wu.

507
00:27:55,177 --> 00:27:56,044
Come, have some tea.

508
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,480
Mr. Wu,

509
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,800
you're too kind.

510
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,040
Not at all.

511
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,280
Hello?

512
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:15,920
Director Deng, the man you've
been asking about, Mu Zhenliang,

513
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:17,266
we've finally got news on him.

514
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,422
We've tracked
that he's arrived in Linshan,

515
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,760
and he's brought his son,
Mu Haobo, along.

516
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,120
(Mu Haobo)
Mu Haobo was born in 1992.

517
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,250
He's 17 years old.

518
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,180
That matches Luo Xiaoyu's age.

519
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,160
Alright, got it.

520
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,000
I just want to know any leads
about my brother.

521
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,920
Where is he?

522
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,520
Is he doing well?

523
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,040
I'm the only one left in the family now.

524
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,010
I've been waiting for 15 years.

525
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:48,555
I've been looking for him for 15 years.

526
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:02,495
Dingshun Investment Cooperation
Signing Ceremony

527
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,760
now begins.

528
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,720
First,

529
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,950
let's welcome the president
of Yongyi Gangcheng Trading Company,

530
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,360
Mr. Mu Zhenliang,

531
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,040
and the president
of Linshan Dingshun Group,

532
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,240
Mr. Wu Bin,

533
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,870
to participate in the signing ceremony.

534
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,120
A round of applause, please.

535
00:29:18,418 --> 00:29:24,578
(Dingshun Investment Cooperation
Signing Ceremony)

536
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,311
- I look forward to our collaboration.
- I look forward to our collaboration.

537
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:10,898
(Dingshun Investment Cooperation
Signing Ceremony)

538
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,755
What prompted you
to invest in Dingshun, Mr. Mu?

539
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,840
My investment in Dingshun
is actually an investment in Mr. Wu.

540
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,290
Alright, Mr. Wu,

541
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,440
do you have anything to add
about this signing?

542
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,960
With Mr. Mu's investment,

543
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:38,133
I believe Dingshun Group
will reach even greater heights

544
00:30:38,244 --> 00:30:40,200
under my leadership.

545
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,444
Mu Zhenliang and his son came to Lishan

546
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:52,644
to sign a contract with Dingshun.

547
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,840
They're currently

548
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,440
staying at a five-star hotel.

549
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,000
Ai Xin, Chang Rui,

550
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,600
you two go check them out.

551
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:11,688
Mr. Mu, you haven't been back to Linshan
in a long time, right?

552
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,640
Yes.

553
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,160
It's been more than ten years.

554
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,000
Linshan has changed a lot, indeed.

555
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,920
We're mainly here to confirm

556
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,070
whether Mu Haobo is your biological son.

557
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,160
Yes.

558
00:31:28,755 --> 00:31:29,800
Any problem with that?

559
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,290
Both of us are from Lishan,

560
00:31:32,444 --> 00:31:33,422
and we share the surname.

561
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,022
Nothing's wrong with that.

562
00:31:35,377 --> 00:31:36,720
According to our investigation,

563
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,960
you didn't have any sons before 1995.

564
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,800
Mu Haobo is 18 this year.

565
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,360
It doesn't seem

566
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,110
to match up with the timeline.

567
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,040
Could you tell us the truth?

568
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,840
Daddy,

569
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,740
I heard Mr. Wu from Dingshun
is coming over

570
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,155
and has already booked dinner.

571
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,480
No need.

572
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,960
Turn him down.

573
00:31:58,622 --> 00:32:00,040
I'm going back to Gangcheng today.

574
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,844
Something's come up.

575
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:01,840
The plane leaves soon.

576
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,520
But Mr. Wu has already
made the arrangements.

577
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,760
I'll handle it.

578
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,040
Go back to your room.

579
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,400
Hurry.

580
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,250
Sorry, Officers.

581
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,760
I have something urgent in Gangcheng,

582
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,120
and I need to fly out tomorrow morning.

583
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,420
Mr. Mu...

584
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,177
That's fine.

585
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:23,311
Thank you for cooperating with us,
Mr. Mu.

586
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:24,840
We're leaving.

587
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,755
Sorry about that.

588
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,560
Hold on.

589
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,560
Excuse me.

590
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,720
Has Room 2588 been cleaned yet?

591
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,640
Not yet.

592
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,960
Please have it cleaned

593
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:50,666

Qian,

607
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,160
do you like the dress I bought you?

608
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:40,320
Do you like it?

609
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,177
Drink some water.

610
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,200
You like it, right?

611
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,640
Qian, let's have some water.

612
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,729
Slowly.

613
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,910
- Good girl.
- Drink slowly.

614
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:48,733
Drink more water. It's good for you.

615
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,680
Two more sips, okay?

616
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,960
Just two.

617
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,480
No?

618
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,840
Alright, no more.

619
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,360
She told me she likes pink.

620
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,360
Yeah.

621
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,840
I took her shopping a few days ago,

622
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,800
and she said, "Mommy, I like pink."

623
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,800
Right?

624
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,960
Goddad knows now.

625
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,040
I know now, too.

626
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,280
I saw the news the other day.

627
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,840
You looked great
at the signing ceremony.

628
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,760
So dashing.

629
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,777
That's just on the surface.

630
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,120
To be honest,

631
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:22,422
I'm confident
I can run the company well.

632
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,280
You have to be confident.

633
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,120
We trust you, don't we?

634
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,640
That day,

635
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,760
I took Qian

636
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,920
to the hospital.

637
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,240
She had acute gastroenteritis.

638
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,244
I didn't feel comfortable

639
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:33,840
letting the housekeeper take her alone.

640
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,230
So I missed the press conference.

641
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,840
But I felt it was enough
with you there.

642
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:40,800
Is she better now?

643
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,088
She's fine.

644
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:44,822
Kids get sick quickly,
and recover quickly, too.

645
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,480
I think

646
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,840
I need to spend more time with her

647
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,480
from now on.

648
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,880
I might need you

649
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,200
to take on more

650
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,750
with the company.

651
00:34:55,866 --> 00:34:58,266
Even though you're only holding shares
on Xiuming's behalf,

652
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,822
you're still the largest shareholder.

653
00:34:59,888 --> 00:35:02,244
It's only right that you shoulder
more responsibility.

654
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,320

655
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,000

656
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,600

Don't worry.

658
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,288
Oh, come on.

Whenever I have time,

660
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,400
I'll come and spend more time
with Qian, okay?

661
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,800
Should you thank Mr. Wu?

662
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,000

I saw someone in the news

668

about the Dingshun Group
contract signing.

669
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,240
He looked exactly like the ID photo

670

you sent me last time.

671
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,120
He was with that businessman
from Gangcheng.

672
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,680
He must be my brother, Xiaoyu.

674
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,720

675
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,390
and we've begun investigating.

we'll let you know right away.

00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:47,920
Alright.

688
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,700
The project's fallen behind.

689

Plus, the core data's been leaked.

in the tech company

didn't you assure
that this project had no issues?

I never expected this to happen either.

696
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,333
How about this, Mr. Ye?

697
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,400
Why don't you

698
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:32,777
come back to Linshan first?

Wu,

702
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,560
you can't tell Zilin about this.

Don't worry.

704
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,560

to see Xiuming.

711

I wonder if something's happened.

712
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,880
You probably don't need to go.

The tech company's core technology

721
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,160
was leaked.

722
00:37:42,022 --> 00:37:43,133
All the money invested

723
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,560

725
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,760
Maybe we should wait for
Mr. Ye to return

726
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:57,755
and then figure something out together.

00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,760
What time exactly?

747
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,955
I'm still checking.

748
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,080
Director.

749
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,440
Director Deng,

750
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,920
thank you.

751
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,311
Yan Lei will take you for a test
in a moment.

752
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,120
Okay, let's go quickly.

753
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,360
Xiaoxing.

754
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,240
Whether or not he's your brother,

755
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,880
no matter the results,

756
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,440
stay calm

757
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,680
and be prepared.

758
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,280
Don't worry, Director Deng.

759
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,130
After so many years,

760
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,400
I've hoped countless times

761
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,810
and been disappointed countless times.

762
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,910
I'm used to it.

763
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,440
No matter the results,

764
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,480
I can accept it.

765
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,640
Go ahead.

766
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,640
Mr. Mu, we're from
Linshan Anti-abduction Office.

767
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,311
May we take a few minutes of your time?

768
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,840
Sorry, we have a flight to catch.

769
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:20,488
Please cooperate with our investigation.

770
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:21,444
It won't take long.

771
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,320
Haobo, go back to your room.

772
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,680
I'll come to get you
after I'm done here.

773
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,730
Okay.

774
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,960
Let's go.

775
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,680
What do you want from me this time?

776
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:53,990
Mr. Mu,

777
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,160
this is the DNA test report

778
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,880
of your son, Mu Haobo,

779
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,266
and a young woman from Linshan.

780
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,320
The results show

781
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,880
they're sister and brother.

782
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,440
What does that prove?

783
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,480
At the very least,

784
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,266
it proves that Mu Haobo
isn't your biological son.

785
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,840
Is blood relation really that important?

786
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,320
I've raised him myself.

787
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,600
That makes him my son.

788
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,240
Do you know that he was abducted?

789
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,670
Here,

790
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,680
adopting a trafficked child

791
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,200
is illegal.

792
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,680
Trafficked?

793
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,720
I legally adopted him

794
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,040
from an orphanage in Gangcheng.

795
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,511
I have all the proper documents.

796
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,960
If you don't believe me,

797
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,377
I can have my lawyer fax them to you
right now.

798
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,360
I believe you.

799
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,160
I believe you wouldn't joke about
something like this.

800
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,480
But it's true

801
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,280
that Mu Haobo was abducted from Linshan.

802
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,480
Mr. Mu,

803
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,120
from what you just said,

804
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,080
we know

805
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,080
that your adoption was legal.

806
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,690
But we also have evidence

807
00:41:55,777 --> 00:41:58,050
proving he was the abducted child
from Linshan back then.

808
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,960
All these years, you've been with him

809
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,560
and given him a happy childhood.

810
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:06,800
We don't

811
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
deny that.

812
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,560
But we hope

813
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,920
you can cooperate with us

814
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,440
to help this child find his home

815
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
and his family.

816
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,400
His family was torn apart

817
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,920
searching for him.

818
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,600
Many of the elders have passed away

819
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,044
before they see him return.

820
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,130
We hope you can tell us

821
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,320
which orphanage you adopted him from.

822
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:32,880
Also,

823
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,120
if you're willing,

824
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,630
could you tell us

825
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,920
why you chose

826
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,070
to adopt him in the first place?

827
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,390
Actually, there's a reason

828
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,880
I adopted Haobo.

829
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,240
It's a bit embarrassing to say.

830
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,320
Back then, a fortune teller

831
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,480
told me I needed to find a boy

832
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,770
with two moles

833
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:00,400
to be my son,

834
00:43:01,133 --> 00:43:02,622
