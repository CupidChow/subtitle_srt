00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The next game is the same as the previous one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The game is the same as the previous one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The game is the same as the previous one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The game is the same as the previous one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The game is the same as the previous one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:54,480
Here are the

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,480
I love you hahri acid

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,480
Returning to the character

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,020
opened the door

24
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,560
W genre

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
I pushed my godfather

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,320
Nobody can beat me

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Current status

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Hello, everyone

29
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
Hello

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
You are here

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,320
Hello, you are here

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
Thank you

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Let me introduce you

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
This is Officer Ai

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
Officer Yan

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
This is Jingjing's father

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Hello

38
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
We found some new clues recently

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,320
These are clothes for children

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Do you have any evidence?

41
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
Do you have any impression of this one?

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,320
This one...

43
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,320
I think I have an impression

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Are you sure?

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
Take a closer look

46
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
I'm sure

47
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
I have an impression

48
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
This little dress

49
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
is the one I wore when I was a child

50
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Right?

51
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Yes

52
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
I'm sure

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
I bought this dress in the town

54
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Kid

55
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
Let's go

56
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
Kid

57
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Kid

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Look at the clothes in the photo

59
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
Do you remember

60
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
we went to the town

61
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,320
to buy the clothes in the town

62
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
in the market?

63
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Think about it

64
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Put it in your hand

65
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
Put it in your hand

66
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
I sewed this one

67
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Can't you see it?

68
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
You said

69
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,320
I was ugly

70
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
But Jingjing likes it

71
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,320
She can't even sleep at night

72
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Right, Jingjing?

73
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Can't you remember?

74
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
You can sleep in it

75
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Mom sewed it by herself

76
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
How could I not remember?

77
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
I remember

78
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
In 1997

79
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
the whole country celebrated

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
the return of Hong Kong

81
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,320
We celebrated

82
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
and went to the town

83
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
to buy the clothes in the market

84
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Look

85
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
We made a lot of money today

86
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Let's go back

87
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
and tell Mr. Deng about this

88
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Mr. Deng

89
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Xing

90
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
Mr. Deng said

91
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
he would inform you

92
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
as soon as he heard about it

93
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
It's the same

94
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
when you go back

95
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
I can't stay anywhere

96
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
It's been 11 years

97
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
It's the first time

98
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
that I feel that Hong Kong is so close to me

99
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Only here

100
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
can I feel at ease

101
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
It's raining

102
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
It's raining again

103
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
If you still

104
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
ask me about my hometown

105
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
I have nothing to say

106
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
I found it

107
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
in your hometown

108
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
You only had three kids

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Where did you get these?

110
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
I bought them

111
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
I like children's clothes

112
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Can't I?

113
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Where did you buy them?

114
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
How much?

115
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
It's been so long

116
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
I can still remember

117
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
I forgot it

118
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
We have verified

119
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
the kitten on this dress

120
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
It was sewn by the mother of the child

121
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
I...

122
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
I picked it up

123
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Is it illegal?

124
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Hong Jifeng

125
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
whether you admit it or not

126
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
these are the clothes

127
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
of the child

128
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
It's the evidence

129
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
of your crime

130
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
I didn't do it

131
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
I was saving them

132
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
The boy from Pingli Town

133
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
His parents

134
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
only cared about having breakfast

135
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
They left the kid

136
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
on the side of the road

137
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
He almost fell into the ditch

138
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
I saved him

139
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
And the little girl

140
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
I gave her candy

141
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
She was going to leave with me

142
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Usually

143
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,320
she can't even eat candy

144
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
I sent her to

145
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
a very rich family

146
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
in the provincial city

147
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
She even lived in a big villa

148
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Can her parents

149
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
afford to rent such a good house for her?

150
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
So you mean

151
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
you were helping them

152
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
and saving them

153
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
No

154
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
They are living a good life

155
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
They are living a happy life

156
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
We found something

157
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
in your old house

158
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
Where did you find it?

159
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
This is my stuff

160
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
You can't touch it

161
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Where did you get this?

162
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
I earned it

163
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
I worked hard to earn it

164
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
That's my blood and sweat money

165
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
How do you know it's blood and sweat money?

166
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
It's the black money

167
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
that the kid was paid

168
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
What do you mean by black money?

169
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
I'm telling you

170
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Don't even think about

171
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
getting these dirty things

172
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Those parents

173
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
gave it to me

174
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
because they were thankful to me

175
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
I was saving them

176
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
I saved those parents

177
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
They needed a kid

178
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
I saved these kids

179
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
and let them have a good life

180
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
How can this be black money?

181
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
I'm so angry, Hong Jingfeng

182
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
We've received so many

183
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
kids' stuff

184
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
You didn't do anything

185
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
You're getting anxious about money

186
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
That's my money

187
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
You care about money the most, right?

188
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,320
You care about money the most, right?

189
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
I'm telling you

190
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,320
If you don't admit your guilt

191
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,320
you'll lose more than money

192
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Don't take my money

193
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Don't take my money

194
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
That's my money

195
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,320
That's my blood and sweat money

196
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
It's my blood and sweat money

197
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
You can't take my money

198
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Please

199
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Don't take my money

200
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
Don't take my money

201
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Don't take it

202
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
I'll tell them

203
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
I'll tell them everything

204
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
Let's talk about the lawyer's kid

205
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
He was so disobedient

206
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
He kept crying

207
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
He was so angry

208
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
He didn't care about anything

209
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
I was afraid that someone would find out

210
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
So I buried him

211
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
I'm sorry

212
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
I'm sorry

213
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
I'm sorry

214
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Who sent the message to Sun Lingshi?

215
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
We can't possibly remember this

216
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
He was really squatting downstairs

217
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
and staring at our car

218
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
It was Sun Lingshi

219
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
He was really squatting downstairs

220
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
and staring at our car

221
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
I'm sorry

222
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
I'm sorry

223
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I'm sorry

224
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
I'm sorry

225
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
I don't know how long he was standing there

226
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Anyway

227
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Do you really believe that kid is Sun Xiao Guang?

228
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
I hope not

229
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
But I'm sure he's right

230
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
If that's the case

231
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
He's so pitiful

232
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
This is his only spiritual support

233
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
He's been looking for it for more than ten years

234
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
And this is the result

235
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Will he break down?

236
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Until I can't see him for the rest of my life

237
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
I'm sorry

238
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Mr. Sun

239
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Mr. Sun

240
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Why are you here?

241
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
I've been looking for you

242
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Why don't you answer the phone?

243
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
What's wrong with you?

244
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
What's wrong with you, Mr. Sun?

245
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
What are you doing?

246
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Mr. Sun

247
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
What's wrong with you?

248
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Say something

249
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Mr. Sun

250
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
You

251
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
What's wrong with you?

252
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
What's wrong?

253
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Mr. Sun

254
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Nothing

255
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Aunt Zhang

256
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
No

257
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
You don't look like you're okay

258
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Xiao Xing

259
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
This is your brother's letter

260
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
I've found the information about the little girl

261
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
and the clues I found before

262
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
I've asked Xunzi to go home and continue to help you find her

263
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Take it

264
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Take it

265
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
No

266
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
What's wrong with you?

267
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
I'm sorry, Xiao Xing

268
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
I have to leave

269
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Leave?

270
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Where are you going?

271
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Are you going on a business trip or something?

272
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Mr. Sun

273
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Aunt Zhang

274
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
Take care

275
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Mr. Sun

276
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
You must be busy

277
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Just tell me what's wrong with you

278
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
I'm so worried

279
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Just tell us

280
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Xiao Guang

281
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
He is gone

282
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
What do you mean?

283
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
He's dead

284
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Mr. Sun

285
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
Mr. Sun

286
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Mr. Sun

287
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
My little girl

288
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
My little girl is dead

289
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
No

290
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Xiao Xing

291
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
No, no

292
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
No

293
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Don't be afraid

294
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Don't be afraid

295
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Don't be afraid

296
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
I promised my mom

297
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Don't be afraid

298
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Don't be afraid

299
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Don't be afraid

300
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
No

301
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
She's not gone yet

302
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Hong Jiefeng gave me many clues

303
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
I have to sort them out

304
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Wait a minute.

305
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
Why are you still here?

306
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
You didn't ask them for dinner?

307
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
I've finished my dinner.

308
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Yin asked me to bring you some supper.

309
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
I put it outside.

310
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
You can eat it when you're hungry.

311
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
It's so late.

312
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
You should rest.

313
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,320
You caught the old men like Hongyi and Huang Chuan.

314
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
You don't need to prove yourself so desperately.

315
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
It's a waste of effort.

316
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
So you think I'm trying to prove myself?

317
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
Let me tell you a case.

318
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,320
In 1986, near Wenchang Street in Lingshan City,

319
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
a case of a fraud case happened.

320
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Wenchang Street in 1986?

321
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,320
You mean the case of the boss's daughter in the small club?

322
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
I heard from the boss that

323
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
a crippled man kidnapped the girl.

324
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
There was a witness.

325
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,320
But he was so scared that he kept saying that she was a cripple.

326
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
He knew nothing except that she was a cripple.

327
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
This case has been a mystery.

328
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Yes.

329
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
If I say I'm the witness,

330
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
I'm the one who saw her friend

331
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
and was scared by the cripple.

332
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Do you think I can do this job well?

333
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,320
Impossible.

334
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
I don't have to lie to you about this.

335
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
You can ask the boss.

336
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Let him tell you if it's me.

337
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
You're not kidding.

338
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,320
That day was the Monday, October 2, 1986.

339
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Around 4 p.m. in the afternoon,

340
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
we were playing outside like usual.

341
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,320
We were both in the second grade of the Ningnan Primary School in Songtao Road.

342
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Ranran, stop hiding. Come out.

343
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
Ranran.

344
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
Her name is Lin Ran.

345
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
She is my best friend.

346
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Look, you can't find me.

347
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
You're so good at hiding.

348
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,320
At that time, we were off school at 3 p.m.

349
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
We played for a while.

350
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
She was going home.

351
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
But I wanted her to stay with me for a while.

352
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
So...

353
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
I did something that destroyed our relationship.

354
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
I asked her to play with me for a while.

355
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Play with me for a while.

356
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Today is my birthday.

357
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
So today is your birthday.

358
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Happy birthday to you.

359
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
She wanted to buy me a gift.

360
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
So we went there.

361
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,320
But we didn't bring enough money.

362
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
Here.

363
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
It's a dollar this year.

364
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
It's at least six dollars.

365
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
How can I let you go to buy it on your birthday?

366
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
I'll go to buy it.

367
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
You're the best.

368
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Remember to wait for me.

369
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
You remember to wait for me too.

370
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Okay.

371
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
She left me like this.

372
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
I remember very clearly.

373
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,320
After Lin Ran left, the boss said two sentences in total.

374
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Little sister.

375
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
You like this Bainhe so much.

376
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
This is the first sentence.

377
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
The second sentence is...

378
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
It's getting late.

379
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Why don't you take it back and play?

380
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
You can send the money back another day.

381
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
It's getting late.

382
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Why don't you take it back and play?

383
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
You can send the money back another day.

384
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,320
These two sentences are just five seconds.

385
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,320
Then I saw the most terrifying scene in my life.

386
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Ranran!

387
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
Ranran!

388
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
The alley is not long.

389
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
It's about 60 meters.

390
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Ranran!

391
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
It takes at most ten seconds for an eight-year-old child to run to the end.

392
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
Ranran!

393
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Ranran!

394
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,320
In just ten seconds, this person disappears.

395
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
Ranran!

396
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Ranran!

397
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,320
Actually, this incident could have been avoided.

398
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Because my birthday is not October 2nd.

399
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
It's October 4th, two days later.

400
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
I wanted him to play with me for a while.

401
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
That's why I said that.

402
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
If I hadn't lied to him,

403
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
I wouldn't have met that man.

404
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
Grandpa!

405
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,320
Grandpa!

406
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Anyway, I'm the one who hurt him.

407
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I'm sorry.

408
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
I'm the one who hurt Zhang Haiyi.

409
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
That's why I'm thinking,

410
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
if it weren't for me,

411
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
things wouldn't have happened.

412
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
He could have studied like me,

413
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
found a job,

414
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
and built his own dreams.

415
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
He could have lived the life he wanted.

416
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,320
But now,

417
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
I don't know if he's alive or dead.

418
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,320
Since that day, I've been writing to him.

419
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Pretending that he's just gone far away.

420
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
It's been more than twenty years since he wrote.

421
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Then, Zhang Haiyi closed the rice noodle shop we used to go to when we were kids.

422
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
He was afraid that he couldn't find his home.

423
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
The owner told me that

424
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,320
the technical department had drawn the image of Lin Ran looking for the Queen.

425
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,320
But Zhang Haiyi insisted on using his father's photo to find the truth.

426
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,320
I know that he can't get out of it.

427
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
I'm the same.

428
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,320
In order to find Lin Ran, I had to go through a lot of trouble.

429
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,320
I applied to the chief many times to join the team.

430
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
I tried my best to catch many people.

431
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,320
I saw those hypocrites, cold-hearted, cheaters, and crazy people.

432
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
But I still couldn't find Lin Ran.

433
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
But I know that everything is worth it.

434
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,320
Because of those smiling faces, I can keep going.

435
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,320
I want to find the life that they were stolen for those in trouble.

436
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
So that they can grow up well.

437
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,320
Study, love, grow old.

438
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Just like Lin Ran should have.

439
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,320
So, if I wanted to find Lin Ran,

440
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
I would want to find everyone now.

441
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
That's probably the reason why I kept on searching.

442
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
The report of the kid from Yalu Village came out.

443
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,320
It's not the kid of Mr. Sun, Sun Xiaoguang.

444
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,320
The kid's mother is the editor of a local magazine.

445
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Her name is Qiao Suhan.

446
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Her husband's surname is Chen.

447
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
He's also a lawyer.

448
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,320
After the kid was lost, Mr. Chen committed suicide.

449
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
Inform the family.

450
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
I'll go to the police station.

451
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
I'll go to the police station.

452
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
I'll go to the police station.

453
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
I'll go to the police station.

454
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Inform the family.

455
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
What's wrong?

456
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
How should I put it?

457
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
I've been searching for the kid for so many years.

458
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
I finally found it.

459
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,320
We called the police station to identify the body.

460
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
Did I say anything?

461
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
I'm sorry.

462
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
I'm sorry.

463
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
I'm sorry.

464
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,320
I'm sorry.

465
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
I'm sorry.

466
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
I'm sorry.

467
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
I'm sorry.

468
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
I'm sorry.

469
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
I'm sorry.

470
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
I'm sorry.

471
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
I'm sorry.

472
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
I'm sorry.

473
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
I'm sorry.

474
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
I'm sorry.

475
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,020
You are not aIn technique

476
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Hello, J Tablet

477
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Everybody knows that your dad died in a car crash.

478
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,320
So I can't receive a letter.

479
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
He died today.

480
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,320
His parents are doing this for his family.

481
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
He's dead.

482
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
I hope you can come to our police station.

483
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Tell him the truth.

484
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,320
It's better than waiting for him forever.

485
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,320
We have already punished the suspect.

486
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,320
The law will give you justice.

487
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
Please don't be sad.

488
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,320
If you need anything, you can tell us.

489
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,320
I don't need anything.

490
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Thank you.

491
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
Thank you.

492
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
I hope I can find my child.

493
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,320
I've been hoping for this for years.

494
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:09,320
I hope he can come home and call me mom again.

495
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,320
But now...

496
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
But now...

497
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,320
But now...

498
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Now, it's better.

499
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,320
He's only been missing for a few days.

500
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,320
He died not long after he was released.

501
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
He died.

502
00:27:52,320 --> 00:28:01,320
I don't think he's been very drunk.

503
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
I'm sorry.

504
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Uncle.

505
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,320
Go home with me.

506
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
I'll take you home.

507
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
I'm sorry.

508
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Many people told me that it's hard to get a job.

509
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,320
But no matter how hard it is, as long as we don't give up, there's still hope.

510
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,320
But what is the end of hope?

511
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,320
I don't want to see what happened to Chao Suhan.

512
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,320
It's the hardest thing for a police officer.

513
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:22,320
This reminds me that Lin Ran may never come back.

514
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:29,320
But no matter how hard it is, we have to keep looking for him.

515
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,320
This is our mission.

516
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:39,320
Lin Ran, Luo Xiaoyu, Sun Xiaoguang, and the victims are waiting for me.

517
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,320
I can't give up yet.

518
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
I'm sorry.

519
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,320
Hello?

520
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
Lawyer Sun, this is Deng Yan.

521
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
We've identified the child.

522
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
We found that he's not Sun Xiaoguang.

523
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
We'll keep looking for him.

524
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,320
I hope Hancan won't give up.

525
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
I won't give up.

526
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,320
I'll keep looking for him.

527
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:08,320
Who has the courage to embrace the silence?

528
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Who can be persistent for a lifetime?

529
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,320
Who faces the rain and I?

530
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,320
As for the���ippo arms...

531
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
What about you?

532
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,320
No, why don't you choose me instead?

533
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,320
Hancan deported by water...

534
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,540
They want to improve Africans being more efficient in the IT industry.

535
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,520
They Hispanic refugees,

536
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,780
farm like great persons.

537
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,280
Business is important like a conservative government.

538
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,500
apped to be coworkers.

539
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,720
enee people never felt comfortable.

540
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,200
They seek Welcome-a-F任 here.

541
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,880
the results of the operation.

542
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,280
We also hope that the public

543
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,240
can understand and support the operation.

544
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,920
If you find that there is a case of being controlled

545
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,320
or related clues,

546
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,000
contact the police immediately.

547
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Brother, where is the nearest hospital?

548
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,200
Oh.

549
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,120
This time,

550
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,920
it's at the private hospital.

551
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,320
Just hear the police call out.

552
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,960
Don't make a mistake.

553
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,000
Thank you.

554
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You're welcome.

555
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,760
According to the local police,

556
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,720
there are five types of people who can avoid DNA testing.

557
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,680
The parents who have been controlled

558
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,800
and the parents who have been asked to collect blood.

559
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,840
The children who have been saved

560
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,560
and the children who have been misled.

561
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,240
The children who have been misled.

562
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,600
The citizens who are eligible

563
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,280
can contact the local police

564
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,040
to find the home-saving organization

565
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,760
or the local hospital to consult.

566
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,480
We believe that

567
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,600
with the joint efforts of the whole society,

568
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,240
more and more missing children

569
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,600
can return to their families

570
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,640
and live a happy life.

571
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,440
More details

572
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Please follow our follow-up reports.

573
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,200
The people's hospital is here.

574
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,040
Are you getting off?

575
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,440
The people's hospital.

576
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,720
Young man,

577
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,280
I want to ask you.

578
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,680
How do you get to the hospital?

579
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,280
Sir, you're looking for a wife?

580
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,120
I'm looking for a wife for my child.

581
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,280
Sir, look.

582
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,520
It says you have to go to the hospital.

583
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,800
It's no use if you come alone.

584
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,120
You have to take the child to do the test.

585
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,000
And according to your situation,

586
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,640
you should go to the police station first.

587
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,720
The police station has a police officer

588
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,560
who specializes in handling this case.

589
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,880
Look, that's the police station.

590
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,000
You can go two hundred meters

591
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
along this road.

592
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,880
Thank you.

593
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,440
It's okay.

594
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,320
Golden Peak

595
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,920
Sir,

596
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,720
what can I do for you?

597
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,880
Comrade,

598
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,080
I want to see my child's biological parents.

599
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,680
Which department is it?

600
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Sir, I'm the one who is in charge of the department.

601
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,160
My name is Aisin.

602
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,240
Please come with me.

603
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,760
I'll get to know more about the situation.

604
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,960
That's great.

605
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,560
Let's go.

606
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,320
His name is Kidefu.

607
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
He is a resident of Qingluo Town, Rui City.

608
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,840
He said his son, A Yuan,

609
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,360
was a garbage collector.

610
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,760
He is 13 years old.

611
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,400
He has always wanted to help his son find his biological parents.

612
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,000
He saw the message we sent,

613
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,120
so he came to ask.

614
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,560
Aisin took him.

615
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,320
Qingluo Town is where Sun Xiao Guang was abandoned.

616
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,120
Is A Yuan Sun Xiao Guang?

617
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,440
How about this?

618
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,120
You and Cheng Rui go to Kidefu's house

619
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,960
and bring the child back to be the collection witness.

620
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,800
Jiajia, you and Aisin go to the local police station

621
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
to investigate the situation.

622
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,760
Okay.

623
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,240
Go.

624
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,680
Dad, I'm almost done with this.

625
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
We'll sell it tomorrow.

626
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,920
Who told you to do this?

627
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,040
You're not going to learn.

628
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,720
You're still doing this?

629
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
You want to be a garbage collector forever?

630
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,240
How can you be so good?

631
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,880
Dad, I'm doing it slowly.

632
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Don't be angry.

633
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,760
You're so clumsy.

634
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,440
I'm old.

635
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
How long do you want me to serve you?

636
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,160
Dad, what's wrong with you today?

637
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,240
You're so old.

638
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,320
What's wrong?

639
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,360
You don't like it?

640
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,280
If you don't like it, don't stay here.

641
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
Get out of here.

642
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,720
You're still doing this?

643
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,560
I told you to do this.

644
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,440
I told you to stay here.

645
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,640
I told you to stay here.

646
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,320
No.

647
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,640
Dad, are you okay?

648
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,200
Yes.

649
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,000
Don't call me.

650
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,760
Dad.

651
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,040
Dad.

652
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,240
Dad.

653
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,120
Dad.

654
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,760
Dad.

655
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,360
Dad.

656
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,520
I told you to stay here.

657
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,880
Don't call me.

658
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,200
Dad.

659
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,560
What's wrong with you today?

660
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,480
Why are you so angry?

661
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,440
Daddy.

662
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,920
She said A Yan was born in the outskirts

663
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,360
When the child was one year old

664
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,360
his mother ran away with someone else

665
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,360
Qi Defu took the child back to Qingluozhen

666
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,640
He said the child was picked up

667
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,360
We're here

668
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,800
A Yan went out to play

669
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,280
Let's talk in the house

670
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
Let's go

671
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,040
The road is narrow

672
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,400
You can't drive

673
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,920
You have to walk on the road

674
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,160
Look

675
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,680
The environment is not good

676
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,280
Sit down

677
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,880
It's okay

678
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,000
I'll get you some water

679
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You're welcome

680
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,880
Sit down

681
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,640
We're here to talk about some things

682
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,480
You said you picked up the child, right?

683
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,160
Yes

684
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,240
When was the baby?

685
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,080
Do you remember?

686
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,040
It's been many years

687
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,840
I can't remember the exact time

688
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,360
It was about 11 years ago

689
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,400
Yes

690
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,960
When I picked it up, it was a year older

691
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,040
Now it's almost middle school

692
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,320
Do you remember where it was?

693
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,120
It's where I often pick up bottles

694
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,600
Can you tell me more?

695
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,720
That day

696
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,000
I went to the bin to pick up bottles

697
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,360
I heard a sound in the bin

698
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,760
I opened the bin

699
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,760
It was a baby

700
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,600
I didn't want to care about it

701
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
But I didn't care

702
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,400
The baby was dead

703
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,960
So I picked it up

704
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,440
Do you live here?

705
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,000
Yes

706
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,440
I live downstairs

707
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,280
A Yan lives upstairs

708
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,040
Is she youry?

709
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,720
Did she just be raised?

710
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:39,560
I'm

711
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I'm sorry.

712
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
You saved her.

713
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
You raised her to be such a good child.

714
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
No one will dislike her.

715
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
No one will dislike you.

716
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
What kind of person do you want to be?

717
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Lighting others up in the dark night

718
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
The brave person, that kind of identity

719
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
What doesn't change is the sincerity in the heart

720
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
The brave person, that kind of identity

721
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Every number is a memory of youth

722
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
For love, for happiness, for the future and for this life

723
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Once you've decided your identity, you won't go back

724
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
The greeting of time, follow it to the end

725
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
When someone stands, waiting for the light

726
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Embracing the years, it will never be old

727
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Just like my heart, it will never be deep

728
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The blue heart, it will never be deep
