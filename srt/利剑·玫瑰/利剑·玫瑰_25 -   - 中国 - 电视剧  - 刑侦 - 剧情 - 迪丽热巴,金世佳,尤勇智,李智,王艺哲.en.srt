3
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,120
Where's this car now?

4
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,789
I rented it out two days ago.

5
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,755
It's not back yet.

6
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:41,511
Who rented it?

7
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,777
Someone from
the local car rental group chat.

8
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,711
How did you hand over the car?

9
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,680
He was supposed

10
00:01:49,044 --> 00:01:50,150
to pick it up himself,

11
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,680
but he said he couldn't come that day.

12
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
My shop was swamped,

13
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,040
so I mailed him the key,

14
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,711
and he got the car from the garage.

15
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:00,150
So you never saw

16
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,480
this person?

17
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,079
No.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,359
Please show us
all the transaction records.

19
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,680
Sure, this way.

20
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,479
This is it.

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,590
(Hi, I saw your message in the rental
group chat. Is the car still available?)

22
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,950
(Yes. When do you need it?
You can come collect the key.)

23
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:22,159
(I need it tomorrow, but I'm busy.)

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,488
(Could you mail me the key instead?
I'll pick up the car myself.)

25
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,400
Something's wrong with this Santana.

26
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,759
It was following Hu Xiaolu's car.

27
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,479
Check the nearby CCTV

28
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,439
and track its route.

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,000
These people knew

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,488
her driving routine beforehand,

31
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,680
so they planned earlier

32
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,360
and picked a spot without cameras

33
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,511
to make their move.

34
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,719
This Santana

35
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,960
premeditated

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,479
a child abduction.

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,879
Earlier planning and staking out.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,120
They went to such lengths.

39
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,599
Could there be another motive?

40
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,159
Tang Dongquan's company

41
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,400
has been doing well in recent years.

42
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,159
Could this be

43
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:27,488
a kidnapping and extortion?

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,639
Unlikely.

45
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,000
If it were for ransom,

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
they would've called by now.

47
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,840
Yan Lei,

48
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,680
contact Tang Dongquan.

49
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,560
If he gets a ransom call,

50
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
notify us immediately.

51
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,240
Got it.

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,800
Also, contact the traffic department

53
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,240
to find information

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,400
about this Santana's owner.

55
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,599
This should be the car.

56
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,240
Check whether the plate

57
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,360
is fake or swapped.

58
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,890
- I'll take a look at the back.
- Okay.

59
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:30,839
Miss,

60
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:32,222
what are you looking at?

61
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,680
Is this your truck?

62
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,279
Yeah.

63
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,644
Do you want to rent it?

64
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:39,311
I'll give you a good price. Yes?

65
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,040
Or maybe free.

66
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,079
Let's go.

67
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:45,160
Police business.

68
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,279
Please cooperate.

69
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,577
Did I do something wrong?

70
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,000
If not, I have a delivery to make.
I should get going.

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
This is the car.

72
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:19,310
Where's your boss?

73
00:05:19,377 --> 00:05:20,977
Boss, someone's looking for you.

74
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,120
Who is it?

75
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,510
Ding Shuncheng, right?

76
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:26,430
Yes, it's me.

77
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,920
Officers, hello.

78
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:31,120
On the 21st of this month,

79
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,990
you were involved
in a traffic accident, right?

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,519
Yes.

81
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:36,560
We have to ask you to come with us.

82
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,044
We have a few questions for you.

83
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,079
Wait, officers.

84
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,639
I thought that was settled.

85
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:41,360
Ding Shuncheng,

86
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,590
please come with us
and cooperate with the investigation.

87
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
On the 21st of this month,
you were driving

88
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,177
through the middle section
of Renmin Road, correct?

89
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,920
21st?

90
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,399
Let me think.

91
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
That was days ago.

92
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,759
I don't remember.

93
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:58,879
Why?

94
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,390
You don't remember?

95
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,040
Good. Let me remind you.

96
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,839
There was a scrape between two vehicles
on that road.

97
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,510
Oh, I remember now.

98
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,040
I was driving normally.

99
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,920
I wasn't speeding.

100
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,510
I just saw two cars scrape each other

101
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,439
behind me,

102
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,680
and I

103
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,839
kept driving.

104
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:18,822
If you were driving normally,

105
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:20,480
why did you try to run just now?

106
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,160
I... I didn't.

107
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,639
I just wanted to make more deliveries.

108
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:31,310
Every time I haul goods,

109
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,639
I overload

110
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,759
just a little.

111
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,754
Plus, I was tired that day.

112
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:38,644
I had been on the road all night.

113
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,399
I didn't expect

114
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:41,400
to run into something like that.

115
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:43,333
I was just afraid
of getting into trouble.

116
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,360
So, this isn't about overloading.

117
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,160
But the scrape

118
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:50,310
has nothing to do with me.

119
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,920
On the 21st of this month,

120
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,079
your Santana was involved

121
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,480
in a scrape, wasn't it?

122
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,279
Yes, that's right.

123
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,279
Can you describe what happened that day?

124
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,439
At the time,

125
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,120
there was a car

126
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,920
in front of me

127
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,720
and a big truck on my front left.

128
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,800
(The truck was driving very slowly.)

129
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,040
(I got impatient)

130
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,000
(and tried to overtake,)

131
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:21,711
(but it wouldn't let me through.)

132
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:23,070
I was stuck behind it.

133
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,759
I got anxious

134
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,240
and took the right lane to pass,

135
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,920
but then I bumped into the car.

136
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,560
But based on the surveillance footage,

137
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,240
the left lane was clear.

138
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,759
Why did you swerve right instead?

139
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,439
No way.

140
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,720
There was no camera there.

141
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,000
How do you know?

142
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,199
I...

143
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,160
I...

144
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,240
I don't know.

145
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,439
I scraped a car,

146
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,240
so I checked around

147
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,319
and didn't see any cameras.

148
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,600
Officers,

149
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,160
I admit

150
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,480
I have

151
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,200
bad driving habits.

152
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,160
But I was fully responsible.

153
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,800
I paid for the damages on the spot,

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,120
got fined 200 yuan,

155
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,777
and three points were deducted.

156
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:25,044
I won't complain about that.

157
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,560
So, to you,

158
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,200
this was a regular traffic accident?

159
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,639
Yes, of course,
it was just a traffic accident.

160
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:38,555
We checked the surveillance
around that area.

161
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,240
You'd been following the car

162
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,240
from a distance
until you reached the main road,

163
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,044
and then the accident happened.

164
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,440
Quite a coincidence.

165
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,240
That's all it was, a coincidence.

166
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,240
We happened to be driving
in the same lane.

167
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,879
Officers,

168
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,822
if you're done questioning me,

169
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,120
I'll get going.

170
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:10,279
Maybe this really was
a regular traffic accident.

171
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,549
I don't think Ding Shuncheng

172
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,066
has anything to do with Kui's case.

173
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:20,666
He wasn't nervous.

174
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,200
Even if it was
a regular traffic accident,

175
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,799
a child went missing that day,

176
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,399
how could he stay so calm?

177
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,120
It's strange.

178
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,440
I checked with the traffic department.

179
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,559
Ding Shuncheng

180
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,519
hasn't had a single violation in years.

181
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:48,066
That's highly unusual.

182
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,360
Release him for now.

183
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:56,369
Yan Lei, keep a close watch on him.

184
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,870
Report immediately
if anything comes up.

185
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,320
Yes.

186
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,600
Yes.

187
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm back.

188
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,519
Welcome home, Mr. Ye.

189
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,120
Hello?

190
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,840
Mr. Ye,

191
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,088
thank you so much.

192
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,559
It's nothing, Mr. Fu.

193
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,200
I asked a friend for help.

194
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,177
As long as you're happy.

195
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,311
I'll send the contract
to your finance later.

196
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,799
Sure.

197
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,559
You can contact Ms. Fang.

198
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:36,844
Alright. Thank you.

199
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:37,800
Good.

200
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:39,879
Zilin.

201
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,399
Fu Haochen gave us the project.

202
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,720
Got it.

203
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,799
Come have some fruit.

204
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,840
Take a look at the papers on the table.

205
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,320
No need.

206
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:04,822
If it's about the company,

207
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:05,977
you can just sign it.

208
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:12,155
This isn't about the company.

209
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:21,910
Adoption application?

210
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,840
Here's the copy.

211
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,600
I've submitted the originals

212
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,422
(Adoption Application)
and all the documents.

213
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,320
They'll call you for verification later.

214
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:33,644
Cooperate with them.

215
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,399
About this...

216
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,360
Dear,

217
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,240
we're still young.

218
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,533
Let's give it another try.

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,488
I don't want to try anymore.

220
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,720
I've taken medicines and injections

221
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,919
for such a long time.

222
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,039
I'm exhausted.

223
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,919
Let's stop trying.

224
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:21,044
Dear,

225
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,960
I know you've been through a lot

226
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,279
to have a kid.

227
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,360
It's my fault.

228
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,270
Let's talk about it again.

229
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,200
When do you ever have time
to talk to me?

230
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,360
Out of 365 days,

231
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,480
you're only home for a few.

232
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,399
The rest of the time,

233
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,279
whenever I call or text you,

234
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,879
you're either at dinner
or on your way to one.

235
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,919
You care less about me

236
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,240
than Wu Bin does.

237
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:54,720
And it's not like I haven't
brought this up before.

238
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,679
You never took it seriously.

239
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,919
I've made up my mind.

240
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,799
I'm not here to discuss it with you.

241
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,600
But adoption

242
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,111
isn't a small matter.

243
00:13:12,444 --> 00:13:13,644
Have you thought about it?

244
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:14,600
What if...

245
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,000
What if we adopt a child

246
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,044
and later have one of our own?

247
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,200
Would that be fair

248
00:13:20,377 --> 00:13:21,577
to the adopted child?

249
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,600
I've been to the hospital.

250
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,060
The doctor said...

251
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,133
The doctor said I can't have children...

252
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,039
It's okay.

253
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,080
There, there.

254
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:51,840
It doesn't matter.

255
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,755
It's fine if we can't have children.

256
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,039
I know you're busy with your work.

257
00:13:59,039 --> 00:13:59,679
I understand.

258
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,919
It's your dream.

259
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,039
It's your ambition.

260
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,960
But I also have my wish.

261
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,440
I really hope to come home every day

262
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,919
to a lively house

263
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,279
with you and our child here.

264
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,759
But we've been trying

265
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,039
all these years...

266
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,080
Enough. Stop.

267
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,600
- I desperately want...
- I promise you.

268
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,200
this home to feel like home.

269
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,919
I wish so much
to have a child of our own.

270
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,466
I promise you.

271
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:30,550
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,150
I promise you.

273
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:42,933
I'll say yes to anything you want.

274
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,919
It's alright.

275
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:46,840
It's alright.

276
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:55,460
(Adoption Application)

277
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:56,970
Can I have my bill, ma'am?

278
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,000
One moment.

279
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,480
Your noodles taste delicious.

280
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,622
Come again anytime.

281
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:01,960
Sure.

282
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,919
That's

283
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:04,759
28 yuan.

284
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:05,519
28 yuan.

285
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,000
Thank you, please come again.

286
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,577
- Well, we're off.
- Have a nice day.

287
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:09,511
Goodbye. Thank you.

288
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,133
Goodbye.

289
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,919
Goodbye.

290
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,360
Goodbye.

291
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,759
I'm back, Madam Zhang.

292
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,360
Meiyu.

293
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,320
You're back, Xiaoxing.

294
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,559
Meiyu,

295
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:25,288
you have been helping out here
these past few days.

296
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,600
Who's looking after your pet shop?

297
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,759
My shop hasn't been too busy lately.

298
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,879
The restaurant's been short on staff,

299
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:35,000
so I came over to help.

300
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:37,550
Still, you have to take care
of your own business.

301
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,039
Xiaoxing's back now.

302
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,000
You should head back.

303
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,600
Exactly.

304
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,269
It's fine.

305
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,200
- I'll do it.
- Take a rest. I'll handle it.

306
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,240
Honestly,

307
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,639
my shop hasn't been doing well,

308
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,200
and I owe a lot of rent.

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,039
A few days ago,

310
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:02,933
I transferred it to someone else.

311
00:16:03,355 --> 00:16:04,390
Your business shut down?

312
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,240
What are you going to do now?

313
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,840
Have you found a new job?

314
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,320
I went for a few interviews,

315
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,533
but nothing's worked out.

316
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,039
Given my case,

317
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,159
it's not easy to land a job.

318
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,320
But don't worry,

319
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,919
I'll definitely find a job.

320
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,955
How about this?

321
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,279
Meiyu,

322
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,200
once you find

323
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,480
a job,

324
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,600
you can move on.

325
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,360
Until then,

326
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,919
you can stay in Tuanyuan Restaurant.

327
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,240
Really?

328
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,840
Can I stay?

329
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,879
Of course.

330
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,600
I'll talk

331
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
to Lawyer Sun

332
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,711
- about the living expenses.
- No.

333
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,720
I want to stay here.

334
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,120
I love being with everyone.

335
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,266
You don't need to worry

336
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,519
about the rest, Madam Zhang.

337
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,080
Alright. Enough of that.

338
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,159
Say no more.

339
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,440
From today on,

340
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,200
you'll be

341
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,759
staying here.

342
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Thank you, Madam Zhang.

343
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,279
Thank you.

344
00:17:05,044 --> 00:17:06,030
Get back to work.

345
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:06,720
Sure.

346
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,519
I'll do it.

347
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,509
Go rest, Madam Zhang.

348
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,600
- I'll do it.
- It's fine.

349
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,000
You're all working so hard,

350
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:16,359
and now I'm the helper here.

351
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,319
Give it to me.

352
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,000
Sure.

353
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:24,750
I've got it.

354
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:26,559
Let me.

355
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,599
Okay.

356
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,155
Give it to me.

357
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,039
Sure.

358
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,359
Sit and rest a bit.

359
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:34,920
Alright.

360
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,480
Get the relevant contracts ready.

361
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,279
Okay.

362
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,519
Let's get out.

363
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,109
All right, Qian.

364
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,266
It depends on the situation.

365
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,440
Come here.

366
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,680
Mommy will take you out for a walk
in a while, okay?

367
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,200
Yes.

368
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,079
Qian.

369
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:06,920
Qian,

370
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,599
this is our home.

371
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,359
Qian.

372
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:11,880
Come.

373
00:18:12,911 --> 00:18:14,977
Let Mommy change your shoes, okay?

374
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:16,680
Have you arranged the meeting
with the investors?

375
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:17,133
Good.

376
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:18,160
I'll give you a hand. Here.

377
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,079
Could you get Qian's shoes?

378
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,240
Let me know once the time's confirmed.

379
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:23,533
Don't be scared.

380
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:25,559
This little girl is quite heavy.

381
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,240
Such a sweetie.

382
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,359
Good.

383
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,759
From now on,

384
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,039
this is your home.

385
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,200
Look at Mommy's orchids.

386
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,119
Aren't they pretty?

387
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,480
Mommy will show you around.

388
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,480
This is our living room.

389
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,079
Look. This is a piano.

390
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,880
If you want to learn,

391
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,319
Mommy can teach you, okay?

392
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,359
We can also draw together.

393
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,319
This is the big balcony,

394
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,720
and outside is a garden.

395
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:03,240
Look.

396
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,000
Daddy's busy

397
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,160
on the phone.

398
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,111
Is the amount he's investing
what we demand?

399
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:11,960
Look at this.

400
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,200
Do you like it?

401
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,160
That's great.

402
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
Daddy's been on the phone.

403
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,839
He's very busy.

404
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,844
That's it, then.

405
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:23,960
Don't always stay on the phone.

406
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,311
Play with the girl.

407
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,480
Well,

408
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,079
Wu told me

409
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,519
he's dealt with Fu Haochen.

410
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,240
But

411
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,880
I need to go to Shencheng tomorrow

412
00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:32,920
to meet him in person.

413
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,440
You're leaving tomorrow?

414
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,720
Weren't we supposed

415
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,599
to take Qian to the amusement park?

416
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
This is important.

417
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,240
Wait for me.

418
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,200
We'll go when I get back.

419
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,839
Should we be mad at Daddy?

420
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,160
Should we?

421
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,279
So adorable.

422
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,960
Say "Mommy", okay?

423
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,119
Mommy. Look at me.

424
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:57,960
Mommy.

425
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,079
Mommy.

426
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,789
Good girl.

427
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,200
See, I told you she gets along with us.

428
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,720
Say "Daddy".

429
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,960
Daddy.

430
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Don't feel like saying it?

431
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,400
Haven't learned that yet?

432
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,519
Maybe next time, okay?

433
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,799
Okay?

434
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:20,933
You're always on the phone.

435
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,070
Go on and keep being busy.

436
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,960
Look, Daddy bought you this.

437
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,240
Do you like it?

438
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:27,759
No?

439
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,000
She's cute.

440
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,119
Don't like the color?

441
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,680
Do you prefer pink or purple?

442
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,440
Right. Little girls

443
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,880
love pinkish colors,

444
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:44,022
right?

445
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:52,380
(Missing Person: Tang Zhikui)

446
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:55,160
Meiyu,

447
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,333
can you check if the notice is okay?

448
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,119
Yes, it looks fine.

449
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,440
I'll go out again

450
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,200
and post the notices.

451
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,480
The more people who see them,

452
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,444
the more hope we have.

453
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,640
Here.

454
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,400
(Missing Person)

455
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:49,488
What's wrong with his account?

456
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,279
(This account has been deleted.
Messaged failed to send.)

457
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:52,680
No way.

458
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,599
Crap.

459
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:55,933
The account is gone?

460
00:22:11,577 --> 00:22:13,720
Trying to dump everything on me?

461
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,319
Fine.

462
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:20,599
Very well.

463
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,000
Just you wait.

464
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,039
Mr. Fu.

465
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:32,759
Good evening.

466
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,480
Give me a minute.

467
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,888
I need to talk to him about work.

468
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,079
Daddy's going to work.

469
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,519
Let's play.

470
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:47,110
What are you doing here?

471
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,720
All the procedures are done.

472
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,279
Mr. Fu,

473
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,519
I did help you find a girl.

474
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,888
What's with this cold tone?

475
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,400
Not inviting me in for tea?

476
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,200
What on earth are you up to?

477
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,279
Mr. Fu,

478
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:06,599
I'm just trying

479
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,279
to make your life easier.

480
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,720
Right now,

481
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:14,844
the cops are everywhere
searching for the kid.

482
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,279
Don't talk nonsense.

483
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,559
I adopted an orphan.

484
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,519
I'm doing a good deed.

485
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:24,599
Mr. Fu,

486
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,920
are you doing a good deed

487
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,680
for someone else or for your wife?

488
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,577
You know better.

489
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,519
I don't need to spell it out.

490
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,599
Leave now,

491
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,559
or I'll call security.

492
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,079
Call security?

493
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,240
Why not call the police?

494
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,559
You won't talk with me, huh?

495
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:43,559
Fine.

496
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,400
I'll talk with your wife.

497
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,240
Don't go too far.

498
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,240
Let go of me.

499
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,680
Baby.

500
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:52,880
Let go.

501
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,039
Don't go too far, I'm telling you.

502
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:56,829
Let go of me!

503
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,711
Ding Shuncheng.

504
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,319
Are you Ding Shuncheng?

505
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:08,688
Yes, it's me.

506
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:21,066
- Madam Zhang.
- Madam Zhang.

507
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:22,599
We found Kui.

508
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,319
This is Kui.

509
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,200
Sweet little Kui.

510
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,519
So you're Kui?

511
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,680
So pretty.

512
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,599
Kui.

513
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,960
Madam Zhang, I couldn't thank you more.

514
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,799
This is what anyone should do.

515
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,200
Alright.

516
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,960
Dongquan, don't just stand there.

517
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,880
Come on here.

518
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,079
Sweetie.

519
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,200
Xiaolu,

520
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:46,288
Dongquan's been here for a while now.

521
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,599
Kui.

522
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,079
Carry the baby and play with her.

523
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,039
Liu,

524
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,960
go get dinner ready.

525
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,559
We'll have a reunion meal.

526
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,480
Sure, leave it to me.

527
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,200
Dongquan,

528
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,839
didn't you say earlier

529
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,319
you had a lot you wanted to tell Xiaolu?

530
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:07,519
I can't remember it all,

531
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,519
and I can't say it right.

532
00:25:08,622 --> 00:25:10,030
You'd better tell her yourself.

533
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:10,720
Hurry up.

534
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,680
Say what you need to say.

535
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,799
Go on.

536
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,880
Xiaolu,

537
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,759
well,

538
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,240
I'll go get busy.

539
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,440
Xiaolu.

540
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,880
I've failed you.

541
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,079
You didn't fail me.

542
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,680
I shouldn't have expected much from you.

543
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,079
I'm your husband

544
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,119
and Kui's father.

545
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,359
I didn't do enough.

546
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:51,319
Mr. Tang,

547
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,440
didn't you say I'm not gentle

548
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,488
and considerate enough?

549
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:56,200
I must've been the one who did wrong.

550
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,880
You just made the same mistake

551
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,119
all men do.

552
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,279
Xiaolu.

553
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,839
It's my fault.

554
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,119
I failed you.

555
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,039
It won't happen again.

556
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:14,880
Can you

557
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,888
stop holding onto this?

558
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,720
I'm petty.

559
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,680
I'm not generous.

560
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,440
It's all my fault, okay?

561
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,400
That's not what I meant.

562
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:28,310
It's my fault.

563
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,155
You're not wrong.

564
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,279
I didn't say it clearly.

565
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,319
Xiaolu.

566
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:36,839
Have some fruit.

567
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,759
Well...

568
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,240
Dongquan,

569
00:26:45,111 --> 00:26:46,755
if you've made a mistake,
just admit it.

570
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,480
You need to truly reflect on it.

571
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,079
Accept

572
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,279
what you did wrong.

573
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,160
Yes.

574
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,800
Xiaolu.

575
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,559
Look at this.

576
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
A whole wall
of missing person notices...

577
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,599
Behind every child

578
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,960
is a broken family.

579
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,759
When will they

580
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,400
come home?

581
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,440
Will they ever see

582
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,799
their parents again in this lifetime?

583
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:20,377
No one knows.

584
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,160
(Missing Person)

585
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,160
Do you know

586
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,400
how many people envy you

587
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,039
for having your child back?

588
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,000
Your whole family

589
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,839
is together again.

590
00:27:36,711 --> 00:27:38,480
That's more important
than anything else.

591
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,359
Come,

592
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,354
Kui.

593
00:27:49,355 --> 00:27:50,240
Let Daddy hold you.

594
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
You must've missed Daddy.

595
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,319
Let Daddy hold you.

596
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:53,920
Daddy.

597
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,440
Don't cry, Kui.

598
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:58,039
What's wrong, Kui?

599
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:58,920
You're back home now.

600
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:00,680
Don't cry.

601
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,960
Look at this grape, Kui.

602
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,119
Mommy's here, Kui.

603
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:27,400
Yan Yuyan,

604
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,200
tell us about the child.

605
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,333
Yan Yuyan.

606
00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:38,222
Where's Wenwen?

607
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,079
Where did you hide Wenwen?

608
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,559
Answer us.

609
00:28:41,644 --> 00:28:42,911
Where did you get the kid?

610
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,155
Where's Wenwen?

611
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,839
Where did you hide her?

612
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:47,510
Where did you hide Wenwen?

613
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,079
Where did you hide her?

614
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,400
(Regarding)

615
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,680
(the recent child trafficking case
in our city,)

616
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,222
(the police found the missing child)

617
00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:55,790
(within just five days)

618
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,920
(and arrested a suspect.)

619
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,839
Hello?

620
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,559
Did you clean up everything?

621
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,559
The job wasn't done well,

622
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:39,880
but there are no loose ends.
Don't worry.

623
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,279
I messed this one up.

624
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:45,400
Should I

625
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,000
find you another child?

626
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,440
No need.

627
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,880
You'll still get paid.

628
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,759
No, that won't do.

629
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,680
I didn't finish the job well.

630
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,880
I let you down.

631
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,319
It's under strict watch now.

632
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,440
Put the labor company on hold.

633
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,000
Understood.

634
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,960
Gang,

635
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,440
why are you calling?

636
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,519
Look into Fu Haochen's company

637
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,519
in Shencheng.

638
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,880
See if they're having new investments

639
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,880
or

640
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,039
dealings with other firms.

641
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,799
All right.

642
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,680
Gang,

643
00:30:57,977 --> 00:31:00,222
the cops are cracking down right now.

644
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,319
Maybe we should slow down

645
00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:04,133
the overseas labor business.

646
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,000
We can't stop.

647
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:08,440
Wealth comes with risk.
That's how we do things.

648
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,279
Fu Haochen.

649
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,200
Tell us

650
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:24,440
about the child.

651
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,319
I believe you already know about

652
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,599
my wife's condition.

653
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,920
After she gave birth,

654
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:36,222
she suffered
severe postpartum depression.

655
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,960
Our child passed away

656
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,200
at one year old,

657
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,880
and her condition

658
00:31:42,111 --> 00:31:43,355
only got worse.

659
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,799
Given

660
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:47,559
her state

661
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,960
and the situation in our family,

662
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,079
I decided to adopt a child.

663
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:54,640
Adopt?

664
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,109
Do you know
what conditions you must meet

665
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,822
to legally adopt a child in our country?

666
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,000
Conditions...

667
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,279
I'm not sure.

668
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,799
Then let me tell you.

669
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,359
According to the law,

670
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,349
an adopter cannot suffer
from any medical condition

671
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,911
that makes them unfit to adopt a child.

672
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,839
Do you think,
with your wife's condition,

673
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,200
she meets that requirement?

674
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,359
But I really had no choice.

675
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:20,510
Our family needs to carry on, don't we?

676
00:32:21,288 --> 00:32:22,640
We still need to carry on somehow.

677
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,666
Where did this child come from?

678
00:32:29,422 --> 00:32:31,355
One of my business partners said

679
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,200
there was a baby

680
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,880
abandoned by a couple in the mountains.

681
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,030
The child was at a welfare home.

682
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,920
Right, when they brought the baby over,

683
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,711
they had welfare home papers with them.

684
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,720
Those papers were fake.

685
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,640
This child was kidnapped off the street

686
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,559
by a suspect.

687
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,200
I really didn't know that.

688
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,279
I swear I didn't.

689
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,666
Whether you know it or not,
we'll verify that.

690
00:32:54,955 --> 00:32:56,488
Who is your business partner?

691
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,640
Ye Xiuming.

692
00:32:57,888 --> 00:32:59,622
Ye Xiuming from Dingshun Group.

693
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:06,440
Officers,

694
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,799
I don't know anything else.

695
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,559
I just delivered the kid.

696
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,880
Then why were you

697
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
at Fu Haochen's place

698
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:16,680
and the scene of the incident?

699
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,880
Let me refresh your memory.

700
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:25,070
On the 21st of this month,

701
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,555
you staged a car accident

702
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:28,955
at the intersection
of Renmin Road and Guangshun Road

703
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,977
and utilized the chaos to abduct
Hu Xiaolu's daughter, Tang Zhikui.

704
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:32,559
Later,

705
00:33:32,755 --> 00:33:34,720
you pretended to be
a welfare home staff member

706
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,119
and handed Tang Zhikui

707
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,400
to Fu Haochen.

708
00:33:37,511 --> 00:33:39,244
And you're saying you knew nothing?

709
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,279
Confessing now

710
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,079
or confessing after we find the truth

711
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,480
are totally different cases.

712
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,960
You're the prime suspect in this case.

713
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,079
You can stay silent,

714
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,400
but that won't help you.

715
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,279
I...

716
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:56,519
I...

717
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,039
I'll confess.

718
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:00,640
Officers, I...

719
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,666
I'll tell you everything.

720
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,720
I'll tell you everything.

721
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,955
About two years ago,

722
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
I met a guy online.

723
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,800
Sometimes,

724
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:15,960
he'd give me some money.

725
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,280
All I had to do was place an order,

726
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,709
like renting a car

727
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,711
or arranging a delivery.

728
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,440
Before the car accident,

729
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,760
that guy contacted me again.

730
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,519
He told me to hit a car.

731
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,599
I had no idea why.

732
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,599
I thought maybe he had a beef

733
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,760
with someone

734
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:34,333
and wanted me to scare them a little.

735
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,320
This guy

736
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,079
always treated me well,

737
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,480
so I couldn't turn him down.

738
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,639
What is his name?

739
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,800
I don't know his real name.

740
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,639
I only know his username is Ding Fengbo.

741
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,760
(- Teach them a lesson for me.
- Okay, Bo.)

742
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,880
I called him "Bo".

743
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
Have you met him?

744
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,559
Never.

745
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,480
We only talked online.

746
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,480
After you questioned me last time,

747
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,920
I tried to reach him immediately.

748
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,639
But I didn't expect him

749
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,400
to delete his account!

750
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:17,022
Trying to dump everything on me?

751
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:19,920
Officers,

752
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,159
I honestly didn't know
it was a kidnapping.

753
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,549
If I had,

754
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,355
I'd never have done it.

755
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,440
Why wouldn't you?

756
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,039
You took a baby girl without a guardian

757
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,679
and drove her all the way to Shencheng.

758
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,079
Where's the mother?

759
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,709
Mister, taking a child
with you on a long trip

760
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,155
must've been really inconvenient.

761
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,760
No, Officer.

762
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,079
Please listen to me.

763
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,079
That all happened later.

764
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,320
After the accident,

765
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:51,510
I realized
the mother had lost her child.

766
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,719
I knew it was serious,

767
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,079
so I kept trying to reach Bo,

768
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,039
but he wouldn't reply.

769
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,159
I kept texting him.

770
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,320
He only got back to me late that night.

771
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,039
He told me to find that van

772
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,119
and deliver whatever was inside

773
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
to Shencheng,

774
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,320
as he instructed.

775
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:08,222
I went to the location he gave me

776
00:36:08,244 --> 00:36:08,888
to find him.

777
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,719
When I got there,

778
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,119
I never expected

779
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,159
there'd be a kid in the van.

780
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,109
Since you saw a kid,

781
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,509
why didn't you call the police?

782
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,760
Why did you follow his instructions
and send the kid away?

783
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,880
No, I didn't want to.

784
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,159
But Bo

785
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,320
threatened me. He said

786
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:25,155
there's no way I could clear my name.

787
00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:26,044
He said

788
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:26,760
if I refused,

789
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,119
he'd report me to the cops.

790
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,159
I...

791
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,960
I panicked.

792
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,960
Then why did you go to Fu Haochen?

793
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,119
I did everything Bo told me to.

794
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,555
But when I asked for my payment,

795
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,355
he deleted his account.

796
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,079
Officers,

797
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,280
I was scammed.

798
00:36:48,755 --> 00:36:49,760
I did the job for nothing.

799
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,519
I couldn't accept that.

800
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,400
The only person I knew was Fu Haochen.

801
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,519
Since I handed the kid to him...

802
00:36:57,044 --> 00:36:59,222
I thought I could at least
get some money back from him.

803
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,039
Did you notice anything suspicious

804
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:05,960
during the whole thing?

805
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,039
Nothing really.

806
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,079
I was busy

807
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,760
arguing with that woman.

808
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:13,280
Everything happened so fast

809
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,577
that I barely had time to react.

810
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,559
The guy who grabbed the kid

811
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,559
was wearing a mask

812
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:18,880
and glasses.

813
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,559
Completely covered up.

814
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:21,840
I couldn't see a thing.

815
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,199
He was quick.

816
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:25,070
Really quick...

817
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,559
Bracelet.

818
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,239
What bracelet?

819
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:35,000
The guy who grabbed the kid

820
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,119
had a bracelet on his wrist.

821
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,400
My car was hit...

822
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:47,599
Kui!

823
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,440
Kui!

824
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:49,599
Where are you going?

825
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,840
Kui!

826
00:37:52,511 --> 00:37:54,133
- Kui!
- Xiaolu!

827
00:37:58,133 --> 00:37:59,630
Based on Ding Shuncheng's statement,

828
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,719
he didn't see the kidnapper's face,

829
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,960
but he thought

830
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:04,600
it was a young man.

831
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,644
He also mentioned the person
wore a jade bracelet.

832
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,960
A young man wearing a jade bracelet?

833
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:11,288
Could it have been a woman
disguised as a man?

834
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,519
I'm starting to feel

835
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,840
that this case

836
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,088
is linked to Cripple.

837
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:24,920
Also,

838
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,280
Fu Haochen admitted

839
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:28,822
that the person who gave him the child

840
00:38:30,244 --> 00:38:31,800
was Ye Xiuming from Dingshun Group.

841
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,679
Ye Xiuming,

842
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,559
do you know

843
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:43,440
the child you gave to Fu Haochen
was abducted?

844
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:45,400
Abducted?

845
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:47,960
That's impossible.

846
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,079
How could that be?

847
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:55,960
I knew all along

848
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,044
Fu Haochen wanted to adopt a child,

849
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:00,280
but was facing hurdles.

850
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:02,911
Later, I had my secretary handle it.

851
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:03,960
And he managed

852
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,244
to get it done.

853
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,559
Consider it

854
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,079
a favor he owed me.

855
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,360
What's

856
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,222
your secretary's name?

857
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,639
Zhang Quanzhi.

858
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:17,555
How long has he been with you?

859
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,480
Seven or eight years.

860
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:25,159
How did your secretary, Zhang Quanzhi,

861
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,280
arrange for the adoption?

862
00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:29,355
It should have been through
proper channels.

863
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,719
The paperwork

864
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:31,960
was all in order.

865
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,444
Everything went smoothly.

866
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,320
Once it was done,

867
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:37,440
Fu Haochen

868
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,239
gave us

869
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:39,920
a project

870
00:39:40,555 --> 00:39:42,466
as a way of repaying the favor.

871
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Do you know the online username
"Ding Fengbo"?

872
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:46,760
No, I don't.

873
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,022
Do you know Ding Shuncheng?

874
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:53,159
Ding... who?

875
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,333
Ding Shuncheng.

876
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,119
Ding Shuncheng...

877
00:40:02,177 --> 00:40:03,000
Businessmen like me

878
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,440
know a lot of people,

879
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,760
but that name

880
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,159
doesn't ring a bell.

881
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,577
I don't think I know him.

882
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,199
Where were you on October 21?

883
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,159
October 21.

884
00:40:17,822 --> 00:40:19,955
I should have been in a company meeting.

885
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,559
Yes, I was in a meeting at the office.

886
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,111
My staff and executives
can testify for me.

887
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,760
One more question.

888
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,709
Does your company

889
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,400
have any dealings with Tianhai Lucky?

890
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:35,639
No, we don't.

891
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,377
(Tianhai Lucky)
(We sometimes had business dinners)

892
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,480
(in Tianhai Lucky,)

893
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,920
(but I personally
don't like that place.)

894
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,719
Am I considered a VIP here, Mr. Liu?

895
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:48,360
Yes, of course.

896
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,777
I need to find you myself, though.

897
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,670
My bad.

898
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,559
Sirs,

899
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,559
let me introduce a friend.

900
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,639
This is Mr. Liu,
the owner of Tianhai Lucky.

901
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:58,320
Mr. Liu.

902
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:58,880
Mr. Xu.

903
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,440
A pleasure.

904
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,599
This is Mr. Huang.

905
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,880
Let me give you a toast.

906
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,933
May your business prosper.

907
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,488
Have a seat, please.

908
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:09,320
Please.

909
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,159
Let me introduce you properly.

910
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,079
Come.

911
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,719
This is my boss,

912
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,960
Mr. Ye, CEO of Dingshun Group.

913
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:18,511
Nice to meet you. I'm Liu Gang.

914
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,519
I'm so grateful.

915
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,360
Let me toast to you.

916
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,911
You've got to add a little more.

917
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,480
Alright.

918
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,222
You can really hold your drink, Mr. Liu.

919
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Allow me to go first.

920
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:36,280
Please have a seat.

921
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,559
Mr. Liu,

922
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,880
this is Mr. Ye's first time here.

923
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,044
We can't just drink like this.

924
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:44,679
Oh.

925
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,280
Come in.

926
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:50,679
Mr. Wu.

927
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,480
Mr. Ye.

928
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,088
Hello, Mr. Ye. Hello, Mr. Wu.

929
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,079
Well, if there's nothing else,
I'll step away.

930
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,119
You can come back later.

931
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:00,920
I will.

932
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:01,509
Mr. Ye,

933
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,911
if you need anything, let me know.

934
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:03,480
Thank you.

935
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,200
No problem.

936
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,400
Alright.

937
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,239
We've reviewed your situation.

938
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:12,440
If we have more questions,

939
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,639
we hope you'll cooperate with us.

940
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,400
Of course, I will.

941
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,180
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

942
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,444
(Here's the list of all companies)

943
00:42:24,444 --> 00:42:27,160
(and contract amounts Lu Sheng's company
signed with Dingshun Group)

944
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,749
(during Zheng Weiwei's
abduction period.)

945
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,822
(Dingshun Group?)

946
00:42:30,355 --> 00:42:31,244
(Anything wrong?)

947
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,039
(I'd like to know...)

948
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,360
Does Lu Sheng's case

949
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,559
have a big impact

950
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,159
on Dingshun?

951
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,000
Definitely.

952
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,559
Don't worry.

955
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,639

Xiuming's pretty resourceful.)

According to Ye Xiuming's secretary,

957
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:51,670
after receiving instructions,

958
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,266
he logged into
the welfare home's website

959
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:54,888
and submitted Fu Haochen's information

960
00:42:54,911 --> 00:42:55,977
to apply for adoption.

961
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,440

964
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:02,070
