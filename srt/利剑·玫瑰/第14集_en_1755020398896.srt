=Episode 14=

3
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,400
Will this Lu Sheng case

4
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,430
have a big impact on Dingshun?

5
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,520
Of course.

6
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,230
Right now, our company's finances
are extremely tight.

7
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:47,844
There's a huge hole to fill.

8
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:49,222
I don't even know where to start.

9
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:50,150
If things get worse,

10
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,120
I'll have to go out
and chase down clients myself.

11
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,400
Not the first time I've done that.

12
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,840
Who introduced Lu Sheng

13
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,950
to Dingshun for business?

14
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,555
Our deputy general manager.

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,950
Are they close?

16
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,190
Definitely not.

17
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:10,444
If they were, would he have
taken on a deal like that?

18
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,280
But things are tough
in foreign trade right now.

19
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,150
Otherwise, we wouldn't be scrambling
to take every deal,

20
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,888
causing this much trouble for ourselves.

21
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:27,090
(Dingshun Group)
Did Director Deng send us to Dingshun

22
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:28,622
because she suspected something?

23
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:30,550
She said the contract
between Lu Sheng and Dingshun

24
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:32,577
was handled by a deputy general manager
named Wu Bin.

25
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,640
Hello.

26
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,750
Hi.

27
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:37,270
We're here to see Wu Bin.

28
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,470
Mr. Wu, yes?

29
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,310
This way, please.

30
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,000
Officers,

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,080
I've made up my mind.

32
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:54,111
I want to report something.

33
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
I want to cooperate.

34
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:56,960
Who are you reporting?

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Wait.

36
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,960
Can I ask something?

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,240
Do I get anything

38
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,120
for reporting this?

39
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,710
Start talking first.

40
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,120
How much

41
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,590
is saving a kid worth?

42
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,290
You think
this is some kind of flea market

43
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,422
where we haggle over prices?

44
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:12,840
If you want to say it, say it.

45
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,680
I'll talk.

46
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,190
I'll talk.

47
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,680
It's...

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,640
It's She Qinglin's kid.

49
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:21,555
The child was kidnapped
about a month ago.

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,080
Who is She Qinglin?

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,120
The general manager
of Kaiyi Trading Company.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,800
Officers,

53
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:33,430
is there anything you need from me?

54
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,960
We just want to understand a few things.

55
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,400
Go ahead.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,150
Do you have a client named Lu Sheng?

57
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,590
Yes.

58
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,430
Did he recently sign a big deal?

59
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,590
Yes.

60
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,577
As you know,

61
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,520
our company handles import
and export trade in Southeast Asia.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,910
Lu Sheng signed a contract with us

63
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,710
to buy dendrobium from Qinmang.

64
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,590
We fronted him five million
for the purchase,

65
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,990
but then

66
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:03,333
there was a shipping accident.

67
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,400
To date,

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,750
his company still hasn't

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,590
reimbursed us.

70
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,030
That's a large sum.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,470
Surely

72
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,711
that means you have
a strong relationship with him.

73
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,750
Well, there was

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
a certain level of trust
from previous deals.

75
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,270
Why didn't he file
a missing child report?

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,440
Are you lying to us?

77
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,680
No, I'm not!

78
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,120
Please calm down.

79
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,430
I'll start from the beginning.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,630
I think

81
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,600
it was

82
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,560
two months ago.

83
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,750
She Qinglin came

84
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,310
to our company to buy dendrobium.

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
Smaller companies like his
usually don't need much.

86
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,270
So,

87
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,430
as usual,

88
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,040
I collected the deposit first.

89
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,390
Then we had Dingshun Group handle

90
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,279
the shipment from Qinmang.

91
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,390
Who could have known
a shipping disaster would happen?

92
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,870
The whole shipment was lost.

93
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,679
Since then,

94
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,888
She Qinglin has been showing up
at my office every day,

95
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:50,733
causing a scene.

96
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,720
Do you know Lu Sheng personally?

97
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,710
Are you close?

98
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,240
We've run into each other a few times.

99
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,510
What's he like in real life?

100
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,600
He's got a temper,

101
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:02,111
and he's a bit of a womanizer.

102
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,160
I'm coming in.

103
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,590
Come here!

104
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,333
Where do you think you're going?

105
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,680
I'm coming to get you!

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,222
Where do you think you're going?

107
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,230
Mr. Lu?

108
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,790
Sorry.

109
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,422
I had a little too much to drink

110
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:24,660
and walked into the wrong room.

111
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,310
My bad.

112
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,270
Excuse me.

113
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,230
Sorry.

114
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,040
Really sorry

115
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,350
to bother you.

116
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,400
(Walking in on that)

117
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,470
(was awkward.)

118
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,560
(I left in a hurry.)

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,840
So

120
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,110
that's what happened.

121
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,160
Was this the girl?

122
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,480
Uh,

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
it was a while back.

124
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:48,111
I don't remember all the details,

125
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,030
but

126
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,350
she had long hair.

127
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,390
He came to my office every day,

128
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,750
making a fuss.

129
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,920
He just wouldn't stop.

130
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,390
Tell us why
Skinner kidnapped She Qinglin's kid.

131
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,160
Like I said,

132
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,680
he was like a leech,

133
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,040
sticking to me day after day.

134
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,510
I just got sick of it.

135
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
Mr. Lu.

136
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,350
Have a seat.

137
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:12,160
I'll just stand.

138
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,911
I need to talk to you about something.

139
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,150
What is it?

140
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,110
Mr. Lu,

141
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,600
I've already paid.

142
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,190
And now you're telling me
the goods are gone?

143
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,560
You...

144
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,040
at least owe us an explanation.

145
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,350
Qinglin,

146
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,120
I already told you.

147
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:37,000
The shipping accident
was a natural disaster.

148
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,555
There's nothing I can do about it.

149
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,830
If I don't get that shipment,

150
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,240
you've got to refund me.

151
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,190
Otherwise,

152
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,830
I'm going bankrupt, Mr. Lu.

153
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,470
She Qinglin,

154
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:50,133
don't you think you're going too far?

155
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:53,360
You waited for me outside my office
the day before yesterday.

156
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:55,280
Yesterday, you cornered me
in the parking lot.

157
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,920
And now you're showing up at my house.

158
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,311
What exactly do you want from me?

159
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,070
Go back

160
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,488
and read that contract again.

161
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,480
It clearly says losses

162
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,240
from force majeure

163
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,040
are shared by both parties.

164
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:11,466
You want me to refund you?

165
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Then who will refund me?

166
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,320
I...

167
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,240
I understand

168
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,680
what the contract says.

169
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,310
But I'm out of options here.

170
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,560
I'm desperate, Mr. Lu.

171
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,310
Please...

172
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:24,270
Please just reconsider.

173
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,710
If you would...

174
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,480
Just...

175
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,440
Just give me half.

176
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,630
Half would be enough.

177
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,470
She Qinglin.

178
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,000
Listen up.

179
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:32,510
You're not getting a single cent back.

180
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,640
If you don't like it,

181
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,190
sue me.

182
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,440
Got it?

183
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,400
Get out!

184
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,390
Mr. Lu...

185
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,350
Ms. Zhang!

186
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,310
Show him out.

187
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,950
Mr. Lu, please, just hear me out....

188
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,466
Mr. Lu...

189
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:43,066
Please leave.

190
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:43,510
Stop...

191
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,350
Get out of my sight!

192

194
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,430
You listen to me!

195
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,640
Don't try me!

196
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,680
If I go down,

197
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,600
you're coming with me!

198
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,400
I give you an inch,
and you take a mile. Leave!

199
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:53,933
Please leave.

200
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,390
Don't push me! I can walk on my own.

201
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:56,666
You're going to regret this!

202
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Here's my problem...

203
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,022
(That makes you an accomplice.)

204
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,890
You were the one
who told Skinner to do it.

205
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,310
I'm not an accomplice!

206
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,040
That's not what I meant.

207
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,950
All I wanted

208
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,750
was for Skinner

209
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,920
to scare him off.

210
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Make him stop bothering me.

211
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,800
I never meant

212
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,070
for him to actually

213
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,480
kidnap the kid.

214
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,680
You scared me.

215
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
What are you doing here?

216
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,640
I'm begging you.

217
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Please.

218
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,640
Mr. Lu,

219
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,120
I don't want the money anymore.

220
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,600
Just don't hurt my child.

221
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,480
Please, Mr. Lu.

222
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,670
Please don't hurt my child.

223
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,240
Please...

224
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,530
What are you even talking about?

225
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,480
Who hurt your kid?

226
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,550
If you say that again,
I'll sue you for slander!

227
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,270
Mr. Lu,

228
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,030
I'm begging you.

229
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,720
I said. Get lost!

230
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,360
Did you hear me?

231
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,790
Please!

Just don't hurt my child.

I'm begging you.

235
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,270
- I don't need the money anymore...
- Security!

236
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,440
Get him out of here!

237
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,840
Please, Mr. Lu!

238
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,933
Stop causing a scene here!

239
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,040
Mr. Lu!

240
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,750
Mr. Lu,

241
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,080
I don't want the money anymore!

242
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,720
Don't hurt my child,

243
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,560
Mr. Lu!

244
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,390
I don't want the money anymore!

245
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,150
This is inhumane.

246
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,480
No conscience at all.

247
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,670
I'm not that kind of person.

248
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,270
I'm only saying all this

249
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,720
because I want credit

250
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,120
for cooperating.

251
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:15,990
All right.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

252
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,080
Don't leave!

253
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,440
Officers,

254
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,630
this counts
as a major contribution, right?

255
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,510
Officers!

256
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,840
Does this count?

258
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,360
Mr. Liu,

259
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,440
do you know Fei Yan?

260
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,680
Fei Yan?

261
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,870
Mr. Fei, right?

262
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,550
Yes.

263
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:36,711
He's a regular
at Tianhai Lucky Entertainment Center.

264
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,750
Likes to spend big.

265
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Do you know him well?

266
00:09:40,577 --> 00:09:41,960
Officer, that's a funny question...

267
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:44,533
Let me put it this way.

268
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,600
I know almost everyone

269
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,790
who's been to Tianhai Lucky.

270
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,120
But knowing someone
doesn't mean we're close.

271
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,030
Did something happen to him?

272
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:57,870
Do you have security footage?

273
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,120
We do, but not much.

274
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:02,120
And we only keep footage

275
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,960
for about a month...

276
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,200
Take us to the security room.

277
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,880
Of course.

278
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,840
Come with me.

is that him?

284
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,630
Yes, that's the guy.

285
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,670
Was that the last time you saw him?

286
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,440
Yes.

287
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,870
What happened to him?

288
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,670
Do you know...

289
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,630
Enough.

292
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,288
If he contacts you again,

293
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,600
please let us know right away.

294
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,720
Of course.

295
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,630

(Linshan City Police Bureau)

298

We checked the client records
for Tianhai Lucky.

299
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:12,670
Fei Yan really was a regular there,

300
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,600
but it all looked like normal spending.

301
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,630
Nothing unusual.

302
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,266
What about Liu Gang?
What do you think of him?

303
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,000
Also seemed normal.

304
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,000
When we asked how he knew Fei Yan,

305
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,750
he just said Fei was a customer.

306
00:11:25,822 --> 00:11:27,890
They didn't have much
of a relationship beyond that.

307
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,533
I think Liu Gang is hiding something.

308
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,080
It felt like he knew we would show up.

309
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,120
Knew what we would ask.

310
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,080

we spoke with Wu Bin.

315
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,000
So far, nothing suspicious.

316
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,550
But he did give us

317
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,030
one lead.

318
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:53,910
He said he saw Lu Sheng at Tianhai Lucky

319
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,120
with a girl

320
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720

just do it! No questions asked.

and things you don't.

367

do you think is true?

He's not getting out
of his sexual assault charge.

That name rings a bell.

379
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,440
Do you have anything to do

380
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,555
with his child's abduction?

381
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,000
Definitely not.

382
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,200
Officer,
I'd never do something as horrible

383
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,360
as trafficking children.

384
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,120
Let me remind you

385
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,910
that this case ties back to Mr. Li.

386
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,670
Mr. Li?

387
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,440
Right. That incident.

388
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,000
She Qinglin rubbed Mr. Li the wrong way,

389
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,000
so he told me to send a couple of guys

390
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,390
to "teach him a lesson".

391
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,320
That part is true.

392
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,200
Listen. I don't want that woman anymore.

393
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,080
Send her back.

394
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,030
I'm done with her!

395
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,150
All right, all right.

396
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,670
Calm down.

397
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,155
Give me a couple of days.

398
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,840
I'll find you someone better.

399
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,533
Just wait for my call, all right?

400
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,200
What happened?

401
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,200
Who or what's got you

402
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,480
so worked up?

403
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,150
They're just some pathetic thugs.

404
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,600
They're not even worth my time.

405
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,333
Come on,

406
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,270
thugs are my specialty.

407
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,360
Tell me who,

408
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,030
and I'll handle it for you.

409
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,920
Lu.

410
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,350
Here's my problem...

411
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,800
And how did you handle it?

412
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,750
Be specific.

413
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,910
Well,

414
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:21,888
I was just feeling things out at first.

415
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,630
Before I could even get rolling,

416
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,160
I got a call

417
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,480
from Old Yellow Dog.

418
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,750
You mean

419
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,040
Huang Chuan?

420
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,790
(I don't know his real name.)

421
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,390
(Everyone on the street calls him)

422
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:34,480
(Old Yellow Dog.)

423
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,320
(Could be)

424
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,360
(the same guy?)

425
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,550
Why did he call?

426
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,155
Asked to borrow some money.

427
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,000
Finally,

428
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,510
you're here.

429
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,680
Dog,

430
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,110
what's so urgent?

431
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,960
We can't be seen together.

432
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:30,088
Cripple doesn't like it.

433
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,750
If he finds out

434
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,760
about this...

435
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,110
I'm desperate.

436
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,720
Skinner,

437
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,030
I'm in a tough spot.

438
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,510
You have to help me.

439
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,240
Dog,

440
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,720
you're one

441
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,110
of Cripple's

442
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,880
biggest suppliers.

443
00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:49,755
You've got your own turf, just like me.

444
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,750
What happened

445
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,030
to you?

446
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,390
Don't ask.

447
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:54,800
The cops have been

448
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,110
cracking down hard.

449
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,920
They raided my territory.

450
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,880
Madam Hong disappeared

451
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,750
and took all my money with her.

452
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,590
You left all your money

453
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,160
with her?

454
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,640
We'd been living and running things
together for 20 years.

455
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,070
Never thought she'd bail on me

456
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:16,150
when things went south

457
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,550
and take all the money too.

458
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,240
Dog,

459
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,590
sounds like that was true love.

460
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,710
Look, man,

461
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,550
things are heating up right now.

462
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,200
I have to get out of Linshan fast.

463
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,630
Please,

464
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,630
lend me some money.

465
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,430
I swear

466
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,880
I'll pay you back.

467
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,840
Dog,

468
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,080
why not

469
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,750
go to Cripple?

470
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,070
You think I didn't try?

471
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,040
But can you even track him down?

472
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,510
You know how he is.

473
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,990
I'm begging you.

474
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,950
Help me.

475
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,110
Please.

476
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,200
When I bounce back,

477
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,760
I promise

478
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,160
I'll pay double.

479
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,630
Dog.

480
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,720
I can't

481
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,200
lend you money.

482
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,666
That'd break the rules.

483
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,800
However,

484
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,910
I can hook you up

485
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,200
with a job that pays fast.

486
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,950
What job?

487
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,560
Well...

488
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,830
I don't know what happened

489
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,840
after that.

490
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,080
Wang Guangqing,

491
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,830
you say
you're against child trafficking.

492
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,680
So why give Huang Chuan

493
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,030
that idea?

494
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,920
That's aiding and abetting.
You understand that?

495
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,790
How is that aiding?

496
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,000
He wouldn't stop calling
and pestering me.

497
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,200
Mr. Li needed to hire someone

498
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,440
to teach She Qinglin a lesson.

499
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,110
I never told him to kidnap a kid,

500
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,320
right?

501
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:40,288
Did he contact you again after that?

502
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,910
No.

503
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,920
Do you remember what he looks like?

504
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,000
In his 50s.

505
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,280
And

506
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,510
average height.

507
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,270
Kind of balding.

508
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,720
His most obvious

509
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,760
feature

510
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,030
is a mole

511
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,680
right here

512
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,520
on his face.

513
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,640
Bring in the sketch artist.

514
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,040
All right.

515
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,260
(Anti-abduction Office)

516
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,750
How did it go, Mr. Yin?

517
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,111
Wang Guangqing talked.

518
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,350
She Qinglin's child

519
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,310
is connected to Huang Chuan.

520
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:18,080
Here's his statement.

521
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:21,070
But Jiajia checked the system.

522
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,960
She Qinglin didn't file
a missing child report.

523
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,280
Director.

524
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,169
Vice Director Yin.

525
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,490
Here's the sketch of Huang Chuan.

526
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,800
Take a look.

527
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,790
This sketch

528
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,030
is a big step forward.

529
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,350
Should I ask Chief Xiao

530
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,750
for approval

531
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,910
to issue a warrant?

532
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,280
Not yet.

533
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,520
No need to rush.

534
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:45,333
We've been after this guy

535
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:46,177
for 20 years.

536
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,280
He's slippery.

537
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,510
Issuing a warrant now

538
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,270
might just scare him off.

539
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,760
Right.

540
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,640
And we still need

541
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,590
more intel on him.

542
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,990
I already sent

543
00:20:58,066 --> 00:21:00,111
Yan Lei and Jiajia
to follow up with She Qinglin.

544
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,044
Let's hear what he has to say first.

545
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:13,460
(Kaiyi Trading Company)

546
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,270
(Company For Sale)

547
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,466
200,000, and it's yours.

548
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,400
We can negotiate.

549
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,340
(General Manager)

550
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,830
180,000 works too.

551
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,590
When can you come by?

552
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,110
Okay, got it.

553
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,830
Are you here to check out the company?

554
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:31,910
I can show you around.

555
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,310
We're police. We need your cooperation
for an investigation.

556
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,390
What's this about?

557
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,070
We're here regarding

558
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,160
your contract dispute with Lu Sheng.

559
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,630
Officers,

560
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,422
that matter was already settled.

561
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:47,888
There's nothing more to discuss.

562
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,488
According to Lu Sheng,

563
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:51,480
you approached him
about your missing child.

564
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,040
Um...

565
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,000
No, I didn't.

566
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,760
Are you sure?

567
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,000
That's not what we heard.

568
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:00,120
It's a misunderstanding.

569
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:01,333
Just a misunderstanding.

570
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,750
My son is fine.

571
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,280
Officers,

572
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm about

573
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,640
to sell the company.

574
00:22:06,844 --> 00:22:07,840
I'm done with business.

575
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,600
I'm going back to farming.

576
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,070
Thank you for your concern.

577
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,200
I'm really busy today.

578
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,533
I can't entertain you.

579
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,760
Please leave.

580
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,870
Please.

581
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,310
Let's go.

582
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,150
Yes, that's me.

583
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,960
Yes, I'm selling the company.

584
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,830
The price is negotiable.

585
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:32,688
She Qinglin is definitely

586
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:33,590
hiding something.

587
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,520
I think so too.

588
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,509
Let's report back
to Director Deng first.

589
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,910
Let's go.

590
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,870
All right.

591
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,820
(Kaiyi Trading Company For Sale)

592
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,070
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

593
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,910
(Jiajia,)

594
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,600
(are you sure She Qinglin
never reported it to the police?)

595
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,720
He didn't.

596
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,040
He said
it was all just a misunderstanding.

597
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,750
But both main suspects

598
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,960
have already admitted
to kidnapping the child.

599
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,960
If he's the victim,
why would he cover it up?

600
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,822
That means something's off
with the victim.

601
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,300
(Wang Guangqing,
Old Yellow Dog, Madam Hong)

602
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:18,200
The case involving Lu Sheng

603
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,110
and Zheng Weiwei is connected

604
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,070
to Wang Guangqing,

605
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:24,960
and She Qinglin's son's abduction

606
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,550
is also tied to Wang Guangqing.

607
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,720
And both of them have links
to the dendrobium trade.

608
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:36,480
We need to keep digging
into She Qinglin.

609
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,160
So his son really is with him.

610
00:23:49,777 --> 00:23:51,111
Good thing the boy's safe.

611
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,880
But why is he moving now?

612
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:02,155
Obviously, he's trying to avoid someone.

613
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,350
Yan Lei,

614
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,790
check the surveillance footage
from the property management.

615
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,520
Director,

616
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,480
we found something.

617
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,070
Let's go, Cong.

618
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,350
She Qinglin,

619
00:24:28,822 --> 00:24:30,480
we need to ask you a few more questions.

620
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,560
Officer,

621
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,840
I've already

622
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,070
told you everything.

623
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,310
My child is fine.

624
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,350
See?

625
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,790
He's right here.

626
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,510
I've got nothing more to say.

627
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,710
And

628
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,030
I'm already moving,

629
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,350
so please

630
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,110
just leave me alone.

631
00:24:46,955 --> 00:24:48,240
Cooperating with the police

632
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,480
is every citizen's duty.

633
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,070
We won't take up much of your time.

634
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,960
This will only take a few minutes.

635
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,110
All right.

636
00:24:57,577 --> 00:25:00,240
Here's footage from the security cameras
in your residential area.

637
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:07,820
(Entrance Surveillance)

638
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,910
You're mistaken.

639
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,830
That old man is a distant relative.

640
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,320
He was just joking.

641
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,590
It was a prank.

642
00:25:17,622 --> 00:25:19,066
He returned our son right afterward.

643
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:21,888
That old man goes
by the name "Old Yellow Dog."

644
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,350
He has a history
of child trafficking offenses.

645
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,755
We've been tracking him for years.

646
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,222
We hope you can provide any leads,

647
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:28,888
so we can catch him as soon as possible.

648
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,720
So your son really

649
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,680
was kidnapped before?

650
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,990
Moving won't help

651
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,160
if he's not caught.

652
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,590
If he did it once,

653
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,840
he'll do it again.

654
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,150
Do you hear that?

655
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,880
That man really is a trafficker.

656
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:45,640
What are you talking about?
A trafficker?

657
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,430
What trafficker?

658
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,590
Our son is right here.

659
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,310
I'm not making things up!

660
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,822
The police are right here!

661
00:25:50,822 --> 00:25:52,488
This is the time
to tell them everything!

662
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,400
Tell them!

663
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,310
Do you want us to lose Cong again?

664
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,780
(Entrance Surveillance)

665
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,070
(That day was August 9, 2009.)

666
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
(I got a strange text
while I was at work,)

667
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,600
(so I rushed straight home.)

668
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,960
Cong?

669
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,390
Cong!

670
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,430
Cong!

671
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,040
Where's Cong?

672
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,640
He's gone...

673
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,622
Did you call the police?

674
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:38,030
Not yet. I'll call them now.

675
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,870
Wait.

676
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,190
(I have your son.)

677
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,840
(Drop 30,000 in the trash bin
at the bus stop by 9 PM.)

678
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,400
(If you call the police,
you'll never see your son again.)

679
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:45,440
Do we have money in the house?

680
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,630
Yes!

681
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,590
Go get it!

682
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,700
(Sanitation Worker Rest Area)

683
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,720
Give me the money.

684
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,750
There's no one around.

685
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,550
Cong...

686
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,030
Quiet.

687
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,000
Let's get out of here.

688
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,840
Let's go.

689
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,110
Come on.

690
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,590
Did you get

691
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,110
your child back after paying?

692
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,320
No.

693
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:42,980
(Even after I dropped off the money,)

694
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,920
(our son didn't come back
at the agreed time.)

695
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,844
It's already past midnight.

696
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,350
When is Cong coming back?

697
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,040
Calm down.

698
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,110
I can't calm down!

699
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,440
Will our son really come back?

700
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,320
I'm calling the police!

701
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,920
No! We can't call the police!

702
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,960
Why not?

703
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,400
Let them investigate!

704
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,860
If we call them, they'll kill our boy!

705
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:09,679
That's nonsense!

706
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,850
Let's wait a little longer.

707
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:11,920
I'm done waiting!

708
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,920
- Calm down.
- Give me...

709
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,377
(Then I got another message)

710
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:17,030
(telling me to think carefully
about who I might have offended.)

711
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:18,311
(That's when it hit me.)

712
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,350
It must be Mr. Lu.

713
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:23,022
I had no choice
but to go apologize to Mr. Lu.

714
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,080
Please.

715
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,550
I don't need the money anymore.

716
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,000
Just don't hurt my child.

717
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,110
I'm begging you, Mr. Lu!

718
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,160
Please don't hurt my child.

719
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,830
Please!

720
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,890
What are you even talking about?
Who hurt your kid?

721
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,866
If you say that again,
I'll sue you for slander!

722
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:36,555
(But strangely,)

723
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,240
(he seemed completely clueless.)

724
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,440
(When I was at a loss for what to do,)

725
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,844
(the kidnapper sent another text
with an address.)

726
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,480
(I went to the address)

727
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:45,600
(and that's where)

728
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,920
(I finally found my son.)

729
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,150
Over there!

730
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,110
He's right there!

731
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,280
- Cong!
- Cong!

732
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,320
- Cong...
- Cong...

733
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,630
It's me.

734
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,030
I'm here, Cong.

735
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,720
It's okay.

736
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,560
Let me hold you.

737
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,780
(I know where you live. Call the police,
and I'll kill all of you.)

738
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,000
(I was terrified.)

739
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,480
(So I never reported it)

740
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,960
(and stopped asking Mr. Lu
about the payment.)

741
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,000
(Later, I heard Mr. Lu got arrested.)

742
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,550
(I was scared those people
would think I tipped off the police)

743
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,590
(and come after me again.)

744
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,160
That's why I wanted

745
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,111
to get out of Linshan
as fast as possible.

746
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,510
That 30,000 was probably

747
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,880
extorted by Huang Chuan.

748
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,590
If they had been reported sooner,

749
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,510
Huang Chuan might already be
in custody now.

750
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:38,270
There's one thing
I still don't understand.

751
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,830
Why did Huang Chuan return the boy?

752
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,400
He got the money.

753
00:29:42,977 --> 00:29:44,400
They already paid the ransom once.

754
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,110
Why stop there?

755
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,160
If he hadn't returned the child,

756
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,970
he could've blackmailed them
over and over.

757
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:51,333
He could've even sold the boy.

758
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,000
It wouldn't be the first time.

759
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,350
So

760
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,790
what made him

761
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,510
back off

762
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,720
this time?

763
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,590
I don't get it either.

764
00:30:01,044 --> 00:30:02,822
Do you think he caught wind of something

765
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,200
and called it off?

766
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,960
What if She Qinglin

767
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,000
had reported it immediately?

768
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,000
We were

769
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,790
interrogating Meng Gui at the time.

770
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:16,110
If he'd gone to the police,

771
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,280
there's a good chance
Huang Chuan would've been caught.

772
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,750
He knew Madam Hong was wanted

773
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,310
and stopped She Qinglin from reporting.

774
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,000
He was scared
Madam Hong would give him up.

775
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:30,310
And the reason
he didn't want that was because...

776
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:32,000
He never planned to leave.

777
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,440
Does that mean

778
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,880
Huang Chuan is still in Linshan?

779
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,430
A few years ago,

780
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,200
we had a case involving
the trafficking of women.

781
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,030
We knew the trafficker was Huang Chuan.

782
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,000
We set up checkpoints
at stations, ports,

783
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,310
and every possible route.

784
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:52,444
But when the time came
for the final arrest,

785
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,750
he got away.

786
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,680
He never came near

787
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,977
the checkpoints.

788
00:30:57,311 --> 00:30:59,590
He slipped away through
the remote mountains and forests.

789
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
That was the closest
I ever came to catching him.

790
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,670
I think

791
00:31:08,355 --> 00:31:09,622
I have a good read on him.

792
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,355
He's different from Wang Guangqing.

793
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:13,640
He targets remote mountain areas,

794
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,155
trafficking women and children there.

795
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,720
So the place he's hiding

796
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,550
has to be
the mountainous regions near Linshan.

797
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,270
There's only one location that fits.

798
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,920
Mangma Town,
at the foot of Shangrui Mountain.

799
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,320
Ai Xin.

800
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:30,466
Get in touch
with the Mangma Town Police Station.

801
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:31,750
Have them issue a public notice

802
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,130
and mobilize the local community.

803
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,488
We can't let that sly fox get away.

804
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,590
Yes.

805
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,660
(Wanted)

806
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,700
(Wanted)

807
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,870
Sir,

808
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,920
how much are these sunglasses?

809
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,000
18.

810
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,840
What about this pair?

811
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,040
20.

812
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,440
Can you go any lower?

813
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,640
They are original imports.

814
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:28,288
That's already a good price.

815
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,790
My hats are imported too.

816
00:32:38,844 --> 00:32:40,000
I'll give you a discount.

817
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,080
Take a look at them.

818
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,630
Director Deng.

819
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,550
We got word from Xu.

820
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,160
Our people

821
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,400
spotted Huang Chuan.

822
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,600
This is the screenshot.

823
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,155
All right. I'll go
with Chang Rui to check it out.

824
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:31,044
I'll go too.

825
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,670
Mr. Yin,

826
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,750
it's a long trip.

827
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,870
Let's split up.

828
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:37,200
You contact the local police station
and set up surveillance.

829
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,511
Chang Rui and I will head over
to assess the situation.

830
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,430
Okay.

831
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,390
Be careful

832
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,550
out there.

833
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,640
Drive!

834
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,740
(September 5, 2009,
Pengcang Mountain, Linshan City)

835
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,910
This is your stop.

836
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,160
All right.

837
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,720
Be safe.

838
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,030
- Chief Xu.
- Chief Xu.

839
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:30,880
Join us.

840
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,920
No, thank you.

841
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,320
Just a few reminders.

842
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,800
There have been

843
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,800
a lot of mountain fires

844
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,550
lately,

845
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,280
so take caution.

846
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,670
If you see any strangers,

847
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,360
call the station immediately.

848
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,470
- All right.
- Yes, Sir.

849
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,470
All right.

850
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,360
No problem.

851
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,440
All right. Thanks.

852
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
Chief Xu, have something.

853
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,280
Join us.

854
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,840
- Take care.
- Take care.

(Forest Ranger)

856
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,980
(Police)

857
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,670
All units, listen up.

858
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,160
Time is of the essence for this mission.

859
00:35:16,177 --> 00:35:18,100
Start the search
from the west side of Pengcang Mountain

860
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,880
and work our way up.

861
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:19,400
Clear?

862
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,200
- Clear!
- Clear!

863
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:22,222
Report any updates to me immediately.

864
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,100
(Forest Ranger)

865
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,840
Sirs,

866
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,800
it's dark.

867
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,000
Can I ask a favor?

868
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:20,510
What's your situation?

869
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,200
I'm just

870
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,280
a hiker.

871
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,800
I like to wander in these mountains.

872
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,190
But this mountain's a bit strange.

873
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,670
I got lost while hiking,

874
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,800
and now it's dark.

875
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,760
Can I stay with you

876
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,120
tonight?

877
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,160
No, you can't.

878
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,760
Something happened here before.

879
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,550
Sirs,

880
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,550
please.

881
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,720
Put that away.

882
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,680
No smoking here.

883
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,030
Look.

884
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:49,488
I'll check with my superior

885
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:51,970
to see if we can send someone
to escort you down the mountain.

886
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,800
But staying overnight

887
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,640
is not an option.

888
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,240
I see.

889
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,510
Then...

890
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,280
Then

891
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,880
I won't bother you.

892
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,990
Thank you.

893
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,150
You two

894
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,990
keep busy.

895
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,500
(Linshan City, Nanjie Province)

896
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,800
Mr. Yin.

897
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,280
Got it.

898
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,550
That woman really

899
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,840
screwed me over.

(Linshan City Police Bureau)

901
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,240
Vice Director Yin.

902
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,377
Director Deng and the others are back.

903
00:38:43,444 --> 00:38:44,550
- You're back.
- Director!

904

(Linshan City Police Bureau)

906
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,470
Get in,

907
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,430
Mr. Yin.

908
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,710
Mr. Yin, you're the hero this time.

909
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,444
We might not have caught Old Yellow Dog
if you hadn't identified

910
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,550
his escape route.

911
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,190
Tell me how you guys caught him.

912
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,440
(After your call,)

913
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,280
(we got the forest rangers to lead us.)

914
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,230
(They said a hiker had gone
into that area)

915
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,550
(the night before.)

916
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,066
(I thought it was strange.)

917
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:37,333
(Who would be heading that way
at a time like this?)

918
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,670
Everyone, stay alert.

919
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:41,133
Things have been unsafe
in the mountains lately.

920
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:42,888
Especially with wild boars
running loose.

921
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,510
Hunters have set plenty of traps.

922
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,977
Don't wander off. Stay close.

923
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,280
Help!

924
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,240
Help!

925
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,280
Help...

926
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,320
Help...

927
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,160
Come and help!

928
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,390
Help...

929
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,510
He's the hiker

930
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,066
who asked to stay with us last night.

931
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:06,240
Don't touch that!

932
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,200
It hurts...

933
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,000
Don't touch that...

934
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,400
We wanted to have someone
escort him down,

935
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,780
but he insisted on exploring more.

936
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,640
Look at him now.

937
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,110
Stubborn old mule.

938
00:40:19,355 --> 00:40:20,430
Now he's in real trouble.

939
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,200
That trap is meant for wild boars.

940
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,990
You're not a boar.

941
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,430
You're Old Yellow Dog.

942
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,933
We got you now.

943
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,311
Just my luck...

944
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,760
(He admitted)

945
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,400
(he heard a wild boar)

946
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,160
and tried to hide,

947
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,030
but ended up stepping into the trap.

948
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,600
That thing

949
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
must've hurt.

950
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,400
We've got a nice present
for the Detention Center.

951
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,760
Yes?

952
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,720
Who's this?

953
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,470
Boss!

954
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,622
Old Yellow Dog's caught!

955
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,150
Darn bad luck...

956
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,100
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

957
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,800
Madam Zhang,

958
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,030
why are you still here?

959
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,070
Qian,

960
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,440
please give me a few more days.

961
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,930
I'm trying to figure something out.

962
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:12,190
It's not that I don't want to,

963
00:42:12,422 --> 00:42:14,444
but I waited a long time for you
to renew the lease

964
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:15,466
and you never showed up.

965
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,288
I already signed a contract
with someone else.

966
00:42:17,288 --> 00:42:18,820
They're coming soon
to check the shop lot.

967
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,110
If they see you're still here,
I'll have to pay a penalty!

968
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,720
Qian,

969
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,440
- I understand your situation...
- Qian.

970
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,800
Qian.

971
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:25,960
Mr. Shi.

972
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,800
My men are here.

973
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,688
Why are they still here?

974
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:30,070
They're moving out now. Right now.

975
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,266
I can't wait a second longer.

976
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:32,288
Tear down those posters.

977
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:32,960
Tear them down!

978
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,800
Move the tables too.

979
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,155
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

980
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
What are you doing?

981
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,280
You can't do this!

982
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,320
You're hurting my business
by not moving out.

983
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,550
If you won't move, I'll move you!

984
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,800
Don't tear it!

985
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,844
What do you think you're doing?

986
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,670
Stop!

987
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,550
Give me that!

988
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,030
Don't tear it!

989
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:50,880
Don't tear it!

990
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,710
Let go!

991
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,710
Stop!

992
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,640
Stop!

993
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,120
Don't do this!

994
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,620
