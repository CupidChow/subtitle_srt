=Episode 16=

3
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,866
Were there other similar cases

4
00:01:38,955 --> 00:01:41,222
when Yang Caiyun
was trafficked 20 years ago?

5
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,600
You're thinking what I'm thinking.

6
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,533
I looked into it.

7
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,740
Starting from twenty years ago,
when Yang Caiyun was sold,

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,100
over the next two years,

9
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,660
we solved

10
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,210
three human trafficking cases.

11
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,050
All three

12
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,740
happened in Zhang Village.

13
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,770
This is Hu Caihua.

14
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,740
After we solved the three cases,

15
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,050
only her family stayed in the family.

16
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:08,850
Hu Caihua, don't be nervous.

17
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,130
You're the one who knows
everything about the village, right?

18
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,410
We came here today

19
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,060
to ask you about something.

20
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,010
Twenty years ago,

21
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,660
did you see

22
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,980
a girl around 16 or 17 in the village?

23
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,060
She's Blockhead Zhang's cousin.

24
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,730
She had a mole

25
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,060
between her eyebrows.

26
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,220
Pretty good-looking.

27
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,340
Yes, that's her.

28
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,290
I went to Blockhead Zhang's once,

29
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,780
but the door was locked.

30
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,290
Both of them

31
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,100
were gone.

32
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,100
Later, he came back once.

33
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,450
He was alone.

34
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,570
I guess

35
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,260
he couldn't keep the girl after all.

00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,540
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

37
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:04,850
Madam Zhang.

38
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:05,511
Xiaoxing.

39
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:06,370
Yanyan, you're here.

40
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:06,911
Director Deng.

41
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,380
Come on and sit.

42
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,130
Have a seat.

43
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,410
Sit.

44
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,820
I'll cook you a bowl of noodles.

45
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,500
No need.

46
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,100
I'll just sit for a bit.

47
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,980
You came all this way.

48
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,380
You've done us a big favor.

49
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,130
I must make you some noodles.

50
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,060
Give me a moment.

51
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,380
Just sit. It won't take long.

52
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:24,980
Just a small portion, Madam Zhang.

53
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,690
Director Deng, have some tea.

54
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:27,820
Thank you.

55
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,000
Yanyan, here you go.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,822
Madam Zhang,

57
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,850
that's too much.

58
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,730
I can't finish.

59
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,500
It's not much. Eat more.

60
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,890
Yanyan,

61
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,610
you've helped so much.

62
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,220
We really must thank you.

63
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,690
Just now,

64
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:04,410
someone from
Bring Lost Children Home said

65
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,730
they could merge with us.

66
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,260
Really?

67
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,260
Yes.

68
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,010
We can either stay here

69
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,410
or move to their place.

70
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,820
I'm so happy to hear that.

71
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,850
Wonderful.

72
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,410
Ma'am.

73
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,250
One bowl of beef noodles, please.

74
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,100
Sure. I'll get it.

75
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:17,810
Come.

76
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,610
Sit there.

77
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,290
Come.

78
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,250
Sit here.

79
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,580
Yin, we found him.

80
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,460
Blockhead Zhang,

81
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:27,666
real name Zhang Zhongli.

82
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:30,488
(Population Info Inquiry: Zhang Zhongli)
51 years old. Never married.

83
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:32,340
Currently working in Shuanglin County.

84
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,140
Print out his file for me.

85
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:56,955
Did I add salt?

86
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,220
Not yet.

87
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,020
Almost forgot.

88
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,370
Done.

89
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,111
Your beef noodles.

90
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:13,780
If it's not spicy enough,

91
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,800
there's more chili here.

92
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:15,644
Help yourself.

93
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:18,980
Madam Zhang,

94
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,066
I finished all the noodles.

95
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,460
Finished it all? Good.

96
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,250
Give me a smaller portion next time.

97
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:23,850
Ma'am!

98
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,850
This tastes terrible.

99
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,490
It's too salty.

100
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,660
Salty?

101
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,580
How can it be?

102
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,444
Taste it yourself.

103
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,460
I'll make you another bowl right away.

104
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,050
Forget it.

105
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,780
It's free. I'll redo it for free.

106
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,266
Free or not, I'm not eating it.

107
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:41,930
Ma'am,

108
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,050
this isn't the first time.

109
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,250
Forget it, I'm leaving.

110
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,410
I'm so sorry.

111
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,100
I apologize.

112
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,780
Well, thank you for coming.

113
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,610
This...

114
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,610
Oh dear.

115
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,660
How did that happen?

116
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,610
It's fine, Madam Zhang.

117
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:55,511
Don't mind it.

118
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,700
I'm old.

119
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,100
I must be getting old.

120
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,170
Director Deng.

121
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,290
I want to talk to you

122
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,020
about Madam Zhang's situation.

123
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,100
Lately,

124
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,340
I don't know what's going on with her.

125
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,780
She hasn't been herself.

126
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,340
Things like today have happened
several times.

127
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,780
Yesterday, she miscalculated
a customer's bill

128
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,290
by a decimal point.

129
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,410
Besides, when she was
making candied radish,

130
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,755
she forgot to add red vinegar.

131
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,610
She couldn't figure out

132
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,490
why the radish stayed white.

133
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,540
And one thing was really scary.

134
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,490
Last night,

135
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,660
she closed up the shop,

136
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,370
but forgot to lock the door.

137
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,850
When I came this morning,

138
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,730
it was wide open.

139
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,100
It really scared me.

140
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,810
What should I do?

141
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:07,980
How about this?

142
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,340
For safety's sake,

143
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,170
take Madam Zhang to the hospital

144
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:11,780
for a checkup.

145
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,220
Hospital?

146
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,410
Is it that serious?

147
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,100
Not necessarily.

148
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,490
But at her age,

149
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,020
it's best to get checked regularly

150
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,930
to see if there are changes
in her health.

151
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:23,540
Don't worry too much.

152
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,170
(September 18, 2009,
Huang Valley, Hongxi City)

153
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:33,010
What are you washing for?

154
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,290
It's noon and you're not cooking.

155
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,530
You yell at Mom again!

156
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,000
What? Believe it or not,
I'll slap you to death.

157
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,700
Two worthless fools.

158
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,850
Go cook now!

159
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:33,220
You're the person in charge, right?

160
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,700
Yes, I am.

161
00:09:35,222 --> 00:09:36,300
Do you know this man?

162
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,555
This... Isn't this Blockhead Zhang?

163
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,980
Can you bring him here?

164
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:45,555
He should be at the construction site.
I'll call him over.

165
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,666
Blockhead Zhang.

166
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,466
Blockhead Zhang.

167
00:09:51,622 --> 00:09:52,088
Come here.

168
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:57,288
He's Blockhead Zhang.

169
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:00,733
Are you Zhang Zhongli?

170
00:10:03,422 --> 00:10:04,555
Do you know this person?

171
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,890
I do.

172
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,130
Where is she?

173
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,155
I'm also looking for her.

174
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,111
I've been searching for her
for twenty years.

175
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:25,555
What do you mean? Explain clearly.

176
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,610
Twenty years ago,

177
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,850
I paid a thousand yuan to buy her.

178
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:32,866
Later, someone conned me
and took her away.

179
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,770
Dear, you're awake.

180
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:00,850
Don't be afraid.

181
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm your husband.

182
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:04,700
Let's eat something first.

183
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,420
Eat some.

184
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,130
Don't shout.

185
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,266
Let's eat something, okay?

186
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,400
Just eat something.

187
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,060
Mister, please.

188
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,460
Please let me go.

189
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,977
Let me go, please.

190
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,220
Mister,

191
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,650
I know you're a good person.

192
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,010
Please let me go.

193
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,730
I'm begging you. Please let me go.

194
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,420
Please.

195
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,180
I bought you.

196
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,010
I want to go home.

197
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,300
Please let me go.

198
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:35,019
You're my wife.

199
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,650
I'm begging you.

200
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,490
Eat something.

201
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,420
Come on.

202
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,530
I bought you.

203
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,820
I can't let you starve.

204
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,580
I want to go home...

205
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,300
Eat.

206
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,130
I bought you.

207
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,370
Help!

208
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,610
Didn't I tell you not to scream?

209
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
(It was a hand-to-hand deal.)

210
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,250
The moment I saw her, I regretted it.

211
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,700
She was so beautiful

212
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,420
and so young.

213
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,100
How could I deserve her?

214
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,530
I thought to myself,

215
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,420
if she could smile at me once,

216
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,460
she'd look so beautiful.

217
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:23,444
Stop beating around the bush.

218
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,420
Get to the point.

219
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,730
Well,

220
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,530
the seller said

221
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,420
she'd become mild and obedient

222
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,420
over time.

223
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,700
But she wouldn't eat a single bite.

224
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:52,940
You...

225
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,130
Stop yelling, okay?

226
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,250
What do you want to eat?

227
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,244
I'll cook you anything you want.

228
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:19,820
I...

229
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,180
I can't let you go.

230
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,890
I bought you to be my wife.

231
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,220
They won't return my money.

232
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,890
I borrowed money

233
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,733
from every household in the village

234
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:34,420
to buy you,

235
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,130
but you haven't eaten for days.

236
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,980
If you starve to death,

237
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,850
all my money will go to waste!

238
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,980
I... I'm sorry.

239
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,980
I... I didn't...

240
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,130
I didn't mean to slap you.

241
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,490
Please eat something.

242
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,370
If you don't eat,

243
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,340
I...

244
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,730
Please eat something.

245
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,580
(She was a human.)

246
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,610
I paid for her.

247
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,650
What if she starves to death?

248
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,010
Where's she right now?

249
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
I don't know.

250
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,490
Xu Tenglong took her away
twenty years ago.

251
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,333
How am I supposed to know where she is?

252
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,222
Who's this Xu Tenglong?

253
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,180
A... a...

254
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,490
A peddler.

255
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,010
Sure.

256
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,610
All right.

257
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:35,288
Please come again next time.

258
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,650
Zhang.

259
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,460
Buying anything today?

260
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,490
Anything new here?

261
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:42,977
This one.

262
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,088
This one sells the best.

263
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,010
You've been buying

264
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,250
clothes and hairpins lately.

265
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,600
What's the good news?

266
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:53,610
No good news. Nothing.

267
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:55,100
What good news could there be?

268
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:00,288
You bought a wife?

269
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,300
So it's true.

270
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,490
Who told you that?

271
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,370
No one.

272
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,530
I guessed.

273
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,730
Let me see her.

274
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,530
Is she pretty?

275
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,530
Nothing to see.

276
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,420
Let me see.

277
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,300
Come on.

278
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,555
I'm shopping here.

279
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:21,710
I'll send them to you later.

280
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:22,980
Never seen a woman before?

281
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,460
No.

282
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,650
You're so annoying.

283
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,340
Stop it.

284
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,010
Mr. Liu, watch my stall for a bit.

285
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,420
Okay.

286
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,490
Nothing special to see.

287
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,610
Enough already.

288
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,650
Stop it.

289
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,980
Well, well, Zhang.

290
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,370
This chick is pretty.

291
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,370
Lucky you.

292
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,730
Must've cost you a lot.

293
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,580
But

294
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,820
she looks half-dead.

295
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:30,822
Careful you don't end up losing
both your money and your wife.

296
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:47,770
Zhang,

297
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,060
let's make a deal.

298
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,180
What's it?

299
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,460
This can't go on like this.

300
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,000
You can't handle her.

301
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:56,060
How about this?

302
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:58,711
I'll give you 800 yuan,

303
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:00,022
and you hand her over to me.

304
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,490
I paid more than a thousand yuan
for her.

305
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,330
Can you not be so clueless?

306
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,290
I'm doing you a favor.

307
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,490
She hasn't eaten for days, right?

308
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,050
If she dies,

309
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,660
you'll get nothing,

310
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,980
and you'll go to jail.

311
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,380
A living person dies in your house.

312
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,555
Police will come for sure.

313
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,900
The whole village will gossip.

314
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,420
Think about it.

315
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:32,940
Fine.

316
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,330
You don't want?

317
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,620
Wait for prison then.

318
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,250
Wait.

319
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,730
So you sold Yang Caiyun

320
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,860
to Xu Tenglong, did you?

321
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,420
I just didn't want her to starve.

322
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,660
You didn't want her to starve?

323
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:55,490
You didn't want her to starve?

324
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,333
Or you didn't want your money
going to waste?

325
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,620
I got 800 yuan in fake bills.

326
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,250
When I went looking for Xu Tenglong,

327
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,010
he denied everything.

328
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,140
He said I was trafficking women,

329
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:09,600
and if I called the police,
I'd be the first one arrested.

330
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,770
I'm innocent. I swear.

331
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,940
Twenty years ago,

332
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,490
800 yuan

333
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,420
or a thousand yuan

334
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
was a lot of money.

335
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,050
Couldn't you use it to find
a girlfriend and get married?

336
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,711
Why did you have to do
something illegal?

337
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:22,940
I didn't know it was illegal.

338
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,466
Everyone in the village was doing it.

339
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:24,980
Besides,

340
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,180
no woman wanted to
marry into our village.

341
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,460
Tell me.

342
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:31,111
Where's Xu Tenglong now?

343
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:32,730
I...

344
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,380
I don't know.

345
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,530
You could find him when you sold her,

346
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,660
but not now?

347
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,090
Do you realize

348
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,290
you ruined a girl's life?

349
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,180
She was only 16.

350
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:57,933
Vice Director Yin.

351
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:00,329
Xu Tenglong is quite the businessman.

352
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,279
He works hard and goes door to door
selling goods.

353
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,290
He made an amount of money.

354
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:05,755
After moving here from Wushun County,
he's been living here.

355
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:06,770
From what we know,

356
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,810
he's living alone.

357
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:08,770
No women around him.

358
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,290
You're Xu Tenglong?

359
00:19:26,111 --> 00:19:27,177
We're from the police.

360
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:28,577
We need to ask you some questions.

361
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
What questions?

362
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,570
You want to talk out here, or inside?

363
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,730
Please come in.

364
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:37,910
Show us the way.

365
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:38,444
Sure.

366
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:49,955
Please have a seat.

367
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,620
Officers,

368
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,730
what's this about?

369
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,380
Is this a mistake?

370
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:09,644
You can ask around

371
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,570
the neighborhood.

372
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,355
I'm a good citizen.

373
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,770
I follow the law.

374
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,666
Do you know Yang Caiyun?

375
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,570
No.

376
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,980
And Zhang Zhongli?

377
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,860
No.

378
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:27,244
You're from Zhang Village
in Wushun County.

379
00:20:27,244 --> 00:20:28,200
Think carefully.

380
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,420
Officers,

381
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,290
I really

382
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,733
don't know who you're talking about.

383
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,290
What exactly are you here for?

384
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,644
You really don't know them?

385
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,660
No.

386
00:20:44,888 --> 00:20:46,090
Let me read you something.

387
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,530
(Report Letter)

388
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,488
My name is Zhang Zhongli

389
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:55,570
from Zhang Village,
Wushun County, Xinyang Province.

390
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,330
I'm confessing to Public Safety

391
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:58,600
and filing a real-name report

392
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,622
against Xu Tenglong

393
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:00,755
for trafficking women.

394
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,250
In October 1990,

395
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,220
I bought a woman from traffickers

396
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,770
and sold her to Xu Tenglong

397
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,570
half a month later.

398
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,730
He paid me 800 yuan

399
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,490
for Yang Caiyun.

400
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,000
Ring a bell now?

401
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,530
Oh, yeah. You mean that woman?

402
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,090
Well,

403
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,420
I saved her

404
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,770
from Blockhead Zhang.

405
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,770
He nearly starved her to death.

406
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,711
When she came here,

407
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,700
I persuaded her to eat.

408
00:21:28,444 --> 00:21:30,444
Didn't you say
you didn't know Zhang Zhongli?

409
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,180
How do you know his nickname then?

410
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,810
It just came back to me.

411
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,420
The woman you bought was named
Yang Caiyun.

412
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:39,844
Where is she?

413
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,810
She's long gone.

414
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:43,711
She ran off with someone.

415
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,220
Ran off?

416
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,700
Speak clearly.

417
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,380
What happened?

418
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,700
I really did save her

419
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,660
from Blockhead Zhang.

420
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,290
I thought

421
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,140
we'd start a family

422
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,280
and live a good life together.

423
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:58,755
But she couldn't even bear children.

424
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,860
She was like a stone.

425
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,570
It wasn't easy

426
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,330
to make a living back then.

427
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:05,133
If she couldn't have kids,

428
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,800
all that money would've gone to waste.

429
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,940
Just then,

430
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,140
a business partner of mine, Liang...

431
00:22:11,222 --> 00:22:13,288
Liang Wei, yeah. That's his name.

432
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:13,980
That jerk

433
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,420
looked like an honest man,

434
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,620
so I let him in.

435
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,420
But then,

436
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,010
he and that girl

437
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,810
hit it off

438
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,700
right away.

439
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,290
So I went along with it

440
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,022
and introduced them.

441
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,622
How much did you sell her for?

442
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,700
Not much.

443
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,980
About 20,000 yuan.

444
00:22:30,244 --> 00:22:32,110
You bought her for 800
and sold her for 20,000.

445
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:33,180
You're quite the businessman.

446
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,980
Officer,

447
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,460
you're wronging me.

448
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,730
That wasn't business.

449
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,810
They liked each other.

450
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,810
I just did them a favor.

451
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,644
I was a matchmaker, that's all.

452
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,330
Right?

453
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,180
Fine.

454
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,730
Enough nonsense.

455
00:22:46,644 --> 00:22:47,666
Where does Liang Wei live?

456
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:52,911
I only remember
where he was ten years ago.

457
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,090
It was

458
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,244
in Huang Valley, Hongxi City.

459
00:22:57,422 --> 00:22:58,866
I don't know where he is now.

460
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:01,688
All right, then.

461
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:03,311
You're coming with us
to the station.

462
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,420
We're summoning you

463
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,422
for questioning.

464
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,666
Wait, Officer. I told you everything.

465
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:09,600
What else do you need to
investigate me for?

466
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,130
You're suspected of trafficking women.

467
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:11,511
Move.

468
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,180
Wait.

469
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,900
I... You... You...

470
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
I'm innocent.

471
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,530
You really...

472
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,860
I'm innocent.

473
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,700
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

474
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,980
Madam Zhang.

475
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,530
I'm back.

476
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,620
Xiaoxing,

477
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,530
you bought a lot.

478
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,620
Didn't you say
there's a big gathering tomorrow,

479
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,730
so you told me to buy extra?

480
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,810
You're making dumplings for us.

481
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:44,620
Right.

482
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,490
Did you get the green beans
for the filling?

483
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,620
I did. Is this enough?

484
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,900
Yes.

485
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,770
It's heavy. Put it down in the back.

486
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,940
We have fruit

487
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,660
and vegetables.

488
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,330
One more thing.

489
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,010
Xiaoxing,

490
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,660
I forgot to tell you.

491
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,777
Here's the thing.

492
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,940
For the gathering,

493
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,090
they all love

494
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,660
my green bean dumpling filling.

495
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,090
Could you buy some long beans?

496
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,090
Didn't I just buy them?

497
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,860
You asked me a minute ago.

498
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,770
Oh, my memory.

499
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:26,900
Oh dear.

500
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,330
I'll go wash the ingredients.

501
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,530
I forget things
when there's too much going on.

502
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,800
My mind's all over the place.

503
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,050
Hello, Dr. Wang?

504
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,730
This is Luo Xiaoxing.

505
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,220
Um,

506
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,420
I'd like to ask,

507
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,180
is Madam Zhang's test report out yet?

508
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,570
Chang Rui went straight

509
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:11,288
to sleep when we got to the guesthouse.

510
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,530
He didn't eat dinner.

511
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,220
Let him rest.

512
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:16,022
We can bring him something to eat later.

513
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,860
Want some chili?

514
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,490
No.

515
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,660
This is just right.

516
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,980
You know, I've been searching

517
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,700
for Yang Caiyun for nearly twenty years.

518
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,380
A person doesn't have
that many twenty years in a lifetime.

519
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,620
Just as we got a lead,

520
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:45,288
she's been sold somewhere else again.

521
00:25:45,288 --> 00:25:47,311
I got all worked up
the moment I heard about that.

522
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,180
Yang Caiyun's case

523
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,330
is indeed complicated.

524
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,420
If you can't handle the strain,

525
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,460
let me know.

526
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,177
Go back to Linshan
and rest for a few days.

527
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,900
Not until I find her.

528
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,730
I'm not going back.

529
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:10,810
Say,

530
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,380
Captain Han asked me

531
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,980
to return to Linshan for some matters.

532
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,460
I'll be back in a few days.

533
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,380
If you need help,

534
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:18,422
I'll send Ai Xin over.

535
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,533
Vice Director Yin.

536
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,730
Okay, got it.

537
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,940
Sure. Don't worry.

538
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,090
You've been on the road all night.

539
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:50,088
You must be exhausted.

540
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,555
Would you like to check into
a nearby hotel and rest first?

541
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,530
No need.

542
00:26:54,777 --> 00:26:55,730
Let's talk business.

543
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:57,222
Vice Director Yin is focused

544
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:58,980
on finding Yang Caiyun right now.

545
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:03,088
I've been chasing this case

546
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,570
for nearly twenty years.

547
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,180
Yin,

548
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,460
you're not young anymore.
You're pushing too hard.

549
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,700
You've waited twenty years.

550
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,888
A little longer won't matter.

551
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,180
Let's grab breakfast.

552
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,290
No need.

553
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,900
Tell me

554
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,730
what you've found.

555
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,770
After getting your call,

556
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,980
we worked through the night

557
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,010
and located the man
Xu Tenglong mentioned,

558
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,220
Liang Wei.

559
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,700
We also sent his photo

560
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,980
to the Anti-abduction Office
of Qingxi County.

561
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,660
Xu Tenglong confirmed

562
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,770
that Liang Wei

563
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:36,222
was the man who bought Yang Caiyun

564
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,570
nine years ago.

565
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,810
Have you found her yet?

566
00:27:39,777 --> 00:27:40,800
There was too little time.

567
00:27:40,888 --> 00:27:42,088
We couldn't visit in person.

568
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,660
We only got to check

569
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,769
the household registry.

570
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,940
Liang Wei's wife

571
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,380
is named Wen Sujuan.

572
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,700
Her age

573
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,570
matches the woman you said,

574
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,460
Yang Caiyun.

575
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,810
They got married

576
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,860
within a year
after Xu Tenglong sold Yang Caiyun.

577
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,420
The timeline fits.

578
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,980
This Wen Sujuan

579
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,088
isn't from the local area.

580
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,090
There's no record of her parents
in the system either.

581
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,090
This is her ID photo.

582
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,330
You can identify her.

583
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,570
Do we have any other info on Wen Sujuan?

584
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,730
Yes.

585
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,420
When they got married,

586
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,700
Wen Sujuan was already pregnant.

587
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,330
And not long after,

588
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,420
she had a daughter,

589
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,660
named

590
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,940
Liang Xiaoyun.

591
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,660
She has a child?

592
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:30,933
Vice Director Yin,

593
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,050
this is Wen Sujuan's house.

594
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,460
Is Wen Sujuan home?

595
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,250
She's Wen Sujuan?

596
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:01,770
Yes.

597
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:02,980
That's her.

598
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:11,900
Wen Sujuan,

599
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,700
they are

600
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,555
from Linshan Anti-abduction Office,

601
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,777
Vice Director Yin and Officer Ai.

602
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,355
They have some questions for you.

603
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,180
We'd like to talk to her privately.

604
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:26,700
Sure.

605
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,111
Put your thing down.

606
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,290
Sit.

607
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,570
We're here

608
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,600
to confirm something with you.

609
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,700
Your real name

610
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,700
isn't Wen Sujuan.

611
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,490
It's Yang Caiyun,

612
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,711
right?

613
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:08,860
My name

614
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:09,980
is Wen Sujuan.

615
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,660
I'm not Yang...

616
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,570
Yang Caiyun.

617
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,420
Look at this photo. Is this you?

618
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:28,940
No.

619
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:31,577
I don't know what you're talking about.

620
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:32,980
Officers,

621
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,660
you've got

622
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:34,860
the wrong person.

623
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,050
Your name is Yang Caiyun.

624
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,810
Born on May 10, 1974.

625
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,530
In October 1990,

626
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,290
you were abducted

627
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,000
by a trafficker known as Old Yellow Dog.

628
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,220
First sold to Zhang Zhongli

629
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,688
in Zhang Village, Wushun County.

630
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,266
Later, Zhang Zhongli sold you

631
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,420
to Xu Tenglong in Qingqu County.

632
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,090
Then, Xu Tenglong sold you to Liang Wei,

633
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,155
who is your current husband.

634
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,730
Officers,

635
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,700
my husband and I married for love.

636
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,490
Our child is nine years old.

637
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,570
She's in second grade.

638
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,010
I'm not the person you're looking for.

639
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,570
Please leave.

640
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,180
Please.

641
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:21,940
Mom.

642
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,090
Is this your child?

643
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:28,810
Yes.

644
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:29,940
She's Xiaoyun.

645
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,420
Xiaoyun.

646
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:36,088
Where's your dad?

647
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,660
He went out to buy liquor.

648
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,980
Xiaoyun, go do your homework.

649
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:40,977
If you don't finish,

650
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:42,533
Dad will scold you when he gets back.

651
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,420
Officers,

652
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,460
if there's nothing else,

653
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,688
I need to start cooking.

654
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,660
Hold on.

655
00:32:52,355 --> 00:32:53,755
I want to tell you something.

656
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,330
Twenty years ago,

657
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,530
a girl was trafficked.

658
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,700
I was in charge of that case.

659
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:04,660
Unfortunately,

660
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,140
I never found her.

661
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,220
I remember her parents

662
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,010
always came to our office,

663
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,490
crying

664
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,940
and begging us to find

665
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,090
their only daughter.

666
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,900
Later, whenever I traveled,

667
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,730
I'd stop by her parents' graves.

668
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,290
Their graves are desolate.

669
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,380
Because their only daughter
went missing.

670
00:33:28,822 --> 00:33:30,488
No one was there to visit
or tend to them.

671
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:31,660
They've

672
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,420
already...

673
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,860
Officer,

674
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,220
your story is touching,

675
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,180
but I'm not Yang Caiyun.

676
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,380
If you have nothing else,

677
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,400
please leave.

678
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,140
Caiyun,

679
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,810
you can trust us.

680
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,980
We're here to help you.

681
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,180
If there's something holding you back,

682
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
you can tell us.

683
00:33:57,222 --> 00:33:58,333
You don't have to be afraid.

684
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,660
I'm not Yang Caiyun.

685
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,800
You've got the wrong person.

686
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:05,511
Please leave.

687
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:32,530
Mom,

688
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,090
who are those people?

689
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:39,460
Mom,

690
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,460
what's wrong?

691
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,130
Don't cry, Mom.

692
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,380
Yang Caiyun's parents
were cremated,

693
00:36:10,622 --> 00:36:11,820
and there are no relatives

694
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,650
to get a DNA sample.

695
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,340
If she insists she's Wen Sujuan

696
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,170
and not Yang Caiyun,

697
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,340
we may not be able to arrest Liang Wei.

698
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,010
Why do you think she won't admit it?

699
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:26,610
Xiaoyun,

700
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,610
where's your dad?

701
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,940
He went out to buy liquor.

702
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,490
Xiaoyun,

703
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,090
go do your homework.

704
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:34,600
If you don't finish,
Dad will scold you when he gets back.

705
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,170
I guess

706
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,780
it's because of her child.

707
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,650
No mother

708
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,210
wants their children to see

709
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,530
their father taken away

710
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,530
to prison.

711
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,780
But I think

712
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,740
the child is only part of the reason.

713
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,090
There might be more to it,

714
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,600
which she refuses to admit.

715
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,570
Well,

716
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,860
this has given us a headache.

717
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,170
Everyone in the village

718
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,555
knows Liang Wei beats his wife.

719
00:37:09,866 --> 00:37:11,422
He's beaten her very badly every time.

720
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,260
She's even been
to the hospital a few times.

721
00:37:14,888 --> 00:37:16,555
Why didn't anyone call the police?

722
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,130
Well, about Wen Sujuan...

723
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:19,444
How should I put it?

724
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,490
Every time the neighbors
couldn't bear to watch anymore,

725
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,222
they'd come to the village committee.

726
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:25,844
But whenever we went to her house,

727
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:26,666
Wen Sujuan

728
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:28,600
always insisted
it was just a couple's quarrel,

729
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,460
nothing serious.

730
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,460
You see,

731
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,010
if that's what she says,

732
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,210
what can we do?

733
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,130
It's happened so many times

734
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,050
that people have gotten used to it

735
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,333
and stopped caring.

736
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,050
True.

737
00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:42,355
Domestic violence cases
can only move forward

738
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,820
if the victim is willing to testify.

739
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:47,311
Does Liang Wei threaten her?

740
00:37:47,422 --> 00:37:48,688
Or does she have any concern?

741
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,380
Maybe.

742
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:53,150
We've tried talking to her
several times,

743
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,940
but she always shuts us out.

744
00:38:03,711 --> 00:38:04,780
Let's go back to her house.

745
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:06,600
We need to be more careful this time.

746
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:07,610
Yes, Sir.

747
00:38:44,644 --> 00:38:46,010
What were the police doing here

748
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:46,900
just now?

749
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,610
Nothing.

750
00:38:51,977 --> 00:38:53,490
They were visiting every household,

751
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,650
asking if we were happy

752
00:38:55,888 --> 00:38:56,866
with the local police.

753
00:38:56,955 --> 00:38:58,977
I said yes, no complaints.

754
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,010
Did they ask

755
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,980
where you're from

756
00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:04,000
and your name?

757
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,340
No, they didn't.

758
00:39:05,755 --> 00:39:07,530
It's written in the household registry.

759
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,490
My name is Wen Sujuan.

760
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,420
We met on our own

761
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,690
and married willingly.

762
00:39:12,222 --> 00:39:13,933
That's what I tell anyone who asks.

763
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,460
You know my temper

764
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,311
after all these years.

765
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,050
Even if the cops find out I bought you,

766
00:39:26,222 --> 00:39:27,733
they can't hold me for long.

767
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,780
Once I'm out,

768
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,490
I'll kill you.

769
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,490
Not just you,

770
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,530
I'll kill her, too.

771
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,130
Xiaoyun is your own daughter.

772
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,688
You think the police
are backing you up, huh?

773
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:45,900
Mom!

774
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,740
You try to go against me?

775
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,690
Mom.

776
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,622
Not telling me?

777
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,340
Say it now.

778
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,420
Let her go.

779
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,050
Get lost.

780
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,090
Say it,

781
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,170
or I'll kill you now!

782
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,050
I'm going to kill you!

783
00:40:07,444 --> 00:40:08,488
I'm going to kill you!

784
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,688
Believe it or not?

785
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:10,460
Mom!

786
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,010
Stop!

787
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,420
Police! Get off her!

788
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:15,977
Hands on your head and kneel.

789
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,420
Caiyun.

790
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,090
Come.

791
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:20,780
Get up.

792
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:26,955
You're safe now.

793
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,860
Come. Give me your hand.

794
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,340
Come.

795
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,460
Move.

796
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,550
Take him to the car.

797
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:42,244
Sujuan!

798
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,650
Sujuan!

799
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,380
Sujuan!

800
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,780
Sujuan!

801
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,530
Sujuan!

802
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,490
Yang Caiyun,

803
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,690
you can choose to leave this place.

804
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:06,155
Don't worry about Liang Wei
hurting you and your daughter again.

805
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,420
He's suspected of domestic violence

806
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,050
and human trafficking.

807
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:13,420
He'll face charges for those.

808
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,260
I've lived here for ten years.

809
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,210
If I leave,

810
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,170
where can I go?

811
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:24,780
Mom,

812
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,170
are we going to be homeless?

813
00:41:31,844 --> 00:41:32,980
You can go back to Linshan.

814
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,422
Your parents' house is still there.

815
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,177
We'll contact the local authorities.

816
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:39,133
They'll help you and your daughter
settle down.

817
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,780
But

818
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,170
even if we go back,
we'll be on our own.

819
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,300
Caiyun,

820
00:41:46,844 --> 00:41:47,755
are you worried

821
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,711
you can't take care of the family
by yourself?

822
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,610
It won't happen.

823
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,340
Don't worry.

824
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,177
The Anti-abduction Office,
charity organizations,

825
00:41:58,177 --> 00:42:00,910
and socially responsible companies
will all step in to help you.

826
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,940
You'll get through the hardest time.

827
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:05,780
Thank you.

828
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,010
Thank you.

829
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,170
You must believe in yourself.

830
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,010
You can do this.

831
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,610
For Xiaoyun

832
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,210
and me,

833
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,170
I definitely can.

834
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,050
This time,

835
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,170
you can finally go home.

836
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,490
Twenty years...

837
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,420
I can finally go home...

838
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:33,420
I can finally go home...

839
00:42:35,288 --> 00:42:36,860
Finally, go home...

840
00:42:54,911 --> 00:42:55,688
