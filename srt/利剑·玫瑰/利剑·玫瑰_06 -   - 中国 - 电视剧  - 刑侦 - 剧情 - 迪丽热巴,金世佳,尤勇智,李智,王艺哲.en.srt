3
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,480
Send me that video so I can take a look.

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,600
Pause.

5
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,870
What is that woman holding?

6
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,360
From its size,

7
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,670
could it be a child?

8
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,430
Little Spud?

9
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,870
120 got the distress call at 16:12.

10
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,840
This person came out at 16:13.

11
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,760
They're the closest
to the time of the incident.

12
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,511
We might've missed them
during screening.

13
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,560
How about this?

14
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,710
Track this person down

15
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,080
and ask them what happened.

16
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,920
No footage captured their face.

17
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,200
Only their legs.

18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,840
Wait.

19
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,222
There's someone beside the car.

20
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,600
There really is someone.

21
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,270
Director, you've got sharp eyes.

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,600
Sharpen the image.

23
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,040
Where have I seen this?

24
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,320
Pull up Meng Gui's interrogation video.

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,080
Zoom in on his feet.

26
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:44,590
During the interrogation,

27
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,490
he was very fidgety.

28
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,450
His feet kept moving.

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,360
So I remembered his shoes.

30
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,200
Look at the time he left the park.

31
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,000
Rewind.

32
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,640
There's a three-minute gap.

33
00:02:55,644 --> 00:02:58,390
The blind spot between these two cameras
is where the child was lost.

34
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,200
They used this window
to transfer the child.

35
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,080
I told you he wasn't telling the truth.

36
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,670
Can we arrest him now?

37
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,070
Not yet.

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,680
We still can't confirm

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,822
whether the bag he was holding
had Little Spud inside.

40
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,666
We can't just bring him in
based on shoes.

41
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,066
We'll need more evidence.

The project won't wait, you know?

67
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:52,440
You won't find the child
right away anyway.

68
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,840
You need to let it go.

69
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,880
Mr. Liu, I can't let it go.

70
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,550
It doesn't help if you can't.

71

for so long.

This project can't be delayed.

74
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,840
Do you know how urgent it is now?

75
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,640
Do you know that my child is missing?

76
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,550
Enough.

77
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,600
I quit.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,920

Hand out the flyers.
What are you standing there for?

Hi.

Hello?

88
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,950
Sure, I'll be on my way.

Let's go.

93
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,750
This is it.

94
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,750
What happened?

95
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,510
Xin wasn't in good health to begin with.

96
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,080
And she's been too stressed lately.

97
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,880
What are you buying to cook for him?

98
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,440
Let's see
what's on sale at the supermarket.

99
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
This kid just loves meat.

100
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,910
Meat is good.

101
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,120
This is the time to eat meat.

102
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,160
It'll help them grow.

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,830
Look.

104
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,750
Just mentioning food

105
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,444
makes her so happy.

106
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,640
She hasn't eaten or slept
to find Little Spud.

107
00:05:58,311 --> 00:05:59,520
She fainted again today,

108
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,320
so I rushed her to the hospital.

109
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,080
Officer Deng.

110
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:06,266
I really don't know what else to do,

111
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,510
so I thought of calling you.

112
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,000
Maybe you can talk some sense into her.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,920
It's alright.

114
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:13,111
What did the doctor say
after examining her?

115
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Nothing serious.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,150
She's just exhausted.

117
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,120
Since the child went missing,

118
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,080
she put all her energy into this.

119
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,960
She lost her job too.

120
00:06:23,688 --> 00:06:25,133
Aside from searching for our child,

121
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,910
she does nothing else.

122
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,870
Let me go!

123
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,560
Calm down!

124
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,470
You can't
keep hitting yourself like this!

125
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,830
- Calm down.
- Xin!

126
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,600

130
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,630
Let me go!

131
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,360
Calm down first!

132
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,440
I'll go get a doctor!

133
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,190

135
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,040
Don't scare me.

136
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,630
Xin.

137
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,630
What's come over you?

138
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,910
My child is gone.

139
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,000
Our child is missing.

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,560
What's the point of living now?

141
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,640
- Cai Xin!
- Xin!

142
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,400
Cai Xin.

143
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,160
What's the point of me being alive?

144
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,640
Cai Xin!

145
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
Trust me one more time.

146
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,150
I'll find Little Spud.

147
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,910
Just trust me one more time, okay?

148
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,870
Trust you?

149
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,640
You lied to me.

150
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,270
My child isn't coming back.

151
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,600
My child isn't coming back!

152
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,190
- Xin.
- How am I supposed to live?

153
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,510
Just let me die!

154
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,470
Xin!

155
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,120
- If you keep this up,
- Let go of me!

156
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,470
Little Spud won't have a family
when he comes home.

157
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,390
No matter where he is,

158
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,590
I'll bring him back.

159
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,390
Trust me, okay?

160
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Little Spud...

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,910
Little Spud can't be without a family.

162
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,320
He can't be without a family.

163
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,240
Let alone without a mother.

164
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,320
You have to bring him back.

165
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,080
I'll bring him back.

166
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,120
Promise me

167
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,510
you'll bring him back.

168
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,390
I promise you.

169
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,710
I'll definitely bring him back.

170
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,630
You bring him back.

171
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,550
Okay.

172
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,640
If you don't bring him back,
our family is no more.

173
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,155
The family will be no more...

174
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,070
Promise me.

175
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,080
I promise you.

176
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
I promise you.

177
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,510
He'll come back.

178
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,350
Any updates

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,488
on Luo Xiaoyu's case?

180
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,310

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,230

There's no...

184
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,630
Didn't Director Deng promise

185
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:35,222
at Public Complaints Administration

186
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:36,550
to help me find my brother?

187
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,750
How long has it been?

188
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,590
Why is there still no lead?

189
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,150
Do you police officers

190
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,630
make promises you don't keep?

Officer Ai.

192
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:46,444
You were also there that day.

193
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,680
Director Deng made a solemn vow.

194
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,240
Forget it.

195
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,310
You're all unreliable.

196
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,390
I

197
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,280
had someone draw this sketch.

198
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,080
Please use it to investigate.

199
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,120
No, Lawyer Sun.

200
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,110
What do you mean we're unreliable?

201
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,320
How do you know we haven't been trying?

202
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,630
After Director Deng came back that day,

203
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,840
she had the tech department
sketch a portrait

204
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,000
based on Luo Xiaoyu's bones.

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,840
At the same time,

206
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,888
we shared this portrait

207
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:16,755
with public security departments
at all levels

208
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:18,110
to investigate together.

209
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,950

211
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,920
Why didn't you tell me?

212
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,150
Yeah.

213
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,710
If I hadn't brought this out today,

214
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:33,355
you wouldn't have shown it to me either.

215

216
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:35,070

219
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,600
We did issue a notice for assistance

220
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,800
based on the new portrait,

221
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:43,066
but we haven't received
any useful information.

222

Without new leads,

223
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,710
we can't inform the family.

I suggest you take her
to see a psychologist.

240

Given her current state,

241
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,622
it's likely

280
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,666
I'd be able to find you again.

281
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,560
Mom and Dad had always looked for you.

282
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,750
While they were looking,

283
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,320
they got into a car accident.

they adopted me.

293
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,680

to adopt two children.

everything adults say right away.

Her complicated background

304
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,750
worries the adoptive parents.

305
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,680
We can't lie to adoptive families, right?

306
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,680
That's completely understandable.

307
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,550
What I'm most worried about now

308
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,911
is Fafa's mental state.

309
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,440
She was already traumatized.

311
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,670
I'm afraid

312
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,750
she might behave abnormally later on.

caught a clear shot of the man's face.

Jiajia told me.

381
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,360
I didn't see you.

382
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,240
No.

383
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,480
I'm not here because of that.

384
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,910
I wanted to talk about

385
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,000
Lin Yangyu.

386
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,480
It's

387
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,400
about Little Spud.

388
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,880
What about Little Spud?

389
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,630
A lead on Little Spud.

390
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,120
Let her tell you.

391
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,150
I was also at the square
when the child went missing.

392
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,350
Everyone was busy rescuing people.

393
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,760
From a distance,

394
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,320
I saw a woman carrying a child

395
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,320
heading toward a car.

396
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,040
I didn't think much of it at the time.

397
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,670
But a couple of days ago,

398
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,720
I saw a message from Lawyer Sun saying

399
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,150
you're looking for that child.

400
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,430
When I recall it,

401
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,240
something felt off.

402
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,510
Why wasn't that woman

403
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,040
watching the commotion?

404
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,110
Also,

405
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,440
today I saw

406
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,950
the video of the child's mother
trying to jump from the rooftop.

407
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,488
It reminded me of the incident again,

408
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,480
so I rushed to see Lawyer Sun.

409
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,390
Do you remember
what the woman looked like?

410
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,000
She was too far away.

411
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,150
I couldn't see clearly.

412
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,790
What about the car?

413
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,590
Did you see what kind of car it was?

414
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,030
It looked like

415
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,630
a beat-up

416
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,430
van.

417
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,040
Are you sure it was a van?

418
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,440
If what the woman
Sun Wenhan brought in said is true,

419
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,430
that a woman carried the child away,

420
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,160
the direction she left in

421
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,311
matches the direction
of this surveillance footage.

422
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,310
This woman

423
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,190
was likely working with Meng Gui.

424
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,480
The timing and direction

425
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,400
all line up.

426
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,560
It clears up our doubts.

427
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,830
Lawyer Sun is a great help.

428
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,800
We should...

429
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,360
Focus on locating Meng Gui.

430
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,240
Investigate the vans
near the crime scene.

431
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,070
South C 1798B.

432
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,190
A Linshan-registered vehicle.

433
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,830
According to surveillance footage,
this van shows up daily

434
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,800
near the Qingluo Town wholesale market.

435
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,750
Move!

436
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,670
What are you doing?

437
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,990
Watch it!

438
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,360
What's going on?

439
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,510
Get up.

440
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,420
(Interrogation Room)

441
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,360
What's your name?

442
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,510
Wang...

443
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,430
Wang Laoshi.

444
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,560
Why did you run when you saw us?

445
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,480
I...

446
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,280
I thought you were debt collectors.

447
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,000
I took out a loan from loan sharks
and couldn't pay it back.

448
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,790
They...

449
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,844
They harass me every day.

450
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,350
I couldn't take it.

451
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,880
If I knew you were the police,

452
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,480
I wouldn't have run.

453
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,870
Now that I think about it,

454
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,430
being at the police station
feels much safer.

455
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,270
Look,

456
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,190
officers.

457
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,720
You've got to...

458
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,920
You've got to protect me.

459
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,790
Officers.

460
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,720
Do you know Meng Gui?

461
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,510
Who?

462
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,310
Meng...

463
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,230
Meng Gui?

464
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,710
No.

465
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,830
Is this white van yours?

466
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,480
Yes.

467
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:01,560
Have you ever lent this van to anyone?

468
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,870
No way.

469
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,120
Every morning,

470
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,350
I drive it to Nankou Seafood Market

471
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,240
to make deliveries.

472
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,560
I've been driving it every day
since I bought it.

473
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,390
There's no way I lent it to others.

474
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:20,244
There are two vans
with this license plate.

475
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,320
That means one of them
is a cloned plate.

476
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,760
I suspect that's the vehicle
they use to transport children.

477
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,670
Any leads on the other van?

478
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:32,550
That vehicle appeared
during the same timeframe

479
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,910
in both Linshan and Lingnan.

480
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,670
It's Meng Gui.

481
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,040
So he has a cloned vehicle.

482
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,960
That matches the shoe lead as well.

483
00:23:48,311 --> 00:23:50,150
We confirmed with Dahai
from the supermarket.

484
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:51,510
Wang Laoshi was being honest.

485
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,430
He told the truth.

486
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,000
This guy's really unlucky.

487
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,933
He didn't even know
his plate had been cloned.

488
00:23:58,177 --> 00:24:00,080
I've notified
the Economic Investigation unit.

489
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,550
Maybe they can help him

490
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,644
with the loan shark issue.

491
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,840
He's pretty impressive.

492
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,480
Driving a cloned van

493
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,240
with not a single violation.

494
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:11,177
I think he has multiple license plates.

495
00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:13,422
He switches them
every time he gets a ticket.

496
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,750
He's cautious.

497
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,590
Where is that van now?

498
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,400
It was last seen at 8 PM last night

499
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,720
at Lingnan's Youyi Mall.

500
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,870
Then it disappeared.

501
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,920
Before that,

502
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,910
its movements were also irregular.

503
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,990
Look.

504
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,510
Yesterday it was in Lingnan,

505
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,600
the day before in Linjiang,

506
00:24:35,644 --> 00:24:36,910
and before that in Hongxi.

507
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,680
In just one month,

508
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,830
it's been to so many places.

509
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,777
Even some counties
in neighboring provinces.

510
00:24:41,777 --> 00:24:42,911
He never repeats a place.

511
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:48,910
If this is really the vehicle
they use to move children,

512
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,590
he'll avoid highways.

513
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:52,560
That makes it hard to track.

514
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,190
So we'll need to expand
the search radius.

515
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,760
I also believe

516
00:24:57,222 --> 00:24:59,400
Meng Gui and his people
are likely a criminal ring.

517
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,350
They won't act alone.

518
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,480
As long as we find Meng Gui
and follow his trail,

519
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,670
we can take down
the entire criminal organization.

520
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:06,430
I agree with Director Deng's analysis.

521
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,311
According to our earlier assumptions,

522
00:25:08,377 --> 00:25:09,510
if this criminal gang

523
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,480
is connected to a girl trafficking ring,

524
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,880
we'll find that criminal group

525
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,590
once we crack this lead.

526
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,190
Lawyer Sun.

527
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,320
What's with the lead you mentioned
yesterday?

528
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,560
A former coworker told me

529
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,110
someone in their village

530
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,390
had a child last year,

531
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:33,390
but the child disappeared
within a few days.

532
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,270
Recently, he went back

533
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,280
and attended
that child's first birthday party.

534
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,320
I thought it was very strange.

535
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,870
Do you think this could be related
to Little Spud's case?

536
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,480
Tell me his name.

537
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,400
Where does he live?

538
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,440
Hello?

539
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,560
Dacheng. Are you
still in Xibang Village, Shanyang?

540
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,880
I go back occasionally.

541
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,720
Why?

542
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,155
Wait there. I'm coming to find you.

543
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,940
(July 10, 2009, Xibang Village,
Jinglong Town, Shanyang County)

544
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,550
Our villagers are close-knit.

545
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,870
Be careful in there.

546
00:26:29,777 --> 00:26:30,840
Bring all the documents.

547
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,270
Over there.

548
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,560
That house next door.

549
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,990
Let's go.

550
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,270
I'm not going with you.

551
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:09,990
Careful.

552
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:36,370
(Xibang Village, Jinglong Town)
Drink a little more, okay?

553
00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:37,222
Good boy.

554
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:38,222
Just a sip.

555
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,560
Okay?

556
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,440
Here.

557
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,720
One more tiny sip, okay?

558
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,320
Who is it?

559
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,040
Hello, Madam.

560
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,000
May I ask something?

561
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,280
Does Fan Dacheng live in this village?

562
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,910
You mean Fan Laosan?

563
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,430
He lives here.

564
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,840
Who are you?

565
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,630
I'm his friend.

566
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,590
His friend?

567
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,000
You don't know where he lives?

568
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,680
I'm a lawyer.

569
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,960
We met in the city.

570
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,533
He said he was from Xibang Village.

571
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:11,750
I've never been here before.

572
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,000
I happened to pass by today,
so I thought I'd visit him.

573
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,400
He's not home.

574
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,670
He went out to work a while ago.

575
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,150
Are his parents at home?

576
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,280
I'd like to visit them.

577
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,960
His parents are around.

578
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,880
I'll show you.

579
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Go down this path by our house.

580
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,230
Go straight.

581
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,110
At the first intersection,

582
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,044
turn right.
It's the third house on the right.

583
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:33,830
Got it, thanks.

584
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,190
He's so cute.

585
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,320
He seems to be sick.

586
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,680
His face is a bit pale.

587
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,920
He overates these days

588
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,840
and has indigestion.

589
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,400
Right?

590
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,250
That's why
he refused to drink milk earlier...

591
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,400
What are you doing?

592
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,790
What are you doing?

593
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,480
I...

594
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,430
I'm examining him.

595
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,280
Are you a doctor?

596
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,320
Who is this?

597
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,310
Hello.

598
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,350
He insisted
on taking a photo of the child.

599
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,520
First, he said he was a lawyer,
then a doctor.

600
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:08,819
I just found your child cute.

601
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,349
Why are you taking pictures of my child?

602
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,750
He looks unwell. He's really cute.

603
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,310
Delete it.

604
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,270
I...

605
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,270
Delete it now.

606
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,190
Okay.

607
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,940
(Delete)

608
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,340
(Save)

609
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:19,880
I deleted it.

610
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,350
I just found your child cute

611
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,350
and took a photo of him.

612
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,310
Look.

613
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,430
Don't misunderstand.

614
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,110
I'll go find

615
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,830
Fan Dacheng.

616
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,750
Thank you.

617
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,400
What's going on?

618
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,720
He's here for Fan Laosan.

619
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,350
Then he said the child didn't look right

620
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,270
and took a photo.

621
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,510
First, he said he's a lawyer,

622
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,430
then a doctor.

623
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,800
Could he be a child trafficker?

624
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:01,350
Keep the door locked from now on.

625
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,577
Watch out for strangers.

626
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:27,380
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

627
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,320
I found it.

628
00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:32,888
That vehicle with the fake license plate
has appeared.

629
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,711
Where else
has this vehicle been spotted?

630
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,310
Lingnan, Jijiang,

631
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,680
Changqing, and Hongxi.

632
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,288
The last place it appeared
was Jiuguan County in Hongxi City.

633
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,444
Which means no matter where it goes,
it always passes through Linshan.

634
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,920
Linshan is its base of operations.

635
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,840
Yes.

636
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,320
If they're really hiding in Linshan

637
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,280
and managed to evade our earlier sweeps,

638
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,800
they must be cautious.

639
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,030
So that means

640
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,080
finding this vehicle

641
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,000
might give us clues about Little Spud.

642
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,480
Check this vehicle's movements
in Linshan.

643
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,400
Okay.

644
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,440
This vehicle is cunning.

645
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,070
It avoided most of the traffic cameras

646
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,990
in Linshan.

647
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,160
All this time,

648
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,150
only four cameras have captured it.

649
00:31:28,577 --> 00:31:30,830
The intersection
of Renmin Road and Xiangyun Street,

650
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,000
Renmin Road and Nansheng Street,

651
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,310
Hongshan Road and Xiangyun Street,

652
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,169
and Hongshan Road and Nansheng Street.

653
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,000
(Renmin Road, Nansheng Street,
Xiangyun Street, Hongshan Road)

654
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,000
So that means

655
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,190
these four intersections
are on its regular route.

656
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,550
And there must be

657
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,280
a fixed parking spot for it here.

658
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,270
That's a huge area.

659
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:47,920
How about we ask

660
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,250
the local police station
and neighborhood patrols for help?

661
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,190
Absolutely not.

662
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,350
These people are alert.

663
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,920
If we ask them for help,

664
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,280
they'll likely be spooked.

665
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
How about this?

666
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,222
The four of us
will each watch one intersection.

667
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,830
Well...

668
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,480
It was just spotted in Jijiang today.

669
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:05,929
It hasn't returned to Linshan yet.

670
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,750
Isn't it too early for us
to start watching it?

671
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,480
No. Look at the pattern.

672
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,320
It returns to Linshan every three days.

673
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,110
(Intersection)
It's been three days.

674
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,240
It's almost

675
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,160
time.

676
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,640
How about this?

677
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,640
Mr. Yin.

678
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,111
You'll watch the Renmin Road
and Nansheng Road's intersection.

679
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,350
Chang Rui

680
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,888
will watch Nansheng Street
and Hongshan Road's intersection.

681
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:32,780
(Hongshan Road)

682
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,950
Jiajia...

683
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,320
But Jiajia needs to
monitor the surveillance network.

684
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:42,933
It's fine. I'll get a colleague
from traffic control to help.

685
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,200
You sure?

686
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,120
Yes.

687
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,070
(Xiangyun Street)

688
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,880
Alright.

689
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,400
Watch the Renmin Road
and Nansheng Road's intersection then.

690
00:32:49,444 --> 00:32:51,577
And get the traffic control team
to coordinate.

691
00:32:51,622 --> 00:32:52,230
No problem.

692
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,200
I'll take care of Xiangyun Street

693
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,066
(Renmin Road)
and Renmin Road's intersection.

694
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,300
(Tianxia Shuiyi)

695
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:35,990
Enough.

696
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,800
Buddies.

697
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,400
Today, a stranger

698
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,520
came into our village.

699
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,710
Did anyone see him?

700
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,160
I didn't notice.

701
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,030
You three elders

702
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,950
usually have free time.

703
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,360
Keep an eye out for me.

704
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,640
- Alright.
- Alright.

705
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,440
That guy

706
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,560
might be a child trafficker.

707
00:34:00,488 --> 00:34:01,533
Sure.

708
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,880
Rui, any updates on your end?

709
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,880
Nothing for now.

710
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,990
What about you guys?

711
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,320
Nothing here either.

712
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,310
Have they not returned to Linshan yet?

713
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,880
He will come back.

714
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,400
He avoided so many cameras,

715
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:06,000
but they can't avoid this spot.

716
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,670
That means

717
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,040
this is a route they must take.

718
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,070
Copy.

719
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,550
Stay alert.

720
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,080
He could show up anytime.

721
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,230
Whose clothes are these?

722
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,760
Whose clothes?

723
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,440
I'm hanging them out to dry, okay?

724
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,920
Let's go.

725
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,400
We...

726
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,960
Once I finish hanging the laundry,
we'll go to bed.

727
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,030
Don't cry.

728
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,960
Good boy.

729
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,590
Why are you here again?

730
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,960
Don't misunderstand.

731
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,880
Zheng!

732
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,040
Zheng!

733
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,110
Zheng, the child trafficker is back!

734
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,770
- Don't misunderstand.
- It's you again!

735
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,440
No.

736
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,000
Guys, he's trying to steal the kid!

737
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,920
Don't misunderstand!

738
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,630
- Don't run!
- There he is!

739
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,760
Guys, catch the trafficker!

740
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,840
Don't cry.

741
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,880
Don't cry.

742
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,800
Stop right there!

743
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,630
Stop!

744
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,030
Catch the child trafficker!

745
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,040
Don't let him get away!

746
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,400
Get him!

747
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,110
Quick, catch the trafficker.

748
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,000
After him!

749
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,440
Don't run!

750
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,360
Do you hear me?

751
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,280
Quick!

752
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,750
- After him!

Don't run!

756
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,840
Child trafficker!

757
00:36:53,288 --> 00:36:54,150
Child trafficker!

758
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,110
Stop running!

759
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,030
Stop!

760
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,440
There he is!

761
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,440
Don't run!

762
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:58,840

He's over there!

766
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,760
Stop!

767
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,680
Hurry!

768
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,960
Don't run!

769
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,720
- Don't let him escape!
- Stop!

770
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,880
Stop!

771
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,510
Stop running! Stop!

772
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,590
Get down!

773
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,880
Open the door!

774
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,960
Don't let him escape!

775
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,080
Open the door! Get out!

776
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,510
Stop him!

777
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,790
Stop him!

778
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,070
Stop him!

779
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,590
Get down!

780
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,320
Get down!

781
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,230
Open the door!

782
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,840
Get out!

783
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,377
Open the door!

784
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,600
Let's see where you run now!

785
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,630
I said! Get down!

786
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,110
Get down!

787
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,920
Calling for help?

788
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,800
Hello? Chang Rui.

789
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,040
A car just went from east to west.

790
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,230
It's similar to our target.

791
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,320
Keep an eye out.

792
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,750
Get down! Calling for help?

793
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,000
Get him out of the car!

794
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,920
Smash it!

795
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,190
Get out!

796
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,230
Come out.

797
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,150
Hurry!

798
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,990
Hurry!

799
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,800
Get out.

800
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,320
What are you doing?

801
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,550
Stop!

802
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,110
Move!

803
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,030
Move aside!

804
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,920
Back off.

805
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,840
What are you all doing?

806
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,110
Zheng Mingguang.

807
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:27,880
What are you doing?

808
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,555
This is called inciting a disturbance!

809
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:30,230
Debang.

810
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,360
He's a child trafficker.

811
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,040
He was sneaking around
taking photos outside my house.

812
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,840
He wants to steal my child!

813
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,760
Get out.

814
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,030
Get out!

815
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,555
Go to the village committee
and explain everything.

816
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:42,977
Come on.
Come with us to make a statement.

817
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,540
(Call Ended)

818
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,320
But there are lots of vans like this.

819
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,520
They all look similar.

820
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,520
Standard ones have dark window tint.

821
00:38:54,577 --> 00:38:56,070
But pay attention to its appearance.

822
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,960
There's a very noticeable dent on it.

823
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,400
Got it.

824
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,820
(Tianxia Shuiyi)

825
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,760
Meng.

826
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,680
Go.

827
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,070
I'm exhausted.

828
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,222
My back hurts from driving.

829
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,790
Alright, drive slowly.

830
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,510
You worked hard, Meng.

831
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,720
Let's go.

832
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,000
All units, attention.

833
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,920
Meng Gui has appeared.

834
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,840
Where is he?

835
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,510
At Tianxia Shuiyi Bathing Center.

836
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,560
Meng Gui has gone inside.

837
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,080
The target vehicle is on the move.

838
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,620
(Tianxia Shuiyi)

839
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,310
Chang Rui, arrest Meng Gui.

840
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,470
The rest, follow me.

841
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,620
(Tianxia Shuiyi)

842
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,280
I'm here.

843
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:33,688
All units, attention.

844
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:34,480
The target vehicle

845
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,580
has entered Hongtoushan
Residential Area's parking lot.

846
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,400
Requesting backup.

847
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,150
Sir, are you alone?

848
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,750
Is this your only exit?

849
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,800
Inside, please.

850
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,320
All units, attention.

851
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,150
Target vehicle C1798B has appeared.

852
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,333
Close in on my location now.

853
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,110
What did you do?

854
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,030
You're so dirty

855
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,750
that you're in a rush to shower.

856
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,800
Officer Chang.

857
