00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 2

2
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
He's dead.

3
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
He's dead?

4
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Did you do it?

5
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
No, I didn't.

6
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,920
How could I kill him?

7
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,680
If you didn't do it,

8
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
can we ask you?

9
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,520
Can we come to you for questioning if we have no evidence?

10
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,120
Is this car yours?

11
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Yes.

12
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Where is the car?

13
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
I really wanted to report the case.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,400
My car was stolen.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We found your car

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
near Zhao Dafeng's body and stopped his car.

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,000
When was the last time you saw Zhao Dafeng?

18
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
The last time.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How many days have I been here?

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The sixth or the fifth day?

21
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Anyway, I came here the night before.

22
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
We played cards.

23
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
What happened after you finished?

24
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,000
After I finished, we went home to find our mom.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,400
Did you find this knife

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
when you went home to find your mom?

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's not mine.

29
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,600
Are you sure it's not yours?

30
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I'm sure.

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,000
There's your DNA on it.

32
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,000
And Zhao Dafeng's DNA.

33
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
We've checked it.

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
There's a test report.

35
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Do you want to see it?

36
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
You two officers.

37
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
You have enough evidence.

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
You're wasting your time here.

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,200
Just drag me to the wall.

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
What's your attitude?

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
I'm talking to you.

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
You can't talk.

43
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,800
It's not up to you to decide if you want to kill or not.

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
It's not up to us to decide.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,400
There's the procuratorate and the court.

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
You don't know what's going on.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,200
You killed Zhao Dafeng.

48
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,000
You have enough evidence.

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,200
You have to kill.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,200
We came here to give you a chance

51
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,800
to explain something to you.

52
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Try to find out.

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I'll find out.

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Do you understand?

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
I understand.

56
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Before I met him,

57
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,800
he cut me once.

58
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,200
He was so angry that he wanted to cut me.

59
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
I asked him out to talk about this.

60
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Brother Zhong, I'm here.

61
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
You're here.

62
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Let's talk.

63
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,800
We can't change the goods.

64
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
We can't?

65
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
If we can't,

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
we'll have to die.

67
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
What did you say?

68
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Say it again.

69
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
I'll listen.

70
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,200
I said we can't change the goods.

71
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,800
We'll have to die.

72
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Such a bad temper.

73
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,600
Really?

74
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,200
Yes.

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
It's true.

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
We'll have to die.

77
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Really?

78
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,400
If you don't want to die, I'll die.

79
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Understand?

80
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
Come on, shake hands.

81
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm not a bad temper.

82
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm not a bad temper.

83
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
I'm a good person.

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
You're really a bad temper.

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
You even have a knife.

86
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Are you willing to stab me?

87
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Are you willing to stab me?

88
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
If you don't stab me today,

89
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
I'll kill you.

90
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Go ahead.

91
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Go ahead.

92
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
I...

93
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
I...

94
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
I want to call the police.

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Hu Bai, I want to call the...

96
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Call the police.

97
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
What do you want?

98
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
What is your upper limit?

99
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
My upper limit is...

100
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Light skin.

101
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Light skin.

102
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
He has a hair loss.

103
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I've seen him several times.

104
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
He has a special feature.

105
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
He loves to eat duck eggs.

106
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Where is this light skin person now?

107
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
I don't know.

108
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
How do you usually contact each other?

109
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
He called me and contacted me.

110
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
What's his phone number?

111
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
I can't remember.

112
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
It's in my phone.

113
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
You can go and check.

114
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
But you know it's useless.

115
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
People like them always change their phone numbers.

116
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Where are Zhang Ge Ge and the girls you took care of?

117
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
I handed them over to him.

118
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Take the money and leave.

119
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
So you have to go and ask the light skin.

120
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
I've said so much.

121
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Can you solve it?

122
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Yes.

123
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Jiang Xun.

124
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
The phone is on the line.

125
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Be careful with the people below.

126
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Who is looking for me?

127
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
I'm here.

128
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Are you still eating fried chicken like last time?

129
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Are you full?

130
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Here.

131
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,200
If you're full, you can tell me why you came out of the orphanage and came to me.

132
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
I don't like people there.

133
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
What's wrong?

134
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Aren't there a lot of children there?

135
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
They bully you.

136
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
They dare not.

137
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,200
I just think they are too childish and stupid.

138
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Too stupid.

139
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
They are obviously children that their parents threw away.

140
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
They are still playing over there all day.

141
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
People...

142
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Some things can be chosen.

143
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Some things can't be chosen.

144
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
For example, the children in the orphanage.

145
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
They have their own tragic experiences.

146
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
But that doesn't mean they can't have a happy childhood.

147
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
It doesn't mean they won't have a beautiful life.

148
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
What's important is how you face it.

149
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
What happened before has already happened.

150
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
It's no use struggling.

151
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,200
But the future is completely up to you.

152
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
When you grow up, you will understand that

153
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
a person's life,

154
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
whether it's happy or sad,

155
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
is the complete life.

156
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Do you understand?

157
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Who told you all this?

158
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,200
The truth is never told by others.

159
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
You understand it yourself.

160
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Okay.

161
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
I'll take it after eating.

162
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Go wash your hands.

163
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I'll send you back to the orphanage later.

164
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I want to go to the amusement park.

165
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
They all say it's fun there.

166
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
I'll go to the amusement park.

167
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
I'll see how you behave.

168
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Let's go.

169
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Yan Lei is calling.

170
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Hello, director.

171
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Director, I have bad signal here.

172
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
You asked me to come with Mo Li today.

173
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
This afternoon, a girl was roasted in the mountains.

174
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
What do you mean?

175
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Be clear.

176
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
This afternoon, a few people from the evil mountain

177
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
came to the Molin family to find that girl.

178
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
They ran away with her.

179
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I've already informed the police.

180
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
They're going to search the mountain.

181
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Why would anyone chase after that girl?

182
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
The important thing is not to be entangled here.

183
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Let's go to the amusement park at night.

184
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Let's go. I'll go with you.

185
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Be careful.

186
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Be careful.

187
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Be careful.

188
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Look.

189
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
The situation is like this.

190
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Molin took the girl to the neighbor's house.

191
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
This is Director Chen.

192
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Director Chen is expected to be in danger behind.

193
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
So he arranged the rescue team to come to support him.

194
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Let's go.

195
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Let's arrange it.

196
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Let's go with us.

197
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Okay.

198
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Dear director,

199
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
our shed is now in the rainy season.

200
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
When we picked the mushrooms,

201
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
the water in the mountains was very big.

202
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
The soil was very slippery.

203
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
The water level of this river is relatively high.

204
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Normal people can hardly cross the river.

205
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,200
We blocked the bridge and the passage in the river earlier.

206
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
They can only hide in the mountains and rivers near the village.

207
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
This reduces our speed.

208
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
The rescue team came to 15 people.

209
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Plus our lock,

210
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
we have reduced the number of people to 30.

211
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,200
We have already determined all the places where they can reach.

212
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
The valley is relatively complicated in the mountains.

213
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
We have to find a way to catch them quickly.

214
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
What about Lao Mo?

215
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Didn't you run away with them?

216
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
No.

217
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Lao Mo is still pretending to be confused.

218
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
He's covering up for Molin.

219
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
But the people are already stable.

220
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Someone is watching in the supermarket.

221
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Okay.

222
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
How about this?

223
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Director, you go and do Lao Mo's thinking work.

224
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Don't go into the mountains with us.

225
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
No.

226
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
You're afraid I'll be a burden, right?

227
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Okay, I'll talk to Lao Mo.

228
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Master, Lao Mo is going into the mountains.

229
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Go into the mountains with him.

230
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Jia Jia, take good care of Lao Yin.

231
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Okay.

232
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Xiao Zhang, come.

233
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
You accompany the leaders to the mountains.

234
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Be careful.

235
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Yes.

236
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Director, be careful of the protection of the people.

237
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
This area is the warehouse.

238
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
This area.

239
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Let's go.

240
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Let's take a break.

241
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
There is no clue yet.

242
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Let's go.

243
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
That's right.

244
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
It's him.

245
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
He's not a 20-year-old child.

246
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
I often see him in the mountains.

247
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
I haven't seen the girl next to him.

248
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Let's go on.

249
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Thank you.

250
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Thank you.

251
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Wait.

252
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
It seems that people who don't often come to the neighbor have come in.

253
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Why?

254
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,200
People who often come must know that they won't bring the fire in.

255
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
And not only one person.

256
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
I have a bold guess.

257
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
You said there was a group of people who were chasing the forest.

258
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
I think it's a good thing.

259
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
You said there was a group of people who were chasing the forest.

260
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
They have been looking for the forest several times.

261
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
And they killed all the killers.

262
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
If that girl really escaped from the central station.

263
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
There must be some people who are chasing her.

264
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,200
So the people who chase her and the people who chase the forest are likely to be a group of people.

265
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Let's go ahead and see.

266
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Director Feng Zhu.

267
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Okay.

268
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Let's go.

269
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I hope that every lost child will be brought home soon.

270
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
I also hope that every family can be satisfied.

271
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Do you have any drinks?

272
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
You can take it yourself.

273
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Put it in here.

274
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
You've seen our girl more than once.

275
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
You know what we're doing here.

276
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
You can't avoid it.

277
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
I suggest you tell us what you know.

278
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
The situation in the mountains is not good now.

279
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
We'll send you food and drinks.

280
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Don't let them suffer in the mountains.

281
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
I'm sorry.

282
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Actually,

283
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
it wasn't you who were hiding from the beginning.

284
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Who was hiding then?

285
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Three guys.

286
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
It was the little rogue before.

287
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Three guys?

288
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
How many of them?

289
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Four.

290
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
They were all with knives.

291
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
They were fierce.

292
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Why did you come to see Molin?

293
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Because...

294
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Because...

295
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I just left.

296
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Mr. Yang, let's go.

297
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
No.

298
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Hurry up.

299
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Don't run.

300
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Stop.

301
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Don't run.

302
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Stop.

303
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Go.

304
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Stop.

305
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Stop.

306
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Don't move.

307
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Stop.

308
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Don't move.

309
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Don't move.

310
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Don't move.

311
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Molin, don't be afraid.

312
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
We've met before.

313
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
We're the police.

314
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
We've caught the three criminals who chased you.

315
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Nan Qiao, I've seen them.

316
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
They're the police.

317
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
We're safe.

318
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Do you know why we're the police?

319
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
I didn't mean to hide from you.

320
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
It's just because...

321
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Do you know these two girls?

322
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Come on, get off.

323
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Get off.

324
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Hurry up.

325
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Get off.

326
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Hurry up.

327
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Get off.

328
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Hurry up.

329
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Hurry up.

330
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Hurry up.

331
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Hurry up.

332
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Where are they?

333
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Don't worry.

334
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
They're safe.

335
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
We've rescued them.

336
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Where are they?

337
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
They're here.

338
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Where are they?

339
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
They're here.

340
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Where are they?

341
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
They're here.

342
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
You're safe too.

343
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Can you tell me

344
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
why you're with Molin?

345
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Are Molin and the others together?

346
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
No, no, no.

347
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Molin is a good guy.

348
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
He saved me.

349
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Believe me, officer.

350
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
He's not a bad guy.

351
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
I see.

352
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Why did you lie?

353
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
I didn't lie.

354
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Since you're his friend,

355
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
do you know his real name?

356
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Do you know where his home is?

357
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
He doesn't have a home.

358
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Your home is in Mulong Town.

359
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Your real name is He Xiaoying.

360
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Your father's name is He Dashan.

361
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
No, no.

362
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I'm not He Xiaoying.

363
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
That's not my home.

364
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
I'm not He Xiaoying.

365
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Man Qiao.

366
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Your father has been looking for you.

367
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Why don't you want to go home?

368
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
No, I don't want to go home.

369
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
That's not my home.

370
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
I'm begging you.

371
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Don't send me back.

372
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
I'm begging you.

373
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Xiaoying.

374
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Can you tell me

375
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
what happened

376
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
that made you so reluctant to go home

377
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
and so afraid of your father?

378
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
What's up?

379
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
I told you to stop.

380
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
You dropped out of school

381
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
and didn't come back to cook for me.

382
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Who will take care of that damn waitress?

383
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
I went to be a waitress as soon as I dropped out of school.

384
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
I earn 30 yuan a day.

385
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
I have to pay tuition,

386
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
pay my family expenses

387
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
and pay you for drinking.

388
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
I raised you so much.

389
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
What about your wine?

390
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Besides,

391
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
you're a waitress.

392
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
You should earn money.

393
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Then you earn money.

394
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
You're a waitress.

395
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
You should earn money.

396
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Then you earn money.

397
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
You don't even pay the rent.

398
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
You rent it to the judge.

399
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
I'm the one who pays the rent.

400
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Besides drinking,

401
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
you're free to talk.

402
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
What else can you do?

403
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Rent a place?

404
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
You don't even pay the rent.

405
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,200
That's called a rent.

406
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
You went to gamble again?

407
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,200
You're the one who made the bet.

408
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I made the bet?

409
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
My mom sent me money again?

410
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Didn't you lie to her again?

411
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
How many times did I lie to her?

412
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
She sent me so much money.

413
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Besides lying to my mom,

414
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
who else can you lie to?

415
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Don't mention that bitch.

416
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Since she left me,

417
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
she has been hanging around with me.

418
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
What about you?

419
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
You're with that waitress every day.

420
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
You think I don't know?

421
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
You bitch!

422
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
You're a dog?

423
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
You're a dog?

424
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
If I didn't drink for her,

425
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
I would have beaten you to death.

426
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
You're still a dog?

427
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
I'm sorry.

428
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
I'm sorry.

429
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
I'm sorry.

430
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
I'm sorry.

431
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
I'm sorry.

432
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
I'm sorry.

433
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
I'm sorry.

434
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
I'm sorry.

435
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
I'm sorry.

436
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
I'm sorry.

437
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
I'm sorry.

438
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
I'm sorry.

439
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
I'm sorry.

440
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
I'm sorry.

441
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
I'm sorry.

442
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,200
I'm sorry.

443
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
I'm sorry.

444
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
I'm sorry.

445
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
I'm sorry.

446
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
I'm sorry.

447
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm sorry.

448
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
I'm sorry.

449
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
I'm sorry.

450
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
I'm sorry.

451
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
I'm sorry.

452
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
I'm sorry.

453
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
I'm sorry.

454
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
I'm sorry.

455
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
I'm sorry.

456
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
I'm sorry.

457
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
What are you doing?

458
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Go to hell.

459
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
I'll tell you!

460
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
Tell me!

461
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Kong Pero Tong, let me tell you Per Gross!

462
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Even I can't pay them a support

463
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
I'm sorry.

464
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
The police said twice

465
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
that my dad was my guardian.

466
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,320
He needed to send me back to his side.

467
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
When the police were here,

468
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
he was fine.

469
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
When the police left,

470
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
he was like a different person.

471
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
He would definitely sell me out.

472
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
I beg you.

473
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
I beg you not to send me back, okay?

474
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Don't send me back.

475
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
I beg you.

476
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
I beg you.

477
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
Don't be afraid.

478
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,320
I won't send you back.

479
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
I won't let anyone hurt you.

480
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,320
Even if that person is your father.

481
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Thank you.

482
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Thank you.

483
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
He's already poor enough.

484
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
I can protect him.

485
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
How?

486
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
Lock him in the little wooden house in the deep mountains.

487
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
You'll protect him.

488
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
What did he say to you?

489
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,320
He ran out of the house.

490
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
He wanted to find his mother.

491
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
But his mother couldn't reach her.

492
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
There was no other way.

493
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
He wanted to work and make money.

494
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
But he met those people.

495
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,320
At that time,

496
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,320
I thought they were working.

497
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,320
I didn't expect

498
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
they would poison me.

499
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
Later,

500
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
after I woke up,

501
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,320
I was locked in a little wooden house.

502
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
Later,

503
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
when they took us to the hospital,

504
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
I ran away

505
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
without noticing them.

506
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Run away.

507
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Run away.

508
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,320
They were eating me all night.

509
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Brother,

510
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
there's no medicine.

511
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Don't look for it.

512
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Where is it?

513
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Jin Mingyue, over here.

514
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
I walked to the waist of the mountain.

515
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
I saw three guys and two men.

516
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,320
I saw them chasing after each other.

517
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
Stop.

518
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,320
Stop.

519
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,320
Where are they?

520
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
There's one more.

521
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
We can't run away.

522
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,320
Look over there.

523
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,320
Sanlaizi

524
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,320
is a famous gang in our town.

525
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
He's very good at stealing and hunting dogs.

526
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
I don't know the other two.

527
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
Why didn't you call the police?

528
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
I was afraid Sanlaizi would take revenge on me.

529
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,320
If he did,

530
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
our family wouldn't be safe.

531
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,320
So,

532
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
I hid the chain in the mountain.

533
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,320
Dad.

534
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,320
Lin,

535
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,320
who is this girl?

536
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,320
Sanlaizi, that little bastard.

537
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
I don't know why

538
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,320
he's chasing after her.

539
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,320
Luckily, I saved him.

540
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,320
He said he was dragged from the woodshed.

541
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
Woodshed?

542
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
What?

543
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
Anyway,

544
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
he can't be caught by the little bastard.

545
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,320
We'd better call the police.

546
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
I beg you, Uncle Lin.

547
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
Please save me.

548
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
Save me.

549
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
How about this?

550
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,320
Take her across the mountain

551
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
and go to your uncle's house.

552
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Call the police when you get there.

553
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Give her to the police.

554
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Okay.

555
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
Go.

556
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,320
Follow me.

557
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
Thank you.

558
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
Thanks to Mo Lin and Uncle Mo.

559
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,320
If it weren't for them,

560
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
I would have been caught again.

561
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,320
Officer,

562
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,320
believe me.

563
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
He's a good man.

564
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,320
He saved me.

565
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Okay.

566
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
I believe you.

567
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
We won't wrong a good man.

568
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
Okay.

569
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,320
You may need to

570
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
settle down here for a while.

571
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
I may need your help in the future.

572
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
Is that okay?

573
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
Okay.

574
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
What about Mo Lin?

575
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
Don't worry.

576
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
He'll be fine.

577
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
Drink some hot water.

578
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
Warm up.

579
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,320
I didn't tell you anything.

580
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,320
Right.

581
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,320
You'll be released

582
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
in two days.

583
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
I won't say anything.

584
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
Stop talking nonsense.

585
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
Write down the process.

586
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
Yes.

587
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Let's go.

588
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Let's sign it.

589
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,320
Sign what?

590
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,320
I didn't say anything.

591
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Your handwriting

592
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
is very clear

593
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
about the process.

594
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
You really think

595
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
we can't

596
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
settle you down

597
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
without your permission?

598
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
It's very clear.

599
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,320
Abortion,

600
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320
kidnapping,

601
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
knife-threatening,

602
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,320
and assault.

603
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,320
These are all facts.

604
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
You don't need to know.

605
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,320
After signing this,

606
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
send you to the police station.

607
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,320
The materials

608
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,320
will be handed over to the procuratorate.

609
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,320
Okay.

610
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
I'll go.

611
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,320
The rest is up to the court.

612
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,320
You...

613
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
You can sign

614
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,320
five to eight years

615
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
and five to seven years.

616
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,320
Don't waste time.

617
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,320
Sign it.

618
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
Officer,

619
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
why are you suddenly five to seven years old?

620
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,320
You didn't say anything.

621
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
You didn't ask today.

622
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
Ask.

623
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
Ask and I'll tell you.

624
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,320
I said I'll tell you.

625
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,320
I said I'll tell you.

626
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Officer,

627
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
ask.

628
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
Now you know

629
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
I'll tell you.

630
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
I...

631
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
I have a letter.

632
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
Ask.

633
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Ask and I'll tell you.

634
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,320
Who is your superior?

635
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
He's a friend on the street.

636
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,320
I just met him not long ago.

637
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,320
We call him Mr. Skin.

638
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
He seems to

639
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
like to eat salted duck eggs.

640
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,320
Sit down.

641
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
You...

642
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
Brother,

643
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
this woman is too disobedient.

644
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,320
She's been struggling all night.

645
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
She won't let the guests touch her.

646
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,320
She offended the guests.

647
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,320
That's not good.

648
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,320
Take good care of her.

649
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,320
All right, all right, all right.

650
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
Such a beautiful face.

651
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
It's a pity to break it.

652
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
Raise your head.

653
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Raise your head.

654
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
Listen to me.

655
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
If you listen to me from the ground up,

656
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,320
I promise they won't dare to bully you anymore.

657
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Okay?

658
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
You bastards.

659
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
I'm dying.

660
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
It's none of your business.

661
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
Brother, come on.

662
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Come on.

663
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Come on.

664
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
No, no.

665
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Dad.

666
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Dad.

667
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
Here you are.

668
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,320
The beef noodles you ordered, right?

669
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
If you want to eat spicy food,

670
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
we made it ourselves.

671
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Try it.

672
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
You can add more.

673
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
Okay, thank you.

674
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,320
Yuan Yue.

675
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,320
Come on, come on.

676
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
Auntie.

677
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
Sit down.

678
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
Sit down.

679
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Come on.

680
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Are you free today?

681
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,320
You said on TV that

682
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,320
you've been solving several cases recently.

683
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
That's great.

684
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
That's the chicken soup.

685
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
No trouble.

686
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
No trouble.

687
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
Old flour and chili powder.

688
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
Okay.

689
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Okay.

690
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,320
Here it is.

691
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,320
Try it.

692
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
Is it still the same old taste?

693
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
It's exactly the same as when I was a kid.

694
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
Really?

695
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,320
The soup has a lot of ingredients

696
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,320
that are hard to find.

697
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
I just need to buy more when I run into birds.

698
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,320
I just have to keep this taste.

699
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,320
Ran Ran also likes to eat old flour.

700
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,320
But she has a lot of mouth.

701
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
She doesn't want coriander,

702
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
green onion,

703
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,320
or five-spice powder.

704
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,320
I don't know what flavor she likes.

705
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,320
Auntie.

706
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
Actually,

707
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,320
I've been to many school jobs these years.

708
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,320
But I only dare to stand outside.

709
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
I'm too ashamed to come in.

710
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
I...

711
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,320
I had a lot of nightmares.

712
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
In my dreams,

713
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,320
I also had many ifs and buts.

714
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,320
If I hadn't asked Lin Ran to go out and play,

715
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,320
if I hadn't asked her to go out and play,

716
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,320
she wouldn't have been locked away by the criminal.

717
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,320
If I had tried hard to catch the criminal's leg,

718
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
if I had caught her,

719
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
the criminal wouldn't have taken Ran Ran away.

720
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
If she had taken her away,

721
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
I would have...

722
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Grandpa.

723
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
I can't blame you.

724
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,320
You were still a child.

725
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
What could you do?

726
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
Yes.

727
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Ran Ran was wrong.

728
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
My family...

729
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
has also been separated.

730
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
I've also forgotten about it.

731
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
But...

732
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
Grandpa.

733
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
I've never blamed you.

734
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
Grandpa.

735
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
You...

736
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
went to the National University of the State,

737
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
and went to the National School of the Arts.

738
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Did you do all this

739
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,320
because of Ran Ran?

740
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Grandpa.

741
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
I will find Ran Ran.

742
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
Thank you.

743
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,320
Boss.

744
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,320
The food is ready.

745
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
Well...

746
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,320
Ran Ran.

747
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
When you're free,

748
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,320
you can come to the small restaurant.

749
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
I'll make you some food.

750
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
Okay.

751
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Eat.

752
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Okay.

753
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
Welcome next time.

754
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
Bye.

755
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
Jia Jia.

756
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Look.

757
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
Who was in charge of this case?

758
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
Brother Rui.

759
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Where is he?

760
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Why can't I see him at work?

761
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,320
It's not about work anyway.

762
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Are you in love?

763
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
You guess.

764
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,320
Really?

765
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,320
What does he do with his girlfriend?

766
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
No.

767
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
He took Luo Luo out to play.

768
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,320
Luo Luo?

769
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
The kid who was sent to the orphanage?

770
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Yes.

771
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Didn't we find Luo Luo's sister before?

772
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
Her foster parents didn't want to take her.

773
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
Luo Luo was so angry.

774
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,320
She said she didn't want to take Luo Luo out.

775
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Since then,

776
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
she often took Luo Luo out to play.

777
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
She didn't want to let everyone know.

778
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Rui Rui is like that.

779
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,320
She doesn't believe in knives.

780
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Is he trying to make me angry?

781
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
해 Not bad.

782
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,320
I think he justfeit out on me.

783
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,320
I think as long as vetting allows,

784
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:30,320
L Beckham must have made too much unstable for me.

785
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:50,300
I've always thought moving is better for the

786
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,080
What?

787
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,560
How about it? Is it fun to travel?

788
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,120
Yes.

789
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,120
What are we going to do next?

790
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,360
roller coaster.

791
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,640
You can't ride a roller coaster.

792
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,240
It's too small.

793
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,840
Then you go and play. I'll go and see you.

794
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,640
I...

795
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,800
It's no fun if I don't play.

796
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,920
Are you scared?

797
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,400
Do you want to go to the toilet?

798
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,760
No.

799
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,360
I'm going to the toilet. You go with me.

800
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,640
Who wants to ride a roller coaster at the door of the toilet?

801
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,440
I'll go.

802
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,360
Then you wait for me here alone.

803
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,680
Don't run around. I'll be right back.

804
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,040
I'll be right back.

805
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,680
Good night!

806
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,080
會晒?

807
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,800
會晒?
