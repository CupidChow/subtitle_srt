00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,820
=Episode 20=

3
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,860
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

4
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,060
(Cripple)

5
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,820
(Wang Guangqing)

6
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,260
(Huang Chuan)

7
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,460
(Madam Hong, involved in multiple cases)

8
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,120
(Now that I think of it...)

9
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,720
It's a bit strange.

10
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,560
He told me

11
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,400
he hasn't heard from Cripple in years.

12
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,920
(He even asked me)

13
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,160
(if we'd arrested him.)

14
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:14,444
(Huang Chuan)
(Old Yellow Dog,)

15
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,720
(is there something
you're still not telling us?)

16
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,880
(Chang Rui, I have a theory)

17
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,680
(about Cripple.)

18
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,800
(The reason we haven't found him)

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,880
is that we pegged
the wrong identifying feature.

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,520
(Cripple might not be lame at all.)

21
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,240
(That limp could be a disguise.)

22
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,920
The lame man I saw as a kid

23
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
could've been fake too.

24
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:33,266
He's been hiding in the shadows,

25
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:34,644
never revealing his true self.

26
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,080
Meet me at the detention center.

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,400
We'll re-interrogate Old Yellow Dog.

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,040
I'm on my way.

29
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,480
We meet again.

30
00:02:47,422 --> 00:02:48,422
Start talking.

31
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,000
Talk about what?

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,410
I've told you

33
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,720
everything I know.

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,080
Cripple.

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,240
How much do you know about him?

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,080
I never dealt with him directly.

37
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,080
Fei Yan was the go-between.

38
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,777
I, too, would like to know

39
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,280
who this guy

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,840
really is.

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,220
I asked around,

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,210
and all I got

43
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,444
was his nickname, Cripple.

44
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,560
But once,

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,200
I was drinking with a dog dealer.

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,800
He said

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,400
he knew Cripple.

48
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,480
He even told me,

49
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,880
Cripple's leg is with someone else.

50
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:22,840
Once limb gets back and reattaches,
he'll no longer be crippled.

51
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,920
I figured

52
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,520
he was just drunk,

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,844
so I didn't press further.

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,000
Dog dealer?

55
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,240
A dog seller.

56
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,800
He also dabbled in theft
and fencing stolen goods.

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,760
Tell us about him.

58
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,244
You might earn some credit.

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,320
That guy

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,280
got arrested

61
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,320
years ago.

62
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,080
The guy Huang Chuan mentioned

63
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,120
might be Zhou Hongcai.

64
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,777
Convicted of trafficking in '86,
sentenced to 5 years.

65
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,720
In 2006,

66
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,640
he got another 3 years

67
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,360
for theft.

68
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,900
1986?

69
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,880
Isn't that...

70
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,520
You think he might be Cripple?

71
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:53,160
Whether he is or not,

72
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,520
it's our best lead yet.

73
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,300
(Cripple)

74
00:04:59,400 --> 00:04:59,800
Hello?

75
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,440
Old friend.

76
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,640
It's me.

77
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:05,244
Who is this?

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,600
Don't you recognize my voice?

79
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,311
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,680
I know

81
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,880
you're doing well these days.

82
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,400
Isn't it time you helped

83
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:19,844
your old buddy out?

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,040
Still don't remember?

85
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,480
Here's a hint.

86
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,160
Over 20 years ago,

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,160
in Linshan City,

88
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,440
there was a little girl
about seven or eight years old...

89
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,600
Hello?

90
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,488
Just you wait.

91
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,280
(That scumbag Wai is out of prison.)

92
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,840
(How did he get my number?)

93
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,760
(Could it be that)

94
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,480
(he's still in touch with Cripple?)

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,400
Man, you're here.

96
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,360
You're early today.

97
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,250
My nanny took my kid to school.

98
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
I had nothing to do,

99
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,080
so I figured I'd come by early.

100
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,600
I've been busy with my kid lately.

101
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,800
My shoulders and neck are killing me.

102
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,880
Let me help her stretch.
You go take a break.

103
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,240
You really know how to hit the spot.

104
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,920
I just love

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,680
when you do it.

106
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,280
Come by whenever you're free.

107
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,160
If I'm not around,

108
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,360
Xiaolian can do it for you.

109
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,440
No way.

110
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,080
I only like your technique.

111
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,860
Man,

112
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,640
the holidays are almost here.

113
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,240
Where are you planning to go?

114
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,080
We're going to Qinmang again.

115
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
I've heard you mention Qinmang
several times now.

116
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,880
Is it really that fun?

117
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,320
My husband runs a few hotels over there.

118
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm not going there to have fun.

119
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,120
I'm just bringing
our three little rascals

120
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,720
to meet up with him.

121
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,080
You're so lucky, Man.

122
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,720
Three sons in a row!

123
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,260
Just having two little boys

124
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,400
already drove me crazy.

125
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,770
I didn't even want a third boy.

126
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,760
I really wanted a girl.

127
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,720
So,

128
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,320
I went ahead

129
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,040
and bore the child despite my old age.

130
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
And when I looked...

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,080
My goodness,

132
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,240
it was another boy!

133
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,960
Other people

134
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,480
are all desperate for boys,

135
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,240
and you want a girl?

136
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,880
That's old-fashioned thinking.

137
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,280
I like girls.

138
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,880
So does my husband.

139
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,120
If I weren't so old,

140
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,040
I'd definitely

141
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,480
have another one.

142
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,530
Why not adopt one from the orphanage?

143
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,040
Let me tell you,

144
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,600
the adoption process is a real pain.

145
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
My husband's always abroad
and super busy.

146
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,520
Where would we find the time
or energy to deal with it?

147
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,760
That's true.

148
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,040
Jenny,

149
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
you've got the connections, right?

150
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,920
Help me find a girl.

151
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,560
It's not that easy.

152
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,280
Come on, do me a favor.

153
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,440
Money's not a problem.

154
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,600
Alright then.

155
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,920
I'll see what I can do.

156
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,760
I'll ask around.

157
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,720
Jenny,

158
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,560
I found someone who fits your request.

159
00:08:58,577 --> 00:09:00,910
He's an experienced guy from out of town
who just got released.

160
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:01,777
He's short on cash.

161
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:03,120
You can bargain for a lower price.

162
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,511
I'll send you his number shortly.

163
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,560
Hello?

164
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,280
Wai,

165
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,440
I've got a job. Do you want it?

166
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,160
Who are you?

167
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,680
How do you know

168
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,960
my name?

169
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,040
Don't worry about that.

170
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,840
A girl.

171
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,066
Two or three years old.

172
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,520
Bring her to Linshan.

173
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,200
Twenty grand.

174
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:33,422
Are you in or not?

175
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:36,000
Linshan's under a major crackdown.

176
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,280
It's risky.

177
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:39,440
Twenty's too low.

178
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,080
Thirty.

179
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,933
Alright. I'll wait for your update.

180
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,120
I should've said forty!

181
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,440
Forty?

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,600
What forty?

183
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,320
What did you just hear?

184
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,400
Go.

185
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,170
Make me some twice-cooked pork,

186
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,111
and bring a bottle of your best baijiu.

187
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,800
Baijiu, okay?

188
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,840
(Dear passengers, welcome aboard
the Jiushan bus.)

189
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,640
(Approaching final stop, Ping'anli.)

190
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,840
(Please take all personal belongings

as a child.

375
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:57,422
Right?

376
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,600
She carried so much grief
from such a young age.

377
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,200
Despite all that, she joined
the Anti-abduction Office.

378
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,260

such a rough time at first...

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,920
Is your back pain gone?

413
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,800
I bought a lumbar support device.

414
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
Wore it for a few days,
and the pain's gone.

415

Around 200 yuan.

421
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,320
How's your back now?

422
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,000
Much better.

423

- Never seen him.
- No.

550
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:58,400
Zhou Hongcai may have gotten off
at Xingtan.

551
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,200
Based on typical trafficker behavior,

552
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:04,720
they usually try to sell the kid
as soon as they get them.

553
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,480
If he boarded a bus for Linshan,

554
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,280
it means

555
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,360
he planned to make the trade in Linshan.

556
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,120
The key question now is,

557
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,000
how will he enter Linshan City?

558
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
Only three options right now. By bus,

559
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,160
long-distance coach,

560
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,080
or on foot.

00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,720
means he knows
there's no surveillance there.

563
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,990
He's trying to dodge the police.

564
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,840
Alright, Chang Rui,

565
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,320
you and Yan Lei stay focused
on Linshan's urban area.

566
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,200
Copy that.

567
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:38,780
(Linshan Bus Terminal)

568
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
He's still not here after all this time.

569
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Will Zhou Hongcai really show up?

570
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,960
He didn't sell the child right away.

571
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,960
Instead, he bought a ticket to Linshan.

572
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,920
That suggests the buyer
is likely in Linshan.

573
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,640
But then he got off at Xingtan.

574
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,800
Either the trade takes place
near Xingtan,

575
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,960
or he got tipped off somehow.

576
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,760
In any case,

577
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,466
he'll try every way to get into Linshan.

578
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,320
This road is his only way through.

579
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:12,180
(Yunxiang Road)

580
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,320
Hey,

581
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:16,700
a bottle of water.

582
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,700
Well,

583
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,955
how do I get into the city?

584
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,920
That way.

585
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,320
The buses

586
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,350
and the train

587
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,040
to Linshan are all over there.

588
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,080
I just came from there.

589
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,760
My bag's heavy,

590
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,480
and it's a pain getting on the bus.

591
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,920
I want to grab a taxi,

592
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,360
but couldn't get one.

593
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,444
I'll tell you what.

594
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,360
See over there?

595
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:48,960
That way.

596
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,022
Under the bridge.

597
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:52,133
There are lots of unlicensed cabs there.

598
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:52,640
There?

599
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,000
Right.

600
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:53,920
Okay.

601
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,560
I see it.

602
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,000
Thanks.

603
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,666
You're welcome.

604
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,120
Thanks.

605
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,880
You're welcome.

606
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,520
Alright, big joker it is.

607
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:05,920
Pass.

608
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,560
Pass.

609
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,360
Sir.

610
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,330
Can you take me into the city?

611
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,160
Yeah, hop in.

612
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,060
How much?

613
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,020
Fifty yuan.

614
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,520
Fifty yuan?

615
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,820
Can't go any lower?

616
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:39,040
That's what everyone charges.

617
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,800
Same price for all.

618
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,880
Alright, let's go.

619
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,710
Hold on.

620
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,020
Let's go.

621
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:10,880
(During the crackdown,)

622
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,160
(the city government
will strengthen leadership,)

623
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:14,520
(improve coordination mechanisms,)

624
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,800
(handle cases strictly by law,)

625
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,920
(and enforce accountability)

626
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,280
(to ensure the targeted operation
is effective.)

627
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,360
(Departments must collaborate closely,)

628
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,680
(strengthen governance,)

629
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,080
(and reduce crime at the source.)

630
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,480
Crackdown, crackdown...

631
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,490
Every day is a crackdown.

632
00:37:29,511 --> 00:37:31,088
We get inspected eight times a day.

633
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,480
We drivers are forced to hide
all day long.

634
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,000
You're not local, are you?

635
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,200
No, I'm not.

636
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,440
What brings you to Linshan then?

637
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,480
Visiting relatives.

638
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,440
You have family here?

639
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,640
A few.

640
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,160
Sir.

641
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,160
How much longer?

642
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,960
We're almost there.

643
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,280
Zhou Hongcai

644
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,520
got off at Xingtan,
where there's no surveillance.

645
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,240
So he's clearly trying
to avoid the police.

646
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,720
The girl Fan Xinran

647
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,880
has congenital heart disease.

648
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,720
We must find her as soon as possible.

649
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,920
Yes, we must rescue
the abducted child quickly

650
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,120
and make sure she's safe.

651
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,440
Chief Xiao,

652
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,060
how about

653
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,120
we make public

654
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,240
the information about the trafficker
and the child?

655
00:38:26,622 --> 00:38:28,200
Leverage the power of the public,

656
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,400
and locate them as quickly as possible.

657
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,480
Deng Yan, Mr. Yin,

658
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,080
what's your take?

659
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,960
I think

660
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,240
for now, we'd better

661
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,622
hold off on releasing the info.

662
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,120
Well,

663
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,760
if Zhou Hongcai

664
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,240
has already entered Linshan City,

665
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,200
making it public

666
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,640
might help us locate him quickly.

667
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,920
But if he hasn't entered the city yet,

668
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,600
and we release the info now,

669
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,000
he might run,

670
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,720
or even abandon the child.

671
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,520
By then,

672
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,030
it would seriously undermine

673
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,350
our search and rescue efforts.

674
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:00,840
Han Liang, what do you think?

675
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,440
I think Director Deng
makes a good point.

676
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,880
Releasing the info too early

677
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,720
risks alerting the suspect.

678
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,440
But delaying too long

679
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,400
might mean we miss our chance

680
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,520
to rescue the child in time.

681
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,320
That's a risk too,

682
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,600
and we have to weigh it.

683
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,040
Alright.

684
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,920
We'll follow Deng Yan's recommendation

685
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:20,520
and hold off on releasing the info.

686
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,400
But once we confirm
Zhou Hongcai is in the city,

687
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,760
release it immediately.

688
00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:24,600
Understood.

689
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,600
Director Deng.

690
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,640
Even though the bureau agreed to delay
the citywide alert,

691
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,960
I'm concerned

692
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,520
that if anything goes wrong

693
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,955
and something happens to the child,

694
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,720
it could reflect badly on you.

695
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:02,279
Right now, all I care about
is saving that child.

696
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,955
I don't want to think
about anything else.

697
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,080
That suggestion

698
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,560
to delay the citywide alert

699
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,088
should've come from me.

700
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,080
I'm about to retire anyway.

701
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,640
I don't mind.

702
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,377
If anything happens, I'll take the heat.

703
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:18,960
Mr. Yin,

704
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,360
I know you mean well.

705
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,720
But I'm the director
of the Anti-abduction Office.

706
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:25,311
It's my responsibility.

707
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:29,600
Alright.

708
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,080
By the way, can you check in on Xingtan

709
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,488
and see how the search is going?

710
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:36,688
Got it.

711
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,250
(Today we've invited)

712
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,210
(Professor Li Aihua from the Department
of Design at Huaqing University,)

713
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,050
(and renowned author Mr. Jin Rongshan)

714
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,420
(to join us in the studio...)

715
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,460
(Shining a light on social issues
and sharing heartwarming stories.)

716
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,290
(Thanks for tuning in
to Life in Society.)

717
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,530
(Here,)

718
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:00,060
(we take you to every corner
of society...)

719
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,880
Sir, how much longer till we get there?

720
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,680
Almost there.

721
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,330
(Hello, listeners,)

722
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,300
(this is Life in Society,)

723
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,960
(broadcasting at 12 every day.)

724
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,330
(I'm your host.)

725
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,480
(Recently, we've seen a wave)

726
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,150
(of impactful charitable initiatives
across society.)

727
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,550
(These nonprofit groups...)

728
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:24,800
You check over there.

729
00:41:24,822 --> 00:41:25,377
Alright.

730
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,480
The police are here.

731
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,680
Hello.

732
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,440
Hi.

733
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,080
Have you seen this person?

734
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,280
Yeah, I have.

735
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,760
Can you confirm it's him?

736
00:41:42,888 --> 00:41:43,800
Yes, it's him.

737
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:44,955
When?

738
00:41:44,977 --> 00:41:47,022
Just a while ago.
After buying a bottle of water,

739
00:41:47,044 --> 00:41:48,780
he headed over there
to catch an illegal cab.

740
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,760
That way?

741
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,320
Yes.

742
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:50,960
Thanks a lot.

743
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,760
No problem.

744
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,250
Alright, let's go.

745
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,810
The police are here!

746
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,640
Hey, stop!

747
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,480
Stop right there!

748
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,240
Stop!

749
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:01,960
