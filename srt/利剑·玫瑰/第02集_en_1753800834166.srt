1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Maybe this Fafa was also dragged by Baibai.

2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Then we can check if there are any cases in the previous reports that match the Fafa's situation.

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's go.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Fafa's case is very similar to the Fafa's case.

5
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Director, these three documents match the Fafa's situation very well.

6
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
A Xin, come with me to the hospital tomorrow.

7
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

8
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Director, please come with me to the hospital tomorrow.

9
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Fafa, why are you sitting on the floor? Is it cold?

10
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I brought you a small gift.

11
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is this your little bear? I brought it back for you.

12
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Make sure it's yours.

13
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This little bear is so precious. Who gave it to you?

14
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let me show you.

15
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I have a white treasure chest.

16
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I have everything in my pocket.

17
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Look.

18
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll put it on for you. It will be different immediately.

19
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There is a card on the side.

20
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you want to try my magic?

21
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm going to the hospital.

22
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Does it hurt?

23
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You must listen to your father.

24
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If you don't listen, your stomach will hurt.

25
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Relax.

26
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Are you two together?

27
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You two are together.

28
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm a police officer.

29
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The police catch bad people.

30
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Are you going to catch my father?

31
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If your father is a bad person, the police will catch him.

32
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Officer Zhang.

33
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Say it.

34
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Say it.

35
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It is said that the white board is very poisonous.

36
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He usually goes to places with a family.

37
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
OK.

38
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you, brother.

39
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Police, please check the address.

40
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Play this?

41
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Three balls first.

42
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How big is the ball?

43
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
2000 is the highest.

44
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Hello, the police.

45
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yan Lei, the white board is poisonous.

46
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You check the underground casino of the amusement park you went to immediately.

47
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't miss any news.

48
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
OK, understood.

49
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And contact Chang Rui immediately.

50
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Inform him to continue investigating the casino.

51
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes.

52
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Please.

53
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Hello, the police.

54
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Lei, I have found the white board is poisonous.

55
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm looking for it based on this clue.

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Brother Rui, the owner just called.

57
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He said the situation is similar to you.

58
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's check the underground casino and amusement park.

59
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I not only know the white board is poisonous.

60
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I also know which casino he plays.

61
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll talk to him first.

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
OK.

63
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
These two people won't be on the bar, right?

64
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's what it means.

65
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hello, the police.

66
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Don't sleep. Come and play.

67
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The group of the crab.

68
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Which group?

69
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The big bank that we played together these days.

70
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Today, we are going to play in the city of the mountains.

71
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I have no money.

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You should come if you have no money.

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I tell you, the chance is not lost.

74
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Today, the game is won.

75
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The game is won.

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The game is won.

77
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The chance is not lost.

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Today, the game is won.

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't blame me for not telling you.

80
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Come on.

81
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Come on.

82
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Come on.

83
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,060
Come on, or they'll give us without me.

84
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,540
Meet your master now.

85
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,260
Don't rest until we surrender!

86
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,260
We'll take this side,

87
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,260
don't lose, we won't lose!

88
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,040
생일bol hogiai,

89
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,100
let's go!

90
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,820
Let's go!

91
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,960
Pass, ten,

92
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,440
eleven, am Standing Mute,

93
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Cheers!

94
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Cheers!

95
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Thank you, boss.

96
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Cheers!

97
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Cheers!

98
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Cheers!

99
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Cheers!

100
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Cheers!

101
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Cheers!

102
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Cheers!

103
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,440
2, 4, 6, 8, 9.

104
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Cheers!

105
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
This doesn't count.

106
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Boss,

107
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
don't be so shameless.

108
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,440
It's just a few bucks.

109
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Here you go.

110
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Boss,

111
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
shut up!

112
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,440
If you want to play,

113
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
get lost.

114
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Who are you?

115
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Boss,

116
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
he's a spy.

117
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Don't get in his way.

118
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
You can't eat or play with him.

119
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Only gambling can help.

120
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
We're just having fun.

121
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Don't change the rules.

122
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
That one counts.

123
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
I'll give you the money.

124
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
The money...

125
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Boss, he has money.

126
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
He's got a win.

127
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
Thank you, boss.

128
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Bring the chair.

129
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Come on.

130
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Come on.

131
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Sit down.

132
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Sit.

133
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Sit.

134
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Let me introduce myself.

135
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
I'm Xie.

136
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
I just came to Lingshan.

137
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,440
I want to do business here.

138
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
I'm the one who's in charge of the game.

139
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
I want to make friends with you.

140
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
I came out to meet you.

141
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,440
It's all for money.

142
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
I don't know if you've thought about it.

143
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Why some people make money

144
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
and even make big money,

145
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
while some people

146
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
can only work all night

147
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
and lose money.

148
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
You're so stupid.

149
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,440
This is all the money

150
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
I've saved.

151
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,440
I've added some more.

152
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,440
I'll take it.

153
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,440
How's it going?

154
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Can you make friends?

155
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
My name is Xiao Bai.

156
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
My name is Zhao Da Feng.

157
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
I'm crazy.

158
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Brother Bai.

159
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Brother Zhao.

160
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,440
From my experience,

161
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
sometimes it's not about skills.

162
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,440
It's about who you work with.

163
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I hope you can help me.

164
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
In Lingshan,

165
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
we'll make the game bigger

166
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
and earn money together.

167
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
Director Lin,

168
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
I found more than half of them.

169
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
He has a colleague named Zhao Da Feng.

170
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Zhao Da Feng?

171
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,440
I've never heard of him.

172
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
They should be in the same group.

173
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
I suspect they're a gang of crooks.

174
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
I want to make it longer.

175
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
The most urgent thing now

176
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
is to find Zhou Min and Zheng Wei Wei.

177
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I know.

178
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
I've already told them.

179
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
They'll know.

180
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
Director Leng.

181
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Director Zhao is here.

182
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
He said Bai Ban found him.

183
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
He also found a person named Zhao Da Feng.

184
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
There might be a bigger fish.

185
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
So he's not in a hurry to collect it.

186
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
I want him to check

187
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Zhou Min and Zheng Wei Wei.

188
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Okay, I know.

189
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
I'll report to Han Chu later.

190
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Zhao Da Feng.

191
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,440
The next day

192
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Okay, I'm done.

193
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Good boy.

194
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Someone, is there a doctor?

195
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Call 120.

196
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
Call 120.

197
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
120?

198
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Someone fainted here.

199
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Hello, call 120.

200
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Okay, I'll be there right away.

201
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Director,

202
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
we received a report.

203
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
There's a man missing in the small square.

204
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
We need to get him out immediately.

205
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Anxin, stay here.

206
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,440
Okay. How long has the child been missing?

207
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
Less than an hour.

208
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Contact the central office.

209
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
There's a child missing.

210
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Please start the blue emergency.

211
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
120, I'm 110.

212
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
We've started the blue emergency.

213
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
The surrounding police station is ready.

214
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
The whole city is ready.

215
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Report to you immediately.

216
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
Report, the central office.

217
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
The car is in the signal.

218
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
The four of them are heading to the target.

219
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,440
We're ready.

220
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
120, I'm 120.

221
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,440
We're almost there.

222
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Please start the second response.

223
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
120, the second response is ready.

224
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
After you arrive,

225
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
please report the situation.

226
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Copy that.

227
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Director, Director.

228
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
About half an hour before the accident,

229
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
the child was in the car.

230
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
When the child was in the car,

231
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,440
someone fainted.

232
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,440
The doctor went to help.

233
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,440
The child was gone when he came back.

234
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Please stop the car.

235
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,440
Please stop the car.

236
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Did you hear me?

237
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
I checked. There's no sign.

238
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Where's my grandson?

239
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Where's Yang Yu?

240
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Who saw him?

241
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Did you see him?

242
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Yang Yu!

243
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Yang Yu!

244
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
The people at the scene were

245
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
distracted by the rescue team.

246
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,440
The child's grandmother is going crazy.

247
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
She can't understand what she's saying.

248
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Director, check the sky.

249
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Director, you two go to comfort the family.

250
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Ask about the child.

251
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,440
We must capture the rescue time of three hours.

252
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Hurry up.

253
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Aunt Lin.

254
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Yanyan.

255
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Yanyan.

256
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
My grandson is missing.

257
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Aunt Lin.

258
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Yanyan, you're a police officer.

259
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
You're helping me.

260
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
I saw you grow up.

261
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
You must help me find my grandson.

262
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
I beg you.

263
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Aunt, don't be like this.

264
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
We came to help you find the child.

265
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
You know him?

266
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
My colleague.

267
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
I'll leave it to you.

268
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
You keep it.

269
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Aunt, don't worry.

270
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Tell me your grandson's details first.

271
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
My grandson's name is Lin Yang Yu.

272
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
He was born on January 21, 2009.

273
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
He was born on January 21, 2009.

274
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
Did you shoot him?

275
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
The colleagues and police officers

276
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
are now patrolling the park and the surrounding area.

277
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
Did you inform the other families?

278
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
Yes.

279
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Yanyan.

280
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
The child can be found, right?

281
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Today, it can be found.

282
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Right?

283
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Aunt, don't worry.

284
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
We will do our best.

285
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Mom.

286
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Mom, where is the child? Where is Yang Yu?

287
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
He can't even walk.

288
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
What happened?

289
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
Mom, I'm sorry.

290
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Are you the police?

291
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Why are you all standing there?

292
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
You are all children.

293
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
We are looking for the crime camera

294
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
and the traffic camera to investigate the suspicious vehicle and personnel.

295
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Don't worry. We will do our best.

296
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Which department are you from?

297
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
We are from the police. Don't worry. The child will definitely find it.

298
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
I don't care.

299
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Don't stand here.

300
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Go find the child.

301
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Don't worry. We are doing our best.

302
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
You cooperate with us to make a record.

303
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
So we can get more information.

304
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Let's go.

305
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
This way.

306
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Director Deng.

307
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
What are you doing here for the first time?

308
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
This is the big problem.

309
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
We understand the family's mood.

310
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
But there is no way.

311
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Every time, we are all looking for the right person.

312
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
The most difficult thing for the people in Chongfeng County

313
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
is to communicate with the victims.

314
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
Director Deng, Director Yin,

315
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
I have already contacted the command center. They are also investigating.

316
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
I have also confirmed the situation of the county mayor's crowd.

317
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
It happened suddenly. Everyone was thinking of saving the child.

318
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
So we didn't notice that child.

319
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
The child was not found.

320
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
So we didn't notice that child.

321
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Did you check the parents' social relations?

322
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
Yes. It's very simple.

323
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
No enemies.

324
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Director, look.

325
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
This car has been parked at the dead end of the surveillance camera

326
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
since it entered the park.

327
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Check the time when it left the park.

328
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
This is the time when Dr. Lin saved the person.

329
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
Put the license plate.

330
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
C, C030.

331
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
This car...

332
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
Put the license plate.

333
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Put the license plate.

334
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
The license plate of this car is a car called

335
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
not a night car. It's a car license plate.

336
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Check it while you chase.

337
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
The command center, the command center.

338
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
We have already found suspicious vehicles.

339
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
License plate, C030.

340
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
The suspect vehicle is now at the west side of Longshan Road.

341
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
It's going outside the city.

342
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Immediately call for a patrol car near Longshan Road.

343
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
West side of Longshan Road?

344
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
This car has been parked on the street.

345
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
I don't need to use all the control points. It must be him.

346
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
C030.

347
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
Check the car.

348
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
C030.

349
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Check the car.

350
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
Can you let him fall?

351
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
C030.

352
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Check the car.

353
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,440
C030.

354
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
The suspect vehicle is now at the west side of Longshan Road.

355
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
There are suspicious vehicles.

356
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
Find and stop.

357
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
The suspect vehicle is now at the west side of Longshan Road.

358
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
C030.

359
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
The suspect vehicle is inside.

360
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
C030.

361
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
C030.

362
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
C030.

363
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
C030.

364
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,440
The car is very fast, but it's not very fast.

365
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,440
The car is very fast, but it's not very fast.

366
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,440
The car is very fast, but it's not very fast.

367
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,440
The car is very fast, but it's not very fast.

368
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,440
The car is very fast, but it's not very fast.

369
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Director, the command center sent us the map.

370
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,440
Director, the intersection is ahead. We turn right.

371
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Director, the intersection is ahead. We turn right.

372
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
OK.

373
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,440
Tang Rui, Tang Rui, follow the suspect car.

374
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,440
We'll go to the other side.

375
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
OK.

376
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Director, the road ahead is blocked.

377
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Let the department follow the suspect car.

378
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,440
The distance between the suspect car and the suspect car is 800 meters.

379
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
600 meters.

380
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
400 meters.

381
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
200 meters.

382
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,440
The last 100 meters.

383
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
200 meters.

384
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,440
Follow me.

385
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
Get off the car. Hurry up.

386
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
Get off the car.

387
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Whose car is this?

388
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,440
This is my child.

389
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
Take him away.

390
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Police, I didn't do anything illegal.

391
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
Then why did you run away?

392
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,440
I put some smoke in the car.

393
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,440
And that car is a prop.

394
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,440
I didn't expect you to chase me for so long.

395
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,440
I was afraid, so I ran away.

396
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,440
You hid the smoke in your car and the prop was on your car.

397
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
These are not the main things.

398
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,440
The main thing is why the child is in your car.

399
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,440
Child? What about my child?

400
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
I don't know.

401
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
Police, wait.

402
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Where is the child?

403
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,440
The child is not yours.

404
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
How is that possible? Are you sure?

405
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Yes.

406
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,440
How is that possible?

407
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
Did you make a mistake?

408
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
Let's see it for ourselves.

409
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
We want to confirm it.

410
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
I beg you.

411
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Let's see it for ourselves.

412
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Let's confirm it for ourselves.

413
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
Please.

414
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
Please.

415
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
Calm down.

416
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,440
The DNA test result is out.

417
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,440
The child is not yours.

418
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
The child is not yours.

419
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
Mom.

420
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,440
What do you think of the child?

421
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
He is so young.

422
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,440
He can't talk and walk.

423
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
How can we find him?

424
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
Calm down.

425
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
I'm sorry.

426
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
I'm sorry.

427
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
It's all my fault.

428
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
We're here.

429
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
It's all my fault.

430
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
It's all my fault.

431
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
Calm down.

432
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Go out and find him.

433
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Don't talk.

434
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
You want to find him?

435
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Calm down.

436
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
You want to find him?

437
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Calm down.

438
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
No.

439
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
Get up.

440
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Get up.

441
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,440
He can't live without me.

442
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
Calm down.

443
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
Get up.

444
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,440
We will die.

445
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Get up.

446
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
I know.

447
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
I know.

448
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
I have no other choice.

449
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
That's the way to deal with this job.

450
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Hope and disappointment are interrelated.

451
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,440
You'll get used to it after a long time.

452
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,440
Is it possible that we're looking for the wrong direction?

453
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Is it possible that the criminal didn't run away immediately after he got the child?

454
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Instead, he chose to go to the deep part of the park or some dead ends without surveillance.

455
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Is it possible?

456
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,440
Why would he run to the deep part of the park?

457
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,440
And the park is so big.

458
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
Many corners are set with cameras.

459
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,440
If so, I'm afraid he won't leave the park so easily.

460
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
No.

461
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
I still think something is wrong.

462
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Well, first, we need to expand the search range.

463
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,440
Not only pointing to the park gate and any exit,

464
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,440
but also some corners and deep cameras should be checked carefully.

465
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
Don't miss anyone.

466
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Second, we need to visit the park at the same time.

467
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Maybe there will be some witnesses.

468
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,440
Third, we can't rule out the possibility that the child has escaped.

469
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,440
So we need to contact the police station in the area.

470
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
Check the pass.

471
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Yes.

472
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Director Deng, this park has been here for years.

473
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,440
It's a private park.

474
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
It's here.

475
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
Mrs. Zhang.

476
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
Mrs. Zhang.

477
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Officer Yan.

478
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Are you busy?

479
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
Let me introduce you.

480
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
This is Director Deng, new from our police department.

481
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
Director Deng, this is Mrs. Zhang.

482
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Sit.

483
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Sit down.

484
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,440
Sit down.

485
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,440
Mrs. Zhang, I won't sit.

486
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
I'm here for a favor.

487
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
It's okay, I'm here.

488
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,440
The child lost in the park two days ago.

489
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
We checked the nearby surveillance angle.

490
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
We can't find anything.

491
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,440
We hope we can collaborate with the council.

492
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
If you can find any clue about the child,

493
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
contact me at once.

494
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Got it.

495
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,440
I'll post it on the wall right away

496
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
and notify all volunteers.

497
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
I'll contact you soon.

498
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,760
Thank you.

499
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Director, I'll go answer the phone.

500
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,960
Ran Ran!

501
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Yan Yan.

502
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,440
How are your parents?

503
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
They're fine.

504
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
How about you?

505
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,440
They're fine.

506
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,440
They're fine.

507
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,440
It's great to be a director.

508
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,440
Zhang Yan Yan.

509
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,440
I've never forgotten about Ran Ran.

510
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Director Deng.

511
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
We have to go back.

512
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
Go ahead.

513
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Auntie Zhang, thank you.

514
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,440
I'll come back.

515
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,440
I'll come back.

516
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
I'll come back.

517
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Director Deng

518
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,440
Director Deng

519
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
I'm a lawyer.

520
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Is there anything I can help you with?

521
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
Director Deng

522
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
Hello, this is the police.

523
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
What?

524
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
The new police is calling again?

525
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,440
This is the director of the police in our Lin Shan City Public Security Bureau.

526
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,440
I'm Director Deng Yan.

527
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
I'm sorry, officer.

528
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
I'm the lawyer.

529
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
My name is Sun Wen Han.

530
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,440
The girl sitting next to me is called...

531
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,440
My name is Luo Xiao Xing.

532
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,440
My brother Luo Xiao Yu

533
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,440
has been kidnapped for 15 years.

534
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,440
We've put all our hopes on you.

535
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,440
But to this day,

536
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,440
the police still haven't found any clues about my brother.

537
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,440
My client is suspecting that the police have taken on the responsibility.

538
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,440
I've already read Luo Xiao Yu's case and information.

539
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
The information is indeed complicated.

540
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
Since Luo Xiao Yu lost the case,

541
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
the police of the Lin Shan City Public Security Bureau

542
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
have been investigating and interviewing

543
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,440
327 people.

544
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
They've checked 11 provinces and cities.

545
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,440
They've asked 7.6 billion people.

546
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,440
Since you've done so much, why isn't there any news?

547
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,440
We're still investigating.

548
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,440
This case happened earlier.

549
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,440
The technology wasn't perfect enough.

550
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,440
I've heard this many times.

551
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,440
I just want to know about my brother's whereabouts.

552
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,440
How is he doing?

553
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,440
He...

554
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Even if it's just a little bit of information.

555
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,440
This case is indeed complicated.

556
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,440
We may need some time to investigate.

557
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
Please be patient.

558
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,440
Patience? My brother was kidnapped.

559
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,440
My mother committed suicide.

560
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,440
My father, my grandfather, and grandmother

561
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,440
couldn't wait for Xiao Yu to come back.

562
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,440
They're all dead.

563
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,440
I'm the only one left in our family.

564
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,440
I've waited for 15 years.

565
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,440
I've been looking for 15 years.

566
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,440
How much patience do you still give me?

567
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
Be careful. Sit.

568
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
Director Deng.

569
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,860
You've just started working as a

570
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,440
detective. I understand your professionalism.

571
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
You've done a lot of research.

572
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,440
But you're dealing with a living person.

573
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Not some cold numbers.

574
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
The victims...

575
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
Don't listen to them.

576
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,440
They want the result.

577
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,440
What did you investigate?

578
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,440
What did you do?

579
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,440
What kind of possibility?

580
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
If there's no result,

581
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
it's meaningless.

582
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,440
They want a hope.

583
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
A hope to continue to look for.

584
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
A hope not to give up.

585
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,440
We don't want a meaningless process.

586
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,440
We want a solution.

587
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,440
We want to solve this case.

588
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,440
We want Luo Xiao Yu to go home.

589
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,440
I may not be able to give you an accurate answer.

590
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,440
But I hope

591
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,440
you can give me some time.

592
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
How long?

593
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,440
Wait another 15 years.

594
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,440
Ms. Sun.

595
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Luo Xiao Xin.

596
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
I promise you.

597
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
If I can't solve Luo Xiao Yu's case,

598
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,440
I'll take this gold.

599
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,440
My promise

600
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,440
is so insignificant

601
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,440
in front of their suffering.

602
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,440
I can only feel

603
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
the weight of this sword.

604
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
We're looking for

605
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,440
more than one person.

606
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
But there are

607
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
millions of families behind them.

608
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
The only hope

609
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
in life.

610
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,240
The

611
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,240
only hope

612
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
in life

613
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,240
is

614
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,240
the one

615
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
who can

616
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
solve the case.

617
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,240
The only hope

618
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,240
in life

619
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
is the one

620
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
who can

621
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
solve the case.

622
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,240
The only hope

623
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,240
in life

624
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
is the one

625
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
who can

626
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,040
solve the case.

627
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
This is

628
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,840
ourот Murdered me.

629
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
We are

630
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,840
the same with others.

631
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,840
We're all the same.

632
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,040
She just

633
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,940
happened to begil me.

634
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,740
I don't have a good memory.

635
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,240
I know her,

636
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,040
but I don't see her often.

637
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,640
A fine, please.

638
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,440
Brother...

639
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,140
I really made some money.

640
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,040
I just've been lucky.

641
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,800
Oh my...

642
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,840
You're my financial master.

643
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Didn't we agree that we should invest on a family with money?

644
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,200
Brother Ji, I don't know if I should ask you something.

645
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,840
Then don't ask.

646
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,200
I have to ask you again.

647
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,600
What business did you do in the outside world?

648
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,320
I don't know the rules.

649
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,120
Brother Ji, you don't believe us?

650
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,240
If you leave, who won't be responsible?

651
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,080
If you have something to say, just say it.

652
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,880
I can handle it.

653
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,560
I won't quit.

654
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,400
I know you...

655
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,520
Not too good.

656
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,600
I tried poking you.

657
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,960
Brother, what a coincidence.

658
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,200
We were in the same industry.

659
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,760
Enough.

660
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,780
this

661
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,760
we are peers after getting engaged to each other

662
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,500
is your business doing well?

663
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,340
not bad

664
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,640
which price do you usually pay

665
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,100
usually 30 thousand

666
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,160
looking at surprise

667
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
20 thousand

668
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,940
compared to you

669
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,300
don't you care?

670
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,660
Do you have any cash?

671
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,780
I have a cash that I can check immediately

672
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,060
Just 30,000 yuan, not less than one cent

673
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,300
Don't let me down

674
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,900
Brother Xie, I actually have a little money

675
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,460
Brother Xie, I'll take half of the rest

676
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,840
Just leave this to me

677
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,460
How long does it take?

678
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,340
Two days

679
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,100
OK, two days later, still here

680
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
OK

681
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,020
Take care, Brother Xie

682
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,940
You're breaking the rules

683
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,900
That's right

684
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,420
Come on, give it to me

685
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,300
I'm sorry

686
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,820
Busy

687
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,660
Aunt Zhang

688
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,660
Xiaoqian is here

689
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,340
I came here early in the morning

690
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,620
Not for anything else

691
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,700
Mainly for this

692
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,700
Renting

693
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,700
That

694
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,340
Xiaoqian is so embarrassed

695
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,460
I'm a little tight now

696
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,780
I'm thinking of a way

697
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,380
I'll send it to you when I get it

698
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,060
You just paid me the rent today

699
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,620
Look at my family

700
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,860
I'm still waiting for dinner

701
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:15,980
Old Zhang

702
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,700
Fatty Ye

703
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,980
I still have something to collect

704
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,140
Yes, yes, yes, I have a lot of money

705
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,620
Let's collect together

706
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,780
No, no, how can I use your money?

707
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,100
It's not easy for you to save some money

708
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,980
Isn't this little thing

709
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,740
Isn't it for all of us?

710
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,860
Besides, if you didn't take me to this little house

711
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,220
I don't know what to do

712
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,820
This money

713
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,140
That's right, old Zhang, you say

714
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,940
Or you

715
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,420
Then I don't know where I am now

716
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,420
That's it

717
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,860
Even if I borrow yours first

718
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,860
Ok

719
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,020
That Xiaoqian

720
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,700
Look, this is so much

721
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,780
One thousand and one, you take it first

722
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,620
This is not enough

723
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,820
There are too many differences, Aunt Zhang

724
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,020
You allow me to be a few more days

725
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,420
I'm really thinking of a way

726
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,580
I'm really thinking of a way

727
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,380
I'm really thinking of a way

728
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,380
I'm really thinking of a way

729
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,380
I'm really thinking of a way

730
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,380
I'm really thinking of a way

731
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,380
I'm really thinking of a way

732
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,380
I'm really thinking of a way

733
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,380
I'm really thinking of a way

734
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,380
I'm really thinking of a way

735
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,380
I'm really thinking of a way

736
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,380
I'm really thinking of a way

737
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,380
I'm really thinking of a way

738
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,380
I'm really thinking of a way

739
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,380
I'm really thinking of a way

740
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,380
I'm really thinking of a way

741
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,380
I'm really thinking of a way

742
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,380
I'm really thinking of a way

743
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,380
I'm really thinking of a way

744
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,380
I'm really thinking of a way

745
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,380
I'm really thinking of a way

746
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,380
I'm really thinking of a way

747
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,380
I'm really thinking of a way

748
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,380
I'm really thinking of a way

749
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,380
I'm really thinking of a way

750
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,380
I'm really thinking of a way

751
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,380
I'm really thinking of a way

752
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,380
I'm really thinking of a way

753
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,380
I'm really thinking of a way

754
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,380
I'm really thinking of a way

755
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,380
And this life

756
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,380
Step by step

757
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,380
Staring at you

758
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,380
Staring at you

759
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,380
Staring at you

760
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,380
Staring at you

761
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,380
Like a shoulder

762
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,380
Like a shoulder

763
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,380
Staring at you

764
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,380
Staring at you

765
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,380
Staring at you

766
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,380
Staring at you

767
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,380
Staring at you

768
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,380
The bright gentleness

769
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,380
One moment is a hope

770
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,380
Confirmed now

771
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:36,380
The old days will come back

772
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:40,380
The greeting of time

773
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,380
Follow it to stay

774
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,380
There is always someone standing

775
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,380
Waiting for the light

776
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,380
Hugging the time

777
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,380
The night

778
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:00,380
It will never die

779
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,380
Just like my heart

780
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:08,380
It will never die

781
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,380
The blue heart

782
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:16,380
It will never die

783
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,380
Thank you for watching!
