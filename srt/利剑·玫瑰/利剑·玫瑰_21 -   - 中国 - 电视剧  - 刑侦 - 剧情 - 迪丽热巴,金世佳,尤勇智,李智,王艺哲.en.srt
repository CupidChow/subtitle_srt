All units, attention.

4
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,840
Target is a silver van.

5
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,333
Everyone, prepare to intercept.

(Police)

8
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:24,800
Target spotted. Get ready to intercept.

9
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,520
Quick!

10
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,200
Stop him!

11
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,520
Stop the car! Stop!

12
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,270
The police are here! Run!

13
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,400
Hurry! Move!

14
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,320
Head up.

15
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
Why were you running?

16
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,520
Sir.

17
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,560
Turn around.

18
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
We got the address wrong.

19
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,080
It's wrong.

20
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,560
What now?

21
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,755
Another dead end.

22
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,700
(2 Hours Before Smiley's Surgery)

23
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,280
Sir.

24
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:08,600
Stop at the next intersection.

25
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,533
(Director.)

26
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,600
(Wai got away.)

27
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:13,767
(He must've spotted
the police checkpoint.)

28
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,360
(Got it.)

29
00:04:14,377 --> 00:04:16,220
(Looks like
he's entered Linshan jurisdiction.)

30
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,110
(I'll have Jiajia pull up
all road surveillance)

31

of the North City Bus Station.)

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,840
(Stay on standby.)

33
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:21,600

(Qingyang Street)

35
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,120
Pause it.

36
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,520
Zoom in on the platform.

(Qingyang Street)

39
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,080
That's Zhou Hongcai.

40
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:46,880
Keep an eye on him.

41
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:48,577
He's heading toward the city center.

42
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,200
Chang Rui.

43
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,400
Zhou Hongcai showed up.

44
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,400
He just got off
at Qingyang Street bus stop.

45
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,360
He's in the city now.

46
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,533
Keep tailing him.

47
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,140
(Qingyang Street)

48
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,120
If he's already in the city,

49
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,320
we can issue a citywide manhunt.

50
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,440
Watch all routes on Qingyang Street.

51
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:16,920
Got it.

52
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,100
(Qingyang Street)

53
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,660
(Route 102,
Shengxi Street - Hutian Subdistrict)

54
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,880
Lawyer Sun.

55
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,000
Any update?

56
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,488
Have we found the kid?

57
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
We've gotten tons of tips from netizens.

58
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,320
We're still searching.

59
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,170
Check this out.

60
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,000
Isn't this man holding the child
a bit suspicious?

61
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,240
The suspect is around 60.

62
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,044
This man doesn't look that old.

63
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,280
Also, look,

64
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
the kid's smiling so happily
in his arms.

65
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,866
It doesn't seem like she was coerced.

66
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:44,911
It's probably not him.

67
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,840
Don't lose hope, Xiaoxing.

68
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,560
It's like finding a needle
in a haystack.

69
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,360
What matters most is patience.

70
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:54,960
I'll help search too.

71
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,560
(The bus is moving,
please hold on tight.)

72
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,240

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,240
(Now for a news update.)

76
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,940
(Wanted)

77
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,066
(A three-year-old girl
was abducted in Jiushan City.)

78
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,920
(The suspect
is a man around 60 years old.)

79
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,040
(Medium build.)

80
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,520
(Wearing a dark jacket.)

81
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,440
(If anyone sees someone
matching this description,)

82
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:25,288
(please contact the police immediately.)

83
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,080
He doesn't look like a bad guy.

84
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,440
Bad guys don't wear it on their faces.

85
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,720
People like that

86
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,840
are the most deceptive.

87
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,080
What a poor kid.

88
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,160
Yeah.

89
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,240
Her parents must be worried sick.

90
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,240
For sure.

91
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,600
If we ever have a kid,
we'd better be cautious.

92
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,120
We must keep a close eye on them.

93
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,560
Hello?

94
00:07:57,288 --> 00:07:58,440
Forget about the deal.

95
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,160
What?

96
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,160
Forget about it?

97
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,440
You gave me a sick kid.

98
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,866
How am I supposed to seal the deal?

99
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,840
That's just what the parents said.

100
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,000
Hello?

101
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:09,920
Hello?

102
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,320
What was that sound?

103
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
It's a duckling.

104
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,000
Keep quiet,

105
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,440
or I'll cook you in soup
when we get back.

This one?

111
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,040
Zoom in again.

112
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,840
Not quite.

113
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,700
(1 Hour Before Smiley's Surgery)

114
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,000
Here.

115
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:10,622
Have you seen this man?

116
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:15,200
Excuse me.

117
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:16,266
Have you seen him?

118
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,240
I don't think so. Have you?

119
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,280
Nope.

120
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,280
Okay, got it.

122
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,560

Chang Rui.

124
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,040
We found the girl.

125
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,000
At the bus terminal.

126
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,720
Okay.

127
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,560
But she's not doing well.

128
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:50,040
You must get her to Linshan Hospital

129
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,280
within 30 minutes.

130
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:52,177
Understood.

(Linshan Hotel)

133
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,580
Hello? What's the situation now?

134
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,980
That's great! Alright, I'll head back now.

135
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,900
So, any updates?

136
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,620
The girl's been found.

137
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,820
Really?

138
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,220
That's great!

139
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,300
They've found her!

140
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,660
Then I'll head back first.

141
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,820
There's still a ton to do at the bureau.

142
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,100
Officer Yan. Grab a bite before you go.

143
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,340
I'll pass.

144
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,260
We haven't caught the suspect yet,
so I've got no appetite.

145
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,380
Thanks for all your hard work, everyone.

146
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,620
Get some rest.

147
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
Thank you, too.

148
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,460
Grab something to eat and get home soon.

149
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,620
Thanks for your help.

150
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,020
You need not walk me out.

151
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:53,740
Man.

152
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,780
I'm really sorry.

153
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,130
Something's come up with the girl.

154
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,340
- Please wait a little longer.
-  Jenny, be honest with me.

155
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,460
The child has been in the news.

156
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,220
That's not your doing, is that?

157
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,220
Of course not, Man.

158
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,020
I... I'd never do that to you.

159
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,830
Let's just forget it.

160
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,380
My husband and I talked again.

161
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,860
We're already overwhelmed
with three kids.

162
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,180
Having another would be too much.

163
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,580
Sorry for the trouble.

164
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,990
I'll treat you to a meal after this.

(and she's on her way to the hospital.)

all the kindhearted citizens.)

(We'll continue
to follow this story closely.)

171
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,100
The doctor is here.

172
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,220
The OR is ready too.

Go!

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,270
(the Anti-abduction Office
raced against time)

181
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,460
(and finally found the child.)

182
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,900
(We contacted the lead surgeon)

183
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,790
(and anesthesiologist
from Jiushan Hospital.)

184
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,740
(They made their way
to Linshan People's Hospital)

185
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,100
(and performed the surgery there.)

187
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,960

(Alright, dear viewers,)

189
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
(that's the latest update from me.)

190
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,280
Sit.

191
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,600
Let's eat.

192
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,160
I'll wash my hands.

193
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,520
Sit.

194
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,240
Washing hands is a good habit.

195
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,000
Xiaoguang.

196
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,600
How many times have I told you?

197
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,280
Stop picking up random junk.

198
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,320
It's dirty

199
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,800
and full of bacteria.

200
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,770
So it's bad for your health.

201
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,310
Why can't you break this habit?

202
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,880
Besides,

203
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,480
how much

204
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
are these worth?

205
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,720
You should focus on your studies.

206
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,360
And you need

207
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,960
to build good hygiene habits.

208
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,810
Especially

209
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,990
you must brush your teeth

210
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,280
every day.

211
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,800
You must shower.

212
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,080
You must eat breakfast.

213
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,360
Because I

214
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,480
don't have time

215
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,760
to make breakfast for you.

216
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,610
You need to take good care of yourself.

217
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,900
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

218
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,410
Look, Director.

219
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,040
(Qingyang Street)
Wai got on the bus at Qingyang Street,

220
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,040
carrying a woven bag.

221
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,960
Then he got off at Shengxi Street,

222
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,750
(Shengxi Street)
but the woven bag was gone.

223
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,120
He then walked along the road for a bit,

224
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,760
entered a greenbelt,

225
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,560
and vanished.

226
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,680
What about nearby surveillance?

227
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,560
Lei went to check it.

228
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,480
We've reviewed all surveillance
around the greenbelt.

229
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,560
No trace of Wai.

230
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,640
All exits from Linshan are sealed.

231
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,950
He's definitely still inside.

232
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,190
Carry on with the investigation.

233

234
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,940
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

235
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,080
Mister.

236
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,000
One bowl of veggie noodles.

237
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,000
Want it spicy?

238
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,720
Yes.

239
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,140
(Missing Person)

240
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,880
Mister.

241
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,000
You're looking for a child too?

242
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,880
Yes.

243
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,080
Have a seat, please.

244
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,880
Sure.

245
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:25,960
Here.

246
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,000
Thanks.

247
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,680
Mister.

248
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,320
As you can see,

249
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Tuanyuan Restaurant

250
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,400
is for

251
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,080
helping people

252
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,760
find their children.

253
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,280
Could you tell me a bit
about your situation?

254
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,880
My son

255
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,120
went missing

256
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,040
20 years ago.

257
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,640
Back then,

258
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,800
we were young,

259
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,810
and we just wanted to make money.

260
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,560
So we left him with the elders.

261
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
But they got careless

262
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,080
and he got abducted.

263
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,760
To this day,

264
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,460
there's still no word.

265
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Well, do you...

266
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,400
Do you have a photo of your child?

267
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,360
Give it to me.

268
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,400
I'll make
a missing person poster for you.

269
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,640
We've got lots of volunteers.

270
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,800
They can help spread the word.

271
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,360
The more people looking,

272
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,120
the more hope you've got of finding him.

273
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
I don't have it on me.

274
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,120
It's at the guesthouse.

275
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,400
I'll bring it when I'm here again.

276
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,120
Ma'am.

277
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,640
Well,

278
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,720
did you open

279
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,440
this Tuanyuan Restaurant

280
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
because your child

281
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,680
went missing?

282
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,880
Your daughter?

283
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Her name is Ranran.

284
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,000
She was only eight
when she went missing.

285
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,840
It's been over twenty years.

286
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,100
(Missing Person, Name: Lin Ran)

287
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,640
Yanyan!

288
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,120
Yanyan!

289
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,150
I'm right here, Yanyan!

290
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,120
Come find me, Yanyan!

291
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,400
Have you seen her before?

292
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,120
No.

293
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,840
I just find it

294
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,080
a shame

295
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,320
to have such a sweet girl go missing.

296
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
There's no news to this day?

297
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,840
However,

298
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,760
my daughter's childhood friend

299
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,520
is now the director
of the Anti-abduction Office.

300
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,960
She's brilliant,

301
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,000
and she's helped many children

302
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,600
find their families.

303
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,280
She's helping me with my case too.

304
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,960
That's great.

305
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,920
With a friend

306
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,200
inside the government,

307
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,600
you'll get news in no time.

308
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:08,840
Ma'am.

309
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
Could I

310
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,770
have a copy

311
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,560
of this photo?

312
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,920
I'm searching for my child

313
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,960
everywhere.

314
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
Who knows?

315
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,440
I might bump into your girl.

316
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,080
Sure.

317
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,320
Keep it.

318
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,280
Well, thank you.

319
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,080
Don't mention it.

320
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,480
We've been talking so much.

321
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,190
Quick, eat while it's still warm.

322
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,440
Okay.

323
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,720
Oh, right.

324
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,080
The noodles

325
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,120
are on the house.

326
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,880
I couldn't possibly accept that.

327
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,320
Well,

328
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,320
we're all one family here.

329
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,040
It's free.

330
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,540
Sure.

331
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,320
Thank you.

332
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,680
Oh, right!

333
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,280
Make sure to bring along

334
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,040
your son's photo after this.

335
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,260
Will do.

336
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,280
Don't forget it!

337
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:00,960
Thanks.

338
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,000
Eat it while it's still warm!

339
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,040

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,000
(The suspect, Zhou Hongcai,
is still at large.)

348
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,760
Hello, it's me.

349
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,360
Don't hang up.

350
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,600
I need to tell you something important.

351
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,200
I just found out about this.

352
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,200
Well,

353
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,120
Lin Ran...

354
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,360
Yes, Ranran.

355
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,640
That girl's

359
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,800
As you know,

360
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,550
I'm at the end of my rope here.

361
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
If you refuse to help me,

362
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,640
then I...

363
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,120
I'll just

364
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,720
turn myself in.

365
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,480
If I do so, you should know
how things will turn out.

366
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,520
Give me two days.

367
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,600
I'll find you a hideout.

368
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,040
That's more like it.

369
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,200
We go way back, after all.

370
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,600
Fine.

371
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,880
I'll wait for your call.

372
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,880
Gang. You need something?

373
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,600
No, just leave!

Gang.

376
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,800
Did you see the news?

377
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,040
I was just about to call you.

378
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,520
Was that you?

379
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,260
Yes, it was me.

380
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
But it's only because

381
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,550
you were rushing me
for that Qinmang order.

382
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,440
One of the customers at my yoga studio

383
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,840
had a way.

384
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,520
But she didn't want money.

385
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,640
She just wanted a girl.

386
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,520
So I...

387
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,600
So?

388
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,120
Of all people,

389
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,350
you picked him?

390
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,120
Did that old man see your face?

391
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,960
Don't worry, Gang.

392
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,040
Absolutely not.

393
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,920
We only contacted by phone.

394
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,080
I'm always careful dealing
with traffickers from out of town.

395
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,260
There's no way
he can trace it back to me.

396
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,520
Fine.

397
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,400
Let's leave it at that.

398
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,840
Don't contact him again.

399
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,120
And make sure
he never learns about our connection.

400
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,520
Sure.

401
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,440
Understood.

402
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,160
Be more careful from now on.

403
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
No more acting on your own.

404
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,280
Got it...

405
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,260
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

406
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,040
Everyone's here.

407
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,040
Captain Han.

408
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,560
You all

409
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,280
kept saying you're short on staff.

410
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,320
This is Feng Junjie,
top of his class from Police Academy.

411
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:32,950
Director Deng.

412
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,300
Feng Junjie, reporting in.

413
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,560
Deng Yan, Chang Rui.

414
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,160
I practically camped out at HR

415
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,080
for several days

416
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,520
to poach this talent for you two.

417
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,720
Don't come begging me for staff again.

418
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,240
Got it?

419
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,200
Ai Xin.

420
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,290
Show him the ropes
around the Anti-abduction Office.

421
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:47,720
Sure.

422
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,520
Get back to work.

423
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,330
Thanks, Captain Han.

424
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,920
Junjie, this is Officer Chang Rui.

425
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,170
Nice to meet you, Officer Chang.

426
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,440
They're Ai Xin and Yang Jiajia.

427
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,640
Nice to meet you,

428
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,100
Officer Ai Xin and Officer Yang Jiajia.

429
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,320
Vice Director Yin and Yan Lei

430
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,160
are out at the moment.

431
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,640
I'll introduce you when they return.

432
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:03,680
Yes, Director.

433
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,120
This is your desk.

434
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,080
Do your best.

435
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,560
Sure.

436
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,960
Hello, yes?

437
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,200
Okay.

438
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,700
Director.

439
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,460
A possible sighting of Wai
on the southern section of Shanbei Road.

440
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,640
Chang Rui, go check it out.

441
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,600
Ai Xin, show him around.

442
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,120
Sure.

443
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,320
Feng.

444
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,080
Ai Xin.

445
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,880
Welcome to the Anti-abduction Office.

446
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,520
I'll show you around.

447
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:26,920
Sure.

448
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,610
Let's go.

449
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,100
(Tianhai Lucky)

450
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,180
(Tianhai Lucky)

451
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,150
Miss.

452
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:49,880
Hello, sir.

453
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,400
I'd like to see your manager.

454
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,360
Our manager?

455
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,660
Which manager are you looking for?

456
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,280
The owner.

457
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,960
The owner? Do you mean Mr. Liu?

458
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,120
Yes...

459
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,440
We have a policy here.

460
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,560
If you want to see Mr. Liu,
you need an appointment.

461
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,600
What?

462
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,370
You need
to make an appointment in advance.

463
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,840
I don't know how to do that.

464
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,990
- Well...
- Hello, Mr. Liu.

465
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,210
You may give me your number.

466
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,080
Mr. Liu.

467
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:19,840
Mr. Liu.

468
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,160
It's been a while.

469
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,680
Let's have a chat.

470
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,560
Didn't I tell you to give me two days?

471
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,840
The longer I stay out here,

472
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,100
the more danger you're in.

473
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,680
Old man,

474
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,600
are you threatening me?

475
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,100
I've got nowhere else to go.

476
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,440
Moreover,

477
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,560
you and I

478
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,200
are on the same boat, right?

479
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,120
Also,

480
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,080
this place of yours

481
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,280
is comfortable.

482
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,040
There are cigarettes

483
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,440
and booze.

484
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,810
Believe it or not, I'll kill you now

485
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,660
and have your body
buried in the backyard.

486
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,200
Gang.

487
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,570
If you had meant to do so,

488
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,720
you'd have done it already, no?

489
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,990
Give me more of this.

490
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,080
Wai was last seen at
the southern section of Shanbei Road.

491
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,440
He hasn't been spotted since.

492
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,120
He's probably hiding

493
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,100
in some building nearby.

494
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,720
He definitely wouldn't risk a hotel.

495
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,000
Do you think
he's got some friend in Linshan

496
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,860
who's taken him in?

497
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,920
Tianhai Lucky.

498
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,920
That last surveillance image of him

499
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,560
was taken near Tianhai Lucky.

500
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,200
It's Tianhai Lucky again.

501
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,120
Jiajia, Yan Lei.

502
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,480
Go check the surveillance footage.

503
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,640
(There has been
a serious child trafficking case)

504
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,000
(in our city lately.)

505
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,320
(The abducted child
has been successfully rescued.)

506
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,360
(The suspect, Zhou Hongcai,
is still at large.)

507
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,480
(Wanted)
(Zhou Hongcai, also known as Wai.)

508
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,120
(Roughly 1.7 meters tall.)

509
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,840
(Medium build, around 60 years old.)

510
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,480
(Wearing a gray jacket.)

511
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,080
(Zhou Hongcai is wanted)
(We urge the public)

512
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,590
(for suspected trafficking)
(We urge the public)

513
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,720
(to provide us with leads.)

514
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,720
(If you spot a possible suspect,)
Ma'am, check, please.

515
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,040
(contact your local police)
Sure.

516
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,720
(or dial the emergency number.)

517
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,080
Sir.

518
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,890
Ma'am, check, please.

519
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,000
Coming.

520
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:30,960
Thanks.

521
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:52,860
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

522
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,520
Madam Zhang.

523
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,480
Excuse me.

524
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,200
Have you seen

525
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,600
a woman about my height...

526
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,160
No.

527
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,280
Thank you.

528
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,210
Excuse me, sir.

529
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,920
Have you seen a woman about my height

530
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,960
wearing a blue apron and arm covers?

531
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,200
I think she went that way.

532
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,320
Madam Zhang!

533
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,360
Watch out!

534
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,520
Madam Zhang!

535
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,600
Madam Zhang!

536
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,920
Are you alright?

537
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:17,920
Slowly.

538
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,590
Were you trying
to kill yourself, old lady?

539
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,680
Didn't you see the light?

540
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,480
Sorry.

541
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,320
Sorry...

542
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,080
- Sorry.
- You're getting old.

543
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,040
Be careful.

544
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,360
Are you okay?

545
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,640
I'm fine.

546
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,720
Are you hurt anywhere?

547
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,320
Not at all.

548
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,120
How did I end up here?

549
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,920
Madam Zhang.

550
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,640
I think I have something to do.

551
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,680
I need to see to that.

552
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,120
It's alright, Madam Zhang.

553
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,800
Let's head back to the restaurant.

554
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,170
Back to the restaurant?

555
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,520
What was I supposed to do?

556
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:48,960
Red light.

557
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:50,960
When crossing the road,

558
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,520
you have to watch the traffic lights.

559
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
It's dangerous.

560
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,560
Green light. Let's go.

561
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,850
Take it slow.

562
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,200
(Zhou Hongcai.)

563
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,680
(Nothing good ever happens
when that rogue shows up.)

564
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,960
(How on earth did he get my number?)

565
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,280
(Could it be)

566
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,880
(Cripple told him about it?)

567
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,760
(What was Cripple even thinking?)

568
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,840
(No way.)

569
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,120
(I need to get rid of him.)

570
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,200
Hello?

571
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,120
Gang.

572
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,520
The police came.

573
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,880
I did exactly what you said

574
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,430
by giving them the pre-recorded footage.

575
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,000
It's settled for now.

576
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,120
But Gang,

577
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,160
since Fei left,

578
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,810
the police have
come by a few more times.

579
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:48,440
I'm afraid...

580
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:48,760
Alright.

581
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
I'll think of something.

582
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,200
(I have to give the police
something else to chase.)

583
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,280
I got it, Mom. Rest assured.

584
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,260
It's not like I work overtime every day.

585
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,350
I've had my dinner.

586
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,920
I'll bear that in mind.

589
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,320
How's it going?

590
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,320
Any news?

591
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,860
We've gone through
Tianhai Lucky's surveillance

592
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,790
from the past few days.

593
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:29,680
No sign of Wai.

594
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
How strange.

595
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520
The hospital called.

596
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,840
They said Smiley's surgery
was a huge success.

597
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,600
She can move to a regular room tomorrow.

598
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,000
That's great news.

599
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,800
Finally, something good.

600
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,500
I've been wondering this.

601
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,760
Since Zhou Hongcai

602
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,680
knows no one else,

603
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,600
how could he

604
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,160
slip right past us like that?

605
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,060
And no matter what we do,
we can't find him.

606
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,800
My guess is,

607
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,200
he's got an accomplice.

608
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,560
How about this?

609
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,040
I'll have Mr. Yin

610
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,640
get in touch with all the precincts

611
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,240
and ask them to coordinate with us.

612
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,240
Alright.

613
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,240
Director Deng.

614
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,390
What is it?

615
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,660
The Discipline Inspection Commission
wants to see you.

616
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,200
Alright, got it.

617
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,920
Let me know when there's any news.

618
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,000
Sure.

00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,900

622
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,240
A bottle of '82 red wine.

623
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,320
I've had enough of red wine.

624
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,150
Get me something else.

625
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,320
Take the money and lay low for a while.

626
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,840
The police are already watching me.

627
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Try this one.

628
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,880
If you can't handle it,

629
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,400
then I've got nothing else.

630
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,040
I'm not going anywhere.

631
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,170
What's the matter?

632
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,800
Why the long face?

633
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,840
Say something.

What for?

638
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,760
No idea. Some guy came and took her.

639
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,480
I think

640
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,960
the director must be

641
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,370

648
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,400

It says Deng Yan

650
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,640
took bribes
