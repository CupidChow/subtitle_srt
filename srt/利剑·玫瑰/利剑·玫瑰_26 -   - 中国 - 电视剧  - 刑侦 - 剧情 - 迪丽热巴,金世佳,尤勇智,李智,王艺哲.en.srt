00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,140
=Episode 26=

3
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:39,070
Then, the secretary reported this

4
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,359
back to Ye Xiuming.

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,640
So, from Ye Xiuming
and his secretary's perspective,

6
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,229
the adoption process
they handled for Fu Haochen

7
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,244
was legal and proper.

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,120
But in Fu Haochen's perspective,

9
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,280
things went far too smoothly.

10
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,359
He believed

11
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,400
Ye Xiuming used personal connections

12
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,359
to solve the problem.

13
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,040
So out of gratitude,

14
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,319
he offered a business deal

15
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,439
to keep the child.

16
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,959
But...

17
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,519
Ye Xiuming and his secretary

18
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,960
repeatedly claimed

19
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,520
they completed the adoption

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,400
legally.

21
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:15,080
The welfare home
didn't receive any applications.

22
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,080
Why is that?

23
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:17,844
They didn't receive an application?

24
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,319
This gave me an idea.

25
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,280
I already sent the secretary's computer

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,199
to the tech department.

27
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,599
I have a theory.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,639
Either their computer

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,520
was tampered with,

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,639
or the website they accessed

31
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,800
was fake.

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,319
So Ye Xiuming and his secretary
misunderstood

33
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,199
that their adoption procedure

34
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,080
was legal.

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
If that's the case,

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,240
Ye Xiuming
doesn't have much to do with this.

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,599
Keep investigating.

41
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,079
Hello.

42
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:34,720
I'm looking for someone.

43
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,560
Looking for someone?

44
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,279
Have you seen her?

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,879
Can you

46
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,439
take another look?

47
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,319
Madam Zhang.

48
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,959
Madam Zhang.

49
00:04:50,977 --> 00:04:52,088
He's here for someone.

50
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,439
Have you seen this girl?

51
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,319
Madam.

52
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,000

Have you seen her?

No.

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,199
Can I

56
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,639
put this up here?

57
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,800
Of course.

58
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,000
- Put it on the wall. Help him.
- Okay.

59
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,639
Here.

60
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:15,560

00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,879
I

67
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,160

Can you

76
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,839
tell me

77
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,000
what happened exactly?

78
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,519
I'll record it.

79
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,399
This...

80
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,199
This is...

81
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,040
This is my

82
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,480

She loves dancing.

87
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,040
She loves dancing.

88
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,439
She's beautiful.

89
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,879
She really enjoys

90
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,519
traveling.

91
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,000
The two of us

92
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:35,120
had a travel wedding.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,639
But

94
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,040
when we got here...

95
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,199
(I wanted)

96
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,399
(to take a picture of her.)

97
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,720
(While I was changing the lens,)

98
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,879
(she was taken away.)

99
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,439
(I couldn't catch up.)

100
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,720
Did you call the police?

101
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,240
Call the police?

102
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,480
I did.

103
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:02,959
The...

104
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,600
The license plate was fake.

105
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,040
I...

106
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,160
I've been to many places.

107
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,800
I believe I...

108
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,560
I will find her.

109
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,439
I read online

110
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,560
that your restaurant

111
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,480
has helped many people
reunite with their families.

112
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,680
Is that so?

113
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,079

114
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,279

115
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:34,244
you can help me.

00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:35,959

122
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,399

124
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,360
Tell the volunteers about his case.

125
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,839
Okay.

126

139

she can't conceive.

140
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:51,030
She can't even give birth.

141
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,288
What's the point of keeping her?

142
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,759
Just throw her out already.

143
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,759
What?

144
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,111
Throw her out?

I was just about to tell you.

Right after Fu Haochen
got the child we sent,

175

you were coming.

must have happened today.

bring this wine from France.

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,159
This is premium stuff.

198
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:06,333
You're too generous.

199
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,320
No.

200
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,200
Do you have something later on?

201
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,240
Let's have a drink together.

202
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:10,630
Sure.

203
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,200
Thank you.

204
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,960
Let me pour.

205
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,088
I'll pour it for you.

206
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,159
Let me do it.

207
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,679
I heard Dingshun is doing well lately.

208
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,320
You two

209
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,279
must send more clients to Tianhai Lucky.

210
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,399
Mr. Liu.

211
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,480
We already spend a lot here every year.

212
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:35,044
Isn't that enough support?

213
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,799
Yes.

214
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,240
Thanks so much

215
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,888
for supporting me.

216
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,799
I heard Dingshun just signed a big deal.

217
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,600
Why not bring your clients here
to have fun?

218
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,320
Mr. Liu, you're well-informed.

219
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,679
What? Thinking of switching
from KTV to trading?

220
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,159
I'm not fit for that.

221
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,679
It's just

222
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,519
that business hasn't been good lately.

223
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
I'm seeing
if there are other ways to make money.

224
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:11,679
Mr. Liu.

225
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,519
How is business not good?

226
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,720
It looks like it's booming.

227
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,440
Mr. Wu, you don't know.

228
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,039
Recently,

229
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
Linshan hasn't been peaceful.

230
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:24,360
The police keep coming to investigate.

231
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,960
I heard it's about some missing child.

232
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,000
Not sure if I should say this,

233
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
but I heard about a rumor.

234
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,080
They say this missing child case

235
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,644
might be connected to Dingshun.

236
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,080
Mr. Liu.

237
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,200
What do you mean by that?

238
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,720
Mr. Liu.

239
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,960
You can't spread such rumors.

240
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,044
You'll be held
legally responsible for it.

241
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,480
Look at my big mouth.

242
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,399
I'll punish myself
by taking three shots.

243
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,240
Fill it up.

244
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:04,320
Here, I'll drink with you.

245
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,799
- Here.
- Thanks.

246
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,688
Sorry.

247
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,679
(All these years,)

248
00:13:30,088 --> 00:13:31,622
(who would've thought)

249
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
(that the infamous Cripple
in the underworld)

250
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,120
(is actually a big shot)

251
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,399
(in Linshan's business world.)

252
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,919
(You pushed me to become Cripple)

253
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,120
(so that you could pin)

254
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,840
(your crimes on me)

255
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,399
(and use me as a scapegoat.)

256
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,279
(It seems)

257
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,679
(I should find myself a way out too.)

258
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:01,399
(Director Deng.)

259
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:04,239
(The police in the neighboring city
just caught a trafficker.)

260
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,270
According to his statement,

261
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,480
the child he handled
might be Luo Xiaoyu.

262
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,120
Here, Jiajia.

263
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,960
Pull up relevant information first.

264
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,559
We'll discuss at the office.

265
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,879
(The trafficker also confessed)

266
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,759
(that his superior)

267
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,200
once asked him to find a child

268
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,088
for a businessman surnamed Mu
from Gangcheng.

269
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,720
He was paid handsomely afterward,

270
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
but they never contacted him again.

271
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:25,200
I've just screened
Gangcheng's businessmen.

272
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,440
Only Mu Zhenliang
meets all the criteria.

273
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,840
He has a son named Mu Haobo.

274
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,480
Mu Haobo was born in 1992.

275
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,519
He's 17 this year,

276
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,519
the same age as Luo Xiaoyu.

277
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,720
Also, this Gangcheng businessman,
Mu Zhenliang,

278
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,840
visited Linshan City in 1995.

279
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,879
1995?

280
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
That's the year Luo Xiaoyu went missing.

281
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,159
Time and place both match.

282
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,911
What do you think, Director?

283
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,320
Here, Ai Xin.

284
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,639
Contact Luo Xiaoxing.

285
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,799
Inform her of this lead first.

286
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,355
Chang Rui.

287
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,480
Try contacting Mu Zhenliang

288
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,279
and see if he's willing to cooperate.

289
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:21,960
Caiyun.

290
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:22,977
Madam Jin.

291
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:23,750
Drying vegetables?

292
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,769
Yeah. The mustard greens
grew like crazy this year.

293
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,510
We can't finish them,
so I made some salted vegetables.

294
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,480
I'll bring you some later.

295
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,879
Okay, thank you.

296
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:31,120
Let me tell you.

297
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,559
I went to pull radishes in the field.

298
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:34,150
This year's radishes grew really well.

299
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,240
- I'm telling you.
- Really?

300
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,200
They're super juicy.

301
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,799
Take two.

302
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,559
No.

303
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,000
No.

304
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,320
You're too kind.

305
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,955
Way too kind.

306
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,039
Thank you.

307
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:42,750
Don't mention it.

308
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,960
Come in and have some water.

309
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
No, let me tell you.

310
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,155
School will be over soon.

311
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:48,080
I've got to cook for them.

312
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:49,200
- Right.
- I'm off.

313
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,480
Next time.

314
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,279
Bye.

315
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,080
Alright.

316
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:03,919
Mom!

317
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,480
Mom!

318
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:07,480
Slow down.

319
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,279
Don't fall.

320
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,360
Mom.

321
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,759
Hmm?

322
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,679
Let me tell you.

323
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,679
There's a crazy lady in our village.

324
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,960
Her hair's super long.

325
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,960
She has huge teeth.

326
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,120
I heard she bites people.

327
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,120
Nonsense.

328
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,399
It's true.

329
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,000
She lives in that grumpy man's house
up the mountain.

330
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,240
The one that's always locked.

331
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,039
Is it the Tu family?

332
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,480
Yeah, Qiang told me about them.

333
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,390
I didn't believe it.

334
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,360
Then he took me to see it.

335
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,559
So what did you see?

336
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,759
Nothing.

337
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,799
I didn't see her,

338
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,919
but Qiang took me to their back wall.

339
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,399
I heard it.

340
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,679
It sounded like a person.

341
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,644
They're whimpering.

342
00:16:54,755 --> 00:16:55,840
Sounds like they're sobbing.

343
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,720
A person?

344
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,200
Crying?

345
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:00,840
Yeah.

346
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,381
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

347
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,160
Director Deng.

348
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,519
I plan to go to Gangcheng
to find Xiaoyu tomorrow.

349
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,119
Don't rush.

350
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,920
Hear me out first.

351
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:12,880
We've already contacted Mu Zhenliang,

352
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,119
but he denied adopting any child.

353
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:16,830
That makes this difficult.

354
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,920
All we have
is the trafficker's statement.

355
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,400
We have no solid evidence.

356
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,133
What can we do then?

357
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:23,622
Xiaoxing.

358
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,440
Don't worry.

359
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,200
We'll keep contacting him.

360
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,440
At the very least,

361
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,559
we now have a lead.

362
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:30,440
As long as there's a lead,

363
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,039
there's hope.

364
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,844
Don't worry.

365
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,980

Mom.

367
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,599
My exercise book is almost used up.

368
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,519
Next time you go to the market,
buy me some.

369
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,160
Mom, I'm talking to you.

370

Xiaoyun.

371
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,319
Did Qiang say anything else

372
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,511
about that crazy lady?

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,359
Not much.

374
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,759
He just said

375
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,440
that the crazy lady is Mr. Tu's wife.

376
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,839
She's locked up,
not allowed to see anyone.

377
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,960
Qiang also said
something's wrong with Mr. Tu

378
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,160
marrying a crazy lady.

The case is mostly clear now.

(Ye Xiuming learned that Fu Haochen)

382
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,160
(wanted to adopt a daughter.)

383
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,240
(Dingshun Group: Ye Xiuming)
(To sign a deal with the Fu family,)

384
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,577
(he catered to their wishes)

385
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
(and asked his secretary,
Zhang Quanzhi, to help.)

386
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,839
(Using Dingshun's charity,
Zhang Quanzhi)

387
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,559
(put out word)

388
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,789
(to seek a suitable orphan.)

389
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,000
(Mysterious Man, Disguised Abductor)

390
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,640
(A man with the username Ding Fengbo)

391
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,511
(contacted him,)

392
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,640
(saying Lingzhou Welfare Home)

393
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,440
(had just taken in an abandoned girl)

394
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,200
(who matched his criteria perfectly.)

395
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,440
(So Zhang Quanzhi used the website)

396
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,511
(Tang Zhikui, Registry Info)
(Ding Fengbo provided to apply.)

397
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,880
(He thought
everything was legal and proper,)

398
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,319
(but the website)

399
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,799
(was made by Ding Fengbo.)

400
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,559
(Then, Ding Fengbo
arranged for Ding Shuncheng)

401
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,880
(to abduct Kui...)

402
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,720
Miss, this car...

403
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,355
(And sent her to Shencheng.)
Wait!

404
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,400
Wenwen.

405
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,359
(Once it was all done,)

406
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,720
(Ding Fengbo deleted his account)

407
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:04,070
(and vanished completely.)

408
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
So, from what we see,

409
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,133
Ye Xiuming
is basically cleared of suspicion.

410
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,160
That's the strange part.

411
00:21:14,777 --> 00:21:15,920
No matter how you look at it,

412
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:17,733
Ye Xiuming is the one who benefited.

413
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,759
After signing with the Fu family,

414
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:25,244
Dingshun's stock price
rose significantly.

415
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:26,590
(Dingshun Group,
Ye Xiuming Provided Info to Ding Fengbo)

416
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,319
It seems

417
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,244
Dingshun was the one who benefited,

418
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,160
but anyone benefiting from Dingshun

419
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,200
had a motive.

420
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:39,279
It's not just Ye Xiuming necessarily.

421
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,749
The timing of this person

422
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,466
shows they know Dingshun's
current revenue situation very well.

423
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,000
Be honest with me.

424
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,920
Is our deal with Lu Sheng

425
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,519
completely dead?

426
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:06,350
(Does Lu Sheng's incident)

427
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,200
(have a big impact on Dingshun?)

428
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,519
(Yes.)

429
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Our company's entire cash flow
is extremely tight right now.

430
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,509
The hole is so big.

431
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,822
I don't even know how to fill it.

432
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,839
If I have no choice,

433
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,690
I'll go out
and find business for myself.

434
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:19,519
It's not like

435
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,039
I've never done this before.

436
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,220
(Dingshun Group,
Ye Xiuming Provided Info to Ding Fengbo)

437
00:22:32,688 --> 00:22:33,444
Hello?

438
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:35,559
Okay.

439
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay, got it.

440
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,000
There's been progress
from the task force.

441
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,177
They want us to head over.

442
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,960
Officer Yan.

443
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,200
We didn't find any trace

444
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
left behind by the suspect.

445
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:48,030
This is the salvage scene
at Xinfeng Reservoir.

446
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:48,880
We confirmed

447
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,599
this scrapped taxi

448
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,160
is the same one reported missing

449
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,720
by the scrapping plant earlier.

450
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,839
The killer used this car

451
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,559
to flee the crime scene.

452
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,680
Was the killer's DNA recovered?

453
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,720
Before pushing the car
into the reservoir,

454
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,155
the killer wiped all traces clean.

455
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:06,550
Footprints around the reservoir

456
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,799
also show signs of tampering,

457
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,839
so it couldn't be fully retrieved.

458
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:14,480
They

459
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,400
clearly came well prepared

460
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,359
and seem to have a certain level of

461
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:19,822
counter-surveillance ability.

462
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,880
This killer

463
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,640
isn't simple.

464
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,119
Zhou Hongcai

465
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,920
was a human trafficker from out of town.

466
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,720
He was killed in Linshan.

467
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:32,400
The person who did it was very skilled.

468
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,839
They even dared
to attack police officers.

469
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:36,720
Why is that?

470
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:37,720
Deng Yan.

471
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,311
Share with us your thoughts.

472
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,279
We suspect Zhou Hongcai knew Cripple,

473
00:24:42,288 --> 00:24:43,577
so Cripple killed Zhou Hongcai

474
00:24:43,644 --> 00:24:44,977
to protect himself.

475
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,279
Because in all of Linshan,

476
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,319
only Cripple's gang

477
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,200
would pull off something like this.

478
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,160
Of course.

479
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,039
That's just our preliminary theory.

480
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,440
We don't have solid evidence yet.

481
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,822
Any new findings from the autopsy?

482
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:04,440
Two items were found
in the deceased, Zhou Hongcai's stomach.

483
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,000
Both were wrapped
in waterproof plastic bags.

484
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:09,200
But due to prolonged time
in the stomach,

485
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,160
gastric acid leaked into the bags

486
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,319
and damaged the contents.

487
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,088
We can't determine what they are yet.

488
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:17,590
Have the tech department
process it urgently

489
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,759
and see what's inside.

490
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:19,920
Yes.

491
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,860
(Items extracted
from Zhou Hongcai's stomach)

492
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,720
Who is it?

493
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,200
It's me, Yang Caiyun.

494
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,079
I just moved here.

495
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:54,440
Sir.

496
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:56,960
What is it?

497
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,839
I just got back to the village.

498
00:25:58,911 --> 00:25:59,830
There are many people

499
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,000
I couldn't recognize.

500
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,839
I think this is Madam Gu's house.

501
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,039
Madam! It's me, Caiyun!

502
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,480
I'm back, Madam!

503
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,920
My mom is sick.

504
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,911
She's a bit irritable.

505
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,640
How about this?

506
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:17,500
She's not well now, come another day.

507
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,640
Sir.

508
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,839
Look, I brought vegetables for her.

509
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:21,920
I grew them myself.

510
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,119
Let me just see her.

511
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,200
Just give them to me.

512
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,759
Thank you.

513
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,319
Sir.

514
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,440
Thank you.

515
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,039
What happened to your hand?

516
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,079
That cat inside

517
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:35,759
scratched me.

518
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:37,960
Give them to me.

519
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,839
Sir.

520
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,880
I haven't been back for years.

521
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,200
Just let me see her.

522
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,880
Let me come in.

523
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,844
- What are you doing?
- I want to see her.

524
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,789
I'll thank you on her behalf.

525
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,640
I'll ask her to find you
when she's better, okay?

526
00:26:56,644 --> 00:26:57,200
Go home.

527
00:26:57,222 --> 00:26:57,590
Sir.

528
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,119
Go home.

529
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:58,640
My vegetables...

530
00:26:58,644 --> 00:26:59,030
Sir.

531
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,666
Sir, open the door. Sir.

532
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,480
What are you filming?

533
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,720
I'm leaving.

534
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,920
I'm going to keep searching

535
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,599
for my lover.

536
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,640
I'll film all of this.

537
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,480
As I search

538
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,920
for Xiaochu,

539
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,759
I'll also look

540
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,519
for other people.

541
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,799
Have you

542
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,559
filmed this one?

543
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,440
Yes.

544
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,599
I filmed everything.

545
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,759
This is my daughter.

546
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,720
Your

547
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,440
daughter?

548
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,640
I've been looking for her
for over 20 years.

549
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,799
Madam.

550
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,319
Let's record it.

551
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,759
Record?

552
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,680
I'll post

553
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:45,720
what you want to say to your daughter

554
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,799
online

555
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,640
so that more people

556
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:52,559
can see.

557
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:53,920
Okay.

558
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:54,839
Let's record it.

559
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:55,640
Okay.

560
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,960
Alright, I'll stand...

561
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,680
Like this?

562
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,279
Are you ready, Madam?

563
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,440
Yes.

564
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,720
Yes.

565
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,733
Ranran.

566
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
I'm your mother.

567
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm

568
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,422
waiting for you at Tuanyuan Restaurant.

569
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,039
It's

570
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,440
the same noodle restaurant

571
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:40,519
you and Yanyan loved as kids.

572
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,359
I'm here

573
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,977
waiting for you.

574
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,519
You hear me?

575
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:51,640
Ranran.

576
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,519
(Missing Person, Ranran)

577
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:11,200
Ranran.

578
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:14,519
I will always be here waiting for you.

579
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,720
You hear me?

580
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:21,400
Ranran.

581
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,799
Madam.

582
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,119
You'll reunite

583
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,920
with her.

584
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:56,780
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

585
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,599
Who are you?

586
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,800
Madam, it's me.

587
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,000
Do you remember me?

588
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,079
Yang's daughter.

589
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,480
Yang Caiyun.

590
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,599
I'm back.

591
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,280
What do you want?

592
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,480
I came by yesterday to see you.

593
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,719
Your son said you were ill.

594
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:51,280
I came to check if you're better.

595
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,239
I made these pancakes for you.

596
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,199
Well then, have a seat.

597
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:10,639
The cat...

598
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,199
The cat's in heat.

599
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,440
It's making a commotion.

600
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,000
How annoying.

601
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,239
If you go on,
watch me beat you to death!

602
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:31,639
Madam.

603
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,679
Why does your cat

604
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,440
sound like a woman?

605
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,079
Yang.

606
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,519
You're not a stranger.

607
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,480
To tell you the truth,

608
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,119
it's my daughter-in-law.

609
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,719
She was pregnant last year,

610
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,079
but she lost the baby
and got traumatized.

611
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:54,679
This went wrong.

612
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,159
It's not something to brag about.

613
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:58,840
Right?

614
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,760
We didn't want the neighbors to know.

615
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,079
Madam.

616
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,800
Let me see her.

617
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,280
I'll talk with her a bit.

618
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,679
Maybe it'll help her let go.

619
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,760
No!

620
00:36:14,622 --> 00:36:15,466
Let me tell you.

621
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,880
Something's mentally wrong with her.

622
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,840
She's always biting and hitting people.

623
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,039
Even I'm scared to go in.

624
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,280
Madam, you didn't let her see a doctor?

625
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,360
Where would I get that kind of money?

626
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,320
It's getting dark now.

627
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:31,590
School will be over soon.

628
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,760
Look.

629
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,199
The pancakes...

630
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:33,840
We talked so long

631
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,079
that I forgot the time.

632
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,480
I have stuff to do too.

633
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:38,239
I'll head back now.

634
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,159
I'll visit again soon.

635
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,229
Okay, come again.

636
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,155
Take care of yourself.

637
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,800
Thanks for the pancakes.

638
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,119
Miss.

639
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:36,679
Where are you from?

640
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,639
Miss, where are you from?

641
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,159
Were you brought here?

642
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,880
Miss, what's your name?

643
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,844
Where are you from?

644
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,866
You're quite obedient today.

645
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:28,977
That's more like it.

646
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Eat when you're hungry,
and drink when thirsty.

647
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,360
Be good.

648
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,519
If you need something, knock.

649
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:42,320
Got it?

650
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
If anything happens,

651
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,039
knock and call me.

652
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,400
Got it?

653
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,639
She's absolutely starving. Don't worry.

(Linshan City Police Bureau)

655
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:36,311
Ai Xin, someone's here for you.

656
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,960
Caiyun? What brings you here?

657
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,039
You're looking much better now.

658
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:45,079
Is there something we can help you with?

659
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,800
It's not about me.

660
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,711
It's about our village.

661
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,679
I suspect a girl was trafficked.

662
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:54,800
Caiyun.

663
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,559
How did you discover her?

664
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,119
My daughter

665
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,599
was playing with her friends

666
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,920
when they mentioned her.

667
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,039
I felt something was off,

668
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,639
so I sneaked in

669
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,159
when no one was home.

670
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,000
I peeked in through the window.

671
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,880
There was this tiny, skinny girl

672
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,119
with messy hair

673
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,079
and a dirty face.

674
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,280
She cried non-stop,

675
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,400
curled up in the corner.

676
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,360
I just felt

677
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,559
something's off.

678
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:20,400
I think she was trafficked too,

679
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,760
so I came here right away.

680
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,679
Do you know her name?

681
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,880
No.

682
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,920
I tried talking to her.

683
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:30,440
Seems like she couldn't speak.

684
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,519
She just kept

685
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,599
babbling.

686
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,360
Yes, I was panicked too.

687
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,159
I was scared.

688
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,079
I think she wrote
the word "Beg" on my hand.

689
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,880
Junjie.

690
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,840
Contact the local police station.

691
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,880
Find out more.

692
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,440
Got it.

693
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,079
What are you doing?

694
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,840
What are you doing?

695
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,599
What are you doing?

696
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,960
You're still doing it?

697
00:41:04,844 --> 00:41:05,960
What are you fussing about?

698
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:09,840
What are you fussing about?

699
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,559
Keep your mouth shut!

700
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:13,400
You can only stay on the bed.

701
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Don't go near the window.

702
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,440
Got it?

703
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,679
Got it?

704
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,880
Did I say you could make a fuss?

705
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,639
Got it?

706
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,880
You don't listen.

707
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,320
Pack your things.

708
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
What are you doing?

709
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:43,639
I said pack your things.

710
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,119
How useless.

711
00:42:00,466 --> 00:42:01,110
(Recently,)

712
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
(police acted on a citizen's tip)

713
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:06,119
(and rescued
a trafficked deaf and mute woman.)

714
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,039
(It's reported the informant)

715
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,320
(was also a victim rescued)

716
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,199
(in a past anti-trafficking operation.)

717
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,300
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

718
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:19,199
Rui.

719
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,400
How did it go?

720
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,239
We caught Zhang Xiaochu's trafficker.

721
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,880
He works for Skinner.

722
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,866
Zhang Xiaochu should be discharged soon.

723
00:42:28,866 --> 00:42:30,911
As for the evidence in Zhou's stomach,

724
00:42:31,377 --> 00:42:33,550
the tech department
hasn't fully recovered it yet.

725
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,599
But they said

726
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,320
it looks like a newspaper photo

727
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,444
with several people in it.

728
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:39,320
A newspaper-sized photo

729
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,400
with several people in it.

730
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:42,599
I think this item

731
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,360
must be important to Zhou Hongcai

732
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,519
if he would swallow it.

733
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,800
Either it was to save himself

734
00:42:47,288 --> 00:42:49,440
or he meant to leave this evidence
for the police.

735
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:51,920
Could Cripple be in it?

736
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:01,599
This Zhou Hongcai

737
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,400
