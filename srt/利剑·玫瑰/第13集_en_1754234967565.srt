1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to make a new one.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to make a new one.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to make a new one.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to make a new one.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to make a new one.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to make a new one.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm going to make a new one.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to make a new one.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going to make a new one.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to make a new one.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to make a new one.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to make a new one.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to make a new one.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to make a new one.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 2

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This case is being processed in the memory department.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We can't reveal too many details to you.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But as long as there is any situation,

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
we will notify the family as soon as possible.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ms.Cai,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
if your husband is innocent,

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
we will let him out.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We will not wrong him.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Then you should at least tell me what he did.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What's wrong?

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He was raped.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Rape?

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How could he do that?

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Did you make a mistake?

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Ms.Cai,

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
we will investigate if you made a mistake.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If you don't have anything else, please wait for the news.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Do as you are told.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you make a mistake,

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I will complain.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Lu Sheng,

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
please investigate this case.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes, I understand.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Although there is no direct evidence,

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
there is Chen Amo's testimony and the evidence of the facts.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Lu Sheng did not do anything illegal against Zheng Weiwei

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
after the rape of the deceased.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can call the police to report it.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hanzhi, please take a look at this.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I agree to report it.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But you have to continue to investigate.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Find a new source of evidence.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Please.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Brother Rui,

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you are back.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I will get you some hot water.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No need.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I will go.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What are you doing?

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't want to do it.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't want to do it.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Brother Rui, don't be impulsive.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I am not impulsive.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I have figured it out in the last three days.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can't be a good cop.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So I want to quit.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You can do it.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I hope that with your efforts,

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the world can be free.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will do it.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I will do it.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I will do it.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I will do it.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I will do it.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I will do it.

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I will do it.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I will do it.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I will do it.

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I will do it.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I will do it.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I will do it.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I will do it.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I will do it.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I will do it.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I will do it.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I will do it.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I will do it.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I will do it.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I will do it.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I will do it.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will do it.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I will do it.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I will do it.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I will do it.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I will do it.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I will do it.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I will do it.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I will do it.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will do it.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I will do it.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I will do it.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I will do it.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I will do it.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I will do it.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I will do it.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I will do it.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I will do it.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I will do it.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I will do it.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I will do it.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I will do it.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I will do it.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I will do it.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I will do it.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I will do it.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I will do it.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I will do it.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I will do it.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I will do it.

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I will do it.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I will do it.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I will do it.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I will do it.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I will do it.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I will do it.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I will do it.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I will do it.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I will do it.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I will do it.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I will do it.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I will do it.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I will do it.

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Actually, it's not necessary

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
to ask you to run around the prison.

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If it wasn't for this,

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I might not know

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
all the secrets of Changsu.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But after I knew it,

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I really admire him.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Because he made me know

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
what a good policeman looks like.

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What does he look like?

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Anyway, in my memory,

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
he's a bad father

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
who never goes home

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and always works.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
In the end, he saved a scumbag

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and lost his life.

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Is this the real good policeman?

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But you still chose to be a policeman.

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Didn't you?

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's because I had no choice.

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
After he died,

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
everyone around me thought

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I should take his step.

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
At that moment,

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Chief Chang did

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
what he should have done.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He was fulfilling the police's

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
mission and responsibility

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
until the last moment of his life.

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
As his son,

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
don't you think so?

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Why should I take his step?

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He is him, I am me.

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No one cares about

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
what I want to do.

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Everyone thinks

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I should live forever

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
under his shadow.

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't know what happened

170
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
between you and your father

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that made you say that.

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But through these days,

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I can see

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
that you feel very painful

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
when you lose him.

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This is your mental illness.

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But you never admit it.

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You are still stubborn.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So many kids

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
haven't come home yet.

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Are you going to

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
leave like this?

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There are many policemen

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
who are better than me.

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I am not the only one.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I am not the only one.

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Changrui,

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I didn't expect

189
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I would be so disappointed in you.

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I am sorry.

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I didn't expect

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I would hear you say that.

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't want to say anything

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
to keep you in the dark.

195
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But you are right.

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There are many policemen.

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But it takes a lot of time

198
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and energy

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
to train a police officer.

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You know that

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
our job

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
is to race with time.

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There will be a family

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
between us

205
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
who will be in pain

206
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
when they lose their child.

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If you think

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
it doesn't matter,

209
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
you don't care,

210
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you don't care,

211
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
you are numb,

212
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
it doesn't matter.

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can't persuade you.

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I hope you can

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
live your life

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
as you want

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and find a job

218
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
that you like.

219
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I wish you all the best.

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What's wrong?

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Aren't you happy?

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Who said that?

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I am happy.

224
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Very happy.

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Do you think I am a good policeman?

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Of course.

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You are a good policeman.

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Why?

229
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Because you have caught many bad guys.

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You are right.

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Catching bad guys is a good policeman.

232
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Helping bad guys is a bad policeman.

233
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But you have seen Fafa too.

234
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You are different.

235
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Fafa is not a bad guy.

236
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But I help bad guys to take care of them.

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You were a kid at that time.

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You didn't know anything.

239
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You didn't know what others

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
told you to do.

241
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You didn't even know what you were doing.

242
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So,

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
you didn't know

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
who is a good person

245
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
or a bad person when you saved them.

246
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Director.

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I...

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I...

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I pointed at

250
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Director Xiao's nose

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and screamed that day.

252
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Of course.

253
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He

254
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
won't be angry with me, right?

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Chang Rui.

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You know your mistake.

257
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Director Xiao.

258
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
According to the rules,

259
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Wang Guangqing's case

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
may not be avoided by Chang Rui.

261
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Shut up.

262
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You really know your mistake.

263
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
As a policeman,

264
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I should obey the order of the organization.

265
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I shouldn't act without permission

266
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
because of my personal feelings.

267
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I shouldn't

268
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
yell at others.

269
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't know.

270
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Okay.

271
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You are like Chang's good son.

272
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The key is

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
that you found

274
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Shen Wang's way.

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yes, we have found it.

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Go if you find it.

277
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Keep up the pace.

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay.

279
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Go.

280
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Welcome back.

281
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Thank you.

282
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Wang Guangqing.

283
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Do you know what I will do?

284
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You are a good doctor.

285
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Aren't you a policeman?

286
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Wait for it.

287
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
When you have a chance,

288
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
let's have a good fight.

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You have no chance.

290
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Do you remember Chang Yongjun?

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes.

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I remember

293
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
that he saved my life

294
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and saved my life.

295
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So, every year,

296
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
when you celebrate the anniversary of the Qingming Festival,

297
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
you will put art on his grave

298
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
to protect him.

299
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Even the animals know to be grateful.

300
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
My name is Chang Rui.

301
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Chang Yongjun is my father.

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Okay.

303
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Your father

304
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
saved my life in the water.

305
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I didn't expect

306
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
that your son

307
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
almost killed me

308
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
in the water.

309
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Wang Guangqing,

310
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
since you still don't forget

311
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
how to be a captain,

312
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
think about it.

313
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Do you deserve to do these things?

314
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If

315
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
you were still alive,

316
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
you might regret

317
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
saving my life.

318
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He won't.

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He won't regret.

322
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Even if it's ten or twenty times,

323
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
he will still save you.

324
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Every year, you go back to

325
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
the captain's grave

326
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and give him a painting.

327
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It means you haven't forgotten him.

328
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It means you haven't lost your conscience.

329
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We interrogated you so many times.

330
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You didn't tell us a word.

331
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But it doesn't matter.

332
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We have all the evidence.

333
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Even if you don't tell us,

334
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
we can still give you the evidence.

335
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But do you really

336
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
feel sorry for yourself?

337
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Do you feel sorry for

338
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
the flowers you gave every year?

339
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Do you feel sorry for

340
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
the life of the captain?

341
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We want you to be a human again.

342
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I shouldn't have hit you

343
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
when I arrested you that day.

344
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But I couldn't control myself.

345
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I still can't accept

346
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
the person who saved my father

347
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
with his life

348
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and became a scumbag in the end.

349
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
He is not a good father.

350
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But he must be a good cop.

351
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I hope you can cooperate with our work

352
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and tell me everything you know.

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It will be meaningful

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
to make a good cop's sacrifice.

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm thirsty.

356
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Bring me a glass of water.

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
If Wang Wangqing

358
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
is telling the truth,

359
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
then Zheng Weiwei's kidnapping

360
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
should not be

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
an ordinary kidnapping.

362
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
At least,

363
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
he is not a victim of random selection.

364
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The boss

365
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
likes a girl.

366
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
She is the second girl

367
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
on my desk.

368
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
She is an adult.

369
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
She is a college student.

370
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
How can she be so easy to cheat?

371
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I have no choice.

372
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I will let Bai Wan

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
communicate with her online.

374
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
After a long time,

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I will understand

376
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
her personality,

377
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
life details, and so on.

378
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Then,

379
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
she will be a tutor.

380
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
We will

381
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
kidnap her.

382
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Kidnap.

383
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Who can imagine

384
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
that she is very strong,

385
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and she is not soft and hard.

386
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I will ask my daughter to help me.

387
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Boss Li

388
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
will definitely help me.

389
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
After that,

390
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Boss Li is satisfied.

391
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Then,

392
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Brother Xue told Brother Cui

393
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
that he was satisfied.

394
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The next day,

395
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
he gave me 100,000 yuan cash.

396
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
In my opinion,

397
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
this must be a well-organized

398
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
auction price.

399
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And Brother Xue

400
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
gave me 100,000 yuan.

401
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It means that

402
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
the profit he can get from this

403
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
is far less than this.

404
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So we have to find out

405
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
what they are doing behind their backs.

406
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Boss Li's name is Lu Sheng.

407
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I think we should

408
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
follow Lu Sheng's lead.

409
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Ren Lei,

410
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
check the business of Lu Sheng

411
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
that was kidnapped

412
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
by Zheng Weiwei.

413
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Brother Xue

414
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
is not here.

415
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He is not here.

416
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
He is not here.

417
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He is not here.

418
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He is not here.

419
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
He is not here.

420
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
He is not here.

421
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
He is not here.

422
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
He is not here.

423
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
He is not here.

424
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
He is not here.

425
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He is not here.

426
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
He is not here.

427
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He is not here.

428
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
He is not here.

429
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
He is not here.

430
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
He is not here.

431
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
He is not here.

432
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
He is not here.

433
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He is not here.

434
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
He is not here.

435
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He is not here.

436
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He is not here.

437
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
He is not here.

438
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He is not here.

439
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
He is not here.

440
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
He is not here.

441
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He is not here.

442
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He is not here.

443
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
He is not here.

444
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He is not here.

445
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He is not here.

446
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He is not here.

447
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
He is not here.

448
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
He is not here.

449
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He is not here.

450
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He is not here.

451
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
He is not here.

452
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He is not here.

453
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He is not here.

454
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He is not here.

455
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He is not here.

456
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He is not here.

457
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
He is not here.

458
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
He is not here.

459
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
He is not here.

460
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
He is not here.

461
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
He is not here.

462
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
He is not here.

463
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
He is not here.

464
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
He is not here.

465
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
He is not here.

466
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He is not here.

467
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
He is not here.

468
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He is not here.

469
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
He is not here.

470
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,360
Mengerンネル

471
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,880
Zhe relates to several

472
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:27,080
public boilers

473
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,100
Shandong

474
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Work is important

475
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,820
Yes

476
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,460
Work is important, so is life

477
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,180
You know what?

478
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,380
His house is messy

479
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,580
He didn't clean it up

480
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,100
I was the one who made it up

481
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,300
to clean it up

482
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,300
That's true

483
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,540
Xiuming

484
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,700
Can you stay here for a while?

485
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,580
I'll leave tomorrow

486
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,740
So urgent?

487
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,260
You didn't tell him?

488
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,220
I said, is it useful?

489
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,740
Now

490
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,900
Work is his wife

491
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,140
His house is his hotel

492
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,940
Right?

493
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,060
It's all my fault

494
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,180
Aunt Yu

495
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,740
The main thing is

496
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,860
The company I created

497
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,140
has been developing well recently

498
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,500
A capitalist

499
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,100
wants to finance our company

500
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,380
So there are more things

501
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,340
This is a good thing

502
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,100
This is a good thing

503
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,540
Come on, let's celebrate

504
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,140
Xiuming, you are all too young

505
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,060
It's too simple to think about things

506
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,980
No matter how important work is

507
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,580
It's not as important as life

508
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,180
Right?

509
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,180
I mean

510
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,940
You two

511
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,900
You are here

512
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,780
You are here

513
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,300
You live in two different places

514
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,540
What are you going to do with me?

515
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,620
You are brothers

516
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,340
Eat, eat

517
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,900
Aunt, don't worry

518
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,780
I won't

519
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,780
And I've already thought about it

520
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,740
To stabilize Shenzhen

521
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,340
I'll go on fewer business trips

522
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,180
Or I won't go on business trips

523
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,580
Right

524
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,780
I'll live here

525
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,740
It's stable

526
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,980
It's about the same

527
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,380
If only you two had a child

528
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,220
Yes

529
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,180
Eat

530
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,780
Eat, okay?

531
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,580
Old comrade

532
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,100
I mean

533
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,420
If you are running out of time

534
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,860
Busy or something

535
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,420
You can adopt one

536
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,820
You see

537
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,180
Your aunt

538
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,780
Can't stop talking

539
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,420
Let them discuss the children's business

540
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,300
Okay?

541
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,540
Yes

542
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,820
Aunt

543
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,300
Why didn't I think of this before?

544
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,220
It's good to adopt one

545
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,780
Right?

546
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,380
Come on, aunt, I'll toast you

547
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:48,980
Cheers

548
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,460
Aunt, be healthy in the future

549
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,180
Okay

550
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,820
Cheers

551
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,940
Okay

552
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,740
What Brother Xue does is a way of toasting

553
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,940
You just caught us

554
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,020
You can't catch them anyway

555
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,300
People like me

556
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,060
Is the one who specifically carries the thunder

557
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,820
How big is the thunder?

558
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,580
Can you carry it?

559
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,380
Are you so willing to sell your life for Brother Xue?

560
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,780
Take people's money to get rid of people's disaster

561
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,620
It's just a way of playing with money

562
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,940
At most, talk about the world

563
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,220
Brother Xue is a big shot

564
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,900
As long as you know the business

565
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,260
The money must be in place

566
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
And big brother has big brother

567
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,180
As long as you say what you promised

568
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,620
I promise you

569
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,540
I will tell you what you promised

570
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,500
How to contact him?

571
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,860
To be honest

572
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,700
I can't contact him

573
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,460
Every time

574
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,140
Brother Fei contacted me

575
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,500
And gave me an order

576
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,580
After you cleared the mountain tree last time

577
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,420
I let go of Bai Wushan

578
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,780
Brother Fei picked me up

579
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,500
Then he took me to the respiratory room

580
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,020
Since then

581
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,380
I can't contact him

582
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,220
Can't call

583
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,500
It seems that

584
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,740
Between Brother Xue and Wang Guangqing

585
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,100
There is no direct contact

586
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,860
It should be through this brother Fei

587
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,340
Brother Fei is a very important contact

588
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,500
Can only be pursued by half-way

589
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,020
Jiajia

590
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,860
You follow Wang Guangqing's confession

591
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,700
Check all the surveillance of his escape route

592
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,500
it is good

593
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,340
Hello

594
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,100
Not good

595
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,540
Director Du

596
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,060
Since you came last time

597
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,100
After persuading him

598
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,460
He is much better

599
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,620
He went out today

600
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,540
The student ID is not there

601
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,180
I thought he went to school

602
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,620
But I didn't expect

603
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,140
I found a pregnancy report

604
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,580
It's Yang Xi

605
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,900
And he left me a note

606
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,940
How to write

607
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,500
Mom, sorry

608
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,940
I am gone

609
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,460
Please take me as this daughter

610
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,620
Director Du

611
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,180
You help me find him

You help me find him

You help me find him

624
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,620

00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,300
You help me find him

626
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,820
Director Du

You help me find him

628

Director Du

629
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,300
You help me find him

630
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,580
Director Du

631
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,260
You help me find him

632
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,460
Director Du

633
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,980
You help me find him

634
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,020
Director Du

635
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,380
You help me find him

636
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,820
Director Du

637
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,380
And you help me find him

638
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,420
Director Du

639
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,420
You help me find his parents

640
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:14,140
Still wanting to

641
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,980
And you help me find her sons

642
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,180
And you help me form his family

643
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,580
coordinators

644
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
Mom.

645
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
I thought I could do it.

646
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,500
But now,

647
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
I can't.

648
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,580
Do you know how I found you?

649
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,580
The article you wrote

650
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,580
was placed at the center of your school's exhibition.

651
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,580
Not only in your school's exhibition,

652
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,580
the article you wrote on the Internet

653
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,580
also caused a lot of re-evaluation.

654
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,580
Everyone liked you.

655
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,580
They liked the article you created.

656
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,580
You brought hope to everyone.

657
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,580
Now, are you going to give up your hope?

658
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,580
Stop talking.

659
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,580
Your hope has soon to come to us.

660
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,580
Don't take it too far.

661
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,580
You're amazing, Hong.

662
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,580
Let's go say goodbye.

663
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
See you.

664
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,580
Bye.

665
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,580
Miss Lin,

666
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,580
can you give me a ride to Tokyo?

667
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
100% single!

668
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,580
The rush.

669
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,580
She's dead,

670
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,580
The wind is a flower of rebirth.

671
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,780
Look, I've planted two pigs here.

672
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,260
One is you,

673
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,780
and the other is me.

674
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,100
Weiwei,

675
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,980
without you,

676
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,060
I wouldn't have been able to survive.

677
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,580
So you must promise me

678
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,380
to live on.

679
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,020
Live a different life.

680
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,140
Good luck!

681
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,100
I will listen to the past.

682
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,020
I'll be with you.

683
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,660
Lu Sheng, you're suspected of raping.

684
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,660
What's wrong?

685
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,260
You think you're innocent?

686
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,860
Officer Jia, I'm innocent!

687
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,220
Please find out the truth

688
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,820
and clear the case.

689
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,100
You don't want to see the coffin and cry, right?

690
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,820
Why would I cry if I see the coffin?

691
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,260
What do you mean?

692
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,500
Do you want to destroy me

693
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,740
and frame me?

694
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,140
Is that what you mean?

695
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,260
Please be honest.

696
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,460
We're police officers.

697
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,580
We're not innocent.

698
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,700
We're not innocent.

699
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,980
Please be honest.

700
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,060
We're police officers.

701
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,460
Who would destroy you?

702
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,380
You think you're innocent?

703
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,460
You want the truth, right?

704
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,700
Zheng Weiwei is pregnant.

705
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,380
After the autopsy,

706
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,380
the child is confirmed to be yours.

707
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,820
I found Brother Fei.

708
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,900
Director Deng, Brother Rui.

709
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,900
You're back just in time.

710
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,780
I found Brother Fei.

711
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,620
According to Wang Guangqing's confession,

712
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,620
this car

713
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,980
took him to Hongxi City.

714
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,420
We've found the car.

715
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,660
The owner is Brother Fei.

716
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,420
Brother Fei's real name is Fei Yan.

717
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,500
Fei Yan took the body to Hongxi City

718
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,820
and then flew to Xinbangguo.

719
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,780
He flew away pretty fast.

720
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,540
Fei Yan contacted Wang Guangqing's

721
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,340
other number.

722
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,580
He only had one number

723
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,580
with Wang Guangqing.

724
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,860
He only had one number

725
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,860
with Wang Guangqing.

726
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
He's in touch with him now.

727
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,820
Is there any news?

728
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:20,980
Not yet.

729
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,260
Jiajia,

730
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,060
please find out

731
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,980
Fei Yan's driving license

732
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,580
and the traffic rules in the province.

733
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,220
Okay.

734
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,380
This is the recent traffic record of the car.

735
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,780
It's mainly in Lingshan City.

736
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,260
And the place he's been to the most is

737
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,500
Tianhai Good Health Entertainment Center.

738
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,740
Are they thugs or what?

739
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,300
This car,

740
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,140
just go.

741
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,060
Thank you.

742
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:19,820
C'estugh Row Instead.

743
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,600
Since then I have been handling wine

744
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,860
Globe

745
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,580
Ugh

746
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,720
How to trick

747
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,060
How to bargain

748
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,340
Long time no see.

749
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,860
Are you feeling better?

750
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,100
I'm cold.

751
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,660
Sit down.

752
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,660
Why are you crying?

753
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,300
Sit.

754
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,380
How are you recently?

755
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,860
I'm fine.

756
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,100
Your hand...

757
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,820
Does it still hurt?

758
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,660
It's almost healed.

759
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,900
Eat it.

760
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,700
Okay.

761
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,300
What did you order?

762
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,060
I haven't eaten it yet.

763
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,740
You eat this.

764
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,780
It smells so good.

765
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,140
Recently, the city of Shenzhen

766
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,940
has been continuously

767
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,620
destroying

768
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,540
the smuggling of foreign girls

769
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,140
from the smuggling market.

770
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,900
As a province,

771
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,740
please pay attention to...

772
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,340
Look.

773
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,060
These girls who are

774
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,780
smuggled and raped.

775
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,060
Isn't it because

776
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,100
they have a hard life

777
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,060
that they are still

778
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,900
being targeted by these bad guys?

779
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,940
So you mean

780
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,060
the girls who are

781
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,140
smuggled and raped

782
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,660
are their problem?

783
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Of course.

784
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,020
This warehouse

785
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,060
is a big,

786
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,340
unobtrusive place.

787
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,860
And let me tell you.

788
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,300
These girls

789
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,420
who were saved,

790
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,140
think about it.

791
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,140
Which normal man

792
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:17,980
wants them?

793
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,380
Which normal man

794
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,620
doesn't think they are dirty?

795
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,540
So,

796
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,460
I...

797
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,060
Why did you break it?

798
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,180
What's wrong with breaking it?

799
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,140
I should have broken it earlier.

800
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:29,940
You should have shut up.

801
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,820
Shut up.

802
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,020
My mom didn't scold you.

803
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,540
How dare you scold me?

804
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,860
Who forced me to hit you?

805
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,660
You are so capable.

806
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,260
Try to move it.

807
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,340
You two girls.

808
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,420
If you want to hit me,

809
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,100
do you believe that

810
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,140
I will hit you?

811
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:49,940
Don't hit me.

812
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,940
We are talking about the body.

813
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,380
Yes, we have evidence.

814
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,020
If you dare to hit me,

815
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,060
I will call the police.

816
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:54,860
Get out.

817
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,580
You two, wait.

818
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,580
I am a man.

819
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,620
I am a man.

820
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,740
Get out.

821
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,380
Get out.

822
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,180
So what?

823
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,540
What do you expect?

824
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,700
Did you hear it?

825
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,300
The boss has to

826
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,700
move the shop.

827
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,740
Why?

828
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,820
What else can he do?

829
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,500
I heard he can't

830
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
He said he wouldn't sell it all

831
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
He would sell all the dishes

832
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
That's too much

833
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
We don't have enough money

834
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Forget it

835
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Even if we have enough money, we don't have money to buy

836
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,500
We can't make a good living

837
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Auntie Zhang

838
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,500
Have you eaten?

839
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
Yes

840
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,500
I have something to tell you

841
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
Auntie Zhang

842
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
My friend

843
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
He also likes my store

844
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,500
The price he gave is quite appropriate

845
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,500
So I...

846
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
I just want to tell you

847
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Can we

848
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,500
We can continue the original price

849
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,500
Yes

850
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Auntie Zhang

851
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
I'm not saying I don't take care of you

852
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
Look

853
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,500
All the stores on the street have increased rent

854
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,500
I haven't paid you rent for so many years

855
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
I've taken care of you enough

856
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Right?

857
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,500
Yes

858
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
How do we say

859
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
It's a little less symbolic

860
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
A little less

861
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,500
How much is the little you said?

862
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
My friend

863
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
He gave me 50,000 a year

864
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
If you

865
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,500
48,000

866
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
48,000

867
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
48,000

868
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
You didn't go up much

869
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,500
What's the difference between 48,000 and 50,000?

870
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
How can it grow so much?

871
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
You can give us more

872
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
This

873
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,500
This

874
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Look

875
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,500
We really

876
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
It's not easy this year

877
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
Can't make much money

878
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Yaqiang

879
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,500
You've been taking care of us for so many years

880
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
We know you're having a hard time

881
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
You see

882
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Can we

883
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Let's talk about it

884
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Let's discuss

885
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Let's make room again

886
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Or

887
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,500
You give 48,000

888
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Let's renew the contract

889
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Or

890
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
I'll give you half a month

891
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
Move away

892
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,500
You can

893
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
You can

894
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Xiaoqian

895
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
That's it

896
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,500
You think about it

897
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
No

898
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Xiaoqian

899
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Wait

900
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
Xiaoqian

901
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Keep discussing

902
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,300
Give me a audience

903
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,300
I don't want to wait

904
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,300
You're running a show

905
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,360
I'm other than your audience

906
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,020
Let's hurry up

907
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,500
You want to train?

908
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,760
I really want to

909
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,220
Thank you

910
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,460
Thank you

911
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,420
Because you help us

912
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,880
I want to be your action

913
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,580
Because I can see you

914
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,580
Director Zeng.

915
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,980
We have the result.

916
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,380
This is the list of contracts

917
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,540
signed by all Yulusheng companies

918
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,420
during the kidnapping of Zheng Weiwei.

919
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,180
What's wrong with you?

920
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,300
What's wrong?

921
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,340
This is my cousin's company.

922
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,060
If you don't feel comfortable,

923
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,700
I can go there for you.

924
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,580
It's okay.

925
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,820
I'll call them first

926
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,980
and ask them about the situation.

927
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,420
You signed it?

928
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,220
Yes.

929
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,980
Such a huge batch of goods.

930
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,100
Why didn't you

931
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,940
just find a insurance company to buy insurance?

932
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,900
You also wanted to find

933
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,460
an international insurance agency.

934
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,260
Now this agency is out of business.

935
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,380
We have no money.

936
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,260
You two tell me.

937
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,740
How do we clean up this mess?

938
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,100
Director Ye.

939
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,980
I'm sorry.

940
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,860
I'm sorry.

941
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,620
I'm sorry.

942
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,340
I'm sorry.

943
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,060
I'm sorry.

944
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,860
I'm sorry.

945
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,660
I'm sorry.

946
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,420
I'm sorry.

947
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,220
I'm sorry.

948
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,140
I'm sorry.

949
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,140
I'm sorry.

950
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,140
I'm sorry.

951
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,100
It's my fault.

952
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,900
I've been working with that company before.

953
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,100
There's never been a problem.

954
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,900
You've been working with them.

955
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,620
There's never been a problem, Wu.

956
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,260
Is this what you should say now?

957
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,260
Is it true?

958
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,900
No one wants this to happen.

959
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,940
We've already

960
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,660
called the foreign agency.

961
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,020
It's no use calling the agency.

962
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,940
When can you call the foreign agency

963
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,420
to solve the case?

964
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,260
When can you get the money back?

965
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,100
I'm short of money.

966
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,500
I can't wait any longer.

967
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,260
How about this?

968
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,660
I'll personally decide

969
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,940
the company's

970
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,260
emergency funds.

971
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,180
Okay?

972
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,620
And the old clients of the company.

973
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,380
I'll sort them out as soon as possible.

974
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,940
I'll try to get more new orders.

975
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,700
Okay?

976
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,020
Director Ye.

977
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,700
Leave this to me.

978
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,380
One month.

979
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,860
Within one month,

980
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,660
I'll come up with a feasible plan.

981
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,180
It's no use asking for a feasible plan.

982
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,180
And I can't give you

983
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,340
a month's time.

984
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,260
Two weeks.

985
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,140
The funds are in place.

986
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,340
Proceed.

987
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,020
No problem.

988
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,340
If I can't do that,

989
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,420
I will resign.

990
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420
I'll leave to work.

991
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:25,660
sonra,

992
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:26,980
don't leave.

993
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,220
Why do you want to force her?

994
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,940
I'm not forcing her.

995
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,180
I have no choice.

996
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,780
This is her fault.

997
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,020
She should be responsible for this.

998
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,180
What do you mean this is her mistake?

999
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,420
She should be responsible.

1000
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,620
Whose company is this?

1001
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,420
It's ours!

1002
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,980
You're like a master of magic.

1003
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,820
You're so busy this time.

1004
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,420
You're so limited.

1005
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,820
You don't care about anything.

1006
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,060
You just leave it to us.

1007
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,340
Now this is happening.

1008
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,580
You're blaming us.

1009
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,820
What are you doing?

1010
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,700
I'll fly to Shencheng tomorrow morning.

1011
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,100
I'll think of a way there.

1012
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,460
In short,

1013
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,020
the capital chain of Shencheng can't be broken.

1014
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,540
I'll fly to Shencheng tomorrow morning.

1015
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,740
I'll fly to Shencheng tomorrow morning.

1016
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,020
You only care about Shencheng.

1017
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,260
Only the capital chain.

1018
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,020
Do you still care about others?

1019
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,780
The case of Dusheng

1020
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,620
is related to Dingshun Group.

1021
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,100
The boss of Dingshun Group, Ye Xiu Ming,

1022
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,020
is my cousin.

1023
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,060
If the case of Dusheng

1024
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,820
is really related to Dingshun Group,

1025
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,380
should I apply for a ban?

1026
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,500
It's not that far.

1027
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,020
Just go and check it.

1028
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,220
I trust the person.

1029
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,060
If you find out that Ye Xiu Ming

1030
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,500
is related to this case,

1031
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,820
you won't be late for the ban.

1032
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,580
Okay, I know.

1033
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,020
I'll go first.

1034
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,660
Go.

1035
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,060
Qiao, you're so busy.

1036
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,540
Why do you dress so fast every day?

1037
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,580
Why don't you wear the clothes

1038
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,500
I gave you before?

1039
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,340
The clothes you gave me

1040
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,500
are too fancy.

1041
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,140
I can't wear the clothes that I wear when I'm a police.

1042
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,540
You don't like it, do you?

1043
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,020
Tell me, what do you want from me?

1044
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,180
You're not just buying me a cake

1045
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,100
for coffee, are you?

1046
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,020
It's like this.

1047
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,620
I want to ask you

1048
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,100
about Lu Sheng.

1049
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,540
Lu Sheng?

1050
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,500
The person who worked for your Taikwai Office

1051
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,820
has already talked to me.

1052
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,340
Tell me the truth.

1053
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,620
Did the company and Lu Sheng

1054
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,060
completely break up?

1055
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,180
How should I put it?

1056
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,700
I'm not sure about

1057
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,900
the relationship between your company and Lu Sheng.

1058
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,060
But because of the case of Lu Sheng,

1059
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,420
it involves many problems.

1060
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,780
I can't tell you.

1061
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,540
I just want to know

1062
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,980
whether Lu Sheng

1063
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,780
has a big impact on Ding Chun.

1064
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:11,500
