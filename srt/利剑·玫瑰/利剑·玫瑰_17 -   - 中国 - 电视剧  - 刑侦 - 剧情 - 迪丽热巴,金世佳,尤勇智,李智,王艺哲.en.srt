00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,210
Little Spud!

6
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,820
So sweet!

7
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,180
Look at Grandma.

8
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,860
Don't cry.

9
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,511
Look at Grandma.

10
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,177
Did I scare you?

11
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,290
Such soft little hands.

12
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:57,900
Yes.

13
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,088
So adorable.

14
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,900
Look at Grandma.

15
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,260
Look at Grandma.

16
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,300
Looks like you've gained some weight.

17
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,420
Yes.

18
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,140
He's gained two kg since coming home.

19
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,620
He just woke up.

20
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,420
He's a bit cranky.

21
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,220
A bit cranky.

22
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,380
Say "Grandma".

23
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,180
It's okay now.

24
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,133
Look at Grandma.

25
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,380
Madam He.

26
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,220
Mr. Liu.

27
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,755
Don't give up hope, everyone.

28

Trust us,

29
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,260
you'll definitely find your children.

30
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,180
Look, we found ours, didn't we?

31
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:28,980
Have faith.

32
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,780
Stay strong.

33
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,460
You'll find them.

34
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,020
Yes,

35
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,580
we will.

36
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,380
Yes, we will.

37
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,220
We must have faith.

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,820
Such a good boy.

39
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,860
Look at him.

40
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,300
By the way,

41
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,820
we have a new friend with us today.

42
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,060
She's going to share her story.

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,860
Come on.

44
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,500
Hello, everyone.

45
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,780
My name is Pingjiao.

46
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,790
I was abducted when I was seven.

47
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,420
The people who raised me only took me

48
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,940
because they wanted a son.

49
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,380
When I got older, I tried to run away,

50
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,100
to be independent,

51
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,380
and to find my real parents.

52
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,260
But unfortunately...

53
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,890
- Don't be scared.
- I was trafficked again.

54
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,980
And I nearly lost my life.

55
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,300
Thankfully,

56
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,300
I've now found

57
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,700
my real mom and dad.

58
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,820
They've been incredibly kind to me.

59
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:36,540
That's wonderful.

60
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,500
So happy for you.

61
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,340
That's great.

62
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,060
So happy for you.

63
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,340
It's okay.

64
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,180
Wait, you mean

65
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,180
you were trafficked
when you were twelve?

66
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,300
Ma'am, I was seven when I was abducted.

67
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,380
Yes, yes.

68
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,020
Seven years old.

69
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,380
From seven years old until now...

70
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,140
After all these years,

71
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,620
you finally made it back.
That's amazing.

72
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,260
So everyone, don't give up.

73
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,900
Never lose hope.

74
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,380
We'll all make it home one day.

75
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,660
Ranran is right.

76
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,060
Ma'am, I'm Ping...

77
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,200
We just have to keep going.

78
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,180
Keep holding on.

79
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:17,850
Yes.

80
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,300
Yes...

81
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,180
Yes, yes.

82
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,600
That's right. We'll all make it home.

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,340
She's right.

84
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,620
That's wonderful.

85
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,420
Come, give Grandma a hug.

86
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,500
Come...

87
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,060
Grandma's got you.

88
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,460
Good boy.

89
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,200
Oh, right,

90
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,180
Pingjiao also brought us
some local specialties.

91
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,340
Lots of goodies.

92
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,620
She wanted us to try them.

93
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,700
Everything was grown by my mom and dad.

94
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,740
Everyone, have a taste.

95
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,700
All natural and pesticide-free.

96
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,570
Great, great.

97
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,540
Thank you.

98
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,620
Let me help you.

99
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,540
Thank you.

100
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,220
Here...

(Reunion)

102
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,844
Hello, there.

103
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:34,260
Are you looking for a nanny?

104
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,260
What a sweet little one.

105
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,550
Such a good baby.

106
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,540
Look at those long lashes.

107
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,310
So well-behaved.

108
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,060
So fair and clean.

109
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,220
It's rare to meet

110
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,900
someone Xiaoguang doesn't shy away from.

111
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,860
Exactly.

112
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,540
I've looked after many kids,

113
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,820
so kids naturally take to me.

114
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,540
Ma'am,

115
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,260
how long have you been a nanny?

116
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,540
Many years now.

117
00:06:58,555 --> 00:06:59,860
From babies just over a month old

118
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:02,111
to kids one to five years old,
I've cared for them all.

119
00:07:02,311 --> 00:07:03,980
Newborns, though,
are a different matter.

120
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,140
That's for postpartum nannies.

121
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,580
Not just anyone can handle that.

122
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,950
So what brings you here today?

123
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,260
In the last family I worked for,

124
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,300
the father was transferred
to another province.

125
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,580
(Liangjie Domestic Services)
They wanted me to go, too,

126
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,820
but I'm used to living here.

127
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,700
I didn't want to move,

128
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,980
so now I'm job hunting again.

129
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,500
Here.

130
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,940
This is my resume.

131
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:31,200
(Domestic Worker Resume)
And this was my last family.

132
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,700
They were very kind.

133
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:36,200
Just that the lady of the house
was a bit picky.

134
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,820
But we really got along.

135
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,620
I worked there for over four years.

136
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:42,260
When the child left suddenly,

137
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,540
I was genuinely reluctant to go.

138
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,420
Ma'am, here's the thing,

139
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,660
we're here today

140
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,059
because we're looking for a nanny.

141
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,660
But we couldn't find a good match

142
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,820
at the agency.

143
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,580
You seem to click
with my child so well.

144
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,700
Would you

145
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,155
consider helping us?

146
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,380
Sure.

147
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,100
I'm looking for a job anyway.

148
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:03,160
And I really feel a connection
with this child.

149
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,900
I'm happy to help.

150
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,380
Great.

151
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,180
It's settled then.

152
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,660
Let's go register at the agency.

153
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,500
Well...

154
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,820
The agency takes quite a cut.

155
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,660
You pay more,

156
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,830
and I get less.

157
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,888
It's not a good deal for either of us.

158
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,780
How about...

159
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,930
Well...

160
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,140
It's rare for Xiaoguang
to take to someone like this.

161
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,860
Perhaps

162
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,800
we could start
with a brief trial period?

163
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:25,700
Well,

164
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,170
we can ask her to leave her ID with us,

165
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,540
and we'll make a copy to keep.

166
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,100
Here's my ID. Take a look.

167
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,780
Shall we try it for a few days?

168
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,380
Sure.

169
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,380
Ma'am,

170
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,111
why don't you come home
with us to start?

171
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,660
Alright, sounds good.

172
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,100
Here you go.

173
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,860
Okay.

174
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,220
Great.

175
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,700
Let's go.

176
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,220
Alright.

177
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,380
Sweetie...

(September 1, 2009.

179
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,300
Hello, how can I help you?

180
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,930
I'm just looking.

181
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,620
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

182
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,900
How's your leg?

183
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,180
It takes time for serious injuries
to heal.

184
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,900
It still hurts.

185
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,500
That Yang Caiyun you mentioned earlier,

186
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,620
we found her.

187
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,770
That's great news.

188
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,460
Officer,

189
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,580
have I redeemed myself, then?

190
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,822
That depends on how you behave
going forward.

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,820
Madam Hong.

192
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,888
What's her real name?

193
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,650
She never said.

194
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,020
She changes her name every few days.

195
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,720
She's used many names.

196
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,620
Like Deng Yanping,

197
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,740
Hong Yanyan,

198
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,380
Liu Yulan,

199
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,810
Li Lanxiang,

200
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,180
and others.

201
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,340
Where is she from?

202
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,380
She never said,

203
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,780
and I never asked.

204
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,140
Her accent?

205
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,340
From the way she talks, it sounds like

206
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,300
she's from the southwest.

207
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,300
You never met any of her friends
or family?

208
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,620
No.

209
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,220
You lived with her all that time

210
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,577
and you know nothing about her?

211
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,420
Officer,

212
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,420
in our line of work,

213
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,940
you don't ask what you shouldn't.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,288
But you must at least know
what she looks like?

215
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,860
I do.

216
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,020
Of course I do.

217
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,180
Can you describe her?

218
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,060
Yes,

219
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,380
of course.

220
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,200
Huang Chuan's description
is very accurate.

221
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,700
We showed the sketch
to several people involved.

222
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,500
They all confirmed it was Madam Hong.

223
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:38,580
Vice Director Yin has contacted police
and detention centers

224
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,420
across the country.

225
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,460
(Linshan Police Bureau)
So far,

226
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:42,860
Madam Hong is still on the run.

227
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:45,460
But relying on just this sketch

228
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:47,222
is like finding a needle in a haystack.

229
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,940
What we need now is to narrow down
the search area.

230
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,800
We still have to start with Huang Chuan.

231
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,900
After all, they lived together
for years.

232
00:11:57,622 --> 00:11:59,244
There's no way she never slipped up.

233
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,180
I'll go question Huang Chuan again.

234
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,660
Are you sure this is

235
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,133
what Madam Hong really looks like?

236
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,620
Yes.

237
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,260
That's her.

238
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,260
Even if she turned to ash,

239
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,488
I'd still recognize her.

240
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,500
Officer,

241
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,340
have you caught her yet?

242
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,300
You lived with Madam Hong.

243
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,900
What do you know about her habits?

244
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,420
Habits?

245
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,580
Nothing special.

246
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,220
People like us,

247
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,540
are always out and about,
constantly on the move,

248
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,010
running from the cops.

249
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,260
We don't even have a proper life.

250
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,555
What about her favorite foods?

251
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,380
Officer,

252
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,222
is any of this really useful?

253
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,460
Cut the nonsense.

254
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,940
Just answer the questions.

255
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,700
Okay, okay.

256
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,460
Whenever she made money,

257
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,580
she'd treat herself to braised pork.

258
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,133
Where would she eat it?

259
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:24,980
It varied.

260
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,980
She said

261
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,330
she was poor when she was young.

262
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,540
Now that she had money,

263
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,360
she wanted to eat

264
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,700
braised pork from every shop

265
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,060
in Linshan.

266
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,380
Besides food,

267
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,700
did she have any other hobbies?

268
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,420
Hobbies?

269
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,500
Oh right.

270
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,533
She liked buying gold jewelry.

271
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,900
The funny thing is,

272
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,140
normally,

273
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,644
she didn't care about appearances.

274
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,380
But every time she made money,

275
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,060
she'd secretly go out

276
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,380
and buy all kinds of gold
and silver jewelry.

277
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,900
Quite a lot, actually.

278
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,180
A few times,

279
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,660
I checked the pockets in her clothes

280
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,400
and found some receipts.

281
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,020
They listed things like

282
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,780
gold bracelets, gold earrings, and such.

283
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,740
I asked her,

284
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,620
"What's an old woman like you

285
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,300
buying this stuff for?"

286
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,500
She got mad at me over that.

287
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,020
Did you ever see her wear it?

288
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:26,900
Never.

289
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,660
Not even once.

290
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,222
I have no idea where she stashed it.

291
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,100
You mentioned the receipts.

292
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,500
Do you remember

293
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,420
where she bought the jewelry?

294
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,580
Honestly, I don't remember.

295
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,660
But I'm sure it was in
one of the malls in Linshan.

296
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,340
Director Deng, Madam Hong
once told me something.

297
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,700
I'm used to living here.

298
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
I don't want to move.

299
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,555
She must still be here.

300
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,060
Ma'am, these are some of our earrings.

301
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,220
With your short hair,

302
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,000
they'll look especially flattering.

303
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,020
Let's look over here.

304
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,488
Have a look,
see which gold piece you like.

305
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,660
That one.

306
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,340
This one?

307
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,660
Ma'am,

308
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,460
you have good taste indeed.

309
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,380
This

310
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,100
(Camera 3)
is one of our best-sellers.

311
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,220
Here.

312
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,140
Take a look.

313
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,660
This...

314
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,300
The bracelet?

315
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,780
That one?

316
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,660
That one?

317
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:24,530
The thick one.

318
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,060
Ma'am,

319
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,900
to be honest,

320
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,140
I bought the same one

321
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,740
for my mom for Chinese New Year's.

322
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,650
She absolutely loved it.

323
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:32,577
We've got more here.

324
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,100
This one.

325
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,770
This one?

326
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:37,800
Let me box it up for you.

327
00:15:37,822 --> 00:15:38,660
And there's more here.

328
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,300
Let me show you.

329
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,380
No, just these.

330
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,130
Just these?

331
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,140
Alright, these are the ones you chose.

332
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,266
Take a look,
and see which one you like best.

333
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,060
Do they look good on me?

334
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:48,940
They do.

335
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,900
You've got a great eye.
Trust your taste.

336
00:15:58,222 --> 00:15:58,940
I'll take them.

337
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,220
All of these? You're getting them all?

338
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,140
Didn't you say they looked good on me?

339
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,020
That's her.

340
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,860
A month ago,

341
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,220
she bought a large amount
of gold jewelry at a store.

342
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,900
I confirmed it with the store assistant.

343
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,060
She said her appearance

344
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,980
matches the sketch of Madam Hong.

345
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,300
So now, at least we know one thing.

346
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,540
Madam Hong was still in Linshan
a month ago.

347
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,020
Huang Chuan waited
at several jewelry stores

348
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,100
but never ran into her.

349
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:37,200
And right after he went into hiding
in the suburbs,

350
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,955
she showed up.

351
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,500
Start the search here.

352
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:42,044
Focus on places elderly folks frequent.

353
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,820
Zoom in on Camera 1.

354
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:49,890
Look at the plastic bag in her hand.

355
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,260
What's written on it?

356
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:03,220
(Liandu Mountain Supermarket)

357
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,650
Liandu Mountain Supermarket.

358
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,860
That's a grocery store bag.

359
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,620
It's filled with household items.

360
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,520
Is it possible

361
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,460
that Madam Hong has been
hiding somewhere

362
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:21,044
between the jewelry store
and that supermarket?

363
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,620
Director.

364
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,540
Eat something while you can.

365
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,540
We've canvassed
all the nearby neighborhoods.

366
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,660
No one has seen that old woman.

367
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,790
Is it possible

368
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,820
that she doesn't actually live here?

369
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,300
I just looked again at the photos

370
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,800
the jewelry store assistant gave us.

371
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,640
I think

372
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,820
we need to change our approach.

373
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,580
You know what,

374
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,900
Madam Hong's

375
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
got taste.

376
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,100
The pieces she picked out
are quite stylish.

377
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
Don't you think?

378
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,700
Huang Chuan told us that Madam Hong

379
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,060
is a woman in her fifties,

380
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:24,355
and she probably bought the jewelry
as a store of value.

381
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,140
But if that's the case,

382
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,740
why not buy gold bars

383
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,660
or coins?

384
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,420
Why buy

385
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,820
jewelry with such striking designs?

386
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,140
Could it be that she had another reason?

387
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,540
Meaning

388
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,900
she didn't buy the jewelry

389
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,266
just as a store of value.

390
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,540
Exactly.

391
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,940
Our impression of her

392
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:45,155
is probably very different
from how she really looks.

393
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,620
She's good at disguises.

394
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,500
So we have to imagine,

395
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,260
when she's alone,

396
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,060
feeling safe

397
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,070
and relaxed,

398
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,180
what does Madam Hong really look like?

399
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,140
People like us,

400
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,180
always out and about,
constantly on the move,

401
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,620
and running from the cops.

402
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,140
We don't even have a proper life.

403
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,700
The funny thing is,

404
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,780
normally,

405
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,260
she didn't care about appearances.

406
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,220
But every time she made money,

407
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,660
she'd secretly go out

408
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,300
and buy all kinds of gold
and silver jewelry.

409
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,460
Her voice was pretty deep.

410
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,300
You couldn't even tell the gender.

411
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,488
We've been chasing Madam Hong

412
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:19,060
(Linshan Municipal Government)
from the shadows for 20 years.

413
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:20,660
She's cunning, unpredictable,

414
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,500
a real chameleon.

415
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,260
I asked her,

416
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,400
"What's an old woman like you

417
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,940
buying this stuff for?"

418
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,020
Director.

419
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:32,622
What are you looking at?

420
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:37,890
Are there any upscale neighborhoods
around here?

421
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,620
I know where she went.

422
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Hello, welcome!

423
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,090
Hi, there.

424
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,300
We're the police.

425
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,860
We need your cooperation on something.

426
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,660
Of course.

427
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,300
Have you seen this person before?

428
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,100
Looks a bit familiar.

429
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,060
Give me a moment.

430
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,060
Sure, thank you.

431
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,220
This woman.

432
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,420
(Name: Hong Yawen)
Ms. Hong Yawen.

433
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,660
She kind of

434
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,540
looks like the woman in your sketch.

435
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,060
She's actually a VIP client here.

436
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,780
Every time she comes,

437
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,340
she gets facial treatments.

438
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,740
Spends a lot too.

439
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,155
Can you help us get in touch with her?

440
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,460
Sure.

441
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,140
Thank you.

442
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,060
Miss, just wait a moment.

443
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,355
I'll get your hydration
and whitening treatment ready.

444
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:45,740
Okay.

445
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:46,640
Please, go ahead.

446
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,900
We finally meet.

447
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,580
Madam Hong.

448
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,340
The infamous Madam Hong
of the underworld.

449
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,380
It's you, isn't it?

450
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,580
I don't know any Madam Hong.

451
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,780
Recognize him?

452
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,070
Your old flame.

453
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,100
He said

454
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,140
even if you turned to ash,
he'd recognize you.

455
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,600
Huang Chuan.

456
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,740
You called him Old Yellow Dog.

457
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,580
He told us everything you did

458
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,660
in full detail.

459
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,340
You lived with him for decades.

460
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,340
Don't tell me you don't
remember anything.

461
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,620
Officer,

462
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,260
you can't just take his word for it.

463
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,100
I'm a good judge of character.

464
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,220
Just look at him.
He doesn't look like a decent person.

465
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,420
Don't try to play dumb with us.

466
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,740
If we didn't have solid evidence,

467
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,300
you think we'd bring you in?

468
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,860
Why are you being so aggressive?

469
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,980
How am I playing dumb?

470
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,940
I'm being wrongly accused.

471
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,400
I've been to your place.

472
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,900
According to this DNA report,

473
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,140
hair samples collected

474
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,580
from Huang Chuan's home

475
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,540
match your DNA
with a high degree of certainty.

476
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,620
Fine.

477
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,220
I admit I knew him.

478
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,540
But I hated him.

479
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,100
I didn't want to talk about him.

480
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,820
I didn't want to be anywhere near him.

481
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,380
He said

482
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,660
if I ever left him,

483
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,150
he'd kill me.

484
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,380
I had no choice.

485
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,100
I'm just a woman.

486
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,020
I had to do everything he said,

487
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,460
or else he'd beat me.

488
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,420
I'm a victim too.

489
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,180
That's not what Huang Chuan said.

490
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,860
He said you abducted children together.

491
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,940
And that

492
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,260
it was all your idea.

493
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,420
Kidnapping children?

494
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,460
That's ridiculous!

495
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,700
Officer,

496
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,300
you can't frame me like that.

497
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,580
All I did was cook

498
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,900
and clean the house.

499
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,460
I swear I didn't know anything else.

500
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,300
I've got a question.

501
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,460
You look like you've got a lot of money.

502
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,380
Where did it all come from?

503
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,460
I saved it.

504
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,580
Just saved it?

505
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,980
You live in a high-end apartment,

506
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,220
go to beauty salons,

507
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,340
and wear designer clothes.

508
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,180
Tell me,

509
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,700
what kind of job lets you save
that kind of money?

510
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,820
Where exactly did your money come from?

511
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,940
I've worked for years.

512
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,740
And I've made some investments.

513
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,340
Investments, huh?

514
00:24:13,622 --> 00:24:15,400
What kind of investment makes that much?

515
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:16,311
Care to teach me?

516
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,820
Don't tell me it's

517
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,288
gold trading?

518
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,820
You made that money from
abducting kids over the last 20 years.

519
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:25,244
Huang Chuan told us everything.

520
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,700
You took all the money and disappeared.

521
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,260
Nonsense! What a load of garbage!

522
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,780
That money was mine to begin with.

523
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,780
So you're admitting you worked
with Huang Chuan?

524
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,980
I didn't work with him.

525
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,740
He made the money and gave me a share.

526
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,460
He never told me

527
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,660
what he was doing, and I never asked.

528
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,900
How many children did you take?

529
00:24:50,266 --> 00:24:51,911
How many families did you destroy?

530
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,340
You think acting clueless

531
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,460
will get you off the hook?

532
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,140
Don't frame me!

533
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,820
I swear I didn't do anything!

534
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,060
Why won't you believe me?

535
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,740
Why won't you believe me?

536
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,380
I didn't do anything.

537
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,740
Madam Hong denies everything.

538
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,820
She's blaming it all on Huang Chuan.

539
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,020
We expected that.

540
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,940
An old trafficker like her,

541
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,900
if we don't hit her

542
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
with solid evidence,

543
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,260
she'll keep stonewalling us.

544
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,244
The problem

545
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:30,180
is we know nothing
about her real identity.

546
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,180
Not her real name,

547
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,020
where she's from,
or her family background.

548
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,860
Nothing at all.

549
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,860
Now we've got a photo of her.

550
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,380
I've already asked the bureau

551
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,622
to help with the investigation.

552
00:25:38,644 --> 00:25:40,577
We'll get to the bottom
of who she really is,

553
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,580
including running her DNA

554
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,777
through the national database.

555
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:43,400
Director.

556
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,600
Linping County's
Anti-abduction Office has news.

557
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,590
In their area, there's a middle-aged
woman named Hong Jinfeng

558
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,980
who looks a lot like Madam Hong.

559
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,020
Linping authorities got her phone number

560
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,500
through the local police station.

561
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,733
Turns out it was our officers
in Linshan Detention Center

562
00:25:57,733 --> 00:25:58,711
who picked up the call.

563
00:25:58,777 --> 00:26:00,280
That woman named Hong Jinfeng...

564
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,450
She's Madam Hong?

565
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,350
No doubt.

566
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,740
Linping County is Madam Hong's hometown.

567
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,780
Her real name is Hong Jinfeng.

568
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,880
Born in 1958.

569
00:26:07,888 --> 00:26:08,940
Her family had five members.

570
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,900
Her parents,

571
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,870
and two younger brothers.

572
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,860
She left home to work
when she was just a teenager

573
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,740
and rarely returned.

574
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,920
Her family moved away in 1995

575
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,050
and never came back.

576
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:19,600
Can we get in touch with her family?

577
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,060
Vice Director Yin is already
looking into it.

578
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,380
So that means

579
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,420
we've now found

580
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,955
the suspect's original home address.

581
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:29,940
Alright.

582
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,580
Take a team to her hometown.

583
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,760
Have Mr. Yin contact her family.

584
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:34,660
Got it.

585
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:44,900
According to the old officer
who patrolled here,

586
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,050
the family moved away decades ago.

587
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,500
The old house has been empty

588
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,620
ever since.

589
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,510
Understood.

590
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,155
That's Hong Jinfeng's house up ahead.

591
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,490
Here, this way.

592
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,100
(Certificates of Honor)

593
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,066
(Award Certificate: Model Student)

594
00:27:28,088 --> 00:27:28,950
Who would've thought

595
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:30,777
Madam Hong used to be a good student?

596
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,470
Jiajia,

597
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,620
take a look at this.

598
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,377
What have you found?

599
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,900
(Family Portrait, 1970)

600
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,820
Family photo.

601
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:48,511
But there's no Hong Jinfeng
in this family photo.

602
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,380
Kind of sad for her, honestly.

603
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,340
Left out of the family photo,

604
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,540
and had to live in the kitchen.

605
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,820
(Family Portrait, 1970)
Since it's a family photo,

606
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,422
why didn't they take it with them

607
00:28:00,422 --> 00:28:01,800
when they moved out?

608
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,888
Maybe they forgot.

609
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,700
It's right in plain sight,

610
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,380
and they just forgot?

611
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
So that means

612
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,700
this family photo

613
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,820
was deliberately left here.

614
00:28:21,244 --> 00:28:23,666
(Family Portrait, 1970)
Because someone wanted to look at them.

615
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,100
If that's the case...

616
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,820
She never really left.

617
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,740
Does anyone usually clean this place?

618
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,820
No.

619
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,380
(Family Portrait, 1970)
This photo was taken in 1970.

620
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,820
Hong Jinfeng was only 12.

621
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,300
No matter what happened back then,

622
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,940
it must've had a huge impact on her.

623
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,155
Otherwise, she wouldn't have
held on to the photo.

624
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,500
Ai Xin, once we get the search warrant,

625
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,222
take a few more people with you.

626
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,620
There may be more clues.

627
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,460
I'm finally back.

628
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,800
Mr. Yin, thanks for your hard work.

629
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,540
You all had it tougher than me.

630
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,460
Any luck?

631
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,820
Did you find her family?

632
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,460
I went all the way to the far north

633
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,300
and finally tracked them down.

634
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,060
Her parents have passed away.

635
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,977
But I met her younger brother.

636
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,020
What did he say?

637
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,300
I showed him a photo of Hong Jinfeng.

638
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,900
He told me

639
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,940
the person in the photo
isn't his sister.

640
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,100
He said she's already dead.

641
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,820
Dead?

642
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,390
Each brother is saying
something different.

643
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,020
Looks like the family
wants nothing to do with her.

644
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,620
In that case,

645
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,111
confirming Madam Hong's identity
will be even harder.

646
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
Even so,

647
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,420
we can still charge her.

648
00:29:57,933 --> 00:29:59,333
There's one more person we can ask.

649
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,460
Lawyer Sun,

650
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,300
we need your help identifying someone.

651
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:16,044
Take a look at the people coming in

652
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,180
and see if the fake nanny

653
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,711
who abducted Xiaoguang is among them.

654
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,420
It's been years.

655
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,380
She's probably changed a lot.

656
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,755
It's totally normal if you don't
recognize her right away.

657
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,980
Just try to remember

658
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,460
if she had an accent,

659
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,780
or any particular habits.

660
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,420
To this day,

661
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,380
I remember every little detail
about her.

662
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,860
Even if she turned to ashes,

663
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:38,444
I'd still recognize her.

664
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,300
Bring them in.

665
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,340
Come in.

666
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,900
Such a good baby.

667
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,740
Look at those long lashes.

668
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,140
So fair and chubby.

669
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,140
You're such a sweet baby.

670
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,555
Not just anyone can handle that.

671
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:09,350
So adorable.

672
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,180
Are you looking for a nanny?

673
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,660
I've looked after many kids.

674
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,520
So kids naturally take to me.

675
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,700
I'm used to living here.

676
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,100
I don't want to move.

677
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,940
It's her!

678
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,700
It's her!

679
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,060
It's her!

680
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,620
That's her!

681
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,520
Where did she sell my Xiaoguang off to?

682
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,320
That's her!

683
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,622
Please calm down, Lawyer Sun.

684
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,180
Let us handle it.

685
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,340
Just confirm, was it number six?

686
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,580
My Xiaoguang...

687
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
Xiaoguang...

688
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:48,460
Give me back my Xiaoguang...

689
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,340
Give me back my Xiaoguang...

690
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,380
Officer,

691
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,860
I've told you everything I know.

692
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,460
All that bad stuff
was done by Huang Chuan.

693
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,620
Why won't you believe me?

694
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,860
Hong Jinfeng.

695
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,300
What were you doing

696
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:17,533
on September 18th, 1998?

697
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,180
1998...

698
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,860
How should I know
what I was doing back then?

699
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,820
It'd be a miracle

700
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,980
if I could remember that.

701
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,300
You were working as a nanny

702
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,100
around that time, right?

703
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,740
Yes.

704
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,460
I did work as a nanny.

705
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,180
Let me remind you,

706
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,060
you worked for a lawyer's family,

707
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,580
and you took their little boy away.

708
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,660
Didn't you?

709
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:43,900
No.

710
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,030
I swear I never did that.

711
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,500
The lawyer identified you.

712
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,100
He said it was you.

713
00:32:50,044 --> 00:32:51,260
So just because he said so,

714
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,180
it must be true?

715
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,860
What if he's mistaken?

716
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,660
I've always been a decent, honest nanny.

717
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,340
Really.

718
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,540
I've never done anything like that.

719
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,500
Officer,

720
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,620
you know better than I do.

721
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:07,644
You need evidence to accuse someone.

722
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,820
You can't frame an innocent person.

723
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,460
I really didn't do any of that.

724
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,620
Take a look at these people
in the photo.

725
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,711
Do they look familiar?

726
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,780
Do you know who they are?

727
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,060
No idea.

728
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,380
Really?

729
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,660
They're your parents and your brothers,

730
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,000
and you don't know them?

731
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,020
If you don't,

732
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,620
why did you keep the photo?

733
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,340
Is it because

734
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,440
it helps you remember

735
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,100
everything you went through?

736
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,340
Is that why you've kept it
all these years?

737
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,740
Hong Jinfeng,

738
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,820
our team has already visited

739
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,420
Yalu Village, Linping County.

740
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,060
We met your family.

741
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,380
You got in touch with them?

742
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,220
We found your younger brother.

743
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,140
What did he say about me?

744
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,620
He said

745
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,822
you've been dead for years.

746
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,140
Dead?

747
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,500
Yes.

748
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,070
That Hong Jinfeng

749
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,260
died a long time ago.

750
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,060
Hong Jinfeng,

751
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,500
do you resent your parents?

752
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,980
You hate them

753
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,530
because they favored their sons

754
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,220
and never treated you fairly.

755
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,100
You hate them

756
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,140
because they never

757
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,780
saw you as their daughter.

758
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,780
They never

759
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,540
treated you like one of their own.

760
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,050
So you channeled all your hatred

761
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,220
into taking revenge
on those innocent children.

762
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,940
You kidnapped so many kids.

763
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:51,419
You tore them from their families

764
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,333
and ruined their lives.

765
00:34:52,355 --> 00:34:54,111
Do you know how many families
you destroyed?

766
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:01,940
Everyone.

767
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,900
Hong Jinfeng is starting to crack.

768
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:05,109
But Huang Chuan's confession

769
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,980
and Lawyer Sun's identification
aren't enough.

770
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,360
We're still missing key evidence.

771
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,060
So,

772
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,140
Yan Lei and Ai Xin,
go back to her old home.

773
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,022
See if there's anything new to be found.

774
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:13,980
Got it.

775
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,460
Okay.

00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:51,300
(Family Portrait, 1970)

777
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,340
Anything?

(Award Certificate: 1st Prize
in Essay Contest, Hong Jinfeng)

780
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,380
Yan Lei,

781
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,820
I think we've found
Madam Hong's gold stash.

782
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,340
But what's that stuff

783
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,700
underneath the gold?

784
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,340
At the scene, we found

785
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,480
children's clothing.

786
00:37:04,177 --> 00:37:05,030
Upon verification,

787
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,933
they're linked to several
trafficking cases.

788
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,470
Judging by how worn they are,

789
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,260
these crimes span a long period.

790
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,100
The clothing spans roughly

791
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,700
thirty years.

792
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:20,000
Additionally,

793
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,180
the clothes have clear
local characteristics.

794
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,380
It suggests her activities

795
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,155
were centered around Nanjie
and nearby areas.

796
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,380
Besides children's clothes,

797
00:37:30,822 --> 00:37:33,200
we also found a large amount of
gold jewelry at the scene.

798
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,780
Based on Huang Chuan's interrogation,

799
00:37:36,022 --> 00:37:38,260
every time Hong Jinfeng succeeded
in abducting a child,

800
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,020
she would use the money
to buy gold jewelry.

801
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,300
But she never wore them herself.

802
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,720
Instead, she put them together
with the victims' clothes

803
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,740
and hid them away.

804
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,980
This behavior is very abnormal.

805
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,180
It shows that abducting children

806
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,933
gave Hong Jinfeng
a sense of satisfaction.

807
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,740
She collected these clothes

808
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,060
as trophies.

809
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,980
A twisted mind.

810
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,540
Based on this pattern,

811
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,100
we brought in metal detectors.

812
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,060
We've been scanning the old house

813
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,100
and surrounding areas around the clock.

814
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,860
So far, we've found
43 pieces of clothing

815
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,820
and the same number of gold items.

816
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,300
So there are 43 victims?

817
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,220
Maybe more.

818
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,940
The investigation isn't over yet.

819
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,180
She might have other hideouts.

820
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,000
How's the interrogation of Hong Jinfeng?

821
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,740
From what we know,

822
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,180
Hong Jinfeng only did the abductions.

823
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,630
She wasn't involved afterward.

824
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,500
She's only admitting to three cases.

825
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,180
She still doesn't know what we've found.

826
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,020
In any case,

827
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:42,980
this lead

828
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,140

Sit down.

838
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,060
Will she drag us down with her?

839

Madam Hong's never met me.

840
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,220
Fei Yan always handled the contact.

841
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,420
She can't trace it to me.

842
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:16,820
But

843
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,940
we still need to be careful.

844
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,460
Look,

845
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,500

got caught.

853

But we still need

854
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,933
an overseas contract
before we can start operations.

855
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:42,020
Otherwise, even if we recruit workers,

856
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,470

00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,260
