Are you happy?

195
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Of course

196
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are the leader

197
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and you have done your job

198
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You must be happy, right?

199
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
In fact, these achievements

200
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
are all the credit of the team

201
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
They are all excellent

202
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
They helped me a lot

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And the monitoring has been increasing

204
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
to form an invisible network

205
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
to let criminals hide

206
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Look, look

207
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The person who became the leader

208
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
speaks one by one

209
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yan Yan, those things

210
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't talk about your parents

211
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Even I am proud of it

212
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Before Ding Shun

213
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
he asked me about the little girl

214
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The officer Deng on TV

215
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You are relatives

216
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And they all screamed

217
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I think it's a woman's glory

218
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Sister-in-law

219
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
How do you know

220
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
that Tong Yuan has no money?

221
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We didn't want you to know about this

222
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In fact, Ding Shun

223
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
has always had a charity project

224
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Dad and aunt

225
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
told us about Aunt Zhang

226
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Your brother was interested

227
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't tell you

228
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I didn't want you to be burdened

229
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This time

230
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
we only got some money

231
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We can't solve any practical problems

232
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I think

233
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
it's better to change the small team

234
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
to a more formal place

235
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We are trying to meet with

236
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the charity organization

237
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
that Xun Zi went home

238
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
to see if they can

239
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
put the small team together

240
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
In this way

241
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
we can solve the problem of the site

242
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and give them

243
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
some minimum income

244
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What's this?

245
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Is it a good thing?

246
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, sister-in-law

247
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can tell me more about it later

248
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm glad you're here

249
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you, sister-in-law

250
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You're welcome

251
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We are family

252
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay?

253
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Cheers

254
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I have told Xun Zi

255
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
that they agreed

256
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
to work with Tong Yuan

257
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You can be volunteers there

258
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and get paid

259
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Really?

260
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Of course

261
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I came for this

262
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I wanted to

263
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
tell Mr. Sun about it

264
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
but I didn't get through

265
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
the phone call

266
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mr. Sun

267
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
has a lot of legal experience

268
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He can be the

269
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
person in charge of this

270
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
charity

271
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Do you have any

272
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
wishes?

273
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Would you like to go there?

274
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Of course

275
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Liu and I are old

276
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and slow in learning things

277
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We don't know how to use computers

278
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
They...

279
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
They will want us

280
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't worry

281
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is a charity organization

282
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They will give you

283
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
a position

284
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
that suits you

285
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
according to your strengths

286
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes

287
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They have to eat

288
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If not, I will continue

289
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
to be my cook

290
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's good to have something to do

291
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and get paid

292
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Then

293
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
should we

294
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
separate?

295
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Here's the thing

296
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't worry about it

297
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We will tell them

298
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
when you go there

299
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You can work together

300
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
so that you can

301
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
take care of each other

302
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Of course

303
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay

304
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm willing to go

305
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay

306
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
When Mrs. Zhang comes back

307
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
we will share

308
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the good news with her

309
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay

310
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
She's coming

311
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Mrs. Zhang

312
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Mrs. Zhang

313
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Director Deng said

314
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
we should go to a better place

315
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
with a charity organization

316
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
that calls Xun Zi home

317
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's good

318
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You can go

319
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We mean

320
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Mrs. Zhang

321
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
we should go together

322
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I won't go

323
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I will stay here

324
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I won't leave

325
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
the small club

326
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Ms. Zhang

327
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's okay

328
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I will talk to her

329
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Mrs. Zhang

330
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Mrs. Zhang

331
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well

332
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The club

333
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and Xun Zi

334
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
are going to get married

335
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and have children

336
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's good for the club

337
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and Xun Zi to go home

338
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's good for the club

339
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yanyan

340
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I appreciate your kindness

341
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But

342
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't want to go

343
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm used to living here

344
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't want to move

345
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't want to go

346
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I will stay here

347
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, Mrs. Zhang

348
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Look

349
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The rent is rising

350
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
If we can

351
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
get along with Xun Zi

352
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
we can save

353
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the rent

354
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can sell the old house

355
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and I can get the rent

356
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
No

357
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
If you sell the house

358
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
where will you live?

359
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't have a place to live

360
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Anyway

361
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't want to go

362
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Mrs. Zhang

363
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Mrs. Zhang

364
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Do you have something

365
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
you don't want to tell me?

366
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yanyan

367
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Look

368
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's been more than 20 years

369
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Everything has changed

370
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You may forget

371
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
the mall across from us

372
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It used to be a small store

373
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The park next to it

374
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
is a five-story building

375
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's been demolished

376
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
everywhere around here

377
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But only this rice powder store

378
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It was built here

379
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
when you were kids

380
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is also the place

381
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
where you and Yanyan

382
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
like to play

383
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yanyan

384
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
was lost

385
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
in the place

386
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
where you and Yanyan

387
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
used to live

388
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
After Yanyan was lost

389
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I took this store

390
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
down

391
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If I move away

392
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
this place

393
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
may be demolished

394
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
like other places

395
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
After Yanyan came back

396
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
she didn't know

397
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
where she was

398
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
She

399
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
couldn't go home

400
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Anyway

401
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll wait here

402
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
wherever I go

403
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
When Yanyan comes back

404
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'll cook her

405
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
her favorite rice powder

406
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
sweet and sour carrot

407
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and spicy beef jerky

408
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll wait here

409
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
wherever I go

410
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll wait here

411
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
wherever I go

412
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll cook her

413
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
her favorite rice powder

414
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
sweet and sour carrot

415
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and spicy beef jerky

416
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll wait here

417
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
wherever I go

418
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll wait here

419
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
wherever I go

420
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'll wait here

421
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
wherever I go

422
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll wait here

423
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
wherever I go

424
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'll wait here

425
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
wherever I go

426
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll wait here

427
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
wherever I go

428
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll wait here

429
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
wherever I go

430
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll wait here

431
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
wherever I go

432
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll wait here

433
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yangyang

434
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Wait a second

435
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'll find you very soon

436
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I will find you soon.

437
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We have been looking for you for more than 20 years.

438
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Chen Feng Mao,

439
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
was in the hospital in July 10, 2005.

440
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Li Shu Yan,

441
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
was in the hospital in April 28, 2002.

442
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Qing Luo Zhen,

443
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Lin Jun Xuan,

444
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
was in the hospital on September 2, 1996.

445
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Zhao Qi Hong,

446
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
was in the hospital on July 24, 1994.

447
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
was in the hospital on July 24, 1994.

448
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And this girl,

449
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
do you still remember her?

450
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't know her.

451
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You thought you could get over it without saying anything?

452
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You thought you could get over it without saying anything?

453
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This is the girl in the photo.

454
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The person who betrayed her is you.

455
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
This?

456
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I remember this.

457
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You are joking.

458
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Didn't I

459
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
send that girl back?

460
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You are fooling around and taking 300 yuan from her.

461
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You misunderstood.

462
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
How about I return her?

463
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I will ask you now, do you admit it or not?

464
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I...

465
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Do you remember Luo Xiao Yu?

466
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't know her.

467
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Where is Sun Xiao Guang?

468
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This?

469
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I am not the person you are looking for.

470
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You got the wrong person.

471
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I am just a farmer.

472
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I am just a poor man

473
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
who works in the city.

474
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I just walk around

475
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
when I enter the mountain.

476
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I didn't expect to be

477
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
trapped by a wild boar.

478
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Fortunately, you saved me.

479
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Otherwise,

480
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I would have died.

481
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I wanted to thank you

482
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and give you

483
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
a banner.

484
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But I didn't expect

485
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
to be locked here.

486
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I am wronged.

487
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I am wronged.

488
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Are you done?

489
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Officer,

490
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I don't know what you are talking about.

491
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I don't even know

492
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
the person in the photo.

493
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
How is it?

494
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't know.

495
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Even the case of She Qing Ling

496
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
she doesn't admit that she did it.

497
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What if she doesn't admit it?

498
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's okay.

499
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Even if she doesn't admit it,

500
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
she has to sign on the lipstick.

501
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We can use this signature

502
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
to make a comparison.

503
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
As long as the handwriting she left

504
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
is the same as the handwriting of She Qing Ling's son,

505
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
she can't deny it.

506
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Let's knock down the case of She Qing Ling's son first.

507
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Send this to the technology department.

508
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Okay.

509
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Brother Gang.

510
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I didn't ask you to come.

511
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Why are you here again?

512
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If you have something to say, say it.

513
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Why are you so angry again?

514
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm angry because

515
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I didn't see you.

516
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What are you afraid of?

517
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You are so careful

518
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
and careful.

519
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
My business is almost over.

520
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm still in the mood to laugh.

521
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If you have something to say, say it.

522
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Just earn money.

523
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Just talk to the girl.

524
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You are talking about a girl.

525
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The police are chasing her.

526
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
How can I talk to the girl?

527
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's because you are watching her closely.

528
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What do you mean?

529
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I have a way.

530
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Brother Gang, do you want to hear it?

531
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What the hell do you have?

532
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Our business is not easy to do in China.

533
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We can just stay in China.

534
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We only recruit workers.

535
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
As for where they go after they leave the country,

536
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
it's up to them.

537
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Can you do it?

538
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Of course.

539
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Don't say it.

540
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This is a good idea.

541
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Those police are still in the country.

542
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Who can think of my business?

543
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
They are still looking for a job.

544
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I think

545
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
women are the most vicious.

546
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Women are cruel.

547
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
They are not as bad as men.

548
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I like you.

549
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You are cruel.

550
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I saw you from the first sight.

551
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I know you are different from those stupid women.

552
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You and Brother Gang are the same.

553
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I hate you.

554
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Wang Chuan, nicknamed Old Huang Gou.

555
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Born on August 12, 1953.

556
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
He is from the village of Pangge, Lingshan.

557
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
He left Lingshan at the age of 27.

558
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He went to the Xinying province.

559
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He was a criminal suspect

560
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
in many provincial cases.

561
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He was a criminal suspect in many cases.

562
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He was over 50 years old.

563
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He was drunk.

564
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
He was a middle-class person.

565
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He was a little grumpy.

566
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The most obvious sign is

567
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
that there is a mole on his face.

568
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Through the model characteristics

569
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
that Wang Wangqing, the criminal, gave us,

570
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
we caught Wang Chuan by accident

571
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
in the small town on the south side of Shangruishan.

572
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Don't move.

573
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You are Old Huang Gou.

574
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Although Snake Qinglin didn't call the police in time,

575
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
he brought a problem to our investigation.

576
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But his wife secretly left

577
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
evidence of Wang Chuan's crime.

578
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Jia Jia.

579
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Everyone,

580
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
this is Tang Hulu found at the crime scene.

581
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Through the surveillance of the crime scene,

582
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
we found that this object

583
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
was used by the suspect to kidnap the child.

584
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The technical department is trying to remove the fingerprint from it.

585
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Tong Tong.

586
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
In addition, there is a police note

587
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
that is being written.

588
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Because the time of the case is relatively late,

589
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
the police department doesn't have any rules.

590
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So the technical department needs some time

591
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
to get these evidence.

592
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Once the fingerprint and note are from Wang Chuan,

593
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
then the evidence chain of these cases can be changed.

594
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
We can sue Wang Chuan.

595
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
We also have time to dig up

596
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
his historical records and related clues.

597
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Everyone,

598
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Wang Chuan's death

599
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
is the stage result of our Ninshan

600
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
to take the special action.

601
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
My attitude is one.

602
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
If you can't do it, don't relax and continue digging.

603
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The police are looking for Wang Chuan.

604
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Hurry up and find out who Wang Chuan is.

605
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
If you find anything, report it at any time.

606
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yes.

607
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Let's go eat.

608
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Director.

609
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's like a thing.

610
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Wang Chuan didn't get any information?

611
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I think he's not crying because he didn't see the coffin.

612
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Old people like Wang Chuan

613
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
are really hard to catch.

614
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
He's waiting for the money.

615
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's what Director Yin said.

616
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That's right. The technical department just said

617
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
that the identification result will come out soon.

618
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The sooner you get the answer, the more anxious you are.

619
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm going to the technical department.

620
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Brother Rui, you...

621
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You're not eating?

622
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's delicious.

623
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Where are you going? You're eating.

624
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Did you eat?

625
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I ate.

626
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
How is it?

627
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Should we have the result today?

628
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The result of the handwriting identification is out.

629
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It proves that the note was written by him.

630
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The most important thing is that the DNA fingerprint is matched.

631
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And his DNA

632
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
is also matched with the DNA found in the hair

633
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
found in Hong Yi's room.

634
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Jin Ping is right. They are a pair.

635
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
How about it?

636
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
After you finish eating, we'll go to the trial.

637
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Don't worry.

638
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Don't wait for him.

639
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Let him think about it.

640
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
We still have a king card that's useless.

641
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Sister Xin.

642
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm really sorry to keep you waiting.

643
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's okay. I think you're too comfortable here.

644
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You have to face them every day.

645
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
How comfortable is that?

646
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Isn't it all thanks to Uncle Yin?

647
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
If he hadn't recommended

648
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
that I learn pet petting,

649
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I probably wouldn't have done anything.

650
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yin said

651
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
that you're capable of it.

652
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You have to work hard.

653
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Oh, Sister Xin.

654
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
What are you looking for me for today?

655
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The person who was

656
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
in charge of you

657
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
has been exposed.

658
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Meiyue.

659
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Do you remember what he looks like?

660
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
We need you to identify him.

661
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Look at the work.

662
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Boss, look at the work.

663
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Boss, look at the work.

664
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Boss, what kind of work do you do?

665
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The service worker at the washing bowl.

666
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Miss.

667
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Can you do it by looking at the child?

668
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I can do it.

669
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Boss, I can do it.

670
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I have experience with children.

671
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Boss, pick me.

672
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I have experience with three children.

673
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Get in the car.

674
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Look.

675
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
The youngest one is gone.

676
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Sit tight.

677
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm sorry.

678
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm sorry.

679
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm sorry.

680
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm sorry.

681
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm sorry.

682
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm sorry.

683
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm sorry.

684
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm sorry.

685
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm sorry.

686
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm sorry.

687
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm sorry.

688
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm sorry.

689
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm sorry.

690
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm sorry.

691
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm sorry.

692
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
As long as you're obedient,

693
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
stop talking back.

694
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm sorry.

695
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Mei Yu.

696
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
Are you ready?

697
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Don't be afraid.

698
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Let's go.

699
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Can we start?

700
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Bring her in.

701
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Look at this.

702
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Can you see clearly?

703
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Let's go and see.

704
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Don't worry.

705
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Look.

706
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Take off your head.

707
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Mei Yu.

708
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Do you recognize him?

709
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
He is Wu Hang.

710
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
He is...

711
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
Wu Hung.

712
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,840
programs

713
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
of

714
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,880
We're going to have a talk.

715
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
Okay.

716
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,040
Wu display

717
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Hanging is the

718
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
radar

719
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,520
ASHLEY

720
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,920
Okay.

721
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,200
Have some water.

722
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,160
You performed great tonight.

723
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,820
Thank you.

724
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,820
I can't forget those things for the rest of my life.

725
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,820
They hit me,

726
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,820
and forced me.

727
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,820
All these years,

728
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,820
I've always wanted to forget myself.

729
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,820
But,

730
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,820
even in my dreams,

731
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,820
I can't forget them.

732
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,820
Even in my dreams,

733
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,820
I can't forget his face,

734
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,820
and those things.

735
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,820
Don't be afraid. It's all in the past.

736
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
Mei Yu,

737
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,820
listen to me.

738
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,820
If you feel uncomfortable, don't hold back.

739
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,820
Cry it out.

740
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,820
Crying will make you feel better.

741
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,820
No.

742
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,820
I won't cry.

743
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,820
He's the one who should cry.

744
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,820
Before I met him,

745
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,820
I thought I would be very scared.

746
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,820
But when I just recognized him,

747
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,820
I'm not afraid of him anymore.

748
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,820
He's the one who's left me.

749
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,820
He's been caught.

750
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,820
I'm not afraid of him anymore.

751
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,820
We're not afraid of him.

752
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,820
Do you know how brave you were when you were inside?

753
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,820
You not only helped us to help Zhiyuan and Huang Chuan,

754
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,820
but also helped many victims.

755
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,820
I want to thank you on their behalf.

756
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,820
You're great.

757
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,820
It's all in the past.

758
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,820
Someone's going to die!

759
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,820
Someone's going to die!

760
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,820
It hurts!

761
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,820
Go find a doctor.

762
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,820
It hurts so much.

763
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,820
Go find a doctor.

764
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,820
Someone's going to die!

765
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,820
Is it cold enough?

766
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,820
It's almost done.

767
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,820
The coffin is almost closed.

768
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,820
It's not destroyed yet.

769
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,820
This girl's name is Ruan Meiyu.

770
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,820
I showed you a picture yesterday.

771
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,820
You said you didn't know her.

772
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,820
But just now, she recognized you.

773
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,820
You don't remember her, but she will remember you for the rest of your life.

774
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,820
You're over fifty now.

775
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,820
Think about it.

776
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,820
How many people and families did you destroy in your previous life?

777
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,820
Some of the people you kidnapped have died.

778
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,820
Some of them may still be alive.

779
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,820
How many families did you make disappear?

780
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,820
Don't tell me you don't remember.

781
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,820
Fifty years old should go to heaven.

782
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,820
Your destiny is to be punished by law.

783
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,820
This is evidence of the case of She Qinglin.

784
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,820
After confirmation, it's the same as your handwriting.

785
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,820
And the surveillance at the scene.

786
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,820
You can't run away at all.

787
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,820
Take it.

788
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,820
You heard the sound at the scene.

789
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,820
You ran away with the child.

790
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,820
Congcong.

791
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,820
But you didn't notice that you dropped a candy pot.

792
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,820
She Qinglin didn't call the police at that time.

793
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,820
But they left this object.

794
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,820
There are your fingerprints on it.

795
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,820
You must be thinking how we found She Qinglin.

796
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,820
Right?

797
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,820
Wang Guangqing.

798
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,820
He told us everything.

799
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,820
He told us your appearance.

800
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,820
It's been 20 years.

801
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,820
It's the first time we know what you look like.

802
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,820
Wang Guangqing also told us a very important information.

803
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,820
He said you knew Hongyi.

804
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,820
What Hongyi?

805
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,820
You don't just know him.

806
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,820
I don't know him.

807
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,820
He said you were a couple.

808
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,820
Brother dog.

809
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,820
It seems that you have met your true love.

810
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,820
We have been living together for 20 years.

811
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,820
Hongyi is also a habit of a foreign population.

812
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,820
We found her long-term rental house.

813
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,820
We found some hair in it.

814
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,820
After DNA comparison,

815
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,820
these hair belongs to you.

816
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,820
Since you have evidence,

817
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,820
then you are afraid.

818
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,820
I did all these things alone.

819
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,820
I know you a little.

820
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,820
You are a smart person in your circle.

821
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,820
You are also a smart person.

822
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,820
Why are you so stupid?

823
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,820
Why are you deceived by a woman?

824
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,820
Who said that?

825
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,820
Stop talking.

826
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,820
Qingpi has said it.

827
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,820
Hongyi ran away with your money.

828
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,820
You left alone and took all the responsibility.

829
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,820
I tell you.

830
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,820
What you and Hongyi did,

831
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,820
if you don't confess,

832
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,820
we will report you to the procurator.

833
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,820
Hongyi is really a good person.

834
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,820
He did bad things all his life.

835
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,820
He even found a man who is loyal.

836
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,820
Don't say anything.

837
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,820
Okay, we will go first.

838
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,820
We will talk later.

839
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,820
Wait.

840
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,820
Wait.

841
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,820
Officer.

842
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,820
I really don't know where he went.

843
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,820
But I still remember those people I blamed.

844
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,820
I tell you.

845
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,820
Where are they?

846
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,820
I will go.

847
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,820
This...

848
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,820
I remember.

849
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,820
Yang Caiyun was kidnapped when he was 16 years old.

850
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,820
He was sold to the subordinate of Wushen County by Huang Chuan.

851
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,820
Yang Caiyun.

852
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,820
Born on June 14, 1974.

853
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,820
From Wujia Village in Shuangjing County, Linshan City.

854
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,820
On August 3, 1990.

855
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,820
He was kidnapped in the farm market in Shuangjing County.

856
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,820
Why are you so familiar?

857
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,820
This is the first case I have ever taken in a case of kidnapping.

858
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,820
Although many cases have been broken in the middle.

859
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,820
But I haven't found Yang Caiyun.

860
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,820
What about his parents?

861
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,820
How are they now?

862
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,820
His parents are gone.

863
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,820
It's a pity.

864
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,820
His parents didn't even see their own daughter when they were dying.

865
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,820
I remember his parents kneeled in front of us and begged us.

866
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,820
No matter how we find their own daughter.

867
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,820
This case is like a thorn.

868
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,820
It has been stuck in my heart.

869
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,820
Zhang Anni.

870
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,820
Zhang Anni.

871
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,820
Look at the photos on the wall.

872
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,820
They are getting fewer and fewer.

873
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,820
Are you happy?

874
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,820
Yes.

875
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,820
Cai Qi.

876
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,820
Seeing their family reunion.

877
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,820
I am so happy.

878
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,820
If our family comes back.

879
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,820
It will be more lively.

880
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,820
Yes.

881
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,820
Their family reunites.

882
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,820
We...

883
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,820
Yes.

884
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,820
It's so good.

885
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,820
I don't know how my son is doing.

886
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,820
Is he with someone else?

887
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,820
It's all my fault.

888
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,820
I won't talk about this.

889
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,820
Mei Tian.

890
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,820
We need to have faith.

891
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,820
Look at this big monster.

892
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,820
He is so big.

893
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,820
He is so big.

894
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,820
He is so big.

895
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,820
He is so big.

896
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,820
He is so big.

897
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,820
He is so big.

898
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,820
He is so big.

899
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,820
Look at this big monster.

900
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,820
He has done so many things.

901
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,820
He has found so many children.

902
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,820
We need to believe.

903
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,820
The day we reunite with your family.

904
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,820
It will come soon.

905
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,820
Yes.

906
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,820
I believe in you, Director Deng.

907
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,820
Look.

908
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,820
He is still in office.

909
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,820
He has solved several big cases.

910
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,820
He will definitely find our Xiaoyu.

911
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,820
Yes.

912
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,820
We need to have faith in our father.

913
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,820
We need to have faith in Director Deng.

914
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,820
We need to have faith.

915
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,820
Yes.

916
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,820
Come on.

917
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,820
Have hot pot.

918
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,820
Come on.

919
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,820
Hurry up.

920
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,820
Look at this small house.

921
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,820
It's lucky to have you.

922
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,820
It's so hard.

923
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,820
Hurry up and have hot pot.

924
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,820
Okay.

925
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,820
Eat.

926
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,820
Huangchuan told me.

927
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,820
He has turned over more than 30 children with Hongyi.

928
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,820
The information of the children has been sent to the Department of Civil Affairs.

929
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,820
Did Huangchuan tell you where Hongyi is?

930
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,820
He insisted that he didn't know.

931
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,820
What about Brother Que?

932
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,820
It's a little strange.

933
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,820
He told me.

934
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,820
Brother Que hasn't contacted him for many years.

935
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,820
He asked me if we caught Brother Que.

936
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,820
It's different from what Qingpi said.

937
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,820
Does he know Fei Yan?

938
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,820
He said he never heard of this name.

939
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,820
Is it possible that Brother Que is dead?

940
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,820
Someone called him and did something.

941
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,820
For example, Fei Yan.

942
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,820
It's possible.

943
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,820
The doctor said that Fei Yan can be tested.

944
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,820
All the connections are possible now.

945
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,820
It's related to Fei Yan.

946
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,820
But Fei Yan is missing again.

947
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,820
Brother Que doesn't know where to go when Fei Yan disappears.

948
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,820
Don't think so much.

949
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,820
Let's go to Wu Shunxian and the old man tomorrow.

950
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,820
You go first tomorrow.

951
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,820
I have to go home first.

952
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,820
See if there is any other way to cure him.

953
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,820
I'll come to you after I'm done.

954
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,820
Where do you think Brother Que will hide if he doesn't die?

955
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,820
After we received the criminal investigation report.

956
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,820
We immediately told the criminal suspect Huang Chansao.

957
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,820
We bought the location of Yang Caiming.

958
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,820
We did a search and confirmation.

959
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,820
There are 13 villages that are suitable for the crime.

960
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,820
We searched all 13 villages.

961
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,820
But we haven't found anyone who is related to Yang Caiming yet.

962
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,820
This is the case of Yang Caiming being kidnapped 20 years ago.

963
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,820
There was also a case of kidnapping of a woman and a child.

964
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:25,820
The beautiful person is waiting in the dark night

965
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:33,820
The brave person has a kind of identity

966
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,820
What doesn't change is the sincerity in the heart

967
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:45,820
Finally, I became such a person

968
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:51,820
Every number is a memory of youth

969
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:59,820
For love and hate, for the memory and this life

970
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:05,820
The eyes that are not attached

971
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:15,820
The way to the heaven has always been

972
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:22,820
The eyes that are fixed hold each other's hands

973
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:29,820
The softness of the blue sky is a dream

974
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:06,820
Just like my heart, it will never reach

975
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:15,820
The blue heart, it will never reach
