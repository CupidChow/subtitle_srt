1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The next one is the most difficult one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's a very difficult one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's a very difficult one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a very difficult one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a very difficult one.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Then it's useless to hold the science too deep.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If it's too deep, I don't know what to make of it.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,240
Did it work

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Did it work

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,540
The third background-

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,720
I'm going to the

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:51,780
I'm going to the

I'm going to the

I'm going to the

I'm going to the

27
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:53,420
I'm going to the

28
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:53,480
I'm going to the

29
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:53,520
I'm going to the

30
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:53,580
I'm going to the

31
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:53,620
I'm going to the

32
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:53,680
I'm going to the

33
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:53,720
I'm going to the

34
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:53,780
I'm going to the

35
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:53,880
I'm going to the

36
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:53,920
I'm going to the

37
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:53,980
I'm going to the

38
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,020
I'm going to the

39
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,080
I'm going to the

40
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,120
I'm going to the

41
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,180
I'm going to the

42
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,220
I'm going to the

43
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,380
Oh oh

44
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,180
I also get

45
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,460
We have solved three cases of human trafficking

46
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,000
These three cases are in Zhangjia Village

47
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,940
This is Hu Zihua

48
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,920
We solved three cases of human trafficking

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,320
Their family still lives in the village

50
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,180
Hu Zihua, don't be nervous

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,300
Aren't you the Baishi Dong in your village?

52
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,600
We are here today

53
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,300
Just want to find out some information

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,300
Twenty years ago

55
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,180
Have you seen a girl who is 16 or 17 years old in your village?

56
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,220
This is Zhang Hanzi's cousin

57
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,300
There is a beautiful mole in her eyebrows

58
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,300
This mole is quite good

59
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,620
Yes, this is her

60
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,540
Later, I went to find Zhang Hanzi

61
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,940
His door was locked

62
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,260
He and this girl are gone

63
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,060
Later, Zhang Hanzi returned to the village

64
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,580
But he was alone

65
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,060
I guess he didn't see her

66
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,460
So he ran away

67
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,060
Aunt, aunt

68
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,660
Be careful

69
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,540
You are here

70
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,460
Aunt, aunt

71
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,060
Sit down, sit down

72
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,380
Sit down

73
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,820
I'll get you some powder

74
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,300
No, I'll just sit down and leave

75
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,900
You are here

76
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,740
You are our great hero

77
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,300
I must get you some powder

78
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,060
Wait, it will be ready soon

79
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,500
You sit down, it will be ready soon

80
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,020
Be careful, aunt Zhang

81
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,940
Director Le, have some tea

82
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,020
Thank you

83
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,340
Come on, aunt Zhang

84
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,020
Come on

85
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,740
That's too much, I can't finish it

86
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,660
No, you can have more

87
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,860
Yanyan

88
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,580
You are our great hero

89
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,380
We really have to thank you

90
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,020
Just now, the people who came back from the trip

91
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,700
said they could come with us

92
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,620
Really?

93
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,500
Yes

94
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,140
We can stay in the small restaurant

95
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,580
and go to their place

96
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,180
I'm so happy to hear that

97
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,060
It's so noisy

98
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,500
Boss, give me a bowl of beef

99
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,980
I'll go to the restaurant

100
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,260
I'll go to the restaurant

101
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,340
I'll do it

102
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,780
Come on, sit down

103
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,380
Come on, sit here

104
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,940
Director Cao

105
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,660
This is Zhang Hanzi, the famous Director Zhang

106
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,260
51 years old, married before

107
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,580
Now he is working in Shuanglin County

108
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,420
Give me a piece of the tissue

109
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,820
No

110
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,060
Oh

111
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,980
Did he put salt in the old spoon?

112
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,460
No

113
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,060
Almost forgot

114
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,540
Um

115
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,540
She threw up

116
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
Beef powder

117
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,540
It's not spicy to drink

118
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,540
You can have more

119
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,500
You can add spicy soup

120
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
I'm done.

121
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
You're done? That's great.

122
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
I'll have to make less next time.

123
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Boss!

124
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
This is too salty.

125
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
This is too...

126
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
This is too salty.

127
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
It's too salty?

128
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
How come?

129
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Taste it yourself.

130
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
I'll make you another bowl right away.

131
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm not eating it.

132
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
It's free.

133
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
I'll make you a bowl for free.

134
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
I won't eat the free ones.

135
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Boss,

136
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
this situation of yours

137
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
is not the first time.

138
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Forget it. I'm not eating it.

139
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I'm leaving.

140
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm leaving.

141
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm sorry.

142
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
I'm sorry.

143
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Boss,

144
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
take care.

145
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
This...

146
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Seriously...

147
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
How come you're doing this?

148
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
It's okay, Auntie.

149
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
It's okay.

150
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
I'm old.

151
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
I'm really old.

152
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Director Duan,

153
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
I want to tell you about

154
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Auntie Zhang's situation.

155
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
It's just that she's been...

156
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
I don't know what's wrong with her.

157
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
She's been acting strange.

158
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
It's like this happened

159
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
several times today.

160
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Yesterday,

161
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
when she was counting the bill,

162
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
she miscalculated a few points.

163
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
And yesterday,

164
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
when she was marinating the rock sugar and radish,

165
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
she forgot to put in the vinegar.

166
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
She was so confused.

167
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
She was so confused.

168
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
She was so confused.

169
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Last night,

170
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
she was the last person to lock the door.

171
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
And she forgot to lock the door.

172
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
I came here this morning and saw the door was locked.

173
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
I was so scared.

174
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
What do you think I should do?

175
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
How about this?

176
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,500
I'll take Auntie Zhang to the hospital

177
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
and do another examination.

178
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I'll go to the hospital and see if she's okay.

179
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Okay.

180
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I'll go with you.

181
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Okay.

182
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Okay.

183
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Okay.

184
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Okay.

185
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,100
I suggest you take Aunt Zhang to the hospital for a check-up.

186
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,500
Go to the hospital?

187
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,740
Is it that serious?

188
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,500
Not that serious.

189
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,500
But the old man is getting older.

190
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,260
We should do more tests

191
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,300
to see if there are any other changes in his body.

192
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,860
Don't worry.

193
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,460
Yes, you are right.

194
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,380
What are you doing in there?!

195
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,340
I'm not gonna cook at all!

196
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,520
If you die, you will kill me

197
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,400
Lead a household to a meal

198
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,320
With a 친구로 배 laptandy

199
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,220
You'll change the 2 blessings

200
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,760
I'll forget that you love you

201
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,680
I'll treat you with kindness

202
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,820
Like the love from Yuı

203
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,680
I'll remember, there's nocake

204
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
You know him?

205
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Yes

206
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Do you know him?

207
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,680
Isn't this Zhang Laohan?

208
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Please go find him

209
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,680
He's in the bus. I'll go call him

210
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Zhang Laohan

211
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Zhang Laohan

212
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Zhang Laohan

213
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Assistant Zhang, right?

214
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
Do you know this person?

215
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
Yes

216
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
Where is he?

217
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
I've been looking for him for 20 years

218
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
What do you mean? Tell me the truth

219
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,680
20 years ago, I spent 1000 yuan to buy him

220
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
But he was cheated by someone

221
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
You're awake, sister

222
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Don't be afraid

223
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
I'm your man

224
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Let's have a meal

225
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Don't shout

226
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Don't shout

227
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Let's have a meal

228
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Let's have a meal

229
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Okay?

230
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
Brother

231
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
Please let me go

232
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Please let me go

233
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,680
Brother, you're a good man

234
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Please let me go

235
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
I beg you

236
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
Please let me go

237
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
I beg you

238
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
I bought it

239
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Please let me go

240
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
I beg you

241
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
Let's have a meal

242
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
You'll starve to death if you buy it

243
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Brother, I bought it

244
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Help

245
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,680
I've said it

246
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Don't shout

247
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
Help

248
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Because I was a money-lender and a man

249
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,680
I regretted it when I broke up with her

250
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
She was so pretty

251
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
She was so young

252
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
How could I be with her?

253
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
I was thinking

254
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,680
If she smiled at me, how pretty she would be

255
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
Don't make a mess

256
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Tell me the point

257
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,680
The point is, the seller said

258
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,680
As long as the time is long, she'll be obedient

259
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,680
But she didn't eat a bite

260
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
I'm sorry

261
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Don't shout, okay?

262
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
What do you want to eat?

263
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
I'll cook whatever you want

264
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,680
I...

265
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
I can't let you go

266
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,680
I've bought you back as my wife

267
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
They can't return the money to me

268
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,680
I've borrowed all the money I could remember to buy you

269
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,680
But you didn't eat a bite

270
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,680
If you starve to death, I'll spend all my money

271
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
I'm sorry

272
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,680
I didn't mean to hit you

273
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,680
Eat something

274
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
If you don't eat, I...

275
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,680
I'll buy you a meal

276
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
That's a human disease

277
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
I spent money on it

278
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
What if I starve to death?

279
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
Where is she now?

280
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
I don't know

281
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Xu Tanglong tricked her for 20 years

282
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
I can't find her

283
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
Who is Xu Tanglong?

284
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
A...

285
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
A... a seller

286
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
Hello

287
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Come again

288
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Brother Zhang

289
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
What did you buy today?

290
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Did you get any new goods?

291
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
This one

292
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
This one is the best

293
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,680
You bought clothes and hairpins recently

294
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
Is there any good news?

295
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
No good news

296
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
What good news?

297
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,680
You bought a wife?

298
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Yes

299
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
It seems to be true

300
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
Who told you?

301
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
No one

302
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,680
I guessed

303
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Take a look

304
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
Is it really good?

305
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
Nothing good

306
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Take a look

307
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Let's go

308
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
I'm buying things

309
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
I'll send it to you later

310
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
Haven't you seen a woman?

311
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,680
No

312
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
Why are you so annoying?

313
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Annoying?

314
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,680
I'm so annoying

315
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
Liu Shu, show me your hair

316
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
I don't see anything

317
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,680
It's almost done

318
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
It's not over yet

319
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
I have to go

320
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,680
You go

321
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
Bye

322
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
Bye

323
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
Bye

324
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,680
Bye

325
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
Bye

326
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Bye

327
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
Bye

328
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,680
Bye

329
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Bye

330
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,680
Bye

331
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,680
Bye

332
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
Bye

333
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Bye

334
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Bye

335
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
Bye

336
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Bye

337
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Bye

338
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
Bye

339
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
Bye

340
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Bye

341
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,680
Bye

342
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
Bye

343
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,680
It's not over yet

344
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
Good, Zhang

345
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,680
This little girl looks so good

346
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,680
She wants to pay

347
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
I spent a lot of money

348
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
I see her like this

349
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
There is no air in it

350
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
I can't help it

351
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
I can't help it

352
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
I can't help it

353
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Zhang

354
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
I have something to discuss with you

355
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,680
Say it

356
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
You can't do it

357
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
You can't do it

358
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
How about this

359
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,680
I'll give it to your dad

360
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
You give it to me

361
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,680
I spent more than a day to buy it

362
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Why don't you know how to be a good person?

363
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
I'm helping you

364
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
Has he not eaten for a few days?

365
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,680
He has to go to the hospital

366
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
You can't get it

367
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
You have to go to jail

368
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Such a big man died in your place

369
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
The police are looking for you

370
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
Why don't people in this village talk about you?

371
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Think about it

372
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
OK

373
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
You don't want to, do you?

374
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
You can wait and be in jail

375
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Wait a minute

376
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
So you sold Yangcaoyun to Xu Tenglong, right?

377
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
I'm afraid he'll starve to death

378
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
You're afraid he'll starve to death

379
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,680
Or you're afraid your money will go to waste?

380
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
I received 800 yuan

381
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
When I went to Xu Tenglong

382
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
He didn't admit it

383
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
He said I was a businessman

384
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
He said if I called the police, he would arrest me first

385
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
I was wronged

386
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
I was really wronged

387
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Twenty years ago

388
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
Whether it's 800 or 1000

389
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
It's a lot of money

390
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
Can't you get married to someone with this money?

391
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
You have to do this illegal thing

392
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
I don't know it's illegal

393
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Our village does it

394
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,680
You said no one would marry in our village

395
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
I ask you

396
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Where is Xu Tenglong?

397
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
I don't know

398
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
When you sold him

399
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
You can find him

400
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Now you can't find him

401
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Do you know?

402
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
You ruined a girl's life

403
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
He was only sixteen years old

404
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
Director

405
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Xu Tenglong is good at business

406
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
He works hard

407
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
He sells goods on the street

408
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
He made a lot of money

409
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
He has been living here since he moved from Wushun County

410
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
As far as we know

411
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
He lives alone now

412
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,680
No one around

413
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
Xu Tenglong

414
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Tenglong, right?

415
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
We are from the Public Security Bureau

416
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
We want to investigate something with you

417
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
What's the situation?

418
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,680
You are talking here

419
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
You still want to talk inside?

420
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Please come in

421
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,680
Lead the way

422
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Please sit

423
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
I

424
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Officer

425
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
What are you investigating me for?

426
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,680
Did you make a mistake?

427
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
You can ask around

428
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
I am a good servant of Fenggong Shouha

429
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Do you know Yang Ziyun?

430
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
No

431
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Where is Assistant Zhang?

432
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Where is he?

433
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
I don't know him

434
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
He is from Zhang's Village in Wushun County

435
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Think about it

436
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Officer

437
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
I really don't know what you are talking about

438
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
What do you want to ask me today?

439
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
You really don't know him?

440
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
I really don't know him

441
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
I want to read something to you

442
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
My name is Zhang Zhongli

443
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
I am from Zhang's Village in Wushun County, Xinyang

444
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,680
I have confessed to the Public Security Bureau

445
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,680
and reported to Xu Tenglong

446
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
for selling his daughter

447
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,680
In October 1990

448
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,680
I bought a woman from a human trafficker

449
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
And half a month later

450
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,680
I sold her to Xu Tenglong

451
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
He used 800 yuan

452
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,680
to bury Yang Ziyun in my hands

453
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Do you remember?

454
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
You mean that woman?

455
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
I was from that

456
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Zhang, Zhang Laohan saved her

457
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Zhang Laohan was starving to death

458
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
When I came here

459
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,680
she started eating as soon as I told her

460
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Didn't you say you didn't know Zhang Zhongli?

461
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,680
How do you know her nickname is Zhang Laohan?

462
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
I just remembered it

463
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
The woman you bought is called Yang Ziyun

464
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Where is she?

465
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
She was not here

466
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
She ran away

467
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
Ran away?

468
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Explain it clearly

469
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
What's going on?

470
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,680
I really saved this woman from Zhang Laohan

471
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,680
I wanted to live a good life with her

472
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
But she didn't give birth

473
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
like a stone

474
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
I thought

475
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
it was not easy to make money at that time

476
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
If she can't give birth

477
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
I spent my money for nothing

478
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Coincidentally

479
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,680
I have a business partner called Liang...

480
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Liang...

481
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,680
Liang Wei, right, Liang Wei

482
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,680
He is really a man

483
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
I let him in

484
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,680
But he and that woman

485
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
I told him

486
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
I saw the green beans and it was right

487
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,680
I just followed the trend

488
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
and introduced it to him

489
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
How much did you sell?

490
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Not much

491
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
I bought it for 20,000 yuan

492
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
I bought it for 20,000 yuan

493
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
You are good at business

494
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Comrade Jin

495
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,680
You are wronging me

496
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
It's not a business

497
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
They are in love

498
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
I just signed a letter

499
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
At most, I will give it to the maid

500
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Right?

501
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
Well, don't talk so much

502
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Where is Liang Wei's family?

503
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,680
I only remember that place more than ten years ago

504
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
It's in...

505
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Huangjiagou, Hongxi City

506
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
I don't know it now

507
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
Ok, go to the police station with us

508
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,680
We will call you now

509
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
We need to investigate

510
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
No, comrade police

511
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
I have made it clear

512
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Why do you investigate me?

513
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,680
You are suspected of selling your daughter

514
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Go

515
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
I...

516
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,680
I am wronged

517
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
You...

518
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,680
I am wronged

519
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
Translate by Alex

520
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Aunt Zhang

521
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
I am back

522
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
Xiao Xing

523
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
So many things

524
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,680
You are welcome to come here tomorrow

525
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,680
And we still need to buy dumplings

526
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,680
Right

527
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Have you bought dumplings?

528
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
Did you buy the dumplings?

529
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,400
Yes

530
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
See? Is it enough?

531
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Yes, yes

532
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
It's so heavy. Put it on the back

533
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,400
I bought fruits and vegetables

534
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
One more thing

535
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
Xiaoxing

536
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
I forgot to tell you one more thing

537
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
That is

538
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
at the party

539
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,400
they all like the dumplings with the bean paste I made

540
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,120
I just bought them

541
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
You just asked me

542
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
My brain is

543
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
I'm going to cook now

544
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,120
I forget it when I have too much things

545
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
It's messy

546
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,120
Hello, Dr. Wang

547
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,120
I'm Luo Xiaoxing

548
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Well

549
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
I want to ask

550
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
Did you get the test report from Aunt Zhang?

551
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
What a silly girl

552
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
She just fell asleep when she arrived at the reception

553
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
She didn't even eat dinner

554
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Let her rest

555
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
We'll bring her some food later

556
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Do you have chili?

557
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,840
No, it's just right

558
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,840
You know, Yang Taiyun

559
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,840
I've been looking for him for almost 20 years

560
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,840
I don't have many 20s in my life

561
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
He just got a little bit of a beauty

562
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
He's not selling it to other places

563
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
So I heard about it today

564
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Yang Taiyun's case is really complicated now

565
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
If you can't stand it, tell me

566
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
I'll take a break from him first

567
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,560
I won't go back until I find Yang Taiyun

568
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,280
By the way

569
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
Han Che told me

570
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
He wants me to go back to Lingshan

571
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,280
I'll go back for a few days

572
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
If you need it, I'll come to you

573
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Deputy Director Yin

574
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Okay, I got it

575
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Okay, don't worry

576
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Don't worry

577
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's been a long night

578
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's too hard

579
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Do you want to go to the nearby hotel and have a rest?

580
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
No, no

581
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It's normal

582
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Deputy Director Yin is now

583
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
suspicious of Yang Taiyun

584
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,720
I've been looking for this case for almost 20 years

585
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
You're old

586
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
You're still working so hard

587
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
You've been waiting for 20 years

588
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
You're almost there

589
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Let's go for breakfast

590
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
No, no

591
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
You take a break first

592
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
How's the investigation going on here?

593
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
After receiving your call

594
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
We conducted an investigation overnight

595
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,720
We found Xu Teng's man called Liang Wei

596
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,400
And sent the photo to the Qingxi County

597
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
and the police

598
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
After Xu Teng's re-election

599
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Liang Wei is the one who bought Yang Taiyun

600
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
nine years ago

601
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Did you find Yang Taiyun?

602
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
It's too tight

603
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
We can only simply

604
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
investigate the information

605
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Liang Wei's wife is Wen Su Juan

606
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
She's the same age as you said

607
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Yang Taiyun

608
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
The time they got married

609
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
was exactly one year after Xu Teng's death

610
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,080
The time is also consistent

611
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,080
Wen Su Juan is not a local

612
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
We can't find any information

613
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
about her parents in the system

614
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,080
This is the certificate of Wen Su Juan

615
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Please verify it

616
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,080
Is there any other information about Wen Su Juan?

617
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
Oh, right

618
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
When they got married

619
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Wen Su Juan was pregnant

620
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Soon after the marriage

621
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
she had a daughter

622
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
called Liang Xiaoyun

623
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
She had a child?

624
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
I'm sorry

625
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
I'm sorry

626
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
I'm sorry

627
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
I'm sorry

628
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
I'm sorry

629
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
I'm sorry

630
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
I'm sorry

631
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
I'm sorry

632
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,760
I'm sorry

633
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
I'm sorry

634
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
I'm sorry

635
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
I'm sorry

636
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
I'm sorry

637
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
I'm sorry

638
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,440
Director Yu

639
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
This is Wen Su Juan's house

640
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Is Wen Su Juan home?

641
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
She is Wen Su Juan?

642
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,440
Yes, it's her

643
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,440
Wen Su Juan

644
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,440
These two are the two who are in charge of the National Security Bureau

645
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,440
Director Yin and Officer Ai

646
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,440
They have some situations

647
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
I want to know about them

648
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,440
I'm sorry

649
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,440
I'm sorry

650
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
I'm sorry

651
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Sorry

652
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
sorry

653
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
It's Đau Dinh

654
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
No, he's sharing with somebody

655
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
You'reoughs

656
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
I want to talk to him alone

657
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Sure

658
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,440
We came to check some things with you.

659
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Your real name shouldn't be Wen Su Juan,

660
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,440
but Yang Cai Yun, right?

661
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,440
My name is Wen Su Juan.

662
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,440
My name is not Yang Cai Yun.

663
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,440
Do you think this photo is you?

664
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,440
No.

665
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

666
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Police officer, you really found the wrong person.

667
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,440
Your name is Yang Cai Yun.

668
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,440
On May 10, 1974,

669
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
in October 1990,

670
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,440
a man named Lao Huang Gou was kidnapped.

671
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,440
First, he was sold to Zhang Zhongli in Zhangjia Village in Wushun County.

672
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,440
Then he was sold to Xu Teng Long in Qingqu County by Zhang Zhongli.

673
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,440
Then he was sold to Liang Wei by Xu Teng Long,

674
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,440
who is your current husband.

675
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Police officer,

676
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,440
my husband and I are in love.

677
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
Our child is already nine years old.

678
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,440
He's in grade two.

679
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,440
I really am not the person you want to find.

680
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Please leave.

681
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Mom.

682
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,440
This is your child?

683
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,440
Yes.

684
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
This is Xiaoyun.

685
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
Xiaoyun,

686
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
where is your father?

687
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,440
Dad went out to buy wine.

688
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
Xiaoyun, go and write your homework.

689
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
When you're done, I'll come back and talk to you.

690
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,440
Police officer, if there's nothing else,

691
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,440
I should go and cook.

692
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,440
Don't wait.

693
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Let me tell you something.

694
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
Twenty years ago,

695
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
a girl was kidnapped.

696
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
I was the one who took over the case.

697
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,440
Unfortunately,

698
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,440
I haven't found this child for twenty years.

699
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,440
I remember that her parents

700
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
often came to our department

701
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
and complained to me.

702
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,440
They begged us to find the only daughter for them.

703
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
Later,

704
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
every time I went on a business trip,

705
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,440
I went to her parents' grave to see.

706
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Her parents' graves are very cold.

707
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Because their only daughter is missing,

708
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
no one was there to clean up their graves.

709
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,440
They have already...

710
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,440
Police officer,

711
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,440
your story is very touching.

712
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
But I'm really not Yang Xiaoyun.

713
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,440
Please go back if you don't have anything to say.

714
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
Xiaoyun, you can trust us.

715
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
We're here to help you.

716
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
If you have any questions,

717
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
you can tell us.

718
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
You don't have to be afraid.

719
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
I'm really not Yang Xiaoyun.

720
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
You really found the wrong person.

721
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
You guys go.

722
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
I'm sorry.

723
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
Mom, who are they?

724
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
Mom, what's wrong?

725
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
Mom, don't cry.

726
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
Mom, don't cry.

727
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Mom, don't cry.

728
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
Mom, don't cry.

729
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
Mom, don't cry.

730
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
Mom, don't cry.

731
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Mom, don't cry.

732
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Mom, don't cry.

733
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
Mom, don't cry.

734
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
Mom, don't cry.

735
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Mom, don't cry.

736
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Mom, don't cry.

737
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
Mom, don't cry.

738
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
Mom, don't cry.

739
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Mom, don't cry.

740
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Mom, don't cry.

741
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Mom, don't cry.

742
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
Mom, don't cry.

743
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Mom, don't cry.

744
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
Liang Xiaoyun's parents have been bitterly disappointed

745
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
that he couldn't get a DNA test without going to the hospital.

746
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
If he insists that he is Wen Sujun

747
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
and not Yang Caiyun,

748
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
then we might not be able to take both of them.

749
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
Why don't you admit it?

750
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,440
Xiaoyun, where's your father?

751
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Dad went to buy wine.

752
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
Xiaoyun, go write your homework.

753
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Write homework to help dad come back.

754
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
I'll tell him.

755
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
I think it's because of the child.

756
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
Any mother wouldn't want her child's father

757
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
to be taken away by the police

758
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
and put in prison.

759
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
But I think the child might be

760
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
just a part of it.

761
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
Maybe there are other reasons

762
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
why he doesn't want to admit it.

763
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
We're also very worried about this.

764
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
You said that the two of you had a family affair.

765
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
So you're not going to tell us?

766
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
The villagers know about the two of you having a family affair.

767
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
They are very cruel.

768
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,440
They sent them to the hospital several times.

769
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
Then why didn't they call the police?

770
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
Wen Sujun himself

771
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
couldn't stand it.

772
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
He couldn't stand it anymore.

773
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,440
He went to our village committee.

774
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
But when we came up,

775
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
he was just a little bit upset.

776
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
It's nothing.

777
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
He said it himself.

778
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
What can we do?

779
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
If there are too many people in the village,

780
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
the villagers will not blame them.

781
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
They can't control the situation.

782
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Yes.

783
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
Family violence

784
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
should be dealt with by the victim himself.

785
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Did you threaten him?

786
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
Does he have any concerns?

787
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Maybe.

788
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
We talked to him.

789
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
He also ate a few ice creams.

790
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,440
Wen Sujun, this time we'll deal with you.

791
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
Okay.

792
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
What did you do?

793
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
What did you do?

794
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
Nothing.

795
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
I just came to visit.

796
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
I asked if the police station was satisfied.

797
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
I said it was very satisfied.

798
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
I didn't have any objections.

799
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Did he ask

800
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,440
what you were doing?

801
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
No.

802
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
The household register clearly states that

803
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
I am Wen Sujun.

804
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
I am free to love you.

805
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
I said it myself.

806
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
You know my temper.

807
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
You know my temper.

808
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
Even if the police know I bought you,

809
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
you can't control it.

810
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Once I'm out, I'll kill you.

811
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,440
I won't only kill you, I'll kill him too.

812
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,440
Xiaoyu is your biological daughter.

813
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
Dad.

814
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Did the police support you?

815
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Dad.

816
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Dad.

817
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
Dad.

818
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
Dad.

819
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Mom.

820
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,440
Mom.

821
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
Dad.

822
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
Dad.

823
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Dad.

824
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Mom.

825
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
I'll kill you.

826
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Dad.

827
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
I'll kill you.

828
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
I'll kill you.

829
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Do you hear me?

830
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Stop.

831
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Stop.

832
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
Give me the police.

833
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
Xiaoyu.

834
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
Come on.

835
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
Come on.

836
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
I'm going to sleep.

837
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Come on.

838
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Move.

839
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Come on.

840
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
Let's go.

841
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Let's go.

842
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Sujun.

843
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
Sujun.

844
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
Sujun.

845
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
Sujun.

846
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Yang Kanyun.

847
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
You can leave here now.

848
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
You don't have to worry about

849
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
the revenge of your parents.

850
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,440
He's suspected of domestic violence.

851
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
He's suspected of domestic violence.

852
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,440
He's suspected of domestic violence.

853
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
He's suspected of domestic violence.

854
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
I'm here in this royal palace.

855
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,440
I'm here in this royal palace.

856
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,440
I'm leaving now.

857
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,440
I'm leaving now.

858
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
Where else can I go?

859
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,440
Mom.

860
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Are we going to lose our home?

861
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
You can go back to Linshan.

862
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Your parents' grandparents are still here.

863
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
We'll connect with the local government.

864
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
They'll take care of you.

865
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
No.

866
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
If we go back, we'll be in trouble.

867
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
Yang Kanyun.

868
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
You're afraid you can't support this family alone, right?

869
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
You're afraid you can't support this family alone, right?

870
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
No.

871
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Don't worry.

872
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,440
And we'll be your team.

873
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
And many public welfare organizations

874
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
and love companies will come to help you.

875
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
This trouble will definitely pass.

876
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440
Thank you.

877
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
Thank you.

878
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,440
You have to believe in yourself.

879
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,440
Thank you.

880
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
I can do it for Xiao Ying.

881
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,440
I can do it for myself.

882
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,440
I can do it.

883
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
This time,

884
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
you can finally go home.

885
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
I promise.

886
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,440
I can finally go home.

887
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,440
I can finally go home.

888
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
I can finally go home.

889
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
I can finally go home.

890
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
I can finally go home.

891
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Let's go.

892
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,440
But the truth is in my heart

893
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,440
Finally, I became such a person

894
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,440
Every number is a memory of youth

895
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:00,440
For love, heartache, for the sake of the past, and this life

896
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,440
I'm determined to not look back

897
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,440
The time is over, let it go

898
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,440
There is always someone waiting for the future

899
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Hugging this time, it will never change

900
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Just like my heart, it will never be deep

901
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:15,440
The blue heart, it will never be deep
