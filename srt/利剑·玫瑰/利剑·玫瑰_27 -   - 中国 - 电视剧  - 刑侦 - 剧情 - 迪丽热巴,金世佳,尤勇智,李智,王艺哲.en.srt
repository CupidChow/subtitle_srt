=Episode 27=

3
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,711
This Zhou Hongcai

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
knows Cripple...

5
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,560
Cripple feared
his identity would get out.

6
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:45,310
So he killed Zhou Hongcai.

7
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,159
(Hi, Xiaochu.)

8
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,022
(I'm Ai Xin,
from the Anti-abduction Office.)

9
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,680
(We really need to
thank your fiancé, Wen Xu.)

10
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,319
(To find you,)

11
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,709
(he carried your photo)

12
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,311
(and traveled to over a dozen cities.)

13
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,719
(He was even
in Linshan just a few days ago.)

14
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,360
(I saw that photo.)

15
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,149
(You were dancing in it.)

16
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,088
(You looked beautiful.)

17
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,111
(He must really love you.)

18
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:32,000
(Wen Xu has been
to more than a dozen cities)

19
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,680
(in search of you.)

20
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,360
(Why)

21
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,479
(don't you want to see him?)

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,800
(I...)

23
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,879
(don't want him to know what happened.)

24
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,199
(Some things change,
and there's no going back.)

25
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,080
(What's gone is gone.)

26
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,800
(I just want him to remember)

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,080
(the best time we had together,)

28
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,479
(and me at my best.)

29
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,080
(Alright then.)

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,360
(We'll respect your decision.)

31
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,111
(Stop by
Tuanyuan Restaurant if you'd like.)

32
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,520
(There should still be
photos Wen Xu took of you.)

33
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,620
(Missing Person, Zhang Xiaochu)

34
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,840
Welcome.

35
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
What would you like?

36
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,820
(Missing Person, Zhang Xiaochu)

37
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:36,759
Hold on.

38
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,839
You can't take that.

39
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,279
Why are you taking this?

40
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,759
Are you...

41
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,160
Wait a sec.

42
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,120
You're Zhang Xiaochu?

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,319
You're really Zhang Xiaochu?

44
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,879
Someone's been

45
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,800
looking for you.

46
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,079
Tall guy,

47
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,879
hair down to here.

48
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,079
Mr. Wen.

49
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,560
His last name is Wen.

50
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,639
You know him, right?

51
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,160
No, no! Don't go!

52
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,319
Let me call him!

53
00:05:24,822 --> 00:05:25,800
I can help you reach him!

54
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,560
Please don't go!

55
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,340
(Wen Xu, Zhang Xiaochu is
at the restaurant. Come quick!)

56
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:55,959
Wu.

57
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,120
Welcome.

58
00:07:57,288 --> 00:07:57,830
Ms. Fang.

59
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,000
You didn't have to

60
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,040
bring a gift.

61
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,680
I've wanted to visit,

62
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,711
but I was busy.

63
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,160
Congrats on the baby girl!

64
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,639
This is for Qian.

65
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
How thoughtful of you.

66
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:07,560
And this.

67
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,560
Mr. Ye told me to get

68
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,720
the candied chestnuts from South Street.

69
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,240
Mr. Ye doesn't even know

70
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,240
I love the candied chestnuts
from that exact shop.

71
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,240
You must've waited in line forever.

72
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,439
That place is always packed.

73
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,680
Not too long.

74
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,120
Madam.

75
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,839
I'll bring the little one.

76
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,519
Come on.

77
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,120
Sweetie, come here.

78
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,679
Mommy wants to
introduce you to someone, okay?

79
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,679
Come say hi to Uncle Wu.

80
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,159
Say "Uncle."

81
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,399
Hello, Qian.

82
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,000
Uncle...

83
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,879
Hi, there!

84
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,466
Say "Uncle."

85
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,919
She's just a little shy.

86
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,679
It's okay.

87
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,320
Daddy...

88
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,200
Look at this kid.

89
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,679
He's your uncle,

90
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,200
look closely.

91
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:54,440
When I told you to say "Daddy,"
you didn't say it,

92
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,960
and now you're calling your uncle

93
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Daddy?

94
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,440
He's your uncle,

95
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,039
not Daddy.

96
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,759
Not Daddy.

97
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,279
Ms. Fang, I feel like

98
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,919
this kid and I have a connection.

99
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:03,879
How about...

100
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,440
I become her godfather?

101
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:07,711
You're really taking advantage
of this visit, huh?

102
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,270
Isn't this all too sudden?

103
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,039
Hey, how's that taking advantage?

104
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,519
Want me as your goddad?

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,440
Yeah?

106
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,600
Look.

107
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,480
I got this

108
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,422
for you.

109
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,377
Do you like it?

110
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,480
I do.

111
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,799
It really is a pretty doll, isn't it?

112
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,039
So, how about a thank-you?

113
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,159
Thank you, Uncle.

114
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,279
Say "Goddad".

115
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:27,822
It's settled then!

116
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,879
I will come to visit you often!

117
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,440
You should hurry up
and find a girlfriend.

118
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,720
What goddad nonsense?

119
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,399
Come on now.

120
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,240
I got a goddaughter.

121
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,644
Who needs a girlfriend?

122
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:52,900
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

123
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,320
Hey!

124
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,840
Where's your owner?

125
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,240
What's going on?

126
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,120
Something wrong?

127
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,360
My kid

128
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,200
ate a bowl of noodles here,

129
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,840
and he's had diarrhea.

130
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,039
You owe me an explanation!

131
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,080
Well...

132
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,600
Are you sure

133
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,159
your kid didn't eat

134
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,509
anything else that was spoiled?

135
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,400
He ate at your place
and went straight home.

136
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:14,360
That was all!

137
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,879
The doctor said

138
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,639
it was food poisoning!

139
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,919
Now explain yourselves.

140
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,279
Um...

141
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,320
Please hear me out.

142
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:21,840
Well,

143
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,759
we've run this place for years now,

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,480
and this has never happened before.

145
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:25,880
Are you...

146
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:26,333
Fine.

147
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,440
Still denying it?

148
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,840
I only brought my kid here

149
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:31,440
to have your food because I felt pity

150
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,519
for your family!

151
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,840
Here's the doctor's note.

152
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Three thousand yuan.

153
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,519
Medical bills and lost wages.

154
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,559
You need to pay me.

155
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,159
Sir, please,

156
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,759
you can't just accuse us like that.

157
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,759
How do you know your kid

158
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,759
didn't eat anything else?

159
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,120
We have no way of knowing that.

160
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,720
Young lady...

161
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,320
Meiyu!

162
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,240
It's true, though.

163
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:52,720
Let's all just calm down and talk.

164
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay?

165
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,840
Alright.

166
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,440
Okay.

167
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,120
There's no reasoning with you.

168
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,600
I won't argue anymore.

169
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,200
I'll take this somewhere else.

170
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,879
Hey, wait...

171
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,879
Wait...

172
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,200
Go ahead, eat!

173
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,840
Eat your food!

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,822
We're leaving.

175
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,000
Alright, fine. It's on the house!

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,679
Free of charge!

177
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,840
Meiyu,

178
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,120
did the kid actually have noodles here?

179
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,840
Now I remember.

180
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,288
That bowl of noodles yesterday

181
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,240
was made by you, Madam Zhang.

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,120
I made it?

183
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,519
I made him a bowl of noodles?

184
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,039
I cooked it for him?

185
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,039
I... I...

186
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:35,879
Go check on it!

187
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,440
This...

188
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,733
I just remembered something.

189
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,799
Liu, after you left yesterday,

190
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,840
that kid showed up.

191
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,679
I made him a bowl of noodles.

192
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:47,960
I...

193
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,279
added a bit more vegetables.

194
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,200
Put in some salt.

195
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,120
The kid doesn't eat spicy food.

196
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,266
I didn't add chili.

197
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,039
And since I thought he liked sweets,

198
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,639
I added just a little bit of sugar.

199
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:04,911
As for the rest...

200
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,080
This...

201
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,279
This isn't sugar.

202
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,777
This is cleaning powder.

203
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,399
Cleaning powder?

204
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,120
What is the cleaning powder doing here?

205
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,480
I used it
to clean the kitchen yesterday.

206
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,759
I forgot to put it away.

207
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,000
This...

208
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,960
It was my fault.

209
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:23,320
It was my mistake.

210
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,919
It's on me!

211
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,360
No, no.

212
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,355
You're not the only one to blame.
I should've...

213
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:28,150
I should've
tasted it before adding it in.

214
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,480
Yeah, it didn't even look like sugar.

215
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,039
This is on me too.

216
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,039
My eyesight got worse.

217
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,279
Go find the family.

218
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,480
You need to apologize.

219
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Yes, of course.

220
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,799
Go now.

221
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,360
Alright.

222
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,080
Take it easy.

223
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,600
Is it this way?

224
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,399
Yes, take your time.

225
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,620
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

226
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,120
We truly

227
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,720
understand your situation.

228
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,399
But rules and regulations

229
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,480
must be followed.

230
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,120
Given her condition now,

231
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,720
she's considered not fully
capable of managing on her own.

232
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,177
She is no longer
fit to run the restaurant.

233
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,039
Look,

234
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,133
you may close for now.

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,600
Understood.

236
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:13,177
We'll get going then.

237
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:14,511
Have a nice day.

238
00:13:15,222 --> 00:13:16,688
Let's check on the other shop.

239
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,279
What now?

240
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
We just have to tell the truth.

241
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,088
You explain it to her.

242
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Madam Zhang.

243
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,840
They mean to say

244
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,200
we should let the restaurant

245
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,622
temporarily close for now.

246
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,720
Xiaoxing,

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,120
am I sick?

248
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,600
Madam Zhang,

249
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,360
don't overthink it.

250
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,320
You're just

251
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,799
a little too tired lately.

252
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,799
While the shop is closed,

253
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,399
you can take a good rest and recover...

254
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,039
Xiaoxing.

255
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,679
That day when you
took me to the hospital...

256
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,679
Now that I think about it,

257
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,360
that doctor

258
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,519
asked me a bunch of strange questions.

259
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,360
Lately, I've been...

260
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,120
I keep...

261
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,000
getting all confused.

262
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,777
Do I have Alzheimer's?

263
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,120
Madam Zhang...

264
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,799
It's just...

265
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,120
You've got some
common age-related conditions.

266
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:30,200
That's completely
normal for older folks.

267
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,240
Xiaoxing.

268
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,840
You have to tell me the truth.

269
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:41,279
Madam Zhang,
you've just been too tired lately.

270
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,799
Even we young ones

271
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,919
forget stuff all the time.

272
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,679
Exactly.

273
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,799
I lost my keys
at the restaurant a few days ago.

274
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,519
Right?

275
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,120
Yep.

276
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,200
I left my phone
at Bring Lost Children Home.

277
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:52,622
See?

278
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,888
We just haven't had enough rest.

279
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,240
Didn't I misplace my bag too?

280
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,380
(Missing Person, Lin Ran)

281
00:15:51,900 --> 00:16:01,420
(Missing Person, Lin Ran)

282
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:17,940
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

283
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,780
(Linshan City People's Reception Office)

284
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,919
Excuse me.

285
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:24,000
Here to see someone?

286
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,733
Hi, how can I get
to the Anti-abduction Office?

287
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:27,320
The Anti-abduction Office?

288
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,360
These folks work there.

289
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,200
Sir!

290
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,960
Police officer!

291
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,639
Hello.

292
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:35,444
My daughter was taken by bad people.

293
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,120
What's your daughter's name?

294
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,200
Tong Xiaoling.

295
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,000
Can you tell us what happened?

296
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,720
Officer,

297
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,279
our Xiaoling went overseas.

298
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,200
Can you go abroad to look for her?

299
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,288
And how did you know
she was taken overseas?

300
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,919
I...

301
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,720
We...

302
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,360
Okay, Sir, Madam,

303
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,240
no need to panic.

304
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,120
Let's talk in the reception room.

305
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:54,840
Come on.

306
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,559
Feng, grab the bag, please.

307
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,639
I got it, Sir.

308
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,279
Thank you.

309
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,840
Tong Xiaoling, 19 years old.

310
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,840
From Lianxiang Town.

311
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,599
She used to work

312
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,640
as a waitress
at a restaurant in Linshan City.

313
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,200
About a month ago,

314
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,550
she told her parents she wanted
to make big money overseas.

315
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:11,859
They never heard from her again.

316
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,440
A few days ago,

317
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,240
her mom received

318
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,039
a text from an unknown number.

319
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,039
It just said, "Mom, help me."

320
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,200
The parents feared
she might be in danger,

321
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,488
so they called the police.

322
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,720
Tong Xiaoling

323
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,955
was sent to work in Qinmang

324
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:25,190
through an agency called
Mixin International Labor Company.

325
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,160
She went with nine other girls.

326
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,759
None of them can be reached now.

327
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,000
So we suspect

328
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,680
this is part of

329
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,519
a cross-border scam operation.

330
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,519
Recently,

331
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,519
these labor scams

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,240
targeting overseas jobs

333
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,720
have been popping up
all across the country.

334
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,480
It's had a terrible impact.

335
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,359
HQ asked

336
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,799
the provincial department
to form a task force.

337
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,359
I'll be the team lead.

338
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,039
Han Liang will be the deputy lead.

339
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,400
You'll take full charge of operations.

340
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,440
We need full cooperation from you.

341
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,400
Yes, Sir.

342
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,000
This case involves overseas activities.

343
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,160
So it's going to be
a bit tricky to investigate.

344
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,519
The provincial department

345
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:10,060
got in touch with
the Ministry of Public Security.

346
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:11,879
They contacted
the liaison officer Zou Yuhuai

347
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,777
stationed in Qinmang.

348
00:18:12,777 --> 00:18:14,066
He'll assist the investigation.

349
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,440
And even though

350
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,119
we've only had
one report here in Linshan,

351
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,200
there must be

352
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,440
a lot more victims.

353
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:22,319
So,

354
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,839
we have to move fast.

355
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,279
We need to find leads
as soon as possible.

356
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,359
- Yes.
- Yes.

357
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,359
Hey, listen.

358
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,240
Don't get greedy.

359
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,549
A hundred thousand in agency fees?

360
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,933
Give a discount if you have to.

361
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,119
It's easy money anyway.

362
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:43,160
We're not even making
our real money from that.

363
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,079
I gave a discount.

364
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,359
What do you mean I didn't?

365
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:49,359
Gang, all the money
we make ends up with you.

366
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,000
If I don't take some agency fee,

367
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,079
how do I get by?

368
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,759
I've already put your cut
into an offshore account.

369
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,444
What's the problem?

370
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,799
You don't trust me?

371
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,680
It's not that I don't trust you.

372
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,359
Money in hand is peace of mind.

373
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,559
I've got nothing in hand,

374
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,079
and I haven't even seen it.

375
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:07,440
Let's make

376
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,720
a few more big deals.

377
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,160
Then, I'll show you

378
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,759
everything there is to see.

379
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,440
The numbers in your bank account

380
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,266
will definitely make you happy.

381
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,759
Alright.

382
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,519
I'll be waiting to see those numbers.

383
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,933
Those ten we sent last time

384
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,359
were a pretty good batch.

385
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,720
Hurry up.

386
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,920
Keep recruiting.

387
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,749
Aren't I already looking?

388
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,911
I have to pick carefully.

389
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,039
Careful about what?

390
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,319
Right now, speed is what matters most.

391
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,359
It's that urgent?

392
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,533
Did you hear something?

393
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,119
Enough.

394
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,799
Don't be paranoid.

395
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,000
Well,

396
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,960
I want to

397
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,920
make enough

398
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,680
and take you abroad.

399
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,800
I'll do whatever you say, Gang.

400
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,622
Sure, let's leave it at that for now.

401
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,355
Hi, we're from
the Anti-abduction Office.

402
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,400
First door on the left.

403
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,240
Got it, thanks.

404
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:12,200
Come, this way.

405
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,559
Officer,

406
00:20:33,622 --> 00:20:34,960
you don't have to bother with us.

407
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,319
We'll figure something out.

408
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,680
It's fine.

409
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,799
This is the police
department's guesthouse.

410
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,920
No charge.

411
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,279
Stay here and rest.

412
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:43,359
No, we can't.

413
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,022
You're going out of your way
to find our daughter.

414
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,311
We can't stay here for free.

415
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,240
Don't worry.

416
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:49,640
This is all standard procedure.

417
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,079
Searching for your daughter

418
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,240
is our duty.

419
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,720
As for the basics,

420
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,480
we've already
got a pretty clear picture.

421
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,319
So please,

422
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,440
just stay here and rest.

423
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,688
If there's any update,

424
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,960
I'll let you know right away.

425
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,279
We'll be back to work then.

426
00:21:01,622 --> 00:21:02,790
If you run into any problems,

427
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,000
contact me anytime.

428
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,279
Get some good rest.

429
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,359
Honey.

430
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,480
This doesn't look good, you know.

431
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,119
I'm just as confused.

432
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:28,920
Madam Zhang.

433
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,359
You should eat something.

434
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:31,920
I already did.

435
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,640
You haven't eaten all day.

436
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,519
When did you eat?

437
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,279
Come on, have some.

438
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,759
I already ate.

439
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,880
I made this for you.

440
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:40,720
Please eat.

441
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,079
What did you eat?

442
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,920
You haven't had anything today.

443
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,119
I'm stuffed, honestly.

444
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,960
You eat. Once you finish,
just go home, alright?

445
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,319
Meiyu.

446
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,789
The place is closed.

447
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,022
Why haven't you gone home?

448
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,799
Madam Zhang insisted on coming.

449
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,319
She won't leave until after midnight.

450
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,533
She says she has to wait for Ranran.

451
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,359
Her condition's been
getting worse lately.

452
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,319
Sometimes

453
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,799
she doesn't even recognize me.

454
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,799
Xiaoxing's been really busy lately too.

455
00:22:17,222 --> 00:22:19,444
So I'm the only one
looking after her here.

456
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,960
But...

457
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:23,880
What is it?

458
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,079
Something wrong?

459
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,920
My pet shop shut down.

460
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,000
I still owe some money.

461
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
And now the restaurant is closed too.

462
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:37,559
So...

463
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,822
I don't have any income anymore.

464
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,960
A friend of mine

465
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,519
introduced me to a company.

466
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,839
They asked me to go
for an interview tomorrow.

467
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,480
As long as I have time,

468
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,860
I'll come to look after Madam Zhang.

469
00:22:51,866 --> 00:22:52,666
Don't worry.

470
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:55,844
You go first.

471
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,519
Yanyan's here.

472
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:10,279
Look.

473
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:11,750
Isn't it pretty?

474
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,240
It's really pretty.

475
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:14,880
It even transforms.

476
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:18,777
There, it changed.

477
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:21,666
You're so clever with your hands,
Madam Zhang.

478
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:23,711
Here you go, Madam Zhang.

479
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,044
While the noodles are warm,

480
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,555
go ahead and eat this bowl.

481
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,039
Once you finish, I'll take you home.

482
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,355
We eat, and then we go home.

483
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,400
Yes.

484
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,880
Alright.

485
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,559
Have you eaten?

486
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,559
Yes, I have.

487
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,519
Then I'll eat too.

488
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,039
I'll watch you eat.

489
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,039
Tasty?

490
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:44,759
Tasty.

491
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,200
You made it?

492
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,720
Meiyu made it.

493
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,079
Tasty.

494
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,039
Want some water?

495
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,519
No?

496
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,240
Are you done?

497
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:58,920
You made this?

498
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,839
Not me.

499
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,039
Meiyu made it.

500
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:03,920
Tasty.

501
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:04,839
Tasty.

502
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,240
Manager Wang.

503
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,640
(Mixin International Labor Company)

504
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,844
All the documents are ready.

505
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:28,000
Everything's here.

506
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,400
Alright, once it's done,

507
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,279
just head this way.

508
00:24:38,088 --> 00:24:40,680
Hi, are you here for immigration
or overseas job recruitment?

509
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,160
Recruitment.

510
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,000
Please fill this out.

511
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,680
Okay, thank you.

512
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:47,519
Zhang.

513
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,000
Ms. Zhen.

514
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,549
Send me the final list of candidates

515
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,111
we confirmed.

516
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:50,711
Got it.

517
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:52,480
She's here about overseas work.

518
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,400
This is Ms. Zhen.

519
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,200
Hello.

520
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,920
Hello, Ms. Zhen.

521
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,799
Come with me.

522
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,244
Never mind, just come in with me.

523
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,480
Have a seat.

524
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,177
Here's my résumé.

525
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,119
Ms. Zhen.

526
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,440
Here's the filtered list

527
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,066
of qualified candidates
for overseas work. Please sign here.

528
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,000
Ruan Meiyu, right?

529
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:40,559
Yes.

530
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,200
Why didn't you

531
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,920
list your educational background?

532
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,640
Let me give you a quick overview.

533
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,000
Our overseas recruitment program

534
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,160
mainly covers two regions.

535
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,640
Africa,

536
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,519
and Southeast Asia.

537
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:01,088
We're mainly hiring
construction workers for Africa.

538
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,200
It's not really suitable
for someone like you.

539
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,400
I suggest you take a look at

540
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,640
Southeast Asia.

541
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,160
As for Southeast Asia,

542
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,680
we have twelve companies hiring.

543
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,155
This is the list of companies.

544
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,160
You can take a look.

545
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,620
(Pangka Hotel)

546
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,759
Excuse me,

547
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,240
is this the highest-paying job
for service staff?

548
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,079
Yes.

549
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,799
Pangka Hotel

550
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,720
is a luxury five-star hotel in Qinmang.

551
00:26:36,022 --> 00:26:38,022
With more and more
Chinese tourists going there,

552
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:39,110
they're in urgent need

553
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,240
of Chinese-speaking staff.

554
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,039
But from what I see,

555
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,160
you don't seem to have

556
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:46,160
any hotel service experience.

557
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,000
But I used to run a pet shop.

558
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,933
That counts as service too, right?

559
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,759
You're pretty handy too.

560
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,200
Looks like

561
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,222
luck's on your side.

562
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,599
Pangka Hotel is hiring just ten staff.

563
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,720
We already have nine.

564
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,279
Only one spot left.

565
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,400
But the agency fee is 100,000 yuan.

566
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,240
That's a lot.

567
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,480
Our agency fee is indeed

568
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:24,422
on the higher side.

569
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,119
But

570
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,839
that's the going rate
for international jobs.

571
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,799
You actually meet
the requirements quite well.

572
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,599
And since this company just opened,

573
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:39,155
I'll give you 90% off.

574
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,422
Ninety percent off?

575
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
That's...

576
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,240
That's still 10,000 yuan.

577
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,711
If you really can't
come up with it right now...

578
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,640
I could

579
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,000
deduct it from
your first three months' salary.

580
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,599
Alright, that works.

581
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,720
Thank you, Ms. Zhen.

582
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,119
Zhang.

583
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,160
Ms. Zhen.

584
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,519
Take this lady,

585
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,480
Ms. Ruan,

586
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,822
to sign the contract.

587
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,440
Got it.

588
00:28:07,844 --> 00:28:08,822
Right this way.

589
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:09,880
Thank you.

590
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:12,800
Right this way.

591
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,980
(Linshan Public Security Bureau)

592
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:29,333
Regarding Tong Xiaoling's disappearance,

593
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,920
Chief Xiao has
already briefed me on the case.

594
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,600
With help from
the local police, I found

595
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:36,844
that Tong Xiaoling
and the others left the country,

596
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,555
and weren't sent to work
at Pameng Hotel.

597
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,000
Staff at Pameng Hotel told us

598
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,759
their official website had been hacked.

599
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,680
Someone used their website

600
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,759
to post job ads.

601
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,359
They know

602
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,755
nothing about it.

603
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,400
But our colleagues
at the Anti-abduction Office found

604
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,160
those ten people's visa documents

605
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,466
were provided by the hotel.

606
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,640
Well,

607
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,839
the general manager
of Pameng Hotel claims

608
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,880
he had no idea.

609
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,000
The local police
are still investigating.

610
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:02,880
From what I know,

611
00:29:03,222 --> 00:29:05,444
this hotel has ties to organized crime.

612
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:06,920
So I doubt the police

613
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,519
will find anything useful.

614
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:12,079
Is there another way to

615
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,377
investigate this?

616
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,759
Through other sources,

617
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,839
I found a prostitution ring from China

618
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,400
with deep connections to the hotel.

619
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:25,920
Anti-abduction Office

620
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:26,839
provided the phone

621
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,200
used to send the SOS text.

622
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,866
Does the owner have
any ties to that prostitution ring?

623
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,920
The phone owner

624
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,000
said he got a girl from China

625
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,444
through one of their pimps.

626
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,279
I suspect that girl was Tong Xiaoling.

627
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:42,644
While she was forced into prostitution,

628
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:44,000
she used the client's phone

629
00:29:44,022 --> 00:29:45,350
to send out the SOS message.

630
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,880
Can we trace that brothel

631
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,839
through the owner of that phone?

632
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,666
Based on our investigation,

633
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,269
that prostitution ring keeps moving

634
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,622
from one place to another.

635
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,079
Comrade Zou Yuhuai,

636
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,519
we'll need you to keep tracking

637
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,920
their hideouts as they move.

638
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,400
If anything new comes up,

639
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,440
keep us in the loop.

640
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,640
Understood.

641
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:07,960
Deng Yan,

642
00:30:08,155 --> 00:30:09,440
has the Anti-abduction Office

643
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,319
found anything new?

644
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:11,920
Yes.

645
00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:14,000
We've already looked
into Mixin International.

646
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,279
All their paperwork checks out.

647
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,359
Nothing suspicious so far.

648
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,240
But we're still investigating the person

649
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,000
in charge of the company, Zhen Ni.

650
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,279
Chief Xiao, Zhen Ni might be

651
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,160
the breakthrough in this case.

652
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:26,720
Keep digging.

653
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,200
Report any leads right away.

654
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,640
Got it.

655
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,599
Sir,

656
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,079
I've just found something new.

657
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:31,920
Go on.

658
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,799
Mixin International Labor Company

659
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,319
just posted a new job listing.

660
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,400
The job is at Pangka Hotel in Qinmang.

661
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,789
It's a five-star hotel too.

662
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,100
They're hiring ten female servers.

663
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,800
Investigate
the Immigration Administration.

664
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,279
Yes, Sir.

665
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,839
These are the visa documents
provided by the hotel.

666
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,319
The ten girls listed here

667
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,000
left the country three days ago.

668
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:56,920
(A friend of mine)

669
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,519
referred me to a company

670
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,920
and said I could go
for an interview tomorrow.

671
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,799
We all know what needs to be done next,

672
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,119
don't we?

673
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,559

Hello.

686
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,079
Hello.

687
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,119
Hello, officers.

688
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:43,400
We're here for Zhen Ni.

689
00:32:43,555 --> 00:32:44,830
Sure, this way, please.

690
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,740
(Certified Overseas Labor Company)

691
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:59,310
Ms. Zhen,
the officers are here to see you.

692
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,599
Please, have a seat.

693
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,519
We have a few questions.

694
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:09,350
Did this woman

695
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,599
go abroad through your company?

696
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,000
I remember her.

697
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:14,466
Her name is Tong Xiaoling.

698
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,119
She went to Qinmang for work.

699
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,480
Her family was struggling,

700
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,240
so I waived

701
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,733
about half of her agency fee.

702
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:22,440
Do you know what job

703
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,680
she ended up doing there?

704
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,680
She works as a waitress.

705
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,799
Including her,

706
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,160
all ten went through us

707
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,000
for visas.

708
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,960
They departed from the Bailianquan port.

709
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,279
Actually, these days,

710
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,680
aside from Qinmang,

711
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,000
a lot of Southeast Asian countries

712
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,319
need Chinese workers

713
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,022
due to a big jump in Chinese tourists.

714
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,000
So these ten people

715
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,680
went to work at the hotel there?

716
00:33:44,911 --> 00:33:45,880
How are they doing?

717
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,480
They should be doing fine.

718
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,200
I haven't heard any complaints

719
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,519
about any of the hotels.

720
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,880
But to be honest,

721
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,359
what worries us is when someone

722
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,079
runs off.

723
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,279
Then, it's out of our hands.

724
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,200
Officer,

725
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,680
did someone go missing, right?

726
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:04,711
Do you handle Western immigration too?

727
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,159
Western immigration is even tougher.

728
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,920
It takes longer, more paperwork,

729
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,679
and it's harder.

730
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,159
I just opened this place a month ago.

731
00:34:13,644 --> 00:34:15,533
I've only just
figured out Southeast Asia.

732
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,239
So, officers,
what brought you here today?

733
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,440
Oh, it's nothing big.

734
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,159
We're working on a case lately,

735
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,679
and we need to visit

736
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,960
all the labor agencies in the city.

737
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,639
Just routine visits

738
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,400
to get a better sense
of what's going on in the industry.

739
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,109
If you ever need anything,

740
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,800
just let me know. I'll fully cooperate.

741
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,559
Great, we appreciate it.

742
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,955
We'll be on our way, then.

743
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:44,239
Right this way.

744
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,977
The man who tried to take the kid

745
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,030
had a bracelet on his wrist.

746
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,480
Ms. Zhen.

747
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,480
That bracelet is really pretty.

748
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:53,511
Where did you get it?

749
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,880
Oh, this?

750
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,880
It's nothing fancy.

751
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:58,800
I've worn it so long

752
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,679
I can't take it off.

753
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,440
If you like bracelets too,

754
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,039
I know a good place with great prices.

755
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,119
That's all right.

756
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,360
Just wanted to take a look.

757
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,559
Okay. If that's all,

758
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,400
we'll get going.

759
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,599
Sure.

760
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,920
Take care, both of you.

761
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,980
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

762
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,079
Zhen Ni admitted

763
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,480
that Tong Xiaoling did go abroad

764
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,559
through her labor agency

765
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,239
to work at a hotel in Qinmang.

766
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,360
However,

767
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:33,400
she claims to know nothing about

768
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:35,079
what happened after Tong got there.

769
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,639
We've looked into her company too.

770
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,840
All the documents are in order,

771
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,150
and everything is legal and compliant,

772
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:40,200
with no irregularities.

773
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,960
During our conversation with her,

774
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,639
we noticed one detail.

775
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:45,189
She was wearing a jade bracelet.

776
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,600
And that bracelet was made of jade.

777
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:49,119
A jade bracelet...

778
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,840
Wasn't the person who grabbed Kui

779
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,239
also wearing a bracelet?

780
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,599
A woman dressed as a man?

781
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,840
That's exactly
why I paid attention to it.

782
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,000
But of course,
lots of women wear bracelets.

783
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,599
We can't just assume

784
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,400
Zhen Ni is the trafficker
because of that.

785
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,079
But right now,
she's our biggest suspect.

786
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,480
Keep an eye on her.

787
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,320
Got it.

788
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,519
Oh, right.

789
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,800
What about that photo
we found on Zhou Hongcai?

790
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:15,960
Any progress?

791
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,000
The tech department

792
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,280
has restored it.

793
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,860
(Dingshun Group Charity Donation
for Poor Rural Schools)

794
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:27,920
Based on our earlier analysis,

795
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:30,110
the person who killed Zhou Hongcai

796
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,360
is very likely Cripple.

797
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,360
So

798
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,000
everyone in this photo

799
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:35,199
is a potential suspect.

800
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,644
That includes Ye Xiuming.

801
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,199
Ye Xiuming?

802
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:39,960
You think he's involved?

803
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,288
Isn't Dingshun Group
always doing charity work?

804
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,199
He does donate a lot,

805
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,519
but he was involved

806
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,880
in the Kui case too.

807
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,679
Even though he explained it later,

808
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,159
I've always felt

809
00:36:54,288 --> 00:36:55,622
something was off about it.

810
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,400
Because of
my personal ties to Ye Xiuming,

811
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,679
I'll ask Chief Xiao to

812
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,039
recuse me from the case.

813
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:06,644
That's all for today. Meeting adjourned.

814
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,360
Hello?

815
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,079
Gang.

816
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:20,280
The police came
to the labor agency today.

817
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:21,440
What did they want?

818
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,177
What did you say?

819
00:37:22,488 --> 00:37:25,590
They said it was a routine visit
to all overseas labor firms in the city.

820
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,159
Nothing specific came up.

821
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,840
Don't worry.

822
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:29,079
I handled it just fine.

823
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:30,133
It should be okay.

824
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,039
I told you

825
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,480
not to get greedy
over that little commission money.

826
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,719
But you wouldn't listen.

827
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,320
Look at the situation now.

828
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,711
Don't you see how serious it is?

829
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:40,840
It's really nothing.

830
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,960
The cops barely asked anything and left.

831
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:43,920
Come on.

832
00:37:44,466 --> 00:37:46,866
You're messing up
the operation over pocket change.

833
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:47,733
You won't even know

834
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,644
when it's game over for you.

835
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,559
Your life's not worth much.

836
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:53,400
I can't protect you.

837
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:53,920
Got it?

838
00:37:54,955 --> 00:37:56,070
Is it really that serious?

839
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,559
So what should we do now?

840
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,920
Get rid of the goods you have on hand.

841
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,599
Don't let it sit with you.

842
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,280
Wait for my word.

843
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,000
Don't stir up any more trouble.

844
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,880
Got it, Gang.

845
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,599
Well...

846
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,639
Madam Zhang, don't move.

847
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,519
No, leave it.

848
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,039
I just wanted to get some water.

849
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,239
Okay, I'll get it.

850
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,119
You could cut yourself.

851
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:21,920
Let me clean this up.

852
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,239
I got it, okay?

853
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,800
Go have a seat over there.

854
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,559
Well...

855
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,880
You could cut yourself.

856
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,079
Didn't I tell you?

857
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,360
If you want water
or anything, just call me.

858
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,280
I'll get it for you.

859
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,880
Now I even need help getting water.

860
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,599
Unbelievable.

861
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,119
I know you just
didn't want to trouble me.

862
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,559
But isn't it more trouble
for me to clean this up?

863
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,440
Hey, don't get cut.

864
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,920
Careful, don't hurt yourself.

865
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:52,920
Madam Zhang.

866
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:54,199
Director Deng.

867
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,679
Yanyan.

868
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,239
Coming here

869
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,079
on a rainy day?

870
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,440
It's fine, I brought an umbrella.

871
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,480
Come, give me a hug.

872
00:39:03,355 --> 00:39:04,670
Madam Zhang, you've gained weight.

873
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
I listened to you.

874
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,239
I've been eating more.

875
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,320
A lot more.

876
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,079
Good girl.

877
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:10,800
Sit down.

878
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,360
Okay.

879
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,679
Sit.

880
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,599
Hold on.

881
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,480
Wait a second.

882
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,079
Director Deng, have some water.

883
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:19,920
Thank you.

884
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,719
What's this, Madam Zhang?

885
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:27,400
Yanyan.

886
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,199
I know what illness I have.

887
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,519
Thank you.

888
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:41,440
All this time,

889
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,320
you still threw the medicine box away.

890
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,679
Madam Zhang.

891
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,239
Everyone gets sick sometimes.

892
00:39:49,622 --> 00:39:51,133
The medicine makes you better.

893
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,920
I asked you here because

894
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,960
I must tell you something.

895
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,320
I'm just afraid...

896
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:09,069
that bit by bit,

897
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,422
I'll start forgetting things.

898
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,710
So lately,

899
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:13,190
whenever something comes to mind,

900
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,280
I write it down.

901
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:17,039
I've been keeping it
all in this little notebook.

902
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:19,630
Look. This is about
the day Ranran went missing.

903
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,800
All the details from that day...

904
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,960
I wrote them all down here.

905
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,599
And also

906
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,079
the things Ranran likes to eat.

907
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,119
I wrote those down too.

908
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,599
Look. On this day,

909
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,960
Ranran came first in class.

910
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,119
I promised to take her to the aquarium.

911
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,440
But then...

912
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,280
before the weekend came...

913
00:40:46,755 --> 00:40:47,400
She...

914
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:00,670
Do you still remember...

915
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,911
this?

916
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,039
This was from

917
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,599
that talent show performance we did!

918
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,679
That's right.

919
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,679
Ranran wore that dress that day.

920
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,239
You even sewed a little flower on it.

921
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,239
Only she had it.

922
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,840
All the other kids were so jealous.

923
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,679
I stayed up
all night embroidering that for her.

924
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,709
I stayed up all night.

925
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,111
That's exactly what she said too.

926
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,320
The two of you looked gorgeous

927
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,119
in those dresses.

928
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,599
These are all her things

929
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,320
from when she was little.

930
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,039
I sorted it all out.

931
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:44,190
I want you to have it.

932
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,119
No, Madam Zhang.

933
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:47,039
What are you saying?

934
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,079
No, no, Madam Zhang, look.

935
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,800
You should hold on to these for now.

936
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,119
When Ranran comes back,

937
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,360
you can give them to her yourself, okay?

938
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:55,559
No.

939
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,360
Here's what I'm thinking.

940
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,639
I'd like to ask you...

941
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,333
to help me look into a nursing home.

942
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:03,440
Wait, what?

943
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,679
You're doing just fine here.

944
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:06,400
Why would you move to a nursing home?

945
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,320
Look at the way I am now.

946
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,760
I pretty much
need someone with me all the time.

947
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,360
Xiaoxing and the others

948
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,070
are already doing too much for me.

949
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,559
They have their own lives.

950
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,639
And you too.

951
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,480
I called you on a rainy day

952
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,360
and you still came.

953
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,480
Madam Zhang,
please don't think like that.

954
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,840
I don't see you as a burden, not at all.

955
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,639
You've helped so many families,

956
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:29,440
so many children.

957
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:31,159
You never thought it was too much.

958
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,599
How could I see this

959
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:33,559
as any trouble?

960
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,239
Besides, I like coming here.

961
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,519
Please don't think that way.

962
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,519
Yanyan,

963
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,159
if I stay

964
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,639
at the nursing home,

965
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:41,880
I'll be able to

966
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,519
get proper care and treatment.

967
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,320
I just hope...

968
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:49,159
this forgetfulness of mine

969
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:51,639
can be slowed down a bit

970
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,760
so that

971
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,760
when Ranran comes back,

972
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,840
I'll still be...

973
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,519
in my right mind.
