00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to make a new one.

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to make a new one.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm going to make a new one.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to make a new one.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to make a new one.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going to make a new one.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to make a new one.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to make a new one.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The End

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What do you mean?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What do you mean?

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What do you mean?

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What do you mean?

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,680
plus you turned yourself in, right?

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,880
You should be more generous.

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,680
You just got the paper

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,840
from the bank half a month ago.

29
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,080
You're turning yourself in now?

30
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,360
I can't

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,800
just let it slip away.

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,480
Did you go there later?

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,200
No.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,840
I didn't, officer.

35
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Although the guy told me when I left,

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,320
I'll be their big client in the future.

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,760
I'm always welcome.

38
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
But I really didn't come.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,680
After all, someone is calling for help.

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,160
There must be something wrong.

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,400
Police! Police!

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,440
Police! Police!

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,680
Police! Police!

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
What are you doing?

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,600
Why didn't you listen to me?

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,000
Brother.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,600
Can you let me talk to them every day?

48
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,320
It's not their fault.

49
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,240
What are you doing here?

50
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,520
The police are not here.

51
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,080
Everyone is holding back.

52
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,120
I'm holding back too much.

53
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,640
The police are watching.

54
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,440
No one is here.

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
Brother.

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,960
How about

57
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,120
we contact those big clients?

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,200
We have to make some money.

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,120
They won't think we're a bad guy.

60
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,800
No money.

61
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,240
No money. No money.

62
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,200
How about this?

63
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,480
Call them

64
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,200
and tell them you're going home today.

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,600
Okay.

66
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,800
Okay.

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,600
Okay.

68
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,280
Okay, we'll meet.

69
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,800
musicians

00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,240

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,880
Rusdom

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,840
으로

73
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,960
サウンド

74
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,040
Cool.

75
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,920
It's okay.

76
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,680
Tonight at 7 p.m.

77
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,880
Old place Wang Jianing.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
See you later.

79
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Brother, you're here.

80
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Did I agree?

81
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,680
I'm telling you, the police are not normal.

82
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,080
You have to be careful.

83
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
No problem.

84
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,280
100 Left

85
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,640
Ruo Yiucht wasrold about the снимah clans over the 1 hour.

86
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,320
So we decided toically close this place in an hour.

87
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,360
Imp不錯.

88
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,360
And Restome and Jokelle are watching over him at the back.

89
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
That's right.

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
Bro, bro.

91
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Why is the time of this car driving longer than the last time?

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Are you excited?

93
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Don't worry.

94
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
This time, it's going to be good.

95
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
No, no, no.

96
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
I just want the last one.

97
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
Okay, no problem.

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
I'll go.

99
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Lei, they are going to Yixing.

100
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
I'll follow you up.

101
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Go.

102
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Go.

103
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Yixing, Yixing, Yixing.

104
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Yixing, Yixing, Yixing.

105
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Why don't you go?

106
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
It's okay.

107
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
There was a car accident.

108
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
We'll be able to go soon.

109
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
It's strange.

110
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
They haven't moved for a long time.

111
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Do you know how to drive?

112
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
You hit my car.

113
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Let's see.

114
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
You don't know how to drive?

115
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
You just pull the lever.

116
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Director He.

117
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Lei, how is it going there?

118
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
What's the situation?

119
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm stuck in traffic.

120
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
I can't see the target now.

121
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
I'm afraid I'll lose my face and have to catch it in advance.

122
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Don't worry.

123
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Our ultimate goal now is to find their hiding place.

124
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Okay.

125
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Look.

126
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Where are you?

127
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm still in the same place.

128
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
I live on the left side of the road.

129
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
You're in charge of your own business.

130
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
I'm in charge of your business.

131
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
I'm buying this car.

132
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
I don't care about your money.

133
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Hurry up.

134
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
Hurry up.

135
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
The target is turning again.

136
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm stuck here.

137
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
I can't get through.

138
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
I'll follow you.

139
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Well...

140
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Well...

141
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Why haven't we arrived yet?

142
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Mr. He, don't worry.

143
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
I'm not afraid of the good food.

144
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
We're here again.

145
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Okay.

146
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Hurry up.

147
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,360
This is the high-end villa in the mountainous area.

148
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Mr. He, we're here.

149
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
We're here.

150
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Take care.

151
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Be careful.

152
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Okay.

153
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Wangshan-shou, 12th.

154
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Attention, all departments.

155
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm 1201.

156
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
The target is already in Wangshan-shou, 12th.

157
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Wangshan-shou, 12th.

158
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Listen carefully.

159
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Chao Chao.

160
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
Okay.

161
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
I'll do it myself.

162
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
I'll do it myself.

163
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Mr. Luo, you know the rules.

164
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
I'll keep this for you.

165
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Okay.

166
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Let's go upstairs.

167
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Be careful.

168
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Sir, your car is broken.

169
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
Come out and fix it.

170
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Who's blind?

171
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Who are you?

172
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Don't move.

173
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Don't move.

174
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Hands on the ground.

175
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Don't move.

176
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Go.

177
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Close the door.

178
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
I'll do it myself.

179
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
I'm from the police.

180
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
I didn't do anything.

181
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Okay, you're fine.

182
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Let's go.

183
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Go.

184
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Go.

185
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Stop pretending.

186
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
You're not Qingming.

187
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Even if you don't say it now,

188
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,360
we'll find out soon.

189
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
You have to figure it out.

190
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
What you say now and what you don't say

191
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,360
have a lot to do with your conscience in the future.

192
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,480
The fingerprint on the

193
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
It's from the police.

194
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,360
So, Chang Yameng hasn't done anything so far.

195
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Do you have any surveillance cameras?

196
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
I asked the supervision department for surveillance cameras.

197
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,360
I found that only this car left

198
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
before our time of action.

199
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
And I found this one.

200
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
I also made a light escape route.

201
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
I found that the last place he went to

202
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
was under the foot of Mount Baiwu.

203
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
It's this car.

204
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Don't worry.

205
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
You'll be fine.

206
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
I'll go with you.

207
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Go.

208
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Go.

209
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Officer Zhang,

210
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
we found this car an hour ago.

211
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Jiajia,

212
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
send a message to the nearby police station.

213
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Okay.

214
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
I'll go with you.

215
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Brother, are you going into the city?

216
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
No, I'm going back to the village.

217
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
That's good. I'm going back to the village too.

218
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
I'll go back to see my aunt.

219
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
I'll take a ride.

220
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Okay, get in the car.

221
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Thank you.

222
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
What do you want?

223
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
I'm calling.

224
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Okay, call me.

225
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Hello,

226
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Brother Li.

227
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Brother Gang,

228
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
can you reward me?

229
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Our business this month is very good.

230
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
It's 20% more.

231
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
You've worked hard.

232
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Thank you.

233
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Thank you.

234
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Thank you.

235
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Thank you.

236
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
Thank you.

237
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Can you give me the bonus next month?

238
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,360
The annual bonus this year is a big bonus.

239
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Goodbye.

240
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
Brother,

241
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
the car was lost in the secretary's department.

242
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
The previous room has been forever broken.

243
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Where are they?

244
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,360
They ran out.

245
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:05,080
You still want to keep playing outside?

246
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Yes

247
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,580
Okay, I'll take care of this

248
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,580
Remember to settle this properly

249
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,580
After this, go out and hide

250
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,580
The farther the better

251
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
Okay

252
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,580
Okay

253
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,580
Okay

254
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,580
Found it

255
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,580
Director Deng found it

256
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,580
According to the technical department

257
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,580
The fingerprints found in the white-washed越野車

258
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,580
Are the same as the fingerprints found in the night club's suspect Dan Dan

259
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,580
This person is Qingpi

260
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,580
Wang Guangqing

261
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,580
Born on November 6, 1979

262
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,580
No social security record

263
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,580
No criminal record

264
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,580
October 19th

265
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,580
Is a heart-breaking day

266
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,580
In order to save the young man who fell into the water

267
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,580
The head of the Nanyang branch, Chang Yongjun

268
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,580
Unfortunately drowned

269
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,580
43 years old

270
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,580
He used his life and blood

271
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Vigilantly explained the human nature

272
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,580
The human nature of the young man

273
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,580
The human nature of the young man

274
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,580
The blood was vividly explained

275
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
The responsibility and mission of the people's police

276
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,580
To the public security hero

277
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,580
Isn't it ridiculous?

278
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,580
From the beginning

279
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,580
I've always wanted to be a good cop

280
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,580
For work

281
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,580
No one is beautiful

282
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,580
Never fight

283
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,580
In the end, the one who gave up his life to save

284
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,580
The one who gave up his life to save

285
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,580
This is a man who does nothing

286
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,580
Chang Rui

287
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,580
I understand your feelings

288
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,580
This matter has been going on for so many years

289
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,580
Moreover

290
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,580
You can't say that about your father

291
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
Don't be a bulldog

292
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,580
He's not a good father

293
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,580
Chang Rui

294
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,580
Not a good cop

295
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,580
Not a hero

296
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,580
He's a fool

297
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,580
A big fool

298
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,580
Release it immediately

299
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,580
Follow up

300
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,580
This person has seen him recently?

301
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,580
No

302
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,580
If you see him, report to us

303
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,580
it is good

304
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
Right

305
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
Brother Rui, you are finally here

306
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,580
Sit at the back

307
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
Back of the box

308
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,580
There's a cop

309
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,580
I'm going to the park.

310
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,580
I'm going to the park.

311
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,580
I'm going to the park.

I'm going to the park.

313
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,580
I'm going to the park.

314
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,580
I'm going to the park.

315
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,580
I'm going to the park.

00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,580
I'm going to the park.

317
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
I'm going to the park.

318
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,580
I'm going to the park.

319
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,580
I'm going to the park.

320
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
I'm going to the park.

321
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,580
I'm going to the park.

322
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,580
I'm going to the park.

323
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
I'm going to the park.

It's been so long

342
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,940
Brother Fei

I'm under a wanted

You still know to be wanted

345

The plane is fast

346
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,940
Do you dare to do it

347
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,940
Okay

348
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,940
Okay

349
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,940
These few days

Remember the time and arrive at the dock on time

351
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,940
Brother Fei

352
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,940
This money is a bit less

353
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,940
So little money

354
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,940
Not enough to buy my life

355
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,940
Jing Tian

356
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,940
You know how much I have to take risks to see you today

357
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,940
Don't you know

358
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,940
Take risks

359

Don't you have to come to see me

360
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,940
What are you doing

361
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,940
You just wait for me to be caught by the police

362
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,940
Less money, right

363
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,940
Go to Uncle Zhang

364
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,940

Let's finish it together

369

100,000

373
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,940
I'm afraid you're a man of your life

374
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,940
No life

375
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,940
What do you mean, brother Fei

376
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,940
Is it a woman's net?

377
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,940
Then we'll go in and eat together

378
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,940
You thought you hadn't eaten breakfast in prison

379
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,940
I'll give you a bottle of wine and run away

380
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,940
If you don't trust your family

381
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,940
I will take good care of them for you

382
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,940
Hurry up and go

383
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,940
Don't come back

384
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,940
Otherwise, the wine will be too sweet

385
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,940
I'm going to go

386
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,940
I'm going to go

387
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,940
I'm going to go

388
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,940
I'm going to go

389
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,940
I'm going to go

390
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,940
I'm going to go

391
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,940
I'm going to go

392
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
I'm going to go

393
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,940
I'm going to go

394
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,940
I'm going to go

395
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,940
I'm going to go

396
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,940
I'm going to go

397
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,940
I'm going to go

398
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,940
I'm going to go

399
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,940
I'm going to go

400
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,940
I'm going to go

401
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,940
I'm going to go

402
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,940
I'm going to go

403
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,940
I'm going to go

404
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,940
I'm going to go

405
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,940
I'm going to go

406
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,940
You eat so little

407
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
I'll give you an apple

408
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,940
Mom, I'm thirsty

409
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,940
Pour water for you.

410
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,780
I want to drink.

411
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,540
Okay.

412
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,780
I'll go buy it for you.

413
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,540
Be good.

414
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,940
Have a good rest.

415
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,380
I'm very hungry.

416
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,860
You can't make me wait...

417
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,460
...for the wrap!

418
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,580
Ros sought to joinせ kijki

419
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,280
Our reunion

420
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,400
Buai,bbai

421
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,580
Don't be souit

422
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,580
Give me the knife, Weiwei

423
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,580
Weiwei

424
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,580
Don't do this, Weiwei

425
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,580
What are you doing, Weiwei?

426
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,580
You are safe now, why do you hurt yourself?

427
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,580
Weiwei

428
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,580
I can't go back

429
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,580
I can't go back

430
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,580
There is nothing you can't go back

431
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,580
It's all over

432
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,580
Your friends and family still love you

433
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,580
There is nothing you can't go back

434
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,580
I have my hope in them

435
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,580
They also hope I can continue to go to school

436
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,580
But I am like this now

437
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,580
Everyone will laugh at me

438
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,580
Everyone will look down on me

439
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,580
No one will laugh at you

440
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,580
You are not the one who did wrong

441
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,580
No one will laugh at you

442
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,580
Don't hurt yourself anymore, okay?

443
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,580
What will you do with your mother?

444
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,580
Weiwei

445
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,580
Weiwei, how are you?

446
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,580
Why did you hurt yourself?

447
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,580
I am sorry, Weiwei

448
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,580
I am sorry, I am sorry

449
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,580
I am sorry, I am sorry

450
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,580
I will never force you to do anything

451
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,580
If you don't want to go to school

452
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,580
Then you don't go to school

453
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,580
Okay?

454
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,580
If you want to die

455
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,580
I will die for you

456
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,580
I will die for you, okay?

457
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,580
Don't hurt yourself in front of me anymore, baby

458
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,580
I am sorry, I am sorry

459
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,580
I am sorry

460
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,580
I am sorry

461
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,580
I am sorry

462
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,580
Zheng Anwei is so pitiful

463
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,580
I don't know when I will be able to get the news from Wang Guangqian

464
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,580
Hello

465
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,580
Officer Yang, are you with Director Deng?

466
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,580
Come to the rescue station

467
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,580
Something happened at the edge of the road

468
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,580
Okay, I will be there soon

469
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,580
The rescue station captain called and said that the flat is a bit problematic

470
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,580
He wants me to pick him up

471
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,580
What problem?

472
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,580
I didn't say it clearly

473
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,580
Let's go to the rescue station

474
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,580
Register all the documents

475
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,580
You should write it down

476
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,580
Captain Liu, what's going on?

477
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,580
You are finally here

478
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,580
I have informed the flat that the family is fine

479
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,580
No one came to pick us up

480
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,580
The family is also strange

481
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,580
They don't talk to us

482
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,580
Okay, I will go and have a look

483
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,580
Flat

484
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,580
Do you remember me?

485
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,580
You haven't eaten yet

486
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,580
We haven't eaten either

487
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,580
Do you want to go out for a meal?

488
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,580
No

489
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,580
Director Deng

490
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,580
Why don't you talk to the flat first?

491
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,580
I will try to contact his parents

492
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,580
They won't come

493
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,580
They think I am embarrassing

494
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,580
No, don't say that

495
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,580
You are not embarrassing

496
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,580
You are being deceived

497
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,580
We will explain to your family

498
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,580
That's not what I mean

499
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,580
Sister Jurcha

500
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,580
If I tell you

501
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,580
Will you help me?

502
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,580
Of course

503
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,580
They have been bad to me since I was a child

504
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,580
They gave me a nickname

505
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,580
Zhao Di

506
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,580
I heard from the villagers

507
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,580
That they wanted to have a son

508
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,580
Zhao Di

509
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,580
That's why they gave me this name

510
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,580
They don't let me go to school

511
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,580
They only let me work every day

512
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,580
They hit me often

513
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,580
Once

514
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,580
I went to the classroom

515
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,580
And stopped by

516
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,580
But my father found out

517
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,580
That I was a single woman

518
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,580
I am sorry

519
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,580
I am sorry

520
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,580
I am sorry

521
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,580
I am sorry

522
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,580
I am sorry

523
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,580
I am sorry

524
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,580
I am sorry

525
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,580
I am sorry

526
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,580
I am sorry

527
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,580
I am sorry

528
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,580
I am sorry

529
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,580
I am sorry

530
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,580
I am sorry

531
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,580
I am sorry

532
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,580
I didn't mean potato

533
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,580
I get it

534
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,580
Give it to me

535
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,580
Jiajia

536
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,580
Call Yin

537
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,580
And ask him that we need to take him home

538
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,580
Highlights his parents

539
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,580
and how he is

540
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,380
That's perfect.

541
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,180
Shouldn't you be making more money?

542
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,680
Yes, turns out

543
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,200
Her death is what saved her.

544
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,280
Yes, in the past sometimes

545
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,140
she observed her family or loved your family

546
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,140
What? We didn't do anything wrong

547
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,140
You didn't do anything wrong

548
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,140
We just came to send your daughter home

549
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,140
We didn't do anything wrong

550
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,140
If she's not your daughter, how did we find your family?

551
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,140
She has nothing to do with our family

552
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
I don't want her

553
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,140
You don't want her?

554
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,140
After all, she's your daughter

555
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,140
How can you say no?

556
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,140
She ran away by herself

557
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,140
This bitch

558
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,140
We had to rely on the food and the food

559
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,140
We raised her up and left without a word

560
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,140
You're so heartless

561
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,140
You ran away and you're still here

562
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,140
You have the nerve

563
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,140
You did something shameless

564
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,140
You were arrested by the police

565
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,140
And I had to pick you up

566
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,140
Why should I pick you up?

567
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,140
You have no shame

568
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,140
I have the nerve

569
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,140
What are you yelling at?

570
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,140
She wasn't arrested by the police

571
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,140
She was cheated by the criminal

572
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,140
And she was wronged

573
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
She's not my mother's child

574
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
She's a bastard

575
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,140
Who are you calling a bastard?

576
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,140
Who are you calling a bastard?

577
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,140
Who are you calling a bastard?

578
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,140
Calm down

579
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
What are you doing?

580
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,140
Calm down

581
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Calm down

582
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,140
You're so rude

583
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,140
Li Guoping, tell me clearly

584
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,140
Is she your daughter-in-law?

585
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,140
No, she's our daughter-in-law

586
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,140
Your daughter-in-law?

587
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,140
Do you have any procedure?

588
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,140
I don't know

589
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,140
I don't know

590
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,140
I don't know

591
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,140
I don't know

592
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,140
Do you have any procedure?

593
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Show us

594
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,140
Here's the thing

595
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,140
Let me tell you

596
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,140
I had a miscarriage in the early years

597
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,140
And I couldn't bear it

598
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,140
Later, the old man in the village said

599
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,140
If you have a daughter, you can have a brother

600
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,140
So I took care of her

601
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,140
Where did you get her?

602
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,140
From a distant relative

603
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,140
What's a distant relative?

604
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,140
Where do you live?

605
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,140
I bought it with your money

606
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,140
You're all bastards

607
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,140
I bought it with my money

608
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,140
I didn't steal it

609
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,140
What's wrong?

610
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,140
Do you know that it's illegal to sell children?

611
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,140
No

612
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,140
No way

613
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,140
I didn't buy it

614
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,140
It's a relative's gift

615
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,140
A gift

616
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,140
Okay

617
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,140
First, I'll tell you

618
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,140
The business is all wrong

619
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,140
What's the situation?

620
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,140
You go back to the station with us

621
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,140
We'll investigate it

622
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,140
Take them away

623
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,140
No, I still have a child

624
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,140
I can't go

625
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,140
Son

626
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,140
Son

627
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,140
Son

628
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,140
Son

629
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,140
I don't believe it

630
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,140
Let me go

631
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,140
Director

632
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,140
The DNA has found the result

633
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,140
Pingzhao is not their child

634
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,140
His foster parents have been caught

635
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,140
It was a pheasant

636
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,140
Sold to them

637
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,140
Pheasant again

638
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,140
More than ten years ago

639
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,140
It was the time when children were most desperate

640
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,140
You continue to keep an eye on that side

641
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,140
Jiajia

642
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,140
Check the database

643
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,140
Is there any DNA that matches Pingzhao's?

644
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,140
The mountain village of Beilu in Mengshan

645
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,140
Lost a child in 1998

646
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,140
And this child's DNA

647
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,140
It's exactly the same as Pingzhao's

648
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,140
Soon you can see your biological parents

649
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,140
Beilu

650
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,140
Beilu

651
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,140
Director, this is Lin Jiasun

652
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,640
This is the village director, Lao Bai

653
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Hello, director

654
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,080
The place where Bai Xiujing lives.

655
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
I'll take you up.

656
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,320
Just go there after you find her.

657
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,560
Okay.

658
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,360
That's the place.

659
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,000
Look.

660
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,440
The place where three people stand.

661
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,320
Bai Shengquan.

662
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,800
Hurry up.

663
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,680
Wang Wang is back.

664
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,120
Come on.

665
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,880
Wang Wang is back.

666
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,560
Director Deng.

667
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,600
This is Bai Shengquan,

668
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,320
Xiujing's father.

669
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,880
This is your daughter.

670
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,320
She's back.

671
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,800
Sister.

672
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,400
She's gone.

673
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,360
Brother.

674
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,040
I'm afraid.

675
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
I'm afraid.

676
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,040
It's good that she's back.

677
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,920
It's good that she's back.

678
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,680
It's good that she's back.

679
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,840
All these years.

680
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,720
Your father has been looking for you so hard.

681
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,160
You've been lost for so many years.

682
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,760
We've been looking for you so many times.

683
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,040
It's so big.

684
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,360
It's so sad.

685
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,400
It's good that she's back.

686
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,000
Yes.

687
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,520
I'm sorry.

688
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,440
It's so sad.

689
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,880
Mr. Jin.

690
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,240
You're here so well.

691
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,120
You like my neighbor?

692
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,520
Sister.

693
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,080
Hurry up.

694
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,760
Help me find my neighbor.

695
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,160
Mrs. Jin.

696
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,600
She's back.

697
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,400
Calm down.

698
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:22,760
Calm down.

699
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,240
She's back.

700
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,760
She's back.

701
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,240
She's gone.

702
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,560
Come on.

703
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,360
Where is she?

704
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,160
I...

705
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,840
I'm going to run away.

706
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,760
I'm begging you.

707
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,320
I...

708
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,840
Mrs. Jin.

709
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,120
Calm down, Mrs. Jin.

710
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,720
I...

711
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,560
I told you.

712
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,720
She's like a water gun.

713
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,160
She's over there.

714
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,600
I...

715
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,120
I can turn around.

716
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,040
I'll turn around.

717
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,920
She's gone.

718
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,440
I...

719
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:40,920
I...

720
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:41,960
You...

721
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:42,760
You...

722
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,680
You see my face?

723
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
You see my face?

724
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,480
What are you doing?

725
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,440
Calm down.

726
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,680
I'm begging you.

727
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,360
I'm begging you.

728
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,120
Mrs. Jin.

729
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,040
Calm down.

730
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,280
Calm down.

731
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,240
The police sent us back with the baby.

732
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,840

The gentle moment is the end of the world.

761
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,840
Now we are determined to never look back.

762
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:42,840
The greeting of time is with him.

763
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:50,840
When someone is standing, the time is waiting.

764
00:44:50,840 --> 00:45:00,840
Hugging the time, he will never be late.

765
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:08,840
Just like my heart, he will never be late.

766
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:16,840
The blue heart, he will never be late.
