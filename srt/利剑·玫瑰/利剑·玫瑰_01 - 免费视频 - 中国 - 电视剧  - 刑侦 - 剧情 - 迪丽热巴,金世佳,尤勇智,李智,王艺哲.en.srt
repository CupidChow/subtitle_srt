=Episode 1=

3
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,980
(April 25, 2009.
Night Market District, Linshan City.)

4
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,310
Ma'am.

5
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:28,360
- What is it?
- Ma'am.

6
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,310
I was walking home by myself,

7
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,030
but...

8
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,080
the road to my house is really dark.

9
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,150
I'm scared to go alone.

10
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,680
Could you walk me there?

11
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,630
Sweetie,

12
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,240
it's already so dark out.

13
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,150
Where are your parents?

14
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,710
They're at home.

15
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,310
My house is just over there.

16
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,800
Alright, I'll walk you.

17
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,590
Here, hold my hand.

18
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:15,680
Your grilled skewers are ready.

19
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,590
See you.

20
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,190
It's a little kitty.

21
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,750
Look how cute it is.

22
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,750
Don't be scared.

23
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
Let's go.

24
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,750
We're almost there.

25
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,630
Just up ahead.

26
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,430
That's the building.

27
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,400
Go ahead.

28
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,360
Thank you, ma'am.

29
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,470
Bye!

30
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,150
Get in the van.

31
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,840
Hurry!

32
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,360
(Since the Linshan City Police Bureau)

33
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,600
(launched the special operation)

34
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:03,600
(against the abduction
of women and children,)

35
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,190
(the police have intensified)

36
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,600
(Radio)
(their crackdown)

37
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,133
(on trafficking crimes.)

38
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:09,630
(Several cases have been solved,)

39
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,600
(suspects arrested.)
Aren't you worried?

40
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:12,800
(Fourteen people in total.)

41
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:14,222
(Multiple victims rescued...)

42
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:40,000
(Communication Starts from the Heart)

43
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,444
Come here.

44
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,470
Fafa.

45
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,177
Stay in the car.

46
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,270
Don't get out.

47
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,620
(Number 2)
Move.

48
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,520
Come on!

49
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,590
Hurry, hurry!

50
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
Come on!

51
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,760
Get over here!

52
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,910
Well?

53
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,030
Looks good.

54
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,950
Top-quality stuff, for sure.

55
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,711
So, what do you think?

56
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,270
Quit struggling.

57
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
Feisty one, huh?

58
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,570
Struggle again and I'll cut
your tongue out.

59
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:16,180
You hear me?

60
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,150
Did you hear me?

61
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,470
What's the problem?

62
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,688
Don't damage her, or she
won't be worth anything.

63
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,600
There's nowhere to run.

64
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,830
Listen, just do as you're told.

65
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,510
Cooperate a little,

66
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,088
and it won't be so hard on you.

67
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,310
We're not hurting you.

68
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,750
We're helping you.

69
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,480
Think about it.

70
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,760
We're setting you up
with a rich and powerful man.

71
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,950
If you play your cards right,

72
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,360
you could live the high life.

73
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,390
You'll never have to worry
about money again.

74
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,310
You'll have it all.

75
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,800
Am I right?

76
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,630
Don't be ungrateful.

77
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:06,177
What are you doing? Get over here.

78
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,790
Come here.

79
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
You got a death wish?

80
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,800
I already told you!

81
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:18,377
Just cooperate and you won't suffer.

82
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,680
Since you won't listen,

83
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,240
you leave me no choice.

84
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,630
Fan, the buyer's almost here.

85
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,510
Maybe forget it?

86
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,510
She's too wild.

87
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,266
If she causes trouble,
it won't be worth it.

88
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,390
It's hard enough finding fresh ones.

89
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,177
Come on, keep watch.

90
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,390
Don't be scared.

91
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,822
I'll treat you well.

92
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,840
It's all the same
no matter who you're with, right?

93
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,333
Don't move!

94
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
I'll treat you right.

95
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,000
What are you so afraid of?

96
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,590
Come on.

97
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,600
I said! Come with me!

98
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,090
Let's go!

99
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,270
Stupid girl.

100
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,910
Still acting tough?

101
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,390
Come here!

102
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:36,977
You got a death wish?

103
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,320
Still acting tough?

104
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,680
Still acting tough?

105
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,266
You think you're tough?

106
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,440
Do you?

107
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,630
Do you?

108
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,777
Come on, talk. Say something...

109
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,110
It's okay. You're safe now.

110
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,280
Look at me.

111
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,200
Look at me.

112
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,680
You're safe now. It's over.

113
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:11,790
Come on, don't be scared.

114
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,900
I'll take this off for you.

115
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,200
Don't be afraid.

116
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,270
When we go out, hold my hand.

117
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,630
When you see a chance, run.

118
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,755
As soon as you're out,
call the police, got it?

119
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,244
Don't be afraid.

120
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,577
Where's Bai?

121
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,844
Mind your own business.

122
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,750
Fan, that girl escaped!

123
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,590
Go!

124
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,360
Hide under the table.

125
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,230
Quick!

126
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,440
Fan!

127
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,160
Fan!

128
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,110
Run!

129
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,520
Hit her! Now!

130
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,630
Let go of me!

131
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,590
Let me go!

132
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,480
Let go!

133
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,360
Who told you to run?

134
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,977
I'll beat you to death!

135
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,670
Who are you, really?

136
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,980
(One Hour Earlier)

137
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,320
Jiajia, what's the situation?

138
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,510
Captain Han, all units are in position.

139
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,533
Everything looks normal.

140
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,688
What about Chang Rui's side?

141
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:45,555
(Linshan PGIS Application Platform)
Nothing suspicious on his side either.

142
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:46,777
Did you bring it?

143
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,560
Just in case.

144
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,770
Let's move.

145
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,840
Is your boss here yet?

146
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,480
On the way.

147
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,320
Xiangzi.

148
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,510
You stay here.

149
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:24,590
She's wearing a hood.

150
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,244
Can't tell if it's Zhou Min.

151
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,533
Looks like the big fish
is about to bite.

152
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,720
Should we move in closer?

153
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,440
No, wait.

154
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,630
Stay calm.

155
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,177
Wait until they start the deal.

156
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:41,288
A girl just ran out.

157
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,960
Yan Lei.

158
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:53,688
Take a team and intercept.

159
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,266
Make sure the victim is safe.

160
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,110
Yes, Sir.

161
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:58,110
Scream, will you?

162
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,400
Who are you, really?

163
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,650
Tell Mr. Yin,

164
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,822
we've got a new situation.

165
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,960
A girl escaped!

166
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,150
There's another girl inside.

167
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,960
Please, save her.

168
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:14,911
She says there's another girl inside.

169
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,440
Everyone, move in.

170
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:19,720
There's another victim inside.

171
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,422
(SWAT)
Ensure the victim's safety.

172
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,230
Where's the girl?

173
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Where's my merchandise?

174
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
Get her back, now!

175
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,550
That's my money!

176
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,910
- Cops!
- It's the cops!

177
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:00,910
Freeze!

178
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,750
Don't move!

179
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:02,870
Stop!

180
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,120
- Stop!
- Stop!

181
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,390
Back off!

182
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,350
Everyone, step back!

183
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,550
Put your guns down!

184
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,440
Or I'll kill her!

185
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,240
Who's in charge?

186
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:28,222
Ask him to come here.

187
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,080
Now!

188
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,510
Vice Director Yin.

189
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,600
The suspect is inside.

190
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,440
He's taken a hostage.

191
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,880
You!

192
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,870
Get me a car!

193
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,870
Full tank!

194
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,920
Right now!

195
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,040
Move!

196
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,888
Go. Execute Plan B.

197
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,920
Yes, Sir.

198
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,240
Rui!

199
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,200
Are you okay?

200
00:16:55,711 --> 00:16:56,288
Don't move.

201
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,160
Take him away.

202
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,510
Go.

203
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,470
What just happened?

204
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,240
How should I know?

205
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,200
The car's ready for you.

206
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,280
Come out.

207
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,240
I'm warning you!

208
00:17:09,422 --> 00:17:10,866
Don't play games with me!

209
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,270
Or I'll kill her.

210
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,360
All units,

211
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,330
put down your weapons.

212
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,040
Fall back.

213
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,688
Move.

214
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,390
Back up!

215
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,350
Back up more!

216
00:18:01,222 --> 00:18:02,160
- Let go!
- Don't move!

217
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,000
Let me go!

218
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,110
Let go...

219
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,720
The hostage...

220
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,000
Are you alright?

221
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,110
I'm fine.

222
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,110
I'm a police officer too.

223
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,555
Deng Yan, from the Provincial Bureau.

224
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,550
What are you doing here?

225
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,480
What's your name?

226
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:31,870
Where do you live?

227
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,520
Not talking?

228
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm a police officer.

229
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,266
Let me take you home, okay?

230
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,320
Stop her!

231
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,830
Let go of me!

232
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,600
Sweetie.

233
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,440
Let go of me!

234
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,070
Sweetie.

235
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,000
Let me go now!

236
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,840
Listen to me.

237
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,830
We're the police.

238
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,030
We won't hurt you, okay?

239
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:51,533
Go with the officer first.

240
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,480
Take her away.

241
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,000
Let me go!

242
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,430
Be quiet!

243
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,733
Head down, move!

244
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,430
Move it!

245
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,390
Get them in the van!

246
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,800
Move.

247
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,800
Get in.

248
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:12,577
Did we catch the handler?

249
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,110
No.

250
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,590
What on earth happened?

251
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:19,329
I'm not sure either.

252
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,109
But it seems one of the victims

253
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,422
is from the Secretariat Division
of the Provincial Bureau.

254
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:27,555
Why would someone from
the Provincial Bureau be here?

255
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,320
No idea.

256
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,230
Where is she now?

257
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,444
Gone to give a statement.

258
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:07,180
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

259
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,244
(People's Republic of China - Police)

260
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,480
Chief Xiao.

261
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,200
I know I disrupted
the Anti-abduction Office's operation,

262
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,240
but the girl was in danger.

263
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,960
As a police officer, I had to act.

264
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,590
Deng,

265
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,440
the safety of the people
always comes first.

266
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,155
I trust your judgment.

267
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,866
Come on. Let's go
to the Anti-abduction Office.

268
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,110
Captain Han.

269
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,550
What?

270
00:20:55,577 --> 00:20:56,933
Deng Yan from the Provincial Bureau

271
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:58,822
is getting parachuted in
as our new director.

272
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,977
Keep your voice down.

273
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:01,777
Close the door.

274
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,400
I have an announcement.

275
00:21:06,644 --> 00:21:08,240
This is a decision from the committee.

276
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,350
Deng Yan

277
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:11,920
will be appointed Director
of the Anti-abduction Office.

278
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,790
She previously served as a section chief
in the Provincial Bureau Secretariat.

279
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,310
I hope everyone will cooperate with her.

280
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,680
She worked in an admin role,

281
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,920
but we're on the front lines here.

282
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,720
We investigate every case in person,

283
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,200
bit by bit, on the ground.

284
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,240
She's got no experience.

285
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,000
Working under her? That's a joke.

286
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,950
Deng Yan,

287
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:38,600
the Anti-abduction Office is yours now.

288
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:40,569
Then tell me,

289
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,200
who do you think should lead the office?

290
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,510
Definitely Vice Director Yin.

291
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:45,733
He has the experience,
the skill, and the seniority.

292
00:21:45,777 --> 00:21:47,066
He's the most qualified.

293
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,960
I just don't understand

294
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:50,640
what the higher-ups were thinking.

295
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,950
Welcome, welcome!

296
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,430
Welcome aboard!

297
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,030
Thank you.

298
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,600
Well...

299
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,022
Let's all introduce ourselves.

300
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:57,222
No need for introductions.

301
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,120
I've already

302
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,550
gotten to know all of you.

303
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,670
Yan Lei.

304
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,720

Chang Rui.

306
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,520
Yang Jiajia.

307
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,480
And Mr. Yin.

308
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:06,960
I'm new to anti-abduction work.

309
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,440
I'll be counting on your support.

310
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,670
I object to this.

311
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,840
Objection overruled.

312
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,640
Director Deng's appointment

313
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,590
was posted internally a week ago.

314
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,880
If you didn't bother
to read the updates,

315
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,790
don't complain now.

316
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,110
Listen, Chang Rui,

317
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,090
if you have a problem,
take it up with Chief Xiao.

318
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,920
I'm just following orders.

319
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,350
Understood?

320
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,720
Anything else?

321
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,870
Right, Mr. Yin.

322
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Bring me

323
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,310
the old unsolved cases.

324
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,720
Sure.

325
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,910
This way.

326
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,030
You sit here.

327
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,750
I'll have the rest prepared for you.

328
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
Lei, Rui,

329
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,030
isn't she the victim of that raid?

330
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,590
That's her?

331
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,200
Do you know how hard

332
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,240
we worked on the Zhou Min case?

333
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,790
We built such an elaborate setup

334
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,790
all to catch the man behind it.

335
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,830
Then she came in

336
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,680
and ruined everything!

337
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,200
I just don't get it.

338
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,240
How could someone like her
be our director?

339
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,680
Watch your mouth.

340
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,000
This isn't like you.

341
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,590
What do you mean?

342
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,840
Who are you?

343
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,000
Who are you?

344
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:37,150
What are you doing here?

345
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
What are you doing here?

346
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,920
Stop copying me.

347
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,400
You stop copying me.

348
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,110
Chang Rui.

349
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,720
Did you see a little girl?

350
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,560
About this tall?

351
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,080
Shh...

352
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,560
Wearing two braids?

353
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,720
Yeah.

354
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,110
Shh...

355
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,910
Here she is.

356
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,430
She ran over here?

357
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,520
Is it her?

358
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,080
Look.

359
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,670
Is it her?

360
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,430
That's her.

361
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,390
Who is she?

362
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,480
We brought her back
during yesterday's raid.

363
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,109
- What's she doing here?
- Let go of me!

364
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,333
- Let me go right now!
- We couldn't find her parents.

365
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:16,390
So we had to bring her in.

366
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,750
Let go of me!

367
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,560
The welfare center?

368
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,830
They came to pick her up,

369
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,320
but when I looked away, she was gone.

370
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,430
Stand still.

371
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,550
Let go!

372
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,070
- Let go of me!
- Come on, Fafa.

373
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,200
Just answer a few questions,
and you can go home.

374
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,070
I'm not going!

375
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,680
Come on,

376
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,480
be good.

377
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,880
Okay?

378
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,310
Let's go.

379
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,030
You big meanie!

380
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,160
You'll pay for this!

You're not welcome here.

386
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,240
Leave.

Mr. Lin.

388
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,200
Please let us speak with Madam Zhang.

389
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,240
What for?

390
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,640
She was perfectly fine.

391
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,270
Now she's completely broken.

392
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,720
You came to laugh at us, didn't you?

393
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,510
Our Ranran was always timid.

394
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,844
She never wandered off on her own.

395
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,200
It was because of your daughter

396
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,240
that we lost Ranran.

397
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,310
It was your fault.

398
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,790
She's just a child.

399
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,955
She didn't know any better.

400
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,710
Exactly.

401
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,830
She's young. She didn't
understand anything.

402
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,310
Mr. Lin, if you must blame someone,
blame us.

403
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:51,244
We'll make amends on her behalf.

404
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,320
Alright, then.

405
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,440
Go find Ranran and bring her back.

406
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,200
My wife went through so much

407
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,510
to give birth to her.

408
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,640
Make amends?

409
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,177
How are you going to make amends?

413
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,400
Why did you come out?

414
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,110
Ask them to leave.

415
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,110

416
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,800

427
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,160
She didn't come in.

428
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,640
Maybe she thought we were
closed for the day.

429
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,080
Alright.

430

486
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,720
Here you go.

487
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,840
Thank you.

488
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,270
Here's five yuan.

489
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,200
It went up one yuan this year.

490

That will be six yuan.

491

492
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,830

494

495
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,720

505

00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,920
I'm not a bad guy, it's just...

531

I have a little sister.
She's only 12 years old.

532

533
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,480
Oh, I see.

534
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,350
Yeah, so...

535
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,680
I'm really bad at picking stuff,
so could you help me buy it?

536
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,310
Thanks.

537
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,666

Okay.

539

Okay.

540

541

No need to thank me.

547

It's really no trouble.

548
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,270
It's fine. You helped me out.

549
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,577
It's just one yuan. No big deal.

550
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,430
Keep it.

551
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,390

I'm fine.

560
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,520
Okay.

561
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,310
That stuff is hard, isn't it?

562
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:03,377

563
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,860

00:33:24,444 --> 00:33:25,577
How many days has it been?

571
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,790
One month and 13 days.

572
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,110
And traffickers are still

573
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,440
bold enough to strike downtown

574
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,270
and harm society.

575
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,160
The footage is way too blurry.

576
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,000
But judging by how he moved,

577
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,960
this guy's definitely done it before.

578
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,870
Also,

579
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,510
anyone doing this kind of thing
in Linshan

580
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,444
probably knows the others in the game.

581
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
That's a good lead.

582
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,870
Officer Chang Rui,

583
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,470
what do you think?

584
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,950
Me?

585
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,710
No comments.

586
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,550
I just follow orders.

587
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,888
Alright, here's the plan.
Jiajia, Mr. Yin.

588
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,960
Interrogate Zhao Liang.

589
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,760
Yan Lei, you take Hu Xifan.

590
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,320
You and Officer Chang Rui

591
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,480
go to visit the scene.

592
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,320
Let's split up.

593
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,430
Alright.

594
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,030
This place doesn't look like it has

595
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,510
any clear surveillance footage.

596
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,110
Great, another wasted trip.

597
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:11,840
Wasted or not, we had to come.

598
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,266
You know how it is. New boss, new broom.

599
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,630
Where?

600
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,733
That shop right there.

601
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,280
Mister.

602
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:32,955
What do you need?

603
00:35:32,955 --> 00:35:33,680
Hello.

604
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,320
Could you recall

605
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,800
around 11 PM last night,

606
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,230
did a man and woman

607
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,577
come here to buy something?

608
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,400
What's your relationship
with Zhao Liang?

609
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:42,120
Zhao Liang?

610
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,200
Yes, Zhao Liang.

611
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,960
He's the one who kidnaps people.

612
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,150
That's his thing.

613
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,160
I just...

614
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,590
I just connect him
with some clients, that's all.

615
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,280
Earn a small referral fee, nothing more.

616
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,439
I've got nothing to do with it.

617
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,110
(Linshan City Detention Center)
Hu Xifan.

618
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:55,600
I'm going to ask you one last time.

619
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:57,844
What's your relationship
with Zhao Liang?

620
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,600
And

621
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,150
do you remember the girl

622
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,355
you kidnapped last night?

623
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,230
Pretty face.

624
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,120
Very pretty.

625
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,550
She looked

626
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,190
25-26 years old.

627
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,030
I'm telling you,

628
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,200
the plan was to grab

629
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,630
someone 13-14 years old.

630
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:18,533
The deal fell through
at the last minute.

631
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,800
Then this dumb mule

632
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,480
walked right into our hands.

633
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,430
That face,

634
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,590
and that figure...

635
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,422
At the very least,
she's premium merchandise.

636
00:36:27,444 --> 00:36:28,755
We've hit the jackpot.

637
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,710
She's actually a police officer.

638
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,190
You know what it means
to kidnap a officer, right?

639
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,200
Think hard.

640
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,070
This is your last chance to come clean.

641
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,360
No, no... I'll talk!

642
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,130
I...

643
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
I have a handler.

644
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,200
He's called...

645
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,030
He's called

646
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,280
Whiteboard.

647
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,510
The police already questioned me
this morning.

648
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,666
I even gave them
the surveillance footage.

649
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,110
We get lots of customers every day.

650
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,000
It was late.

651
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,030
Honestly, I didn't get a clear look.

652
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,320
Whose black car is that?

653
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,760
No idea.

654
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,230
It's been parked there for days.

655
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,720
How do you know?

656
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,320
I've been working in the shop,

657
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,920
and playing near it with my classmates
these past few days.

658
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:22,950
Let's go.

659
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,860
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

660
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,360
According to Zhao Liang's statement,

661
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,880
(Zhao Liang, Bald, Trafficker/Transport)
he was working under Hu Xifan.

662
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,000
(Hu Xifan, "Doctor")
He followed all orders from Hu.

663
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But beyond that,
he claims to know nothing.

664
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,630
Hu Xifan, however, admitted

665
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,230
that Whiteboard is his handler.

666
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,133
(Whiteboard)
Apparently, Whiteboard once said

667
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:40,190
he had a big job coming up,

668
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,444
one he'd handle personally.

669
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,110
And he prefers using

670
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,280
sedatives.

671
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,280
Well,

672
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,320
that matches the Zheng Weiwei case.

673
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,230
(Victims: Zhou Min, Zheng Weiwei)

674
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,320
If we can prove

675
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,670
that Whiteboard was involved
in the Zheng Weiwei case,

676
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,510
then we can apply

677
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,133
to combine that case with Zhou Min's.

678
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,960
But right now, in the Zheng Weiwei case,

679
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,760
we don't have concrete evidence tying it

680
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,280
directly to Whiteboard.

681
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,022
And the surveillance footage
is so blurry.

682
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:08,280
Hu Xifan couldn't confirm

683
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,666
whether he is Whiteboard or not.

684
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:24,260
(Hotel Parking Lot)

685
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,480
Contact the car owner.

686
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,320
On it.

687
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,280
Do you recognize this man?

688
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,200
Sit down.

689
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,240
Yes.

690
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,000
That's him. That's Whiteboard.

691
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,800
He's the ringleader.

692
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,320
I was just a follower.

693
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,550
Whatever he told us to do, we did.

694
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,590
So, Officer,

695
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,400
if I tell you everything I know,

696
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:57,880
can I...

697
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,000
Just answer our questions.

698
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,510
Sure, I'll answer your questions.

699
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,288
Have you seen this girl before?

700
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,710
I... don't remember.

701
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,030
Think carefully.

702
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,550
Take a good look.

703
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,360
I think

704
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,760
it was about a month ago.

705
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,200
Well...

706
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,840
I checked...

707
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,440
No, no...

708
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,510
Well, I...

709
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,440
I...

710
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,880
I think I saw that girl.

711
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,110
Then Whiteboard came and took her away.

712
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,320
As for where they went,

713
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
I really don't know.

714
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,400
According to Hu Xifan's confession,

715
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:05,911
the man who abducted Zheng Weiwei
in the video was Whiteboard.

716
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:06,955
Bai Wentao.

717
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:08,888
The big fish we tried to catch
last time.

718
00:40:09,266 --> 00:40:11,200
(Case Connection Diagram: Whiteboard)
Now it's confirmed,

719
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Zheng Weiwei's case
is also tied to Whiteboard.

720
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,150
So I suggest we merge
the Zheng Weiwei case

721
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,990
with Zhou Min's.

722
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,390
Okay.

723
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,760
That means your team

724
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,670
needs to find Whiteboard
as quickly as possible.

725
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,400
Based on what we know so far,

726
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,590
he has more than just

727
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,880
Zhou Min and Zheng Weiwei in his hands.

728
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,360
I approve of merging the two cases.

729
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,420
(Han Liang)

730
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,600
Everyone,

731
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:36,760
Captain Han has approved

732
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,670
merging the Zheng Weiwei
and Zhou Min cases.

733
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,150
Whiteboard is now our primary suspect.

734
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,630
To catch him,

735
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,030
we need more evidence against him.

736
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,000
Mr. Yin,

737
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,320
go dig through older cases.

738
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,710
See if any tie back to Whiteboard.

739
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,840
Got it.

740
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,400
Jiajia, go through the footage,

741
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,244
and see if anything matches Whiteboard.

742
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:53,000
Yes.

743
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,110
Chang Rui, you've got a wide network.

744
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:57,200
See if you can dig up leads
on Whiteboard.

745
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,430
Yan Lei.

746
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,600
Ai Xin. You two
go question Zhao Liang again.

747
00:41:01,622 --> 00:41:02,350
Okay.

748
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,720
Officer,

749
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,070
I don't know anything.

750
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,120
Whiteboard.

751
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,680
Do you know him well?

752
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,470
White...

753
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,160
Zhao Liang.

754
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,510
Hu Xifan already confessed.

755
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,670
Whiteboard is your handler.

756
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,880
If you want to redeem yourself,

757
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,840
you'd better come clean now.

758
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,160
Okay, I'll talk.

759
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,840
I'll talk.

760
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,320
It's true.

761
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,800
Whiteboard is my handler.

762
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,630
Hu and I

763
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,070
were just his runners.

764
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,870
But

765
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,230
I didn't deal with him much.

766
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,440
I don't even know his real name.

767
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,800
Seriously.

768
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,350
What else?

769
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,840
That little girl you brought in,

770
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,280
Fafa.

771
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,150
She calls Whiteboard "Dad".

772
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,630
So she must be his daughter, right?

773
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,880
She's always with him.

774
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,711
She must know a lot.

775
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,240
I think

776
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,280
you guys should question that kid.

777
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,980
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

778
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,720
According to Zhao Liang,

779
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,360
Fafa was adopted by Whiteboard.

780
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,630
So I'm thinking,

781
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,150
maybe through Fafa,

782
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,280
we can learn something about Whiteboard.

783
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,320
But Fafa

784
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,760
has lived with Whiteboard all her life.

785
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,030
Her personality's strange.

786
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,190
She even thinks we police
are the bad guys.

787
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:30,920
I'm a police officer.

788
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,030
Let me take you home, okay?

789
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,240
Stop her!

790
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,710
Let me go!

791
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,430
Sweetie...

792
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,480
I think

793
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,110
it'll be really hard to get anything

794
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,230
out of her about Whiteboard.

795
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,110
But don't you all find it odd?

796
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,920
A trafficker like Whiteboard,

797
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,155
how could he legally adopt a child?

798
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,800
Or is the child

799
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,230
a relative's kid?

800
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,070
That's impossible.

801
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,480
Maybe

802
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,110
Fafa

803
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,360
