00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:44,502
We can run an investigation

7
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,288
and see if there are any old reports

8
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,955
that suit Fafa's case.

21
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,390
Why are you sitting on the ground?

22
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,520
Isn't it cold?

23
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,640
I brought you a small gift.

24
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,150
Here you go.

25
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,040
Is this your bear?

26
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,510
I brought it back for you.

27
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,760
Check and see if it's yours.

28
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,230
You treasure this bear so much.

29

Who gave it to you?

30
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,360
Let me examine your wound.

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,110
I have everything

32
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,830
in the pockets of my treasure box.

33
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,150
Look.

34
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,840
Let me put it on you.

35
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,270
The pain will go away immediately.

There are also cartoons on it.

Do you want to try my magic?

38
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:18,880
It doesn't hurt anymore.

39
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,910
You must listen to me next time.

If you don't listen to me,

41
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:24,680

Are you going to catch my father?

Speak.

51
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,950
Apparently, Whiteboard

52
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,880
is a gambling addict.

53
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:26,560
He usually gambles at places

54
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,830

55
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,760

Which games do you want to play?

59
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,030
I'll do this.

2,000 yuan maximum.

67
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,710

is a gambling addict.

70
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:24,569
Investigate the entertainment cities

- Jiajia.
- and underground casinos.

72
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,521
Don't miss out on any clues.

73
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,960
Understood.

74
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,950
Also, contact Chang Rui

75
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,240
and convey the news to him.

76
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,950
Ask him to investigate the casino lead.

77
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,150
Yes.

78
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,590
Make a record.

81
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,680
I found it.

82
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,244
Whiteboard is a gambling addict.

83
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,240
I'm currently following this lead now.

84
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,000
Rui,

85
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,270
Director just called us.

86
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,680
She said something similar to you

87
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,270
and asked us to investigate
casinos and entertainment cities.

88
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:59,022
Not only do I know
that Whiteboard is a gambling addict,

89
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,640
but I also know which casino he's at.

90
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Let me scout ahead first.

91
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,120
Sure.

92
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:07,030
Are these two competing with each other?

93
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,270
Seems like it.

94
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,600
Hello. Who is it?

95
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,510
If you're awake,

96
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,350
come and play.

97
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,110
A game hosted by Xie.

98
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,030
Which Xie?

99
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,000
The guy who's been playing generously.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,080
He's hosting a game on the hills.

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,750
I'm not going.

102
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,590
I'm poor.

103
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
More reason to come.

104
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,910
I'm telling you.

105
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,360
This is a great opportunity.

106
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,390
If you gamble today,

107
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,911
there are no limits to your winnings.

108
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't blame me for not notifying you.

109
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,030
Sure.

110
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,390

111
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,240

Open!

113
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,040
Odd or even?

114
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,890
Even!

115
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,770

There's no mistake!

118
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,360
Five.

119
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,320

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,990
Thank you!

122
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,960
Buy!

123
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,080
Buy!

124
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,710
Even!

125
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,280
Even again!

126
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,110
Odd again!

127
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,080
Even!

Six.

132
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,320
Eight.

133
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,830
Nine, odd.

134
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,470
This doesn't count!

Dafeng.

136
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,830
Show some respect.

137
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,400
Respect is worth nothing.

138
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,440
Besides, why should I show you respect?

139
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,560
If you like, keep playing.

140
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,630
Otherwise, get lost.

141
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,120

Let's not offend him.

145
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,710
You spend money
on food, wine and entertainment.

146
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:03,311

that lets you spend and make money.

Don't spoil the rules.

149
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:12,111
I'll pay for your losses
in the previous game.

150
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:15,400
Give the money back to that person.

151
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,790
This money...

152

Feng.

153
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,870
He is rich

154
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:29,288
and he has a powerful background.

155
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,630
Thank you, Xie!

156
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,200
Bring the chair.

157
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,440
Come on!

158
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,320
Keep playing!

159

Come on!

160
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,110
Place your bets!

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,080
Let me introduce myself.

167
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,680
I am Xie.

168
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,080
I just came to Linshan

169
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,990
and I want to do some business here.

170
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,360
I was the one

171
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,466
who hosted the game today

172
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,000
because I wanted

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,840
to make some friends.

174
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,280
We are all out here

175
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,280
to make money.

176
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,320
But have you two thought about this?

177
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,870
Why do some people make money,

178
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
and even a lot of money,

179
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,040
but some people

180
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,710
only work all day

181
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:47,377
just to lose everything?

182
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,080
You cheated?

183
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,000
This is the money

184
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,280
both of you lost here tonight.

185
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,040
I added some money

186
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:05,230
to make it a round number.

187
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,280
What do you think?

188
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,520
Can we be friends?

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,870
I am Bai.

190
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,590
I am Zhao Dafeng.

194

In my experience,

195
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,200
making money

196
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,200
is not about one's ability

197
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:33,688
but who one partners with sometimes.

198
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,350
I hope you can help me.

199
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,920
Let's make it big

200
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,990
in Linshan

201
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:42,590
and make money together.

202
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,580
(Banker Wins)

203
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,080
Vice Director Yin,

204
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:51,311
I notice someone else
besides Whiteboard.

205
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,440
He also has a partner
called Zhao Dafeng.

206
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,510
Zhao Dafeng?

207
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,110
I've never heard of this person.

208
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:58,577
I think they are working together.

209
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,630
I suspect they are
an organized kidnapping group.

210
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,800
I want to extend the line.

211
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,440
The priority now

212
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,990
is to find Zhou Min
and Zheng Weiwei immediately.

213
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,990
I understand.

214
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,440
I've spread the news.

215
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,022
There will be updates soon.

216
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,110
Director Deng.

217
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,710
Chang Rui called

218
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,160
and said he has found Whiteboard.

219
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,950
He also noticed another person

220
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,160
called Zhao Dafeng.

221
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,790
Zhao Dafeng?

222
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,630
There might be

223
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,440
a bigger target behind them,

224
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:38,800
so he is not in a rush
to make the arrest right now.

225
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,390
I asked him

226
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,630
to search for

227
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,155
Zhou Min and Zheng Weiwei soon.

228
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,710
All right. I understand.

229
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:46,422
I'll report to Captain Han later.

230
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,320
All right.

231
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,110
Zhao Dafeng...

232
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,460
(June 18, 2009,
Linshan City Forest Park)

233
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,630
All right.

234
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,630
Be good.

235
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,590
What a good boy.

236
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,110
Someone! Come quickly!

237
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,720
Are there any doctors around?

238
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,150
Call 120!

239
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,680
Help me call 120!

240
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,800
Hello, emergency services?

241
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,160
Someone has passed out here.

242
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,288
Hello, Anti-abduction Office.

243
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,990
All right. I'll head over immediately.

244
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:36,439
Director, I received a report.

245
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,080
A baby boy is missing at the Central
Garden Square in Xinmin Street.

246
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:40,280
We need to deploy immediately.

247
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:43,977
Ai Xin, stay here.

248
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:44,439
All right.

249
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,700
How long has the baby been missing?

250
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,420
Less than an hour.

251
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:48,670
(Linshan City Police Station)
Contact the Command Center.

252
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,990
(A child is missing
at the Central Garden on Xinmin Street.)

253
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,750
(Activate Blue Contingency Plan now.)

254
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,470
(1201. This is 1101.)

255
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,870
I have activated

256
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:58,266
the Blue Contingency Plan
to search for a missing child.

257
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,710
Surrounding police forces
have been deployed.

258
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,140
(Xinmin Street Central Garden Square)

259
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,888
Every patrol in the city
has been informed.

260
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:06,990
Report your current location.

261
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,870
Command Center,

262
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,680
Traffic Team 1 is on Hongyang Street.

263
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:11,230
Traffic Team 3 is on Qinghe Road.

264
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:13,150
Traffic Team 4 is on
Haitang Road Section 2.

265
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:15,160
We are heading to the destination. Over.

266
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,630
1101. This is 1201.

267
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,911
We will arrive on the scene soon.

268
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,222
Please activate
the Level 2 Response Plan immediately.

269
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,680
1202, Level 2 Response Plan
has been activated.

270
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:27,022
When you arrive on the scene,

271
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:29,155
learn about the details
and report them immediately.

272
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:30,040
Roger.

273
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,320
Director Deng. Vice Director Yin.

274
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:38,569
The time of the crime
was half an hour ago.

275
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,030
The child's grandmother was pushing
a stroller on their way home.

276
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,080
She saw someone pass out...

277
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:42,960
Everyone, calm down.

278
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,150
(She was a doctor.)
I'm a doctor.

279
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,660
(So she rushed to give first aid.)
Let me take a look.

280
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,590
When she went back,
the child was missing.

281
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,630
Everyone, please make way.

282
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,840
Please make way.

283
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,080
Can you hear me?

284
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,840
I checked her.

285
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,680
She's unconscious.

286
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,680
Where's my grandson?

287
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,040
Where's Little Spud?

288
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,120
Did anyone see him?

289
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,080
A boy.

290
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,590
Did you see him?

291
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,400
Call the police.

292
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:14,177
Call the police.

293
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:15,110
Little Spud!

294
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,990
Little Spud!

295
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,550
Everyone was focused

296
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,030
on the first aid

297
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,600
and no one saw any suspicious person.

298
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,550
The child's grandmother is very anxious.

299
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,830
She can't even speak clearly now.

300
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,630
Jiajia, check the cameras.

301
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,030
Yes.

302
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,670
Lei,

303
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,990
comfort the family members

304
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:33,350
and find out about the child.

305
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,510
You must

306
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,066
seize the critical first three hours.

307
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,920
Make haste.

308
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,230
Mrs. Lin.

309
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,320
Yan...

310
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,750
Yan.

311
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,680
I lost my grandson.

312
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,470
Mrs. Lin.

313
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,750
Yan.

314
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,990
You are a police officer.

315
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,040
You must help me.

316
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,190
I watched you grow up.

317
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,640
You must help me find my grandson.

318
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,680
I beg you.

319
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,350
Please.

320
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,480
Don't do this.

321
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,440
We are here

322
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,110
to help you find your grandson.

323
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,800
Do you know her?

324
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:16,088
She is my mother's colleague.

325
00:17:17,022 --> 00:17:18,150
I'll leave her to you, then.

326
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:22,511
Keep a close eye on her.

327
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,280
Calm down, Mrs. Lin.

328
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,960
Tell me about your grandson.

329
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,430
My grandson is Lin Yangyu.

330
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,070
He was born

331
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,960
on the 21st of January, 2009.

332
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,280
Have you searched the surroundings?

333
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,659
Our colleagues and patrol officers

334
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,700
have searched the garden
and the surrounding areas.

335
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,420
Have you informed
the other family members?

336
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:43,311
I have.

337
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,950
Yan.

338
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,190
You'll surely find the child, right?

339
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,480
You'll find him today.

340
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,150
You'll surely find him, right?

341
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,150
Don't worry.

342
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,590
We'll do our best.

343
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,280
Mom!

344
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,210
- Mom! Where's Little Spud?
- What happened?

345
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,480
Little Spud couldn't even walk!

346
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,350
How did he go missing?

347
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,240
What happened?

348
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,800
Sorry!

349
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,110
Sorry!

350
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,430
Are they police officers?

351
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,350
Why are you all standing here?

352
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,880
Go and find the child!

353
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,510
Madam,

354
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,270
we are searching the safety
and traffic cameras around the area

355
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,970
to find any suspicious vehicles
and people.

356
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:19,040
(Calm down. We will do our best.)

357
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,580
(Central Garden)

358
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:29,129
(Central Garden)

359
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,400
Which department do you come from?

360
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,640
We are from Anti-abduction Office.

361
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:32,920
Don't worry. We'll find the child.

362
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,680
I don't care where you come from!

363
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,070
Don't just stand here!

364
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,110
Go find the child!

365
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,680
Find him!

366
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,260
Easy. We are doing
our best to investigate.

367
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,300
Please cooperate with us
and give us your testimony

368
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,760
so we can get more information, okay?

369
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,040
Let's go.

370
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:44,480
Yan Lei.

371
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,160
Let's go, hurry!

372
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,560
This way.

373
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,520
Let's go.

374
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,720
Mom!

375
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,910
Director Deng.

376
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:02,933
Is this your first time
coming to the scene?

377
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:08,800
This usually happens
for Anti-kidnapping officers.

378
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,520
We understand
how the family members feel.

379
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:13,422
However, there's no choice.

380
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,280
Many things usually happen at once.

381
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:18,040
It's easy to charge into battle,

382
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:20,911
but it's difficult to communicate
with the family members of a victim.

383
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,729
Director Deng. Vice Director Yin.

384
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,200
I've connected
with Command Center.

385
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,244
They are also investigating.

386
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:30,200
I've confirmed the situation.

387
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:32,680
It happened suddenly and everyone
wanted to save that person.

388
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,355
So, no one paid attention to the child.

389
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,888
Did you check the parents' background?

390
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,800
I did.

391
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:37,960
They have simple backgrounds

392
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,080
with no enemies.

393
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,960
Director, look.

394
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,350
This vehicle had been
parked at a blind spot

395
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,900
since it entered the garden.

396
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,180
(Central Garden)
Check when the car left the garden.

397
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:57,940
(Central Garden)

398
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:02,690
It was when Dr. Lin
was rescuing the patient.

399
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,390
Zoom in on the plate.

400
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,000
South C C0Y30.

401
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,280
This model.

402
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,333
Check the license plates.

403
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,270
The plate is registered to a sedan

404
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,200
and not an SUV.

405
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,329
This is a fake license plate.

406
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,070
We'll go after the car
while investigating.

407
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,720
Command Center.

408
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,110
We've found the suspect vehicle.

409
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:28,880
License Plate.

410
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,870
South C C0Y30.

411
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,540
(Heading towards Longshan West Road)

412
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,550
The suspect vehicle is now on
Longshan West Road.

413
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,777
It is driving out of the city.

414
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,110
Deploy all patrol vehicles
around Longshan Road.

415
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:43,321
Longshan West Road?

416
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,000
(Linshan PGIS Application Platform)

417
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,844
This vehicle
has been driving on rural roads

418
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:48,110
to avoid our checkpoints.

419
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,155
This must be our target.

420
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,800
South C C0Y30!

421
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,910
Pull over!

422
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,190
C0Y30!

423
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,920
Pull over!

424
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,870
Why are the police here?

425
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,440
Shu.

426
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,000
Can you stop him from crying?

427
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,430
The car in front.

428
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,560
C0Y30! Pull over!

429
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,800
Stop!

430
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,644
The suspect vehicle
is heading towards Huajie Road.

431
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:35,520
All patrol vehicles,
intercept it immediately.

432
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,800
That's the suspect vehicle.

433
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,040
Director,

434
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,800
Command Center has sent us a map.

435
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,222
Director, there's a
three-way fork ahead.

436
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,490
We'll turn right and corner it.

437
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,430
All right.

438
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,480
Chang Rui.

439
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,550
Follow the suspect vehicle.

440
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,820
We'll corner it from another road.

441
00:23:00,822 --> 00:23:01,600
Yes.

442
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,640
Director, we can intercept the vehicle

443
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,577
at the junction ahead.

444
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:26,644
Get every department
to follow the suspect vehicle closely.

445
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,760
800 metres to the suspect vehicle.

446
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,760
600 metres.

447
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,910
400 metres.

448
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,560
200 metres.

449
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,298
Last 100 metres.

450
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,190
20 metres.

451
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,590
Turn off the vehicle!

452
00:24:06,262 --> 00:24:07,582
Get out! Hurry!

453
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,950
Get out!

454
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,350
Whose child is this?

455
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,760
This...

456
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,150
This is my child.

457
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,080
Take them away.

458
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,660
(June 18, 2009, Thursday)

459
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,350
Officers,

460
00:24:33,212 --> 00:24:35,292
I didn't commit any crime.

461
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,480
Why did you run then?

462
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,800
I had

463
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,520
some smuggled cigarettes in the car.

464
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,280
Also,

465
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,320
that vehicle used a fake license plate.

466
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,000
I didn't expect all of you

467
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,790
to pursue me for so long
just for that matter.

468
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,320
I was very afraid,

469
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,280
so I...

470
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,800
I escaped.

471
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,910
The cigarettes in your car

472
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,910
and the false plate on your car

473
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:05,670
aren't the most important things.

474
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,480
Most importantly,

475
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,630
why is the child

476
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:09,760
in your car?

477
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:11,333
The child?

478
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,240
What's wrong with my child?

479
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,910
Officers!

480
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,430
Where's our child?

481
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,590
The child

482
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,240
isn't yours.

483
00:25:47,222 --> 00:25:47,960
That's impossible.

484
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,888
Have you confirmed it?

485
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,080
I have.

486
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,331
That's impossible.

487
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,240
Did you make a mistake?

488
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,350
Can you let us take a look?

489
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,400
We want to confirm it.

490
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,790
Yes.

491
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,790
I beg you.

492
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,440
Let us take a look.

493
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,510
Can you let us confirm it?

494
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,520
I beg you.

495
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,270
I beg you!

496
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,110
Mrs. Lin,

497
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,240
please calm down.

498
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,790
The DNA test result

499
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,750
is out.

500
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,590
The child

501
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,110
isn't yours.

502
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,280
Mom...

503
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,960
What were you doing?

504
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,800
Mom!

505
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,720
Little Spud is a baby!

506
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,110
He couldn't speak

507
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,110
or walk!

508
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,080
How can we find him?

509
00:26:25,177 --> 00:26:26,600
- Sorry.
- The police will help us.

510
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,720
Sorry!

511
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,350
- It's all my fault!
- We are here.

512
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,510
It's all my fault!

513
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,390
Calm down.

514
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,590
Go out and find him!

515
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,670
Shut up!

516
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,840
Officer!

517
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,790
Sorry!

518
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,080
His attitude was bad!

519
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,070
- I apologize to you!
- Get up!

520
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,790
Officer!

521
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,720
Stand up first.

522
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,200
He can't live anymore
if he cannot be found!

523
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,510
I understand how you feel.

524
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,270
Stand up first.

525
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,350
Officers,
we'll surely cooperate with you.

526
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:50,933
We understand.

527
00:26:50,955 --> 00:26:52,370
- Please stand up.
- Let's talk.

528
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,870
I don't have any other way!

529
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,670
This is normal
in the Anti-abduction Office.

530
00:26:59,111 --> 00:27:01,400
The feeling of hope
and disappointment changes constantly.

531
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,430
As time goes on,

532
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,733
you'll get used to it.

533
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,960
Is it possible

534
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,910
that our search direction was wrong?

535
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,510
Is it possible

536
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,160
that the kidnapper

537
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,000
did not escape in a car immediately

538
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,350
and chose to enter the garden further

539
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,480
or somewhere without cameras?

540
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,800
Some blind spots.

541
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,320
Is there such a possibility?

542
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,670
Why must he
go further inside the garden?

543
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,680
Moreover, the garden is big.

544
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,150
There are cameras on all corners.

545
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,440
In that case,

546
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,080
it might not be easy for him

547
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,590
to leave this garden.

548
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,910
No.

549
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,355
Something feels off about this.

550
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,840
All right.

551
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,520
First of all,

552
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,320
we need to expand the search radius.

553
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,200
Not just the entrance,

554
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,550
but every exit of the garden.

555
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,549
We must also pay attention

556
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,822
to blind spots and cameras
in deeper parts of the garden.

557
00:27:51,822 --> 00:27:52,866
Don't miss out on anyone.

558
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,600
Secondly,

559
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
we need to visit the garden again.

560
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,320
There might be other eyewitnesses.

561
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,910
Thirdly,

562
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:01,644
we can't eliminate the possibility

563
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:02,870
that the child has been sold.

564
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:04,688
So, we should contact
the police stations

565
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:06,960
of other areas to release
a joint investigation notice.

566
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

567
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,760
Director Deng.

568
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,555
Tuanyuan Restaurant

569
00:28:16,577 --> 00:28:18,088
(Help Find My Daughter)
has been here for a long time.

570
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:20,177
It is a residential
anti-kidnapping organization.

571
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,870
This is it.

572
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,190
Madam Zhang.

573
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,320
Madam Zhang.

574
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,160
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

575
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,960
Officer Yan.

576
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,800
Are you busy?

577
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:33,644
Let me introduce you.

578
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:36,377
This is Director Deng, who has just come
to the Anti-abduction Office.

579
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,320
Director Deng.

580
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,320
She's Madam Zhang.

581
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,800
Sit.

582
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,080
Sit down.

583
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,590
Sit.

584
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,470
Madam Zhang,

585
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,510
I won't be sitting.

586
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,350
I came here this time

587
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,350
to ask for your help.

588
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,580
(Baby, Come back)

589
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,830
This child went missing

590
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,480
in the garden two days ago.

591
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,659
We checked the nearby cameras

592
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,590
and found nothing.

593
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,510
We hope to work

594
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,630
with Tuanyuan Restaurant.

595
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,030
If you find any clues

596
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,750
about this child,

597
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,960
please contact us immediately.

598
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,800
I understand.

599
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,266
I will put it on

600
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:29,190
the wall immediately
and contact all volunteers.

601
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,110
(Missing)
If I have news, I'll contact you.

602
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,720
All right.

603
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,560
Thank you.

604
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:35,333
Director, I'm going to answer this.

605
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,500
(Missing)
(Ranran!)

606
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,520
(Ranran!)

607
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,150
Yanyan.

608
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,560
How are your parents?

609
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,430
They are doing quite well.

610
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,910
What about you? Are you doing well?

611
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,320
I'm doing fine.

612
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,000
Fine.

613
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,320
You've become the director now.

614
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,320
How nice.

615
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,480
Madam Zhang,

616
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,560
I haven't forgotten

617
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,110
about Ranran.

618
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,940
(Missing)

619
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,910
Director Deng,

620
00:31:07,955 --> 00:31:09,280
there's news at the police station.

621
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,222
We have to go back now.

622
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,430
Go back to work.

623
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,960
Madam Zhang, thank you.

624
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,480
I will...

625
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,080
I will come back again.

626

627
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:27,460
(Missing)

628
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,320
I am a lawyer.

629
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,670
Do you need any help?

630
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,940
(Missing, Luo Xiaoyu)

631
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,900
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

632
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,560
Hello, Anti-abduction Office.

633
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,870
What?

634
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,377
The Public Complaints Administration
is here again?

635
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:00,533
She is Officer Deng, Deng Yan.

636
00:33:00,555 --> 00:33:03,550
The Director of
the Linshan City Police Station's

637
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,866
Anti-abduction Office.

638
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,220
Officers.

639
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,190
I am my client's lawyer.

640
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,520
I am Sun Wenhan.

641
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,150
This woman beside me

642
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,350
is...

643
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,870
I am Luo Xiaoxing.

644
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,390
It has been 15 years

645
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,880
since my brother, Luo Xiaoyu,

646
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,560
was kidnapped.

647
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,240
We put all our hopes

648
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,480
in you, police officers,

649
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,080
but until now,

650
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:35,919
the police have yet to find

651
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,280
any leads about my younger brother.

652
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,110
My client

653
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,350
is suspecting the police

654
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,760
of neglecting their responsibility.

655
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,350
It's like this.

656
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,070
I've read Luo Xiaoyu's case

657
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,110
and the relevant details.

658
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,590
The details are quite complicated.

659
00:33:52,936 --> 00:33:54,648
Since Luo Xiaoyu went missing,

660
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,790
the Linshan Police Station Bureau's

661
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,520
Anti-abduction Office's officers

662
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,830
have gone through 327 investigations

663
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,720
in 11 provincial cities.

664
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,350
We've also questioned 760 people.

665
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,080
Since you did so much,

666
00:34:07,244 --> 00:34:09,274
why haven't you found anything yet?

667
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,000
We are still investigating.

668
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,030
This case happened a long time ago.

669
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,244
Technology back then
was not as advanced.

670
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,520
I've heard this many times.

671
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,840
I only want to know
any clues about my younger brother.

672
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,760
Where is he?

673
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,480
Is he living well?

674
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,320
He...

675
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,440
I don't mind even if I have some news.

676
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,590
This case is very complicated indeed.

677
00:34:35,837 --> 00:34:36,840
We need time

678
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,355
for our investigation to bear fruit.

679
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,310
Please be a little more patient...

680
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,470
Patient?

681
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,150
Since my younger brother went missing,

682
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,560
my mother committed suicide.

683
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
My father and my grandparents

684
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:52,102
couldn't see Xiaoyu return home.

685
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,080
All of them are dead.

686
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,190
I'm the only one left in the family.

687
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,960
I've been waiting for 15 years.

688
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
I've been searching for 15 years.

689
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,840
How much patience
do you still want me to have?

690
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:14,340
(Linshan City Police Station
Public Complaints Administration)

691
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,200
Xiaoxing.

692
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,200
Sit.

693
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,760
Director Deng,

694
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,560
you just took over
the anti-kidnapping job.

695
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,840
I understand your profession,

696
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,480
and you've done a lot of homework.

697
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,310
However, you are facing
a person who is alive

698
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,590
instead of emotionless numbers.

699
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,790
Victims

700
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:40,040
don't want to hear
how hard you've worked.

701
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,440
They only want results.

702
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,840
What did you investigate

703
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:46,488
and which step are you in?

704
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,960
What possibilities are there?

705
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,590
If there are no results,

706
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,630
all of these are pointless.

707
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,920
They want a sliver of hope.

708
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,670
A hope

709
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,400
to not give up and keep searching.

710
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,880
What we want

711
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:04,422
isn't your meaningless work progress.

712
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,480
We want you to solve the problem

713
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,590
and crack the case.

714
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,310
We want Luo Xiaoyu to come home.

715
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,910
I...

716
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,110
I might not be able

717
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,488
to give you a confirmed answer.

718
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,230
However, I still hope...

719
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,888
you can give us...

720
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,280
some time.

721
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,120
How long?

722
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,630

725
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,440
I guarantee.

726
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,790
If I can't crack Luo Xiaoyu's case,

727
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,820
I will quit my job.

Go away.

743
00:38:10,044 --> 00:38:11,320
When I was fishing, I pulled up

744
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,160
and had a look.

745
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,240
It was so scary.

746
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,200
A dead body.

747
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,310

the Anti-abduction Office

753
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:24,000
has been monitoring, Zhao Dafeng?

754
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,030
It's him.

755
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,800

760
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,520
I've made a lot of money.

761
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,590
I got really lucky.

762
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,670
You are my God of Fortune.

763
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,590
Didn't I tell you

764
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,880
that we'd make money together?

765
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,400
Bai, let's have a toast together.

766
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,400
We'll make money

767
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,590
and get lucky together.

768
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,240
Xie.

769
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,480
I don't know if I should ask this.

770
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,560
You better not.

771
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,800
I'll be shameless

772
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,640
and ask you again.

773
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:25,190
What business were you in

774
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,400
when you were in another city?

775
00:39:28,955 --> 00:39:30,200
Don't you know the rules?

776
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,640
Xie.

777
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,150
Do you not believe in us?

778
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:35,888
Everyone in the underworld

779
00:39:35,888 --> 00:39:36,920
carries some secrets.

780
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,550
If you need help, tell us.

781
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,750
If I can do it,

782
00:39:41,044 --> 00:39:42,790
I'll help you even if it costs my life.

783
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:52,950
Leather.

784
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,960
I'm in the leather business.

785
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,320
What a coincidence.

786
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,750
We are also in the same line of work.

787
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,030
Enough.

788
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,990
Well,

789
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
in the end,

790
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,990
we're actually peers.

791
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,480
Is business good in Linshan?

792
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,560
It's not bad.

793
00:40:23,644 --> 00:40:24,750
What's the normal price?

794
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,800
30,000 yuan usually.

795
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,190
It depends on the goods.

796
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,430
We'll do 20,000

797
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,720
for you.

798
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,030
How's that?

799
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,560
Do you have ready stock?

800
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,000
I have stock
that is ready to be verified.

801
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:53,998
30,000 yuan it is.

802
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,120
I'll pay you in full.

803
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,430
Don't disappoint me.

804
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,800
Xie,

805
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,190
I also have one here.

806
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,440
Xie, I'll only charge half after this.

807
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,030
Leave it to me

808
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,870
and don't worry.

809
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:05,550
How long do you need?

810
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,510
Two days.

811
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,470
All right.

812
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,150
We'll meet here two days later.

813
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,350
Okay.

814
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,440
Take care,

815
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,280
Xie!

816
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,960
Are you spoiling the market?

817
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,000
You're right.

818
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,760
Here.

819
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,720
Take it.

820
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,700
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

821
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,870
Are you busy?

822
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:54,518
Madam Zhang.

823
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,520
Qian, you're here.

824
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,480
I came here early in the morning,

825
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,520
not for something else

826
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,560
but for the

827
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,960
rent's matter.

828
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,800
Well...

829
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,070
Qian,

830
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,360
I'm sorry.

831
00:42:06,846 --> 00:42:09,518
I'm a bit strapped right now.

832
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,110
Well,

833
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,670
I am

834
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,880
trying to think of something.

835
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,822
I'll send you the money
once I've gathered it.

836
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,000
You need to pay the rent today.

837
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,790
My family is still waiting for me
to feed them.

838
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,560
- Zhang.
- Madam Zhang.

839
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,440
I have some money.

840
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,310
Let's pool our money.

841
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:26,440
Yes. Me too.

842
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,670
How much do you need?

843
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,510
No.

844
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,640
No.

845
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,710
How can you use all your money?

846
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,200
Making money is difficult for you two.

847
00:42:33,266 --> 00:42:35,880
This restaurant's problem
is our problem as well.

848
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,480
Besides,

849
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,840
if you hadn't brought me
to this restaurant,

850
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,360
I wouldn't know what to do.

851
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,000
Take this money.

852
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:41,760
Exactly, Zhang.

853
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,030
Without you,

854
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,480
I'm not sure where I would be now.

855
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,320
All right.

856
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,960
I'll take it as a loan.

857
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,800
All right?

858
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:49,950
Well,

859
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,110
Qian.

860
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,760
I gathered so much.

861
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,670
1,100 yuan.

862
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,750
Take it for now.

863
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
That's not enough.

864
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,088
It's too far apart, Madam Zhang.

865
00:42:59,155 --> 00:43:01,110
Give me a few more days.

866
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,310
I'll come up with something.
