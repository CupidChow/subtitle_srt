The case is still under investigation.

00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,720
We can't share
too many details right now.

5
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,350
But if anything comes up,

6
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,940
we'll let the family know right away.

7
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,960
Ms. Cai,

8
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,060
if your husband is innocent,

9
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,760
we'll definitely release him.

10
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,090
He will have justice.

11
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,940
Then at least tell me

12
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,650
what he did.

13
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,580
He is suspected of rape.

14
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,230
Rape?

15
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:09,577
He would never do something like that.

16
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,130
You got the wrong guy.

17
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,090
Ms. Cai, whether we did or not,

18
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,330
we'll get to the bottom of it.

19
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,830
If there's nothing else,

20
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,020
please head home and wait.

21
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,150
Alright then.

22
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,920
Follow your procedures.

23
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,090
But if you're wrong,

24
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,530

27

We don't have direct evidence,

28
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,990
but Chen A'mo pointed him out,

29
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,270
plus there is objective evidence.

Lu Sheng illegally

31
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,760
detained Zheng Weiwei

32
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,660
and raped her.

33
00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:14,120
There's enough to make an arrest.

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,577
Captain Han, take a look?

35
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,680
I approve the arrest,

36
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,160
but keep digging.

37
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,800
Find solid evidence,

38
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,940
and make him own up to it.

39
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,990

76
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:26,555
Paying my respects to Chief Chang.

77
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,870
You really didn't have to.

78
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,600
It's a long trip for you.

79
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,040
If it hadn't been for this case,

80
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,180
I likely wouldn't have

81
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,560
known Chief Chang's contributions.

82
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,380
But after I found out,

83
00:08:01,577 --> 00:08:02,911
I really came to admire him.

84
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:05,177
He showed me what a good policeman

85
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:06,377
should be.

86
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,200
What is it like?

87
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,040
All I remember growing up

88
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,600
was a dad who never came home

89
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,040
and was always busy with work.

90
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
And in the end,
he died saving some human filth.

91
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:24,866
Is that what a good policeman really is?

92
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,970
But even so,
you still became a policeman.

93
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,710
Didn't you?

94
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,870
Because I had no choice.

95
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,280
After he died,

96
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,300
everyone around me assumed

97
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,670
I should follow in his footsteps.

98
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,710
At that moment, Chief Chang did

99
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,950
what he felt he had to do.

100
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,770
Right up to his last breath,

101
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,340
he was fulfilling his duty
as a police officer.

102
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,260
As his son,

103
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,790
don't you feel the same way?

104
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:58,644
Why should I take over his legacy?

105
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,180
I am not my dad.

106
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,550
No one ever cared

107
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,140
about what I wanted.

108
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,180
Everyone just assumed

109
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,940
I should live my whole life

110
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,840
under his shadow.

111
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,840
I don't know what happened

112
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,000
between you and your father

113
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:17,730
that made you say things like this.

114
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,500
But these past few days, I can see

115
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,711
that losing him hurts you deeply.

116
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,240
You've carried that pain.

117
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,444
You just never wanted to admit it.

118
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,740
Skinner is still not talking,

119
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,990
and so many kids are still missing.

120
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,830
You really want to quit now?

121
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,190
There are other police officers.

122
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,910
Many are way better than me.

123
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,690
It's not like

124
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,960
I make a difference.

125
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,990
Chang Rui,

126
00:09:58,022 --> 00:09:58,990
I never thought I'd be

127
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,000
so disappointed in you.

128
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,270
I never thought you'd say that.

129
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,550
I won't lecture you
just to keep you here.

130
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,600
You're right

131
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,450
that there are other police.

132
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:12,110
But training one
for anti-abduction work

133
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,590
takes a lot of time and effort!

134
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,780
You know how we work.

135
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,410
We're always racing against time.

136
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,030
Even while we're here talking,

137
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,950
some family out there

138
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,288
might be about to face the nightmare
of losing their child.

139
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,080
If none of that matters to you anymore,

140
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,770
if you've stopped caring,

141
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,355
if you've gone numb, if you've given up,

142
00:10:25,377 --> 00:10:26,710
I won't try to talk you out of it.

143
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:28,700
I just hope from now on

144
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,850
you get to live the way you want.

145
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,840
Find a job you actually like.

146
00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:36,288
I wish you all the best.

147
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,230
What's wrong?

148
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,630
You're not happy?

149
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,050
Says who?

150
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,870
I'm happy.

151
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,980
Super happy.

152
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,790
Do you think I'm a good policeman?

153
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,630
Of course you are.

154
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,010
You're a great policeman.

155
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,140
How so?

156
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,380
Because you've caught so many bad guys.

157
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,800
Yeah, true.

158
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,440
That makes you a good policeman.

159
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,020
Helping bad guys makes you a bad one.

160
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,020
But you saved me too.

161
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,760
That's different.

162
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,740
You are not a bad person.

163
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,120
But I did help bad people once.

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,700
You were just a kid back then.

165
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,790
You had no idea.

166
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,320
You did whatever they told you to.

167
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,630
You didn't even know
what you were doing.

168
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,550
So the same goes

169
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,690
for when you save someone.

170
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,710
You don't always know
if they're good or bad.

171
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,870
Director.

172
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,280
I...

173
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,840
I...

174
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,060
That day,

175
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,730
I yelled at Chief Xiao
right to his face.

176
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,600
Do you think...

177
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,760
he is actually mad at me?

178
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,990
Chang Rui.

179
00:12:44,622 --> 00:12:45,733
You realize your mistake?

180
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,870
Chief Xiao.

181
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,110
Technically, Chang Rui

182
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:56,380
doesn't have to recuse himself

183
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,720
from Wang Guangqing's case.

184
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,040
Zip it.

185
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,290
Do you understand your mistake?

186
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,570
As a police officer,

187
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,320
I should follow orders.

188
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,820
I shouldn't act on personal emotions.

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,910
I definitely shouldn't

190
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,190
have yelled at you.

191
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,320
Good.

192
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,200
Now that sounds like Chang's son.

193
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,350
But have you figured out

194
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,710
how to deal with Wang Guangqing?

195
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,550
Yes, we have.

196
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,510
Then, what are you waiting for?

197
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,510
Keep the pace tight.

198
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,550
Got it.

199
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,510
On it.

200
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,560
Welcome back.

201
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,020
(Police Officer ID)

202
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,630
Thanks...

203
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,340
(Interrogation Room)

204
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,390
Wang Guangqing.

205
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,630
Do you know why I hit you?

206
00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:27,670
Because you think you're tough?

207
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,290
Because you're a cop.

208
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,260
Just wait.

209
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,360
You and I will settle this
fair and square one day.

210
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,080
Forget it.

211
00:14:42,177 --> 00:14:44,511
(Report from Nanjie Police)
Do you remember Chang Yongjun?

212
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:48,019
(October 19, 1992. Chief Chang Yongjun
of Nanyangdian Station drowned)

213
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,355
(while saving a boy from drowning...)

214
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,440
Yeah, I remember.

215
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He saved my life.

216
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,460
He was my lifesaver.

217
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,450
That's why every year
during Qingming Festival,

218
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,350
you leave a bouquet

219
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,310
of carnations at his grave.

220
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:18,720
Even I know how to be grateful.

221
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,230
My name is Chang Rui.

222
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,622
Chang Yongjun was my father.

223
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,440
Well.

224
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,500
Your dad...

225
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,630
He pulled me out of the water years ago.

226
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,670
And now look at this.

227
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,630
His son

228
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,780
almost took my life

229
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,200
in the water.

230
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,590
Wang Guangqing,

231
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,490
since you still remember Chief Chang,

232
00:15:59,044 --> 00:16:00,530
think about what you've done.

233
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,670
Do you really think you've honored him?

234
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,320
Maybe...

235
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,470
if Chief Chang were still alive,

236
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,860
he'd regret

237
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,860
saving me that day.

238
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,990
He wouldn't.

239
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,240
He'd never regret it.

240
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,750
Even if he had to do it again and again,

241
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,960
he'd still save you.

242
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,820
You leave flowers at his grave

243
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,000
every year.

244
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,440
You haven't forgotten him.

245
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,960
That means you still have a conscience.

246
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,670
We've questioned you so many times.

247
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,480
You haven't told us anything.

248
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,940
But that's fine.

249
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,960
We got all the evidence we need.

250
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,580
Even if you stay quiet,

251
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,590
you're still going down.

252
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,080
But can you really live with yourself?

253
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,870
Do you think you deserve
to lay those flowers every year?

254
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,600
Do you think you're worthy
of Chief Chang's sacrifice?

255
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,830
We only want you
to turn your life around.

256
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:10,400
I shouldn't have hit you
during the arrest,

257
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,510
but I lost control.

258
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,640
I just couldn't accept

259
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:18,240
that the person my father died saving

260
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,590
ended up becoming

261
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,590
such a disgrace.

262
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,270
He wasn't a good father.

263
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,400
But he was a good policeman.

264
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,860
I hope you'll work with us.

265
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,110
Tell us everything you know.

266
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,970
Let an officer's sacrifice

267
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,910
mean something.

268
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,090
I'm thirsty.

269
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,560
Get me some water.

270
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,250
If what Wang Guangqing
just said is true,

271
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,580
then the Zheng Weiwei kidnapping case

272
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,510
isn't an average kidnapping.

273
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,640
At the very least,

274
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,280
it wasn't random.

275
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,090
(Mr. Li...)

276
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,780
He had a thing for a girl.

277
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,720
It was...

278
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,400
the second girl from the left,

279
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,680
in those photos on the table.

280
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,200
But she is an adult.

281
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,880
A college student.

282
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,880
Not exactly someone easy to trick.

283
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,670
So, I had Whiteboard

284
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,740
to start

285
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,510
chatting with her online.

286
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,330
Over time,

287
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,920
we figured out her personality,

288
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,830
habits, and so on.

289
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,070
Then one time,

290
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,200
when she was
on her way to tutor someone...

291
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,190
(We just...)

292
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,700
Well, we basically kidnapped her.

293
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:04,970
We kidnapped her.

294
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,790
Who would've thought this girl

295
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,030
was so tough?

296
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,000
Nothing worked on her.

297
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,800
So,

298
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,300
we ended up drugging her.

299
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,580
Then Mr. Li...

300
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,860
He forced himself on her.

301
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,350
After that,

302
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,520
he was pretty pleased with the girl.

303
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,950
Then,

304
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,310
Cripple and Fei said
they were happy too.

305
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,670
The next day,

306
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,690
they handed me 100,000 yuan in cash.

307
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,830
To me, this had

308
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,480
to be a case of organized trafficking

309
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,400
and kidnapping.

310
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,840
And the fact that Cripple

311
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,030
gave 100,000 yuan up front?

312
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:45,600
It shows the profit he expected

313
00:19:45,622 --> 00:19:47,540
was way more than that number.

314
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,510
So we have to find out

315
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,270
what kind of trade they're running.

316
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,720
Mr. Li's real name is Lu Sheng.

317
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,680
I think we should
start digging into him.

Yanyan couldn't make it again today.

326
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:32,120
Ever since she became the director,

327
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,970
she's been swamped.

328
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,960
A dinner with her? No chance.

329
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,510
Well, it's work.

330
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,630
It's her duty.

331
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,520
Fine.

332
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,620
Work matters,

333
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,960
but so does life.

334
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,960
Did you know?

335
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,250
Her place is always a mess.
She never has time to clean.

336
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,920
I have to go over there
every now and then to tidy up for her.

337
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,960
That's true.

00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,240
Are you staying this time?

340
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,300
I'm leaving tomorrow.

341
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,400
That soon?

342
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,980
You didn't stop him?

343
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,790
Would that even work?

344
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,400
Right now,

345
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,510
he is married to his job.

346
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,960
Our home is more

347
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,790
like a hotel. Am I wrong?

348
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,990
This is really on me.

349
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,280
Uncle, Auntie,

350
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,960
our company in Shencheng

351
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,120
has been doing well lately.

352
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,640
A venture capital firm

353
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,110
wants to invest in us.

354
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,270
We've been rather busy.

355
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,380
That's a good thing!

356
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,170
Really good!

357
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:24,710
- Let's toast to that.
- Cheers.

358
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,800
Xiuming,

359
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,160
you're both still young,

360
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,160
and you tend to think too simply.

361
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,030
Work is important,

362
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,650
but it's not more important than life.

363
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,520
Am I right?

364
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,130
What I mean is,

365
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,760
you two are always

366
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,140
living apart from each other.

367
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,590
Don't start causing any trouble.

368
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,460
It's a long-distance relationship.

369
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,240
Dig in.

370
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,830
Don't worry, Auntie.

371
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,680
It won't happen.

372
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,590
I've already thought it through.

373
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,480
Once things settle a bit

374
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,210
with work over there,
I'll cut down on travel.

375
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,160
Or I'll just stop traveling altogether.

376
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,550
Exactly.

377
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,440
I'll live here.

378
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,630
Then you'll settle down.

379
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,790
Now that sounds better.

380
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,240
You two,

381
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,200
it'd be great if you had a kid.

382
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,160
Yeah.

383
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,130
Eat up.

384
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,380
Come on, let's eat, alright?

385
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,110
I mean,

386
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,320
if you really don't have the time

387
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
with all the work,

388
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,240
you could always adopt, right?

389
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,000
See that?

390
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,400
Once she starts talking,

391
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,960
she can't stop.

392
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,350
Let the kids

393
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,590
figure it out themselves.

394
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,840
Alright?

395
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,040
Yeah.

396
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,150
Auntie,

397
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,460
I never thought of what you just said.

398
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,540
Adopting a child doesn't sound bad.

399
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,440
Right?

400
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,044
Let me raise a glass to you both.

401
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,590
Cheers to you.

402
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,160
Come on.

403
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,570
Wishing you both good health.

404
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,440
Thank you.

405
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,190
Cheers.

406
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,150
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

407
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,520
(Cripple only)

408
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,010
(Interrogation Room)
(deals clean.)

409
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,740
Even if you nab all of us down here,

410
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,880
you still won't get him.

411
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,480
Guys like me

412
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,088
are just there to take the fall for him.

413
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,690
You know how heavy that fall is?

414
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,440
You think you can handle it?

415
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:16,180
You're willing
to throw your life away for Cripple?

416
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,940
You take someone's money,

417
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,222
and you fix their problems.

418
00:24:19,244 --> 00:24:20,460
We get paid to do that.

419
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,810
There's still some honor among thieves.

420
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,480
Cripple is

421
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,220
quite generous.

422
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,890
The money always comes through.

423
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,333
As long as the job's done well,

424
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,270
the money always comes through.

425
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,060
If he says

426
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,310
he'll do something for you,

427
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,440
you can count on it.

428
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,440
How do we reach him?

429
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,890
Honestly?

430
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,550
I can't get in touch with him.

431
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,240
Every single time,

432
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,320
Fei calls me.

433
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,400
He gives the orders.

434
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,480
After you cleared out Mangshan Villa,

435
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,640
I crossed

436
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,800
over Baiwushan and Fei picked me up.

437
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,390
(Then, he took me to Hongxi City.)

438
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,030
(Since then,)

439
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,340
I've lost contact.

440
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,350
His phone won't even connect.

441
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,630
Looks like

442
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:09,729
(Fei, Cripple)
Cripple and Wang Guangqing

443
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,422
(Wang Guangqing)
don't have direct contact.

444
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,950
Everything goes through Fei.

445
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,400
Fei is the key link in all this.

446
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,590
We'll just have to dig the hard way.

447
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,500
Jiajia.

448
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,070
Check the surveillance along

449
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,222
Wang Guangqing's escape route

450
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:23,177
based on his confession.

451
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:24,000
Got it.

452
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,840
Hello?

453
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,160
Something's wrong.

454
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,630
Director Deng,

455
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,070
after you talked to her last time,

456
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,350
she got a lot better.

457
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,570
She went out today.

458
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,450
She didn't take her student ID.

459
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,140
I thought she finally
came around and went to class.

460
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,640
But I never expected

461
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,140
to find a pregnancy test.

462
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,560
It came out positive!

463
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,920
And she left me a note.

464
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,960
It says,

465
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,350
"Mom, I'm sorry.

466
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,790
I'm leaving.

467
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,330
Just pretend I was never your daughter."

468
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,670
Director Deng,

469
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,140
please help me find her.

00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:44,860
(Certificate of Honor, Zheng Weiwei.
"Walking Against the Wind". Gold Prize)

472
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,780
Weiwei,

473
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,740
give me the pills.

474
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,860
No.

475
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,680
Please don't do anything rash.

476
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,980
I'm begging you! Hand them over!

477
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,820
Weiwei.

478
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,920
Didn't you promise me?

479
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,830
We had such a good talk last time.

480
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,430
I thought I could do it too.

481
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,290
But now...

482
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,520
I just can't.

483
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,870
You know how I found you?

484
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,110
I saw the article you wrote.

485
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,130
It was displayed in the center

486
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,533
of your school's exhibit hall.

487
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,830
And not just at your school,

488
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,230
it also got

489
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,720
a lot of attention online.

490
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,510
People really liked you.

491
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,670
They loved what you wrote.

492
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,680
You gave everyone hope.

493
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,600
Are you going
to give up your own hope now?

494
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,690
Stop. Just stop...

495
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,630

496
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,520

(I'm Pingjiao.)

498
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,520
(Look.)

499
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,560
(I went home.)

500
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,630
(I found my real parents too.)

hyacinths were flowers of rebirth.)

00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,830
(Look,)

505
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,590
(I planted two of them here.)

506
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,220
(One is you,)

507
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,590

(Interrogation Room)
(Lu Sheng,)

518
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,310
(you're suspected of rape.)

519
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,590
What?

520
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:03,000
You think you're being framed?

521
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:03,990
Officer,

522
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,530
I really am being framed.

523
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,100
Please get to the bottom of this

524
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,350
and clear my name, alright?

525
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,550
Still not ready to face the truth?

526
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,440
What truth? What do you mean?

527
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,920
What are you guys implying here?

528
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,160
Are you trying to set me up

529
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
or frame me?

530
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,830
Is that what this is?

531
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,000
Watch your tone.

532
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,160
We're the police.

533
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,290
Why would we frame you?

534
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,510
You feel wronged?

535
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,400
You want the truth?

536
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,570
Zheng Weiwei is pregnant.

537
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,400
The non-invasive paternity test

538
00:30:31,488 --> 00:30:32,510
shows the baby is yours.

539
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,840
I found Fei.

540
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,390
Director, Rui,

541
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,220
perfect timing.

542
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,060
I found Fei.

543
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,160
According to Wang Guangqing's statement,

544
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
this is the car
that took him to Hongxi City.

545
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,790
We've located the vehicle.

546
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,030
The owner is Fei.

547
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,530
(Fei Yan: Linshan City, Nanjie Province)

548
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:06,820
Fei's real name is Fei Yan.

549
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,980
After Fei Yan dropped off
Skinner in Hongxi City,

550
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,140
he flew to Qinmang Country.

551
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,620
(Flight info inquiry: Fei Yan)

552
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,070
He slipped away really fast.

553
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,950
The number Fei Yan used to contact

554
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,640
Wang Guangqing

555
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
only ever

556
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,760
contacted him.

557
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:20,920
Single-line communication.

558
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,720
So the trail went cold again?

559
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,110
Not yet.

560
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,160
Jiajia.

561
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,370
Check where Fei Yan's car

562
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,400
has been driving around the province.

563
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,350
Got it.

564
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,380
This is the car's
recent movement history.

565
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,310
It mostly stayed around Linshan City.

566
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,180
And the place it visited the most was...

567
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,980
(Tianhai Lucky Entertainment Center)

568
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,400
Tianhai Lucky Entertainment Center.

569
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,622
(Tianhai Lucky Entertainment Center)

570
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:50,260
(Tianhai Lucky)

571
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,290
Come on.

572
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,840
Open it.

573
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:55,730
Drink!

574
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,430
Go on.

575
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,460
(Tianhai Lucky)

576
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:46,300
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

577
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,000
Thanks.

578
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,270
Weiwei.

579
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,550
What took you so long?

580
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,470
Sorry.

581
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,340
Traffic was bad, so I'm late.

582
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,510
Long time no see.

583
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,960
Feeling any better?

584
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,430
Much better.

585
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,000
Take a seat.

586
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,730
Why are you crying?

587
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,780
Sit down.

588
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:32,520
How have you been lately?

589
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,190
Pretty good.

590
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,960
Does your hand still hurt?

591
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,780
It is almost healed.

592
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,240
Let's eat.

593
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,910
Okay.

594
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,410
What did you order?

595
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,888
- I've never had this before.
- Try it.

596
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:51,720
It smells really good.

597
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,110
(Recently,)

598
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,444
(several human)
Dip it in the sauce.

599
00:33:53,488 --> 00:33:55,590
(trafficking cases involving girls
from other regions)

600
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,160
(forced into prostitution
have been solved.)

601
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,810
(Authorities are taking this seriously.)
Look!

602
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,440
These are the girls who were trafficked

603
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,600
and were raped.

604
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,800
They were indecent with their lives,

605
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,510
so these scumbags targeted them.

606
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,650
So you're saying

607
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,270
those girls who were raped

608
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,510
and trafficked were at fault themselves?

609
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:12,470
What else could it be?

610
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,720
Flies don't buzz

611
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,110
around eggs without cracks.

612
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,710
And I'll tell you this.

613
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,120
Once girls like these

614
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,000
are rescued, think about it,

615
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,840
what decent guy would want them?

616
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,510
What decent man
wouldn't think they are dirty?

617
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,280
So I'm telling you...

618
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,110
What's your deal?

619
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,000
What was that for?

620
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,070
So what if I did?

621
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,280
I should've done it sooner

622
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,800
and shut that filthy mouth of yours.

623
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,220
Even my mom never scolded me.

624
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,580
You dare to yell at me?

625
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,710
You want me to hit you?

626
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,590
Aren't you something?

627
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,220
Touch her and see what happens.

628
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,410
Two girls picking a fight with me?

629
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,040
I'll take you both on!

630
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,920
Don't you dare.
We're filming everything.

631
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,400
Yeah, we have evidence!

632
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,050
Touch them,

633
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,150
and we'll call the police!

634
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,240
Get lost!

635
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,590
You just wait!

636
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,710
You call yourself a man?

637
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,720
You're a bully!

638
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,800
Get lost. Go on.

639
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,640
Well done!

640
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,820
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

641
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,110
Have you heard?

642
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,630
Mr. Zhao next door

643
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,210
is giving up his shop.

644
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,110
Why?

645
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,140
What else could it be?

646
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,550
The rent is going up.

647
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,710
He can't keep it going.

648
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,060
Well,

649
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,660
we could buy
some of their tables, chairs,

650
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,710
and kitchen equipment.

651
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,120
I already asked.

652
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,370
He won't sell them separately.

653
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,760
He says it's all or nothing.

654
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,710
That is too much.

655
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,230
We don't have the space.

656
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,510
Forget it.

657
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,960
Even if we had room,
we couldn't afford it.

658
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,480
Everyone seems busy.

659
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,200
Madam Zhang.

660
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,200
Have you eaten?

661
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,240
I have.

662
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,870
I came to talk to you

663
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,710
about something.

664
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,000
Here's the thing.

665
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,850
A friend of mine

666
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,780
is interested in this shop.

667
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,700
The offer he gave

668
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,920
is quite fair.

669
00:36:11,022 --> 00:36:12,333
- So I was thinking...
- Qian,

670
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,300
I wanted to ask too.

671
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,680
Can we maybe

672
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,150
renew for another year

673
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,630
at the same rent?

674
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,380
Yes...

675
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,340
Madam Zhang,

676
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,840
it's not like
I haven't looked after you.

677
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,870
Rents have gone up on this whole street.

678
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,010
All these years,

679
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,800
I've never raised your rent.

680
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,340
I've done right by you, haven't I?

681
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,100
Indeed.

682
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,360
But how about this?

683
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,880
A small

684
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,220
formal raise?

685
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,480
A small formal raise?

686
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,550
How small?

687
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,390
My friend

688
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,390
offered me 50,000 yuan a year.

689
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,360
For you,

690
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,470
I'll make it 48,000 yuan.

691
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,000
Forty-eight grand?

692
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,000
That's barely a discount.

693
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,540
It barely makes a difference.

694
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,150
That's too big of a raise.

695
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,200
- Exactly.
- Qian, please.

696
00:37:01,222 --> 00:37:03,088
- Can you give us a bit more slack?
- No, no.

697
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,400
Look.

698
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,310
You see,

699
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,844
this past year

700
00:37:06,844 --> 00:37:08,530
has been really hard for us.

701
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,790
We barely made any money.

702
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,570
Qian.

703
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,140
You've been very kind to us all.

704
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,190
We know it hasn't been easy for you.

705
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,960
So maybe...

706
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,630
we could talk it over again
and find a compromise?

707
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:22,810
Just a bit more room.

708
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,550
Either

709
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,920
you pay 48,000

710
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,066
and we renew the lease,

711
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,320
or

712
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,100
I give everyone two weeks to move out.

713
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,890
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks?

714
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,680
Qian...

715
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,510
That's final.

716
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,470
Please think it over.

717
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,960
Wait, Qian.

718
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,800
Hold on, Qian.

719
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,140
Please wait a second...

720
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,150
Let's talk...

721
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,650
Take this to the records.

722
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,550
Got it.

723
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,040
Lu Sheng used to run a small business

724
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,960
which went under.

725
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,280
Then, he married Cai Ning.

726
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,480
Then, he used the Cai family's wealth

727
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:15,450
to get to where he is.

728
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,760
Director Deng.

729
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,150
Updates from Economic Crimes.

730
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,630
These are
the companies that signed contracts

731
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,780
with Lu Sheng's
company during the kidnapping

732
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,750
and the contract amounts.

733
00:38:25,777 --> 00:38:27,460
(Party B: Dingshun Group,
Ye Xiuming, Contract Amount: 32 million)

734
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,420
Dingshun Group?

735
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,600
What is it?

736
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,510
It belongs to my cousin and his wife.

737
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,200
If it's awkward for you,

738
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,760
Lei can go instead.

739
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,000
It's fine. I'll call them

740
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,110
to feel them out.

741
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,220
(Dingshun Group)

742
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,530
Did you sign this?

743
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,430
Yes.

744
00:39:01,533 --> 00:39:02,800
That's a massive shipment.

745
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,960
(Marine Cargo Insurance)
With a lot of money on the line!

746
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,920
Why didn't you just go

747
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,177
with a local insurance company?

748
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,550
Why did you use some overseas

749
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,690
insurance broker?

750
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,380
That broker has now disappeared.

751
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,490
The money is gone!

752
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,470
So tell me,

753
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,850
how do we clean up this mess?

754
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,600
Mr. Ye,

755
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,080
this is my fault.

756
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,920
We've worked
with that company for years.

757
00:39:20,977 --> 00:39:22,310
There was never any issue before.

758
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,230
Never a single issue all this time?

759
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,290
Wu, is that
what you should be saying right now?

760
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,390
I failed everyone.

761
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,150
Nobody wanted this

762
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,000
to happen.

763
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,080
We've already contacted

764
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,510
the foreign agency and reported it.

765
00:39:34,688 --> 00:39:35,840
Reporting it does no good.

766
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,070
You report it overseas,

767
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,360
but when will it be solved?

768
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,320
When will we get the money back?

769
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,110
Shencheng is already low on funds.

770
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,550
I cannot afford to wait!

771
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,160
I have an idea.

772
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,570
I'll personally follow up

773
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,780
on the overdue payments.

774
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,440
I'll also sort through

775
00:39:53,444 --> 00:39:55,070
our longtime clients as soon as I can.

776
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,700
I'll try to pull in as many
new orders as possible.

777
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,840
Would that work?

778
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,680
Mr. Ye,

779
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,550
please let me take care of this.

780
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,030
Give me one month.

781
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,360
Within that month,

782
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,550
I'll come up with a practical solution.

783
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,060
A plan alone won't help me now.

784
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,070
And I can't give you a month.

785
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,200
You have two weeks.

786
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:14,422
The money needs to be in.

787
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,470
Got it.

788
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,010
If I can't do it,

789
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,120
I'll resign.

790
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,670
I'll get to work now.

791
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:31,620
- Good day, Mr. Wu.
- Good day, Mr. Wu.

792
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,460
Good day, Mr. Wu.

793
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,990
Why are you pushing him like this?

794
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,510
I'm not pushing him.

795
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:39,920
I have no other choice.

796
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,860
This happened because of his negligence.

797
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,930
He is responsible!

798
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,070
How is this his negligence?

799
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,280
How is this his responsibility?

800
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,460
Whose company is this?

801
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:48,240
It belongs to both of us.

802
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,880
You act like a hands-off boss.

803
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,590
There's so much going on here.

804
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,120
We're short on manpower.

805
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,640
You don't manage anything.

806
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,920
You dump it all on us.

807
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:59,160
Now that something goes wrong,

808
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,460
you're here pointing fingers?

809
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,630
What are you doing?

810
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,630
I'm flying to Shencheng
first thing tomorrow.

811
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,955
I'll figure something out there.

812
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,150
Bottom line is,

813
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,800
we can't let the funds run dry.

814
00:41:18,622 --> 00:41:19,950
All you care about is Shencheng.

815
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:21,070
All you care about is money.

816
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,800
Do you care about anyone else at all?

817
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,200
Lu Sheng's case is
tied to Dingshun Group.

818
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,840
Its boss, Ye Xiuming, is my cousin.

819
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,140
If this case really involves

820
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,630
Dingshun Group in any way,

821
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,320
should I recuse myself?

822
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,110
We're not there yet.

823
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,060
Just keep investigating as usual.

824
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,030
I trust your integrity.

825
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,160
If Ye Xiuming turns out

826
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,120
to be involved,

827
00:41:55,444 --> 00:41:56,650
you can recuse yourself then.

828
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,250
Alright, I got it.

829
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,090
Okay.

830
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,000
I'll be going.

831
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,840
Alright.

832
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,760
Rest for a moment.

833
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,550
Why do you always dress so plain?

834
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,533
Why don't you
ever wear the clothes I gave you?

835
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,400
They are too flashy.

836
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,110
I'm a police officer,
so I can't wear those.

837
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,320
So now you're too good for them?

838
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,790
Anyway, what do you want?

839
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,960
This can't just be coffee and cake.

840
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,480
Here's the thing.

841
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,200
I wanted to ask you

842
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,000
about this guy, Lu Sheng.

843
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,520
Lu Sheng?

844
00:42:36,022 --> 00:42:37,550
Someone from the Anti-abduction Office

845
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,610
already talked to me.

846
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:40,930
Just be honest with me.

847
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,000
Does our deal with Lu Sheng

848
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,840
stand any chance now?

849
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,010
Well, to be honest,

850
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,230
I don't know much
about your company's deal

851
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,610
with him.

852
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,060
But his case involves a lot of

853
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,190
details I just can't

854
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,450
share with you.

855
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,330
All I want to know is,

856
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,710
will this Lu Sheng case

857
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,450
