00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,230
(Emergency Room)

4
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,590
All you do is cry.

5
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,430
It's all your fault.

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,222
If Weiwei had been with me back then,

7
00:01:42,222 --> 00:01:43,480
none of this would've happened.

8
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,920
How dare you say that?

9
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:46,920
You're the one
who insisted on a divorce.

10
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,760
If you hadn't abandoned us,

11
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,755
would this have happened?

12
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,400
Calm down.

13
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,888
Yes.

14
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:54,710
The doctor said they'll
do everything they can.

15
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:55,488
Who are you?

16
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,950
This is Officer Chang.

17
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,590
He was in charge of rescuing Weiwei.

18
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,710
You told me

19
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:01,533
you'd rescue my daughter
as soon as possible.

20
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:02,866
This is what you call a rescue?

21
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,400
How do you police do your job?

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Sir, calm down.

23
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,640
We did our best.
We've also arrested the traffickers.

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,480
Traffickers?

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,080
I don't care about traffickers.

26
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,000
I just want to know

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,910
why you didn't rescue
my daughter sooner.

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,470
If anything happens to her,

29
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,520
I won't let this go!

30
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,080
Sir, calm down.

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,920
Don't act rashly.

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm not being rash?

33
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,190
I don't even know
if my daughter is alive!

34
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,840
Enough.

35
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,680
Stop talking! Sit down!

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,750
The police saved our child.

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,000
Why say such pointless things?

38
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,800
Weiwei...

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,240
Do you know

40
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,755
how we lived this past month?

41
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,666
Have you ever been a parent?

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,190
I'd rather
be the one lying in there right now!

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
I just want to ask.

44
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,400
Why didn't you save my daughter sooner?

45
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,933
Why did she have to suffer so much?

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,030
(Look at my poor daughter.)

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,360
(Every time she sleeps,
she has nightmares.)

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,080
I wish I could climb into her head

49
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,910
and erase those memories.

50
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,960
Arrest them all!

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,240
They're all traffickers.

52
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,080
They're all liars!

53
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,310
A family is ruined because of me.

54
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,520
I've failed you.

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
I've failed Little Spud.

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,870
(All because of your daughter,)

57
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,240
we lost Ranran!

58
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,590
It's all your fault!

59
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,430
Weiwei...

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,800
Poor child.

61
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,120
Zheng Weiwei's family.

62
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,120
That's us.

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
I'm her mother.

64
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,680
The patient is out of danger.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,840
That's great.

66
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,150
The family can't go in.

67
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,430
Weiwei.

68
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,270
Weiwei.

69
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,990
Weiwei.

70
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,910
Don't be scared.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,710
Mom and Dad are waiting for you outside.

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,230
Morning.

73
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,300
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

74
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,320
Director.

75
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:24,310
- Director.
- Director.

76
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,720
There's a document for you.

77
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,560
Everyone, pay attention.

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,990
According to this document
from the Provincial Police Department,

79
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,510
trafficking rings like Skinner's,
which abduct girls

80
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,830
and force them into prostitution,
must be wiped out.

81
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,560
And Madam Hong.

82
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:44,355
We must pursue them with full force.

83
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,920
But all the leads are gone.

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,510
Keep investigating then.

85
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,500
Officers.

86
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,270
I really didn't know
what they were doing.

87
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,830
I just delivered the girls.

88
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,790
Where were they from?

89
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,200
They were all brought by Boss...

90
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,000
Skinner brought them.

91
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,600
Sometimes one every couple of days.

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,190
Sometimes a whole batch.

93
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
I'm just helping out with minor tasks.

94
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,510
I swear to God

95
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:10,000
I didn't...

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,840
Enough nonsense.

97
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,390
If not you,

98
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,230
who could it be?

99
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,350
Was it Skinner?

100
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,088
Or does he have someone above him?

101
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,880
Talk!

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,710
Talk.

103
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,630
I'll talk.

104
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,040
I never said I wouldn't.

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,000
Officers.

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
Let me think.

107
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,120
I think Skinner mentioned...

108
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:33,933
A transfer station.

109
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,160
Hurry up.

110
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,070
Stop dawdling. Hurry.

111
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,030
It's your turn.

112
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,440
Boss is here.

113
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,400
Boss.

114
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,750
So idle?

115
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,710
Nothing to do?

116
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,560
There's work,

117
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
but not enough girls.

118
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,510
Boss.

119
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,870
Want me to bring a couple more?

120
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,040
That girl last time

121
00:05:50,222 --> 00:05:51,377
was really something.

122
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,040
Keep your mouth shut.

123
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:59,244
You think you can touch any girl?

124
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:07,266
I prepared this specially for you.

125
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,360
Is there more at the transfer station?

126
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,040
Transfer station?

127
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,430
Yes, that's what he called it.

128
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,600
He mentioned it several times.

129
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,480
Where is it?

130
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,070
We've never been there.

131
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,510
The girls...

132
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,270
Right.

133
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,360
The girls were all sent from that place.

134
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,000
This transfer station

135
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,870
might be what Mr. Yin mentioned before.

136
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,480
They're probably the same place.

137
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,240
But the girls had their eyes covered
when taken there.

138
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,488
And they were too traumatized.

139
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:46,800
They don't know the details.

140
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:50,066
Lianqiao has been
to the transfer station.

141
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,480
Maybe she knows something.

142
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:53,080
(Lianqiao)
No matter what,

143
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
we must find out

144
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,777
where the transfer station is.

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,190
It's crucial for them

146
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,800
and for us.

147
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:01,160
We can complete
the missing chain of evidence.

148
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,510
Let's find Lianqiao.

149
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,300
(Lianqiao)

150
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:21,620
(Mo's Grocery)

151
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,950
No, why are you here again?

152
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,190
What do you want this time?

153
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,080
Don't get upset.

154
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
How can I not be upset?

155
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,830
Do you know my kid
hasn't eaten anything,

156
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,480
drank water,

157
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,320
or said a word?

158
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,360
He locked himself up for days.

159
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,680
What if something happens?

160
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,560
What if he gets sick?

161
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
We're here to cure him.

162
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,080
How?

163
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,920
We know the root of his pain.

164
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,440
Where is he?

165
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,350
At home.

166
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,600
Didn't I tell you not to come in?

167
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,150
Mo Lin.

168
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Is Lianqiao with you?

169
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,790
No.

170
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,240
She has no one here.

171
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,660
If not you, where else could she go?

172
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,510
How would I know?

173
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:16,800
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

174
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,390
Are you arresting her

175
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,120
just to send her home?

176
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,870
Who said we're sending her home?

177
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,510
We have important questions

178
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,350
to ask her.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,840
Mo Lin.

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,160
We've talked before.

181
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,560
You should trust us.

182
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,240
Besides, we're police.

183
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,390
We keep our word.

184
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,200
Okay?

185
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,600
I don't believe you.

186
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,550
She told me before

187
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,670
that the police found her
just to send her home.

188
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,480
Why are you so stubborn?

189
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,390
Where is she?

190
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,230
I'm indeed stubborn.

191
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm the one who hid her, okay?

192
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:48,590
Go ahead and arrest me.

193
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:50,733
If you arrest me,
you won't need to get her, right?

194
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,800
Arrest me!

195
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:54,511
- Why would we arrest you?
- Mo Lin!

196
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,960
What are you doing?

197
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,920
What are you doing?

198
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,360
Don't come any closer!

199
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,790
Stay back.

200
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,030
Put the knife down, Mo Lin!

201
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,550
Mo Lin.

202
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,630
Mo Lin, calm down.

203
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,600
Put the knife down.

204
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,440
We'll talk.

205
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,480
Everyone, out!

206
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,240
Mo Lin.

207
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,240
Put the knife down.

208
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,270
We'll talk.

209
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,720
Don't be so agitated, okay?

210
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,600
Lin, listen!

211
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,422
Put the knife down!

212
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:11,150
Out!

213
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,480
Mo Lin!

214
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,040
Mo Lin.

215
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,960
I believe her.

216
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,510
If you believe us,

217
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,480
why did you run away?

218
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:29,800
Because I was afraid
the shelter wouldn't let me out.

219
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,240
I wanted to see Mo Lin.

220
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,510
Lianqiao.

221
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:41,360
The conversation
we're going to have next

222
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,510
might make you uncomfortable,

223
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,550
but we really need your help.

224
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,670
Can you recall

225
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,390
the time you spent there?

226
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,480
Do you recall

227
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,150
or notice any specific details?

228
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,600
What kind of details?

229
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,600
Like the sound of water

230
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,000
or

231
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,200
any distinctive buildings,

232
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,630
or anything you saw.

233
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,270
I saw some things,

234
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,550
but it was all mountains there.

235
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:15,866
Nothing looked different
from other mountains.

236
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,240
(Water sounds?)

237
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,910
(I think we crossed a small river.)

238
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,320
(The current was strong.)

239
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,080
(After a short walk,)

240
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,870
(we reached the house.)

241
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,670
(But even inside the house,)

242
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,200
(you could still hear the river.)

243
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,440
(By the way,)

244
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,270
(the house was very old,)

245
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:45,440
(not like the ones built nowadays.)

246
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,800
That's all?

247
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,920
Thank you.

248
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,510
Chief Xiao.

249
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,930
- You asked for me?
- Yes, Mr. Yin.

250
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:11,590
Come in.

251
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,800
Sit.

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
Well...

253
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,720
Mr. Yin,

254
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,155
let me congratulate you first.

255
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,470
What happened?

256
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,710
Take a look.

257
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,660
(Provincial Model Staff Nomination Form,
Yin Jiansheng)

258
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,680
This...

259
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,911
This doesn't feel right.

260
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,880
People

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,533
will gossip about me.

262
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,360
Deng Yan nominated you.

263
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,080
She asked everyone
in Anti-abduction Office.

264
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,390
They all agreed.

265
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:42,590
Who's going to gossip?

266
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,440
You deserve it.

267
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,200
I...

268
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,080
I wanted to be humble.

269
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,390
Well...

270
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,910
No, you're a veteran.

271
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:56,911
How come I'm not hearing any humility?

272
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,630
Alright.

273
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,800
Back to work.

274
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,580
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

275
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:20,510
How did it go, Jiajia?

276
00:12:20,555 --> 00:12:21,910
Have you found the exact location?

277
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,600
Based on Lianqiao's statement,

278
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,960
along with the timing of her escape

279
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,222
and all our current intel,

280
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,910
we can basically confirm

281
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,080
one of these three valleys
near Mangjiang

282
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,422
is where the transfer station is.

283
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,600
These three spots
are separated by rivers and mountains.

284
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,240
Not only is it hard to access,

285
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:41,577
but it's also hard to find.

286
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,870
If we just head out blindly,

287
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,080
we'll waste manpower

288
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,288
and we might alert them,
losing the trail.

289
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,150
How about

290
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,733
we check all three locations?

291
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,080
How can we check all of them?

292
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,600
What if

293
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
we guess wrong?

294
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,155
That trip would be wasted.

295
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,977
We need an exact location.

296
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,710
Hello?

297
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,160
Liu.

298
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:27,870
Did you recently transfer
to the southern district?

299
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,150
Mangma Town, right?

300
00:13:31,822 --> 00:13:32,866
I called the right person.

301
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,600
I have something important

302
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,150
I'd like to ask for your help with.

303
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,240
We found a trafficking hideout.

304
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,630
It's in your area.

305
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,622
Probably an abandoned forest outpost.

306
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,920
Remember anything?

307
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,870
Don't give me a vague answer.

308
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,977
I need an exact location.

309
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,790
Please.

310
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,155
Come on, Mr. Yin.

311
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,311
Are you letting me sleep?

312
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,480
Didn't we share a room

313
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,933
at that provincial meeting?

314
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,440
Didn't you stay up all night

315
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,066
digging for clues?

316
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,777
I only stayed up half the night.

317
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,440
Just a while more.

318
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,840
Hello?

319
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:21,910
Okay.

320
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,630
Speak slower.

321
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,888
Slower, I'm taking notes.

322
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,110
At...

323
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,110
Hello, Mr. Yin?

324
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,920
Really?

325
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,670
Alright, got it.

326
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,466
We don't need to search anymore.

327
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,577
Mr. Yin marked it for us.

328
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,888
Right here.

(Linshan City Shelter)

331
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,440
Hurry.

332
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,822
What are you dawdling for?

333
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,080
This is it!

334
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,360
There's a railway track here.

335
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,440
Just follow the track.

(July 22, 2009, Mangjiang, Linshan City)

337
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,470
Head this way first,

338
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:08,000
and then roughly in that direction.

339
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,790
Yes.

340
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,600
Go that way.

341
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,360
That direction.

342
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:10,910
Alright.

343
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,750
No problem.

344
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,390
Are you scared?

345
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,710
A little.

346
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,150
Do you trust us then?

347
00:16:30,244 --> 00:16:31,360

we'll send you back first.

00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,990
Pack everything up.

It's up ahead.

354
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:26,355
Careful. It's slippery.

Can you?

368
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,110
You two stay here and find

383
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,680
We're hiking enthusiasts.

384
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,760
Just looking around.

385
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,840
Sir,

386
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,790
is there a restroom around here

387
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,111
if we can't go this way?

388
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,720
Why are you filming?

389
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:55,640
You can't come in here, okay?

390
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,440
We need the restroom.

391
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,590
- What are you doing?
- There's no restroom.

392
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,240
Why are you so aggressive?

393
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:01,911
Yes, I'm just asking to use a restroom.

394
00:19:01,911 --> 00:19:02,480
We've

395
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,590
been hiking for a long time

396
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,200
and just want a place to rest.

397
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,110
Do you have one?

398
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,888
The forestry station has rules.
We can't let outsiders rest here.

399
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,840
Head back.

400
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,680
We're deep in the mountains.

401
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,350
If you and I don't tell, who would know?

402
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,640
Yes.

403
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,790
We can pay. Look.

404
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,800
How much?

405
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
It's not about the money.

406
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:23,444
Look, most of these houses
are abandoned.

407
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,270
The toilet is filthy and smelly.

408
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:27,300
There's no way we can let you rest.
Just head back.

409
00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:28,550
It's okay, girls...

410
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,510
Okay.

411
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:30,720
Okay then, we won't go inside.

412
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,110
Can we just sit here for a bit?

413
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,270
Okay? Let's sit here for a bit.

414
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,680
Here.

415
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,520
Sit for a bit.

416
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,550
Sit for a bit.

417
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,439
- Shake the stuff out of your shoes.
- Sit here.

418
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,400
Nong, let them stay

419
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:40,044
and make some side income.

420
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,720
We're tight on cash lately.

421
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,320
No.

422
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,800
We need to receive goods tonight.

423
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:45,822
Don't cause trouble.

424
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,520
You all better go.

425
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,640
You can hike further,

426
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,070
and you're not alone.

427
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:58,666
You brought three girls with you.

428
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,800
Have we

429
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,888
met this girl before?

430
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,270
Who have you met?

431
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,280
Me?

432
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,640
Where did you see me?

433
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,230
No, man.

434
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,880
That pickup line is way too old.

435
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,440
"Have we met this girl before?"

436
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,520
Years ago,

437
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,000
I said the same thing
when I first met my wife.

438
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,830
Don't do that.

439
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,310
That trick doesn't work anymore.

440
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,270
What?
Why are you all staring at me like that?

441
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,680
No, the way you're staring
is kind of scary.

442
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,800
What's wrong?

443
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,790
- What's wrong?
- Enough talking. Let's go.

444
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,790
Why are they staring?

445
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,569
Stop talking.

446
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,600
We just want the restroom.

447
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,660
It's creepy that they stare at us
like that in the mountains.

448
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,800
Never seen a woman before?

449
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,688
We've got goods arriving tonight.

450
00:20:57,711 --> 00:20:58,666
Don't cause trouble.

451
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,350
That girl...

452
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,760
looks suspicious.

453
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,320
I think so too.

454
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:29,510
Are you alright, Lianqiao?

455
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,430
Miss.

456
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,430
I remember them.

457
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,840
It was them.

458
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,070
They locked us in the house

459
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,720
and wouldn't let us speak.

460
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,622
If we spoke, they hit us.

461
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,350
Alright, it's all over now.

462
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,270
We won't let that happen again.

463
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:47,950
How about this?

464
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,720
Go back with Xu first, okay?

465
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,430
No.

466
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,390
I'm not leaving.

467
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,440
Lianqiao, be good.

468
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,590
The next step is very dangerous.

469
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,110
We can't guarantee your safety.

470
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,920
Once it's all over,

471
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,230
we'll come to see you.

472
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,190
Alright?

473
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,240
Xu.

474
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,511
Take good care of her.

475
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:07,790
Notify Director Ge to be ready
for action at any time.

476
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,630
Okay.

477
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,240
This guy left his camera behind.

478
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,355
Here, let me take a look.

479
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,680
Looks like a new model.

480
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,200
It's probably expensive.

481
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,110
Do you think

482
00:22:51,977 --> 00:22:53,050
they'll suddenly come back?

483
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,110
No.

484
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,590
If they do, it won't be at night.

485
00:22:56,688 --> 00:22:58,590
When that happens,
we'll just send them off.

486
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:00,240
Maybe when they remember the camera,

487
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:01,520
they've gone down the mountain.

488
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,350
This whole family's pretty good-looking.

489
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,400
Isn't that the woman?

490
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,270
She's pretty.

491
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,320
Nice face.

492
00:23:21,377 --> 00:23:22,720
She has a slim waist and long legs.

493
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,520
Nice figure.

494
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,680
If Madam Hu were here,

495
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,030
I reckon she'd rate her first-class.

496
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,240
We have to deal with these thugs.

497
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,950
Rui.

498
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,288
Seems like you came prepared.

499
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,720
All thanks to Jiajia.

500
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,080
Let's go.

501
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:42,480
You two be careful with that.

502
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,844
Don't delay tonight's job.

503
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,222
Got it, Nong.

504
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,520
No wonder.

505
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:50,200
I was so fierce earlier,

506
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,133
yet there was no fight.

507
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:52,555
They've got a big job tonight.

508
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,280
Nong.

509
00:24:10,355 --> 00:24:11,733
Didn't you stash some good liquor?

510
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:12,990
Bring some out for us to drink.

511
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:14,590
We've got a delivery tonight.

512
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,760
No drinking.

513
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:22,240
We've kept watching all night.

514
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm starving.

515
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,270
Alright, none of us has eaten.

516
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,800
Talk less, and you'll feel less hungry.

517
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,320
Nong.

518
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,480
I heard

519
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,066
the city base got busted.

520
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,760
Let it be.

521
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,560
It has nothing

522
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,520
to do with us.

523
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,880
Really?

524
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,840
Really.

525
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:44,777
You've been here half a year, right?

526
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,920
Seen anyone else?

527
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,000
No.

528
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,266
They haven't seen you either.

529
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,960
Even if they talk,

530
00:24:53,444 --> 00:24:54,666
they have nothing to say.

531
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,400
Looks like this lead

532
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,880
is deeper than we thought.

533
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,240
Hello?

534
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,560
I'll switch spots.

535
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:12,866
Save me a chicken wing.

536
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,600
I'll do it.

537
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:19,622
What should we do?
We can't hear a thing.

538
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,400
Aren't we on the same side?

539
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,044
Why is Nong making secret calls?

540
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,240
What do you know?

541
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,933
The less we know, the better.

542
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,960
They're pretty cautious.

543
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,280
What?

544
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,088
That place got busted too?

545
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,022
Is the trade still on tonight?

546
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,590
1:30 AM?

547
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,760
Okay.

548
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,870
Here, I got it.

549
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:00,244
Want cumin?

550
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,280
Put some.

551
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,240
Give me chili.

552
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,110
Let's work.

553
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:14,200
Why aren't they here yet?

554
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:16,066
Could they have been spooked?

555
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,750
Don't worry.

556
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,920
We're staking them out.

557
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,790
Have some patience.

558
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,480
I used to stake out all night long.

559
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,933
Sometimes for a whole week.

560
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,310
Hurry, move!

561
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,880
Four men came over with three women.

562
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:47,640
The higher-ups said
it's risky these days.

563
00:26:47,711 --> 00:26:48,733
We need to transfer soon.

564
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,760
What?

565
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:51,755
They're getting more and more cowardly.

566
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,222
This time's different.

567
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,577
Madam Hu was caught.

568
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,266
The city base was also busted.

569
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,422
We'd better be careful.

570
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,080
Go.

571
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,320
Go.

572
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,070
No, Jiajia.

573
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,270
We can't hear anything anymore.

574
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,670
Everything okay?

575
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,400
All normal here.

576
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,290
Ask Director Ge
how much longer until he arrives.

577
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,720
Go, hurry.

578
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,320
Go.

579
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,280
Hurry!

580
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,480
Go.

581
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,160
Nong.

582
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,080
Keep it down.

583
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,670
Nong.

584
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,000
Why are we suddenly leaving?

585
00:27:48,022 --> 00:27:49,550
The higher-ups said it's not safe lately

586
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,088
and asked us to leave with this batch.

587
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:52,440
What about the relay point?

588
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,510
Enough nonsense.

589
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,488
Just leave.

590
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,080
Jiajia.

591
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,240
Did you reach Director Ge?

592
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:01,044
I can't get through to him.

593
00:28:04,577 --> 00:28:05,590
We can't wait anymore.

594
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:06,470
What are you doing?

595
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,533
We need to wait for backup.

596
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,310
Wait for backup?

597
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,644
What if those girls get hurt?

598
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,320
Hurry.

599
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,320
Move.

600
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,040
Go.

601
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,510
Hurry.

602
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,230
Go.

603
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,080
Faster.

604
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,640
Get up.

605
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,390
Hurry.

606
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,350
Go.

607
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,110
Hello, Director Ge?

608
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,080
Where are you?

609
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:53,070
The target just changed direction.

610
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,430
Southeast.

611
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,022
They've walked for about five minutes.

612
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,430
Okay.

613
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,190
Hurry.

614
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,400
Police! Don't move!

615
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:04,750
Stop!

616
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,590
It's the police!

617
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,270
- Police!
- Don't move!

618
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,977
Shut up if you want to live. Hurry.

619
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:09,520
Stay still!

620
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,350
Where are you running?

621
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:10,760
Run!

622
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,440
Don't run!

623
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,320
Stop!

624
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,790
Where are you running? Stop!

625
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,840
Don't run!

626
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,470
Stop!

627
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,430
Still running?

628
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,080
Stay still.

629
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,880
Don't move.

630
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,590
Stop running.

631
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,320
Don't come closer!

632
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,310
Put the knife down first.

633
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,480
Don't come closer.

634
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,120
Don't move!

635
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,910
I'm not moving.

636
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,870
Put the knife down.

637
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,270
We're unarmed.

638
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,510
Put the knife down first.

639
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,790
Let's talk this out.

640
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,630
Calm down.

641
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,311
Let me go, and I'll let the girl go.

642
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,880
You have no way out now.

643
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,590
Your partners are already surrounded.

644
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,200
Push the girl toward us,

645
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,088
and we'll let you go.

646
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:54,111
I don't believe you!

647
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,880
Don't be afraid.

648
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,720
We're the police.

649
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,670
Don't be afraid.

650
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,840
It's okay now.

651
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,000
It's fine. You're okay now.

652
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,800
You're okay now.

653
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,190
Mr. Yin.

654
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,800
You just

655
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,977
sat there all night?

656
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,300
(Mr. Yin, the location is accurate.
Three rescued. We're safe. Deng Yan)

657
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,555
Take care of your health.

658
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,780
(Chang Rui)

659
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,660
(Successful operation.
Three girls rescued. No casualties.)

660
00:30:54,020 --> 00:31:00,660
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

661
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,220
(Interrogation Room)

662
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:05,400
I was just in charge of deliveries.

663
00:31:06,355 --> 00:31:07,430
Once we dropped them off,

664
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,480
our job was done.

665
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,222
On the way to deliver the girls,

666
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:13,022
Ke Liang seemed to receive a phone call.

667
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,750
I couldn't hear what he said.

668
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,520
Officers.

669
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,920
I just follow orders.

670
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,200
We just bring the girls over,

671
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,680
and then the boss moves them.

672
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:23,830
When there are enough girls,
he delivers them.

673
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,960
I left after that.

674
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,533
What happens next isn't my business.

675
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,510
Who's your boss?

676
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,160
All I know is we call him Boss.

677
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,000
He contacts me directly.

678
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,311
I just watched over the warehouse

679
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,160
and gave them a place to rest

680
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,133
and make some money.

681
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,440
I wasn't involved

682
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,022
in trafficking you said.

683
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,720
Everyone we arrest says that.

684
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,440
Do you know what trafficking is?

685
00:31:57,155 --> 00:31:59,022
You were part of the transfer, right?

686
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,590
That's trafficking too.

687
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,310
Why did you run then?

688
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,510
What are you guilty of?

689
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,160
Didn't you also take a hostage?

690
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,280
That forestry station

691
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,790
was used to lock people up, right?

692
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:14,040
How many were held there?

693
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
Li Danong.

694
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,920
According to Article 240

695
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,160
of the Criminal Law
of the PRC,

696
00:32:19,222 --> 00:32:21,288
anyone trafficking
three or more women or children,

697
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:22,733
in especially serious circumstances,

698
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,244
can face the death penalty.

699
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:26,577
Don't say we didn't warn you.

700
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,310
We're trying to help you.

701
00:32:29,222 --> 00:32:31,070
Your accomplices have already confessed.

702
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,480
You're the last one.

703
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:33,819
If you don't confess,

704
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,511
your punishment
will be heavier than theirs.

705
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,777
There's nothing we can do.

706
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,244
It depends on what you tell us.

707
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,510
I know your rules too.

708
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,310
As long as you don't rat them out,
your family will be safe.

709
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,777
But do you really think we're pushovers?

710
00:32:49,822 --> 00:32:50,888
If you don't speak up,

711
00:32:50,911 --> 00:32:52,022
this case won't be solved?

712
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,520
You...

713
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,350
Can you really help me?

714
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,044
It depends on what you say.

715
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,910
I'll talk.

716
00:33:11,377 --> 00:33:12,644
I'll tell you everything.

717
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:15,022
Who were
the ones transporting the girls?

718
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,110
Ke Liang.

719
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,630
Whiteboard.

720
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,280
Zhao.

721
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,150
Just those few.

722
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,560
Who arranged it?

723
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,040
It was a guy.

724
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,080
I think

725
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,840
he was called Fei.

726
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,110
But...

727
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,480
Every time he came,

728
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,400
he sent us away.

729
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,070
We never got a good look at him.

730
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,430
Speaking of,

731
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,840
one time

732
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,310
we had a large group.

733
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,288
Their boss came too.

734
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:49,630
It was...

735
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,600
a guy with a limp.

736
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,577
What did that guy with a limp look like?

737
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,866
I couldn't see clearly.

738
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,510
I never had the chance to get close.

739
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,630
They always sent us away.

740
00:34:14,822 --> 00:34:16,755
I really don't know.
I didn't get a good look.

741
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,222
Who received the girls?

742
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,720
Skinner.

743
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,190
Some others

744
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:27,444
were from Old Yellow Dog.

745
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:29,266
What's their relationship?

746
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,760
They

747
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,550
were in charge of pickup.

748
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,880
I heard,

749
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,630
a few years ago,

750
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,400
the prettier ones

751
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,590
were sent to the city by Skinner.

752
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,600
The ones

753
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,920
that are less attractive

754
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,920
were sold to rural villages

755
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,510
as brides by Old Yellow Dog.

756
00:34:53,088 --> 00:34:54,390
How did they contact you?

757
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,800
They always called me

758
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,230
using public phones
from different places.

759
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:02,000
The ones you can't call back.

760

Look.

775
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,840
I was thinking

776
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,920
about replacing
all the building materials

Once it's sturdy,

780
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,880
we can remove

Can you see

794
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,110
if we can

795
00:37:13,288 --> 00:37:15,888

Yes, see if you can

00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,030
to visit their kids,
if they could temporarily

807
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,760
rest and stay here,

808
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,000
it would save them some money.

They're not well-off,

812

so we

813
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,190
should help however we can.

he was working with Madam Hong.

Everything seems clearer now.

843
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,630
The main distributor is led by Cripple.

844
00:38:51,977 --> 00:38:54,466
It's divided into two branches,
Skinner and Huang Chuan.

One is responsible
for forcing girls into prostitution.

after soliciting a prostitute?

887

But thanks to what you police taught me,

902
00:41:17,022 --> 00:41:18,600

- Who gave it to you?

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,760
It was...

905
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,590
I was there for a foot massage.

906
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,360

is being soft-hearted.

00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:31,070
When I see someone pitiful...

911
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,720
I asked you

912
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,000
who gave you that note.

913
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,670
Where?

It was...

917
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,120
I'll confess.

918
00:41:41,177 --> 00:41:42,280
I'll tell you everything.

919
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,550
