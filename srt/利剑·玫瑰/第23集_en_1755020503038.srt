Put on your hats.

(Martyrs' Memorial)

217
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,790
(The truck involved in the crash
was stolen a month ago.)

218
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,790
(Zhou Hongcai died at the scene.)

219
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,390
(The truck driver is missing.)

220
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,110
(According to Chang Rui's account,)

221
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,720
(their vehicle lost control)

222
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,110
(after running over road spikes,)

223
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,680
(causing it to veer off course.)

224
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,070
(That's why they ended up at the scene)

225
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,520
(where the crash happened.)

226
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,390
This case

227
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,440
can be classified

228
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:14,440
as premeditated murder.

229
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:17,690
The provincial authorities are
taking this case very seriously.

230
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,390
They've ordered us
to set up a task force

231
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,680
and get to the bottom of this

232
00:19:21,822 --> 00:19:22,920
as quickly as possible,

233
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,680
and bring the killer to justice.

234
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,720
Director Deng.

235
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:47,630
That's how anti-abduction work goes.

236
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:50,933
We have to understand
the families' emotions too.

237
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,520
But sometimes there's just no way.

238
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:54,688
There are always
a million threads to follow.

239
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:57,150
Charging into danger is easy.

240
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,630
The hardest part is dealing
with the victims' families.

241
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,310
(Didn't Captain Han tell you?)

242
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,520
(You should rest.)

243
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,440
If we all listened to doctors,

244
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:07,310
every hospital in the country

245
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,960
would be filled with police officers.

246
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,280
This minor illness is nothing.

247
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,488
It can't be cured,
but it won't kill me either.

248
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,960
The former director called it.

249
00:20:16,155 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm almost at retirement age anyway.

250
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,520
Whatever happens,

251
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,550
I'll take responsibility. I don't mind.

252
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,955
(You're the backbone
of our anti-abduction office.)

253
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,920

256
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,680
I came up with

257
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,480
a new soup recipe.

258
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,280
No matter how sad,

259
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,590
you still have to eat.

260
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,000
It's not too salty. Don't worry.

261
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,520

262
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,790

Got it.

269

Lay low for now.

That old cop is dead.

271
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,760
I told you to kill Wai!

272
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,622
Why did you take out a cop too?

273
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,630
Stay hidden.

274
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,177
Don't show your face unless I call.

275
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,440
Got it.

276
00:23:41,022 --> 00:23:42,377
What rotten luck.

I want to request a transfer
to the task force.

282

I want to help investigate
Vice Director Yin's case.

283
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,830
I don't approve.

284
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,920
Mr. Yin's case is a major one.

285
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,911
The provincial authorities
have already flagged it.

286
00:24:21,955 --> 00:24:23,200
You're not on the task force.

287
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,150
You can't join.

288
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,870
Right now,

289
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,550
just focus on your anti-abduction work.

290
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,200
As for Mr. Yin,

291
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,630
if you remember anything else,

292
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,720
report it to me.

293
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,533
Stay out of everything else.

294
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:02,355

the case now.

Please, help me out.

I'll do my best.

300
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:41,619
Rui, the truck involved in the crash
refueled three times

301
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,870
at a gas station near the scene.

302
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,720
Forensics found multiple brake marks

303
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,150
matching the truck at the crash site.

304
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,520
The crash happened here.

305
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,150
The gas station's here.

306
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,960
Only five kilometers apart.

307
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,040
Three refuels.

308
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,960

309
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,830
Any other leads?

310
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,240
The rest of the data is classified.

311
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,790
They said we don't have clearance.

312
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,070
That's out of line!

313
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,070
Let me say it again,

314
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,977
I'm not transferring you
to the task force.

315
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,790
And stop investigating on your own.

316
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,870
You have your own responsibilities

317
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,480
within the Anti-abduction Office.

318
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,200

Where are you needed most?

321
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,000
Mr. Yin was my comrade.

322
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,511
We worked together for over 20 years.

323
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,666
He died. You think I'm not grieving?

324
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,550
Listen,

325
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,355
our task force will do everything we can

326
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,155
to bring the killer to justice.

327
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:56,244
Their target wasn't Mr. Yin.

328
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,000
It was the trafficker Zhou Hongcai.

329
00:28:59,044 --> 00:29:00,480
The task force will investigate.

330
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,590
It's not your concern.

331
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:04,177
If there's nothing else,
get back to the office.

332
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,790

I wonder how Rui is holding up.

335
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,340
Captain Han refused to let him
join the task force.

336
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,440
He's probably upset.

337
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,830
Let him cool off a bit.

338
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,480
I tried calling him.

339
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,110
He didn't pick up.

340
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,680
Mr. Yin is gone.

Let's push through these few days.

344
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,790
Get the work done properly.

345
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,390
Will Director Deng be back?

346
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,830
Don't worry, Jiajia.

347
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,000
I believe

348
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,720
Director Deng is innocent.

349
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,390
She'll definitely return.

350
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,790
Mr. Yin is gone.

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,520
Deng Yan is suspended.

352
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,630
And Yan Lei?

353
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,760
He's been in low spirits too.

354
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,310
Especially that kid Chang Rui,

355
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:57,770
he barged into my office yesterday

356
00:29:57,777 --> 00:29:58,666
and snapped at me,

357
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,440
saying we must

358
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,070
catch the killer

359
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,480
and give Mr. Yin justice.

360
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,390
I told him,

361
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,155
"Get back to the
Anti-abduction Office now.

362
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Get that place running in top shape.

363
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,711
That's the best way to honor Mr. Yin.

It's what he would've wanted."

365
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:12,577

366
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,550
You're the head of the task force,

367
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,960
a cop with decades of experience,

368
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,377
and you're losing your cool?

369
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,280
Yeah.

370
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,110
The Anti-abduction Office

371
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,480
is going through

372
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,200
a rough patch.

373
00:30:28,688 --> 00:30:30,000
Back when Mr. Yin was here,

374
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,630
he was the anchor of the whole team.

375
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,760
He was the glue that held
all the young ones together.

376
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,280
Now he's gone.

377
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:38,630
But this is an opportunity

378
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,070
for them to grow through experience.

379
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,630
Right?

380
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,111
How's the Deng Yan investigation going?

381
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,590
There's been some progress.

382
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,390
At Deng Yan's home,

383
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,040
on the door lock,

384
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,920
we found something unusual.

385
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,960
Someone likely planted the money
on purpose.

386
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,630
Then hurry and get solid evidence.

387
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,466
Clear her name and reinstate her.

388
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,590
Understood.

389
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,000
I've assigned people

390
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,150
to look

391
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,870
for solid proof.

392
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,200
Han.

393
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,720
Hang in there.

394
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,110
Chief Xiao.

395
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,520
Honestly,

396
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,720
I haven't slept well these days.

397
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,960
Mr. Yin keeps appearing in my dreams.

398
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:38,111
He just stands there from afar,
smiling at me.

399
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,480
He said

400
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,280
he never once regretted

401
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,550
standing with us as a comrade.

402
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,390
I...

403
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,440
I really miss him.

404
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,350
Han.

405
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:05,533
Hold it together.

406
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,000
Don't worry.

407
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:23,390
Never thought the next time I'd see you

408
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,390
would be in a place like this.

409
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,040
Now that Mr. Yin is gone,

410
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:30,550
you need to be extra careful.

411
00:32:31,422 --> 00:32:33,150
I remember when I
first joined the office,

412
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,480
he would tell me,

413
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:37,000
"That's how anti-abduction work goes."

414
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,555
Back then, I didn't get it.

415
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,333
Now I finally understand what he meant.

416
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,350
I've always wanted to thank him.

417
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:49,630
But he'll never hear it now.

418
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,390
In the final moment of the crash,

419
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,630
Mr. Yin used his body
to shield Zhou Hongcai.

420
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:01,800
That's why he died.

421
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,630
They got you suspended,

422
00:33:05,955 --> 00:33:07,377
and got Mr. Yin killed.

423
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,870
That just shows they're desperate

424
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,720
and out of options.

425
00:33:14,422 --> 00:33:16,590
So, you believe I'm innocent?

426
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,830
Why?

427
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:21,070
Because you're someone with conviction.

428
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:24,150
In that way, you're just like Mr. Yin.

429
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,280
Someone with conviction

430
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,070
can't be bought

431
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,830
or corrupted.

432
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
You'll definitely be reinstated.

433
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,350
Right,

434
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:38,311
Mr. Yin?

435
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,150
Xiuming.

436
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:04,933
Why are you back?

437
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,622
Is Wu at the company?

438
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:09,920
I think so.

439
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,070
Go get him for me.

440
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:12,320
Both of you, come to my office.

441
00:34:12,355 --> 00:34:13,444
I need to talk to you.

442
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:20,880
Wu,

443
00:34:21,088 --> 00:34:22,710
our company in Shencheng needs funds.

444
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:24,320
We've talked about this for a long time.

445
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,800
You personally guaranteed me

446
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,110
the money would be in place soon,

447
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,190
and you'd handle Fu Haochen.

448
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,550
So now tell me,

449
00:34:29,711 --> 00:34:31,200
when will the money arrive?

450
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,177
As soon as possible.

451
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,150
How soon is "soon"?

452
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,070
When will Fu Haochen be dealt with?

453
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:41,840
Mr. Ye,

454
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,960
you know how it is.

455
00:34:44,422 --> 00:34:46,222
Until there's a signature and a stamp,

456
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,840
nothing is guaranteed.

457
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,630
It's not up to me.

458
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,550
It's this late in the game,
and they still haven't

459
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,230
signed off?

460
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,480
I can't wait any longer.

461
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,960
Mr. Wu has done his best.

462
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,270
I don't care.

463
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,230
I want results.

464
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,070
I want money.

465
00:35:23,044 --> 00:35:23,822
Mr. Ye,

466
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,800
I have another idea.

467
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,177
It might be worth a try.

468
00:35:27,844 --> 00:35:29,355
Who knows, it might just seal the deal.

469
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,110
What idea?

470
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,190
(Fu Haochen had a daughter.)

471
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:41,177
(She was born with poor health.)

472
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:43,750
(His wife went everywhere
to seek treatment)

473
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,150
(for their child.)

474
00:35:45,422 --> 00:35:46,920
(But in the end, the child died.)

475
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,320
(Since then...)

476
00:35:49,644 --> 00:35:50,311
Wenwen.

477
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:51,820
(His wife hasn't
been right in the head.)

478
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,440
Wenwen.

479
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,480
Wenwen, where are you hiding?

480
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,040
Mommy can't find you.

481
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,960
Wenwen...

482
00:36:01,044 --> 00:36:02,920
(Fu Haochen cares a lot
about appearances.)

483
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,520
Mommy's coming.

484
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,250
(He refuses to take her
to a psychiatrist.)

485
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,644
(They've tried every odd remedy
imaginable.)

486
00:36:08,088 --> 00:36:08,911
(Nothing worked.)

487
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,955
What's wrong, Honey?

488
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,044
(Fu Haochen is under so much pressure)

489
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,270
(because of this)

490
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,800
(that he can't focus on work.)

491
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,000
Where is she? Where did she go?

492
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,520
Wenwen is dead.

493
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,360
You're lying!

494
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:20,800
Wenwen is playing hide-and-seek.

495
00:36:20,844 --> 00:36:21,600
Give it to me.

496
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,630
Relax.

497
00:36:22,822 --> 00:36:23,822
Everything's fine.

498
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:24,920
I was thinking,

499
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,270
emotional wounds need emotional healing.

500
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,320
If we could use

501
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,200
your connection with
Bring Lost Children Home

502
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,440
to help them adopt a similar child...

503
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,800
(Perhaps)

504
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,320
(that would fix Fu Haochen's wife.)

505
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,070
Wenwen.

506
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,733
Mom and Dad are coming
to find you, Wenwen.

507
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,230
(As long as we help him)

508
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,400
(solve his family's problems,)

509
00:36:56,733 --> 00:36:58,320
(he'll definitely be grateful.)

510
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,110
This project

511
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:04,355
might actually go through.

512
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:10,880
Cripple.

513
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,480
You've been making quite a stir lately.

514
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
Wai

515
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,150
was going to expose our secret.

516
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,355
Do you think I could let him live?

517
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:23,880
It's just that

518
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,110
my subordinate, Wu,

519
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,400
is too bullheaded.

520
00:38:28,688 --> 00:38:30,110
I told him to take care of Wai,

521
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,270
but who knew

522
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,777
he even dared to mess with a cop.

523
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,040
But don't worry.

524
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,733
I promise I'll clean up the mess.

525
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:38,960
If I have to,

526
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,622
I'll take care of Wu too.

527
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,622
Wai deserved to die.

528
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,480
After all, he would betray anyone

529
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,520
for his own gain.

530
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,270
As for Wu, don't worry about him.

531
00:38:47,511 --> 00:38:49,088
I've already had him go into hiding.

532
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:49,800
Wu...

533
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,230
Wu?

534
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,444
You think you're the only one
working under me?

535
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,000
Got it.

536
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,440
I understand.

537
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,688
You're still the top dog.

538
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,230
I heard you're setting up
an overseas labor company.

539
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,270
What?

540
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:11,070
Planning to strike out on your own?

541
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,800
Cripple.

542
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:13,110
I'm not.

543
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,000
Cripple,

544
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,110
after you handed the business to me,

545
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,670
you wouldn't believe it,

546
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,190
it's been harder and harder
to keep things going.

547
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,590
I've got to find us a backup plan.

548
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:28,844
Let's talk about my issue first.

549
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,200
I need you to do me a favor.

550
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,222
Just say it.

551
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:33,466
I'll take care of it.

552
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,550
I need you to get me a child.

553
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:36,880
What?

554
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,190
Things are so hot right now,

555
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,040
and you're asking me to get you a child?

556
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,190
You...

557
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,550
It's a risky job.

558
00:39:45,377 --> 00:39:47,022
I'll make it worth your while.

559
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,150
I...

560
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:53,880
I...

561
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,070
Actually, I do need a favor

562
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,360
from you.

563
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,750
It's that overseas labor company
I mentioned earlier.

564
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,400
The paperwork is just a nightmare.

565
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,622
I'll have Fei Yan handle it for you.

566
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,630
He's been in Qinmang.

567
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,360
I'll get started on your matter
right away.

568
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,733
I've already found the child.

569
00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:17,622
I'll send you the info shortly.

570
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:19,666
Deliver the child to Shencheng.

571
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,070
I invested a lot

572
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,440
in grooming you.

573
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,750
Don't let me down.

574
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,644
Understood.

575
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,960
(Wai is dead.)

576
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:44,480
(Now I'm the only one who knows)

577
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,270
(about Cripple's past.)

578
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,688
(Chances are, I'll be next.)

579
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,750
(I have to uncover
Cripple's real identity.)

580
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,580
(October 21, 2009.
Guang'an Road, Linshan City.)

581
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,840
Hello, 110?

582
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,110
My child was snatched.

583
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:22,920
Please come quickly.

584
00:41:23,377 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm in the middle section
of Renmin Road.

585
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,440
No, wait, I'm on Guang'an Road.

586
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,920
Just hurry and come!

587
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,400
Move!

588
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,590
What's going on here?

589
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,520
You...

590
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,230
Officer!

591
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,040
Please help me find my child!

592
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,750
Someone took my child!

593
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,550
Your child was taken?

594
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,480
Ma'am, calm down.

595
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,110
Tell me what happened, slowly.

596
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,440
It was that blue van that just drove by.

597
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,190
They took my child!

598
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,670
A van suddenly pulled over

599
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,040
and snatched the child.

600
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,360
I was completely caught off guard.

601
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:22,920
We're from the Linshan
Anti-abduction Office.

602
00:42:22,955 --> 00:42:24,288
Are you the one who lost a child?

603
00:42:24,777 --> 00:42:26,440
There was a sideswipe accident here.

604
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,590
This woman is involved.

605
00:42:27,933 --> 00:42:30,288
There's another party
at the Guang'an Road intersection.

606
00:42:30,377 --> 00:42:31,320
She'll be here shortly.

607
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,550
Ma'am, can you tell us what happened?

608
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,670
Officer,

609
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,880
my friend and I were driving

610
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,270
her child to preschool.

611
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,480
Then all of a sudden, there was a crash.

612
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:42,270
My friend got out to argue with them

613
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,520
while I stayed in the car
to look after the child.

614
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:45,555
The child kept crying,

615
00:42:45,577 --> 00:42:46,840
saying she wanted her mom.

616
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,320
So I got out of the car with her.

617
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,400
Then out of nowhere, a car came up,

618
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,480
and they snatched the child in a flash.

619
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,000
There's no surveillance here.
Check the nearby areas.

620
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,630
Don't worry.

621
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,750
We'll do everything we can
to get the child back.
