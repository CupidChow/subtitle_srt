1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What's wrong with you?

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
She's your girlfriend. Why did you give her this medicine?

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a man.

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He must want his girlfriend, right?

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
After he took it,

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
he...

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He's a bit older.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Men love their face.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Of course, I gave her this medicine.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's my fault.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I admit it.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I also accepted the legal sanctions.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Ushe, I don't want you to take a look at Who is Missem is.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I can't. This guy is tooMarkdown.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If there is no evidence, He won't say anything.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then what do you want?

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I just wanted to find the Challenger.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I have just told you that his mom disagree.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Him?

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Look, her mom doesn't agree. Let's just assume that he took her co-agarst.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Wait a moment.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hello.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I know

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Zhou Min is here, he is willing to see us

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Ping Ping

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We all are here with you

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you have any problem during the process

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Or you don't want to talk about it

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It doesn't matter

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I want to say

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But I can't let this bad guy hurt others

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I met him on the way to school

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He asked me for directions

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I gave him directions

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Then I didn't know anything

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
When I woke up

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I was in a small house

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There was a man next to me

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Dressed in white

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
White

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I remember my classmate at school said

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Some bad guys will catch people

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's weird

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I was scared

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Struggling

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Then

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Then that white monster took off my pants

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I remember

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Ping Ping

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Look at that white monster

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Is it this person?

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's him

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Stop talking

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Can you?

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Then

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He put a cloth on my face

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then I didn't know anything

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
When I woke up

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I was blindfolded

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I can only hear the sound

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I heard

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The person who was controlling me

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It seems to be talking to another man

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That man is fierce

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I heard the sound

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The person who was controlling me

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He kept telling him

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Brother, he's wrong, he's wrong

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There has always been music there

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So they talk

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't hear it very clearly

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do you remember

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What kind of music is that?

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It seems

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's music for five days

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Two officers

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I said everything I should

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I shouldn't say it, I said it

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This is the case

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I ask you

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You said you and Zhou Min

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Make a relationship

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What are you talking about?

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm going to find Dr. Ye to check the goods

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And go to the nightclub to deliver the goods

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No, no

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
How can there be such a person?

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There is no

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That Hu Xifan

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's that Dr. Ye

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He did everything

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And that good brother Zhao Liang

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He also said

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Now you are missing

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If you don't tell me anything today

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You have to take care of what they did

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Is it okay?

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The punishment for the crime of crime is probably only 20 years

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Can you handle it?

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No, no

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No, I admit

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Just

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I want to make friends with him

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But sometimes he said he was not obedient

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Then I was confused for a moment

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Young people

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I was angry

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I wanted to sell him

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You know, Officer Chang

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I was also going to sell it to you

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But I didn't go online

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What did you just say?

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No online

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Did we ask you if you went online?

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No, no

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was a little excited just now

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I said it wrong

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That time you were with Zhao Dafeng

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You said your boss

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Who is this boss?

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I didn't say boss

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I must have said it wrong

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Anyway, I did this alone

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Then I admit

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I also accept all the punishments

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You sent Zhou Ming to the nightclub

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Bai Jingyi

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Attention all groups

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Target unit is not affected

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
All firefighters are ready

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Start operation

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Take off your headphones

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Relax

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You must let everyone know that we are investigating a case

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Attention all groups

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Target unit is not affected

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
All firefighters are ready

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let's go

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Get ready

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Go

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Go

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Go

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Go

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Go

206
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,600
Look at this girl

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Spare

208
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't know how to cry

209
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's okay, sister

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, you're a little clumsy

211
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't move

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let me see

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let me see

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let me see

215
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Dad said

216
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's go to the school tonight

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let the brothers in the bottom get angry

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't drink too much

219
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay

220
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Did you break the record?

221
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hurry up

222
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Hurry up

223
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Who is always here to play?

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yes, always

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's so exciting

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Look, it's so exciting

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Is this place that big?

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There are singers upstairs

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you want to sing? I'll sing

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm so busy

231
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't sing today

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Who is so good

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
All packed

234
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What do you mean?

235
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Please don't

236
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's time

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Go

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No, I just put Sansong

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Surround for a whole week

240
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
When President Li is playing in there

241
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
When it's time to go

242
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Isn't this a surname?

243
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay, it's not your turn

244
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Don't talk nonsense

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Big brother means

246
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He already has a crush on those girls

247
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He's already hanging on to her

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Falling down

249
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Understand

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
OK, I'll fix it later

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Come

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You two go to the back of the hand

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Keep an eye on it

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What is this place?

255
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Come

256
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Why don't you let people in?

257
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Get out

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What are you doing?

259
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm going to the bathroom

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Go

261
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Big brother

262
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Come

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Sorry

264
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry

265
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm sorry

278
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sorry

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry

280
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,560
Che

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,000

334
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Stop

335
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I want you to die

336
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Che

337
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I want you to die

338
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll never like you

339
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I will never like you

340
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll never like you

341
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I will

342
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
oh

343
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It hurts!

344
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It hurts!

345
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It hurts!

346
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It hurts!

347
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It hurts!

348
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Where are the people on the scene?

349
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Lao Yin, they went downstairs.

350
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hurry and catch them.

351
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Okay, I'll be right there.

352
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Go!

353
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Hurry!

354
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Go!

355
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Stop!

356
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Hurry!

357
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Stop!

358
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't move! Police!

359
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Come here!

360
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Hurry!

361
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Come here!

362
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Hurry!

363
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
How did you get kidnapped?

364
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Why did you come here?

365
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm from Mount Mangjing.

366
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Two months ago,

367
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
someone said they were going to the village to recruit workers.

368
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
They said they would take us to the big city to make a lot of money.

369
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But I never thought of doing this.

370
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Me too.

371
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I wanted to go out and make some money.

372
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I didn't expect them to trick us here.

373
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And force us to...

374
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
...sit and wait.

375
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Then they took me to

376
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
a place that looked like a temple.

377
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There were a few people waiting for us.

378
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Hurry!

379
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What are you doing in the village?

380
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Brother Bai,

381
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I brought you here.

382
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Get in the car!

383
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Get in the car!

384
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Get in the car!

385
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Get in the car!

386
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They brought us to a house.

387
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Get in the car!

388
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Get in the car!

389
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Get in the car!

390
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Get in the car!

391
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Get in the car!

392
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
They told us to get in the car in our clothes.

393
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And there was a girl who wanted to get in the car with us.

394
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That girl was so bold.

395
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
She jumped in the car and ran away.

396
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

397
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry.

398
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry.

399
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sorry.

401
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Get off the car!

404
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Hurry up!

405
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Get down!

406
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Get down!

407
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Get down!

408
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Are you ready?

409
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Come on.

410
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
She ran away.

411
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
She ran away!

412
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Did they chase the girl who ran away?

413
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm not sure.

414
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We never saw her again.

415
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Do you remember what the bad guy looked like?

416
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't remember.

417
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Sister, I feel like there's another girl here.

418
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
She was also kidnapped.

419
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I saw two men.

420
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
They took her away.

421
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Is she the girl who was taken away?

422
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't think so.

423
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I can't recognize her.

424
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I don't know.

425
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Could it be the girl who ran away?

426
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
She was taken away?

427
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's her.

428
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's that bald guy.

429
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Get in the car.

430
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Get in the car.

431
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's No. 4.

432
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's her.

433
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Open the door.

434
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Open the door.

435
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Look at me.

436
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Open the door.

437
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's No. 4.

438
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's her.

439
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
According to the two victims,

440
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
it's true what Bai Wen Tao said.

441
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But who are their superiors?

442
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Bai Wen Tao and Hu Xifan

443
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
seemed to be very afraid of their superiors.

444
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
They refused to explain anything.

445
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
We don't have any other clues.

446
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
We don't seem to have any clues.

447
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What clues?

448
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The girl who ran away.

449
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We don't even know who that girl is.

450
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
We don't know who she is.

451
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But we know where she ended up.

452
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Let me tell you first.

453
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Our child has been lost for 11 years.

454
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's been three months and nine days.

455
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Every night, I dream,

456
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I dream of her.

457
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I dream of her wearing a dress I bought for her.

458
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
She cried with me.

459
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
She asked me when I would pick her up.

460
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Later,

461
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Ms. Zhang told me

462
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
that our child is now 14 years old.

463
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
She's not the little girl I dreamed of.

464
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I just realized that

465
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I didn't even know what my child looks like now.

466
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That...

467
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's so hard to blame.

468
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm fine.

469
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I feel much better now.

470
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Liu,

471
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
do you want to tell us your story?

472
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Okay.

473
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
My family is like this.

474
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
My wife is not in good health.

475
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
My son and wife are busy.

476
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm basically the one who takes care of my grandson.

477
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
One day, I went to pick him up.

478
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It was 10 minutes late.

479
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It was 10 minutes late.

480
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The child was lost.

481
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I feel so bad.

482
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Liu.

483
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Liu, don't blame yourself.

484
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
None of us want this to happen, right?

485
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We're here today

486
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
because we all have a belief.

487
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We believe that our children are safe.

488
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We believe that

489
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
they will come back healthy.

490
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yes.

491
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
My little girl is not in good health.

492
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
She will come back healthy.

493
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes.

494
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We will.

495
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
We will.

496
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Come on.

497
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Come on.

498
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Come on.

499
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Come on.

500
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
We will.

501
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Come on.

502
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Come on.

503
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Come on.

504
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Come on.

505
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Come on.

506
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Director Deng,

507
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
the girl we saved yesterday

508
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
has been found.

509
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I asked Yixing to inform their family

510
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
to come and pick her up.

511
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Where is the girl who escaped?

512
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Any clues?

513
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
No.

514
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No.

515
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yang Yu, do you have any clues?

516
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No.

517
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
To be honest,

518
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
what do the police men and women do?

519
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You're so young.

520
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You're really a man of few words.

521
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I can't be anxious about the police.

522
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
They always take the lead.

523
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Take your time.

524
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
All right.

525
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You're out of the night.

526
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Go back and have a rest.

527
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Today,

528
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
two new members came to our place.

529
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Would you like to tell your story

530
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
to everyone?

531
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
OK.

532
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
All right.

533
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Honey,

534
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
let's tell everyone

535
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
about Yang Yu.

536
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Please help us find her.

537
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
She's strong.

538
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yes.

539
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Come on.

540
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Tell us.

541
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Honey, come on.

542
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
She's not in good condition.

543
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Please tell us first.

544
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm sorry.

545
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's OK.

546
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Sit down.

547
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Don't worry.

548
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I believe

549
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
we can find the lost child.

550
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Recently,

551
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I have a real feeling.

552
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The human's emotional reaction

553
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
is real.

554
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Professor Yuhan Tai Le of the University of California,

555
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
has already proven this fact.

556
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But the trigger is complicated.

557
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I think

558
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
blood relations

559
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
are the easiest to generate emotional reaction.

560
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I believe

561
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
we can find our child

562
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
in the near future.

563
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We can find her.

564
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
We will.

565
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yes.

566
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
We will.

567
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
We will find her.

568
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Come on.

569
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Come on.

570
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Come on.

571
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Come on.

572
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Come on.

573
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Come on.

574
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Come on.

575
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Come on.

576
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Come on.

577
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Come on.

578
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Come on.

579
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Don't you think you're funny?

580
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You lost your child.

581
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You don't go to find your child.

582
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Why are you still here

583
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
to study special functions?

584
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yang Yu's mom,

585
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I understand your feeling.

586
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
We also came from this step.

587
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Besides,

588
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
they want to pay attention to...

589
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Why did you bring me here?

590
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Listen to these people.

591
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
What's the point of saying these words, Lin Hao?

592
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I...

593
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
A child lost three years.

594
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
A child lost 11 years.

595
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Mrs. Zhang's child lost 20 years.

596
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
They don't go to find their child.

597
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What kind of emotional reaction are you doing here?

598
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Well,

599
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yang Yu's mom,

600
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
listen to me.

601
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The people sitting here

602
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
have the same experience as you.

603
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
We can understand

604
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
your feelings now.

605
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You can understand me, right?

606
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Yes.

607
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I don't understand you.

608
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Really.

609
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You don't go to find your child.

610
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You're sighing here.

611
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You're hypnotizing yourself.

612
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You're running away from reality.

613
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You're wasting your time.

614
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
No.

615
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The child won't come back by himself.

616
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
No.

617
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm sorry.

618
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm sorry.

619
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Baby.

620
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Baby.

621
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
If

622
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
the criminal who is selling girls

623
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and children

624
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
is linked to a certain time

625
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
or a certain place

626
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
from the connection,

627
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
fraud,

628
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
control,

629
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
delivery,

630
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
middle-way,

631
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
selling,

632
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and payment,

633
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
is there any possibility

634
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
that the criminal who is selling girls

635
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and children

636
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
will be linked to a certain time

637
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
or a certain place

638
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
at a certain time?

639
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
For example,

640
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Bai Wentao,

641
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
he was selling girls

642
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and children

643
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
at the same time.

644
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Is it possible that

645
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
he will sell children at the same time?

646
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Usually,

647
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
selling girls and children

648
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
is not a line.

649
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Then we must find out

650
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
how Lu Nuo

651
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
got into Bai Wentao's hands.

652
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Or if there is any

653
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
person in between.

654
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Only finding this person

655
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
is the key clue

656
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
to our breakthrough

657
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
of selling children.

658
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Where to find?

659
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
He bit him to death.

660
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Luoluo was adopted by him.

661
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We can't find

662
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
the person in between.

663
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
How can two lines

664
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
be linked together?

665
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Now it seems that

666
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Bai Wentao's upper limit

667
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
is definitely not clear.

668
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Then we only

669
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
find the girl who ran away

670
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
now

671
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
to open the situation.

672
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
OK.

673
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Then, Lao Ye,

674
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
you sit here.

675
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Others follow me

676
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
to find the girl who ran away.

677
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Come.

678
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Thank you, mom.

679
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Sister, I tell you.

680
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It is important to have a child.

681
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But I think

682
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
the mother's mental state

683
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
is not very good.

684
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
If a person

685
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
has no mental persistence,

686
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
he will be ruined.

687
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I tell you.

688
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
If it doesn't work,

689
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
let them have another one.

690
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The mother can't think of it.

691
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I tell you.

692
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
If you don't have a child,

693
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
you can't have a child.

694
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I tell you.

695
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
If you don't have a child,

696
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
you can't have a child.

697
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I know.

698
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Thank you.

699
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
OK, I go first.

700
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Take care.

701
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Sister, think about it.

702
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
OK.

703
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I will talk to you.

704
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Take care.

705
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I go first.

706
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
OK.

707
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Xinxin.

708
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
What did aunt say just now?

709
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Nothing.

710
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Give birth again.

711
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
What is it?

712
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You heard wrong.

713
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Mom, I don't have a child.

714
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
What does she mean?

715
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Mom.

716
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Xiaoyang Yu is my child.

717
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
She is not a miscarriage.

718
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
She lost it.

719
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
How can she say that?

720
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
She is kind.

721
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Kind?

722
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You said she was kind.

723
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Did aunt say that in your heart?

724
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Do you want me to give birth again?

725
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I...

726
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Xinxin, you are wrong.

727
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I didn't mean that.

728
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I think you mean that.

729
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I didn't.

730
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Why did she come suddenly today?

731
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I don't know.

732
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I don't know.

733
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Why did she come suddenly today?

734
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Did you tell her to come to our house?

735
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Mom, I tell you now.

736
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I only have one child in my life.

737
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I will never have a child.

738
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
If you think so,

739
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
you are not worthy of being a child's grandmother.

740
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Xinxin.

741
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
She didn't mean that.

742
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I didn't tell her to give birth again.

743
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
She just...

744
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
What is it?

745
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Stop talking.

746
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
What does your family mean?

747
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Why did she say that?

748
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
What right does she have to say that?

749
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
If not, she won't lose the child.

750
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
What are you talking about?

751
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Are you crazy?

752
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
What am I talking about?

753
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I am crazy because of you.

754
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
What are you talking about?

755
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Stop talking.

756
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Stop talking.

757
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Your mom is alone.

758
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
She is the one who lost the child.

759
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It's not me.

760
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Why do you blame me?

761
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
She came to our house

762
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and asked me to give birth again.

763
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's your family.

764
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's just a mistake.

765
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's not intentional to lose your mom.

766
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Stop talking.

767
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's just a mistake.

768
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Stop talking.

769
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Fine.

770
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You just want to give birth again.

771
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Come back.

772
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Go to find a doctor first.

773
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Go.

774
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Who said I wanted to give birth again?

775
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You are so scary.

776
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What did you say?

777
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Stop talking, Xiao Hao.

778
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Stop talking.

779
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Xinxin.

780
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I am also a mother.

781
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I understand all the things you did to me today.

782
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
The child is lost.

783
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It hurts just like you.

784
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I am so scared.

785
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I always blame myself.

786
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
If possible,

787
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I would rather give my life

788
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
to give the child back.

789
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Hello.

790
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Lin Xinxin.

791
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I know where your son is.

792
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Mom.

793
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
There is news about the child.

794
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay.

795
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'll go first.

796
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Hello.

797
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Hello.

798
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Are you the one who called us?

799
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Please.

800
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Okay.

801
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
This is my wife, Cai Xin.

802
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
This is my mother.

803
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Hello.

804
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Where is the child now?

805
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Don't worry.

806
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Don't worry.

807
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
My name is Zhao Zhirong.

808
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I am a volunteer from a love organization.

809
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
The child...

810
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Coincidentally,

811
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
my cousin saw it.

812
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Here is the thing.

813
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We posted the news of the child

814
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
in the Pansi VQQ group.

815
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Usually,

816
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
we will post it online.

817
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
We posted it.

818
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Coincidentally,

819
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
my cousin saw it.

820
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
There is a black mole behind the child.

821
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Yes.

822
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
There is a black mole on the back.

823
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yes.

824
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
We have a deep impression.

825
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Let me show you.

826
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Come on.

827
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It smells good.

828
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It smells good.

829
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
My cousin said

830
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
he saw it in Lianxiang Town.

831
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Lianxiang Town?

832
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Let's go there now.

833
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Let's go.

834
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Let's go.

835
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Sit down.

836
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Let's go.

837
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Lianxiang Town

838
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
is not big.

839
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's not small.

840
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But it is a town.

841
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You just go there like this.

842
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Do you think the child is safe?

843
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Uncle Zhirong,

844
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
you are cleaning up the mess, right?

845
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Mr. Zhao.

846
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Then...

847
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
How should we arrange it?

848
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I will call my cousin.

849
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
He is familiar with Lianxiang Town.

850
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I will let him go there first.

851
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We will find a way.

852
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Okay.

853
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Don't worry.

854
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
My cousin is like me.

855
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
He is a warm-hearted person.

856
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I will do my best to help you.

857
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Okay?

858
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Thank you so much.

859
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Okay.

860
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And...

861
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I have one more thing.

862
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You must promise me.

863
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
What is it?

864
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I will do my best

865
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
to find the person.

866
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
But after you find him,

867
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
you can't tell the police.

868
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Why?

869
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Aunt.

870
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It's a serious crime to kidnap a child.

871
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
If the suspect knows it,

872
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
what should we do?

873
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I hope...

874
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Don't worry.

875
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
We will not call the police.

876
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I won't let them call the police.

877
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yes.

878
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
We won't call the police.

879
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Let's go.

880
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Okay.

881
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Let's go back and pack up.

882
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I will send you the file.

883
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

884
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Thank you.

885
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
If you have any news,

886
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
please let us know.

887
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I think there is something wrong with this person.

888
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I think he has something to do

889
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
with the person who kidnapped our child.

890
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Mom.

891
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It doesn't matter if he has something to do with the person.

892
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
What matters is that the child can be found.

893
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I can't care about that.

894
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
No.

895
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I will tell you.

896
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Don't say anything.

897
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Go and have a look.

898
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Don't say anything.

899
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Let's go.

900
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
According to the two girls,

901
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
they were running away

902
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
when they were sent to the place

903
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
where the white gold number one is.

904
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But based on the source of the white gold number one,

905
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
we have checked the whole place.

906
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
There is no useful clue or information.

907
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And I also checked.

908
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I haven't received any information

909
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
from the girl who asked for help recently.

910
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I suspect that girl

911
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
may not be in Lin Shan City anymore.

912
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Someone is chasing her in Mulang.

913
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
There is no trace of her in Lin Shan City.

914
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So I guess

915
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
she is just on the south side.

916
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The direction of Pengcaozhen.

917
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You go and hurry up.

918
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Let's go to Pengcaozhen later.

919
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Milk powder and milk skin.

920
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Take it.

921
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
There is also milk powder.

922
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Or take a pack.

923
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Okay.

924
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Don't forget your ID card.

925
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Xiao Hao.

926
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Mom, let's go.

927
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Otherwise, we can't go there.

928
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Let's call Director Deng.

929
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
No need.

930
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yes, I just said that it was not too late.

931
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
My ID card is in my bag.

932
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Okay.

933
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I think it's better to call the police.

934
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I...

935
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Mom, didn't you hear that?

936
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
They don't allow to call the police.

937
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I will call Yanyan.

938
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Yanyan is not an outsider.

939
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
If the police can find her, they would have found her long ago.

940
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yes.

941
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Mom.

942
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Don't make trouble at this time.

943
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Let's go, mom.

944
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Take it.

945
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Go.

946
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Cold noodles.

947
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Cold noodles.

948
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Cold noodles.

949
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Cold noodles.

950
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Cold noodles.

951
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Cold noodles.

952
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Cold noodles.

953
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Boss.

954
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
What do you want to eat?

955
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Our dish is steamed with pork.

956
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The fish is very fresh.

957
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Excuse me.

958
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Wait a minute.

959
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
What are we doing here?

960
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Someone has no specialties.

961
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Pickled fish.

962
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yes, pickled fish is famous here.

963
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Do you want to sit on the floor?

964
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Boss, don't worry.

965
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Our ancestors were all living in this farm.

966
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
The cooking of pickled fish is well-known.

967
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I guarantee you will be able to eat it.

968
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Really?

969
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I want to try it.

970
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Okay.

971
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Pickled fish.

972
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Didn't we just eat?

973
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
We can eat local food in a new place.

974
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We are not here to eat.

975
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
We are here to work.

976
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
We have to eat when we work.

977
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Is it here?

978
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yes.

979
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
What is this?

980
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yes, it's here.

981
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
This is the new building.

982
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Is this the place?

983
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yes.

984
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Hello.

985
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Hello.

986
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Is this Mr. Lin's wife?

987
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yes.

988
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Hello.

989
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I am Zhao Zhidong's cousin.

990
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You can call me Wang.

991
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Hello.

992
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Where is the child?

993
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Don't worry.

994
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
My brother has told you about my situation.

995
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Although we can confirm that the child is in our town,

996
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
we can't confirm that he is adopted by someone.

997
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
We may need to organize more people to inquire about it.

998
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
How many people are here this time?

999
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Only a few of us.

1000
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
There are too many people.

1001
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
He is too powerful.

1002
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Let me think about it.

1003
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
How about this?

1004
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Let's split up.

1005
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
There are two ways.

1006
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I will mark the location on this.

1007
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You can go to the hospital.

1008
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I will ask my friend to call you.

1009
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yes, this is my phone number.

1010
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
If you need anything, just call me.

1011
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Okay.

1012
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Okay.

1013
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Don't worry.

1014
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
We will find him.

1015
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Hello.

1016
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Have you seen this child?

1017
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Hello.

1018
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I haven't seen him.

1019
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Please look at him more.

1020
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Look at his face.

1021
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I don't know him.

1022
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm sorry.

1023
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Please have a look.

1024
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Have you seen this child?

1025
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Two days ago,

1026
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I saw a man with a leopard.

1027
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Is this the leopard?

1028
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yes, it is.

1029
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Are you sure?

1030
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Is this the child?

1031
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
How can I be sure?

1032
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
This child is afraid of them for nothing.

1033
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
If you laugh at him, I will tease him.

1034
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Do you know where he is now?

1035
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
How can I know?

1036
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
We are just a few minutes away.

1037
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You should be grateful.

1038
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You should live nearby.

1039
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Honey, we will find him soon.

1040
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
We will find him soon.

1041
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Okay.

1042
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Hello.

1043
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Okay, we will go there now.

1044
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
What did he say?

1045
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
We found him first.

1046
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Let's go.

1047
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Where is he?

1048
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Let's go.

1049
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Go.

1050
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
How much?

1051
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Okay.

1052
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
How much?

1053
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Are you satisfied with the taste?

1054
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I finished it all.

1055
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I told you.

1056
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It's authentic.

1057
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
133.

1058
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Which one do you want?

1059
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
No, thanks.

1060
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I will take this one.

1061
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
That's a lot.

1062
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Then we will go to the place where we are going.

1063
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay.

1064
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Dad, the case is done.

1065
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Get in the car.

1066
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Boss, hurry up.

1067
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm coming.

1068
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Let's go.

1069
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Mr. Lin, this is the photo my friend took.

1070
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Please confirm it.

1071
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It's not him.

1072
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Let's go find him now.

1073
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Where is he now?

1074
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Is it true?

1075
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
My friend is now

1076
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
in the area of the house near the store.

1077
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
But he didn't tell my brother.

1078
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
He helped me.

1079
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
He is different.

1080
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
How much?

1081
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
200,000.

1082
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
200,000.

1083
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
How much?

1084
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Mr. Lin, I'm also kind.

1085
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I didn't take the money.

1086
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I...

1087
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Just 200,000.

1088
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I...

1089
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Just 200,000.

1090
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Okay.

1091
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I will contact them now.

1092
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Don't worry.

1093
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Xinxin,

1094
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
we don't have 200,000.

1095
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
What I'm talking about is the small store.

1096
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The small store is owned by Mrs. Niu.

1097
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Mrs. Niu is a fast-growing woman.

1098
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
She knows everything about this town.

1099
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Okay.

1100
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Mrs. Niu,

1101
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
this is my brother.

1102
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Nice to meet you.

1103
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
He wants to ask you something.

1104
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Take your time.

1105
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Okay, thank you.

1106
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
This street is the best in our family.

1107
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
The price is fair.

1108
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Many people come here.

1109
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The news is clear.

1110
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Okay.

1111
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You can look around.

1112
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Okay.

1113
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Mrs. Niu,

1114
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I ate this candy when I was a kid.

1115
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I've never seen it before.

1116
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You have it here.

1117
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I want all of this.

1118
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Okay, okay.

1119
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Mrs. Niu, you've been here for so long.

1120
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Recently,

1121
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
are there any young girls from other places in town?

1122
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yes, there are.

1123
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
How can I give it to them?

1124
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Where are the people in town now?

1125
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
What kind of person do you want to be?

1126
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
The one who lights up others

1127
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
lights up in the dark night

1128
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
The brave person

1129
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
has a kind of identity

1130
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
that never changes

1131
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and is sincere in heart

1132
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The brave person

1133
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
has a kind of identity

1134
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
that never changes

1135
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
and is sincere in heart

1136
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Finally, I became such a person

1137
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Every number

1138
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
is a memory of youth

1139
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
and the eyes that are obsessed with it

1140
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
The wish to hold hands

1141
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
has been gone

1142
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The eyes are fixed

1143
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I raise my hand

1144
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
The gentle light

1145
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
is a dream

1146
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I've decided to turn back now

1147
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The greetings of time

1148
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
are with her

1149
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Waiting for someone to stand by

1150
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Waiting for the light

1151
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Holding the years

1152
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
She will never change

1153
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Just like my heart

1154
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It will never be deep

1155
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
The blue heart

1156
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It will never be deep
