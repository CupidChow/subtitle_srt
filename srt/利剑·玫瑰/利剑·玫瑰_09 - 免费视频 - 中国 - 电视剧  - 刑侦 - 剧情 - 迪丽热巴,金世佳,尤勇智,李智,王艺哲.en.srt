3
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,080
I want a balloon.

00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,430
Dongdong.

5
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,790
Dongdong.

6
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,510
Dongdong.

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,840
Dongdong!

8
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,110
Dongdong!

9
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,990
Dongdong!

10
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,560
Have you seen a little boy?

11
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,480
About this tall?

12
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,920
Dongdong.

13
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
Dongdong!

14
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
Dongdong.

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,390
Dongdong!

16
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,680
Put the child down.

17
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,830
Kidnapper!

18
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,000
Let go!

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,230
Put the boy down!

20
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:31,800
Put him down!

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,550
Luoluo!

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Why did you run off?

23
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,590
Move aside.

24
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,844
Didn't I tell you to sit there?

25
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,950
Why are you here?

26
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,510
Why are you so disobedient?

27
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,590
Dongdong!

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,800
Dongdong!

29
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,630
Dongdong!

30
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,400
Give him to me.

31
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,510
Don't touch my son.

32
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,510
Quit acting like this.

33
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:47,590
Give me back my child.

34
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,400
Hands off!

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,240
What are you doing?

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,270
No, he's my son.

37
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,270
That's nonsense.

38
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,670
We're already divorced.

39
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,040
The court awarded me custody.

40
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,400
So what if they did?
I still have visitation rights.

41
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,950
Are you trying to take that from me?

42
00:02:58,955 --> 00:02:59,360
Come here.

43
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,120
Hands off!

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,080
Let go!

45
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,190
Get off me!

46
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,800
Who are you?

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,640
I'm the police.

48
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,320
Take a good look.

49
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,790
I see.

50
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,160
Explain what's going on.

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,590
Well...

52
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,400
This is my son.

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,360
We're divorced.

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,600
You two need to settle this
between yourselves,

55
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:18,533
but snatching a child in broad daylight

56
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:19,440
is not okay, alright?

57
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,430
Yes, you're right.

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,590
Thank you,

59
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,430
Officer.

60
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,270
Hey, come back.

61
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,710
I just saw that man.

62
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,390
He was acting really sneaky.

63
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,830
I could tell he was up to no good.

64
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,360
When that lady turned her head
for a second,

65
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,320
he grabbed the little boy
and tried to take off.

66
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,550
I thought he must be a kidnapper.

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,360
I'm sorry, Luoluo.

68
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
I shouldn't have

69
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,790
jumped to conclusions

70
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,920
and yelled at you.

71
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,510
Is she your daughter?

72
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,110
Good thing she stepped in.

73
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,990
No.

74
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,950
Well... sort of, I guess.

75
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,640
Daddy!

76
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,800
Thank you.

77
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,040
Come on, let's go play.

78
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,510
Daddy!

79
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,200
Don't run! You'll fall.

80
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
Daddy!

81
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,022
I have a daddy now!

82
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:24,920
Slow down.

83
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,880
I have a daddy!

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,120
Slow down.

85
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,560
Daddy!

86
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,470
Look, my daddy's here.

87
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,640
I have a daddy now.

88
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,360
He's my daddy.

89
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,190
Stop running.

90
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:35,680
Look,

91
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,910
my daddy's a police officer.

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,120
He's amazing.

93
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,560
He's here.

94
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,400
Luoluo.

95
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,270
This is my daddy.

96
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,950
He's a policeman.

97
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,830
He's awesome.

98
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,320
I have a daddy now.

99
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,910
My daddy's here!

100
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,711
(Whiteboard, Skinner,
Meng Gui, Madam Hong)

101
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,880
Based on the intel from Lianqiao,

102
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:05,830
this Skinner seems to be the ringleader
of the girl trafficking gang.

103
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:08,150
And Madam Hong specializes
in abducting children.

104
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,680
(Meng Gui, Madam Hong)

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,111
Meng Gui helps Madam Hong transport

106
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,150
the kidnapped children.

107
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,800
I'm just the driver.
I wasn't part of the trafficking.

108
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,150
(Han Yougang, however,
is involved in a separate operation.)

109
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,990
(He's not part of the structure
Whiteboard mentioned.)

110
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,710
(It's clear Meng Gui was taking jobs
behind Madam Hong's back,)

111
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,311
(but Madam Hong doesn't seem to care.)

112
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:27,880
(In fact, she turns a blind eye.)

113
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,600
(Meng Gui, Madam Hong)

114
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:30,460
(Bai Wentao, "Whiteboard")

115
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,920
(Whiteboard is one of Skinner's men.)

116
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,711
I said if you
can't give the girl back,

117
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,510
one of us has to die.

118
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,590
Those two,

119
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,720
and Madam Hong, Meng Gui,

120
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,533
they're not part of the same crew
at all.

121
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,400
We need to re-map both networks.

122
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,110
There's a problem.

123
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,120
Don't you think Han Yougang's timing
was suspicious?

124
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,040
What if Han Yougang

125
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,910
was brought in by Madam Hong as a cover?

126
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,270
Mr. Yin,

127
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,360
do you think

128
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,333
Han Yougang could be connected
to Madam Hong?

129
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,910
It's definitely possible.

130
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,510
Madam Hong is very cunning.

131
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:04,000
She's good at hiding her tracks.

132
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,880
If Han Yougang is indeed
one of her runners,

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,630
then he and Meng Gui likely abducted

134
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,710
more than just two kids.

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,480
Jiajia,

136
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,310
keep checking Meng Gui's travel routes.

137
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,320
See where he's been.

138
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,190
Yan Lei,

139
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,440
keep tracking Skinner.

140
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,000
Chang Rui and I

141
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,470
will go look for Han Yougang.

142
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,220
(Smart Checkpoint Data System)

143
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,850
(Jiajia, I need)

144
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,370
(you to pull Meng Gui's
travel history from the past few years.)

145
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,390
(Including the van
with license plate South C1798B)

146
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,760
(and the SUV with plate South CC0Y30.)

147
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,150
(Look for places)

148
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,510
(where he stayed for a long time)

149
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,350
(and visited repeatedly.)

150
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,120
(Watai Village, Anji County,
Lin'an County, Jishui County)

151
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,844
(Cross-reference them with
missing persons reports from that time.)

152
00:06:53,844 --> 00:06:55,080
(We might find something.)

153
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,180
(Moxi City, Jiangcheng County,
Jishui County)

154
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,980
(Watai Village, Anji County,
Jiangcheng County, Jishui County)

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,320
Still another half hour to go.

156
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,380
Let's eat something first.

157
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,260
(Rural Guesthouse)

158
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:34,511
I need to take this. Go on ahead.

159
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,240
Here, take a look at the menu.

160
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,560
It's fine.

161
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
Just bring us two bowls of noodles.

162
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,360
Want any cold dishes?

163
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,510
No, how much is it?

164
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,520
Sixteen.

165
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,960
Do me a favor.

166
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,640
Ask your vice squad

167
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:53,680
if they've heard of someone
called Skinner.

168
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,510
Sir,

169
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,120
hey...

170
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,150
Let me ask you something.

171
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,688
Have you seen this guy?

172
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,066
No, I don't know him.

173
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:02,288
Two bowls of noodles.

174
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,070
How's the taste?

175
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,800
Clean plates.

176
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,640
Look.

177
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,670
Take this.

178
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,350
That much?

179
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,000
I want you to take us
somewhere afterward. Okay?

180
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,270
Alright, no problem.

181
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,350
Sir.

182
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,590
Can I see your menu?

183
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,950
Give me your most expensive dish.

184
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,390
250 g mixed meat, please.

185
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,870
Sure.

186
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,270
Alright.

187
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,933
Coming right up.

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,080
That's 68, right?

189
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,990
Here.

190
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,390
Miss,

191
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,400
you said you were looking for someone?

192
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:38,960
Let me see the photo again.

193
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,510
Sure.

194
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,350
Have a look.

195
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,080
See if you recognize him.

196
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,350
Did he ever eat here?

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,630
He looks kind of familiar.

198
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:47,733
Try to remember where
you've seen him before.

199
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,560
That's him, isn't it?

200
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,920
Chang Rui!

201
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,680
Move!

202
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,680
Move!

203
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,110
Watch out!

204
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,520
Why are you chasing me?

205
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,160
Han Yougang.

206
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,830
You're coming with us.

207
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,380
(Interrogation Room)

208
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,080
Look...

209
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,200
Officers,

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,830
you have the wrong guy.

211
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,030
I...

212
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,920
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

213
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,320
Then why did you run?

214
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,230
Well...

215
00:09:49,844 --> 00:09:50,990
It was a misunderstanding.

216
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,960
I...

217
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,710
I thought you were debt collectors.

218
00:09:57,533 --> 00:10:00,590
Nine out of ten people who come here say
they weren't involved in trafficking.

219
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,920
And one always says

220
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,350
he was dodging debt.

221
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,577
That's right. No one even bothers
to change the script.

222
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,990
It's fine. We're in no rush.

223
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:12,480
Didn't Meng Gui already confess?

224
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,533
He said he sold the kids.

225
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:15,666
We'll just sit here and wait.

226
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,870
Alright?

227
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,680
You caught Meng Gui too?

228
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,140
I...

229
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,870
Officer,

230
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,080
here's the thing.

231
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,080
Someone asked me for a favor.

232
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,200
I thought,

233
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,320
helping others is a good deed, right?

234
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,160
I only took a small payment.

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
And how many of those good deeds
did you do?

236
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,350
What's your relationship
with Madam Hong?

237
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,790
I don't know any Madam Hong or whoever.

238
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,630
What?

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,622
No. What you're saying
doesn't match Meng Gui's story.

240
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,830
I really don't know her.

241
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,333
Meng Gui was the one who contacted me.

242
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,080
Isn't he selling counterfeit cigarettes?

243
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,688
We got to know each other through that.

244
00:10:58,777 --> 00:11:00,630
I casually mentioned buying a kid,

245
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,440
and to my surprise,

246
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,920
he actually brought one to me.

247
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,755
He said the child had been abandoned.

248
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,200
He gave me two kids in total.

249
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,520
One was for my cousin

250
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,990
in Nanyangdian Village,

251
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,840
and one was for a coworker
in Xibang Village.

252
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,670
That's it.

253
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,630
How many kids total?

254
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,550
Just two, really.

255
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,680
How many?

256
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,200
Seriously, just two.

257
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,470
I...

258
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,240
Well... Actually...

259
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,040
Listen to me.

260
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,990
You see,

261
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,720
Meng Gui did say

262
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,000
that if I wanted to buy kids again,
I should go to him.

263
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,870
But I swear I didn't go back to him.

264
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,440
Because after my cousin's kid was found

265
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,350
in Nanyangdian,

266
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,040
I got scared.

267
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,080
I ran away.

268
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,230
I regretted it.

269
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,630
I really did.

270
00:11:41,444 --> 00:11:43,511
Looks like Han Yougang
isn't one of Madam Hong's.

271
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,270
Director.

272
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,044
According to this data comparison chart,

273
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:51,150
Meng Gui's route

274
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,200
did show up in red at the locations
where the two abduction cases occurred.

275
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,280
Meaning he stayed there.

276
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,350
The same pattern showed up
in Watai Village too.

277
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,155
But strangely, there were no reports
of child abduction there.

278
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,950
Watai Village...

279
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,080
Why does it

280
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,990
feel like I've seen that name
somewhere before?

281
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,270
Wasn't there a notice about it

282
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,280
a year ago?

283
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,510
Jiajia,

284
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,720
search the national anti-abduction
DNA database

285
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,270
and the investigation assistance notice.

286
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,110
Okay.

287
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,800
Yes, that's the one.

288
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,177
(National Anti-Abduction DNA Database)

289
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:31,270
(Investigation Assistance Notice)

290
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,000
As I recall, this case

291
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
falls under Binliu City,
Xinyang Province.

292
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,888
The crime happened in another province,

293
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,150
but the person who filed the report
was from Watai Village.

294
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:40,688
So we didn't pay much attention to it.

295
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,440
Watai Village...

296
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,510
Meng Gui.

297
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,620
(Watai Village)

298
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,830
That's the home of Zhang Xuegui
and Cao Guihua.

299
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,470
Their eldest son

300
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,400
went missing about a year ago.

301
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,977
Their neighbor is Wang Baozhu.

302
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,577
He's the only one we haven't asked.

303
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,510
Baozhu!

304
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,230
Director? What brings you here?

305
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,350
And these folks are...

306
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,488
They're officers
from Linshan City Police Bureau.

307
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,977
They're here to look into something.

308
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,950
What could I possibly know?

309
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,400
It's fine. Just say what you know.

310
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,750
If you don't, say you don't.

311
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:43,177
Have you seen this car or this man?

312
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,400
I remember that car.

313
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,160
He came here selling cheap cigarettes.

314
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:49,470
It was just a few days
before Xuegui and his wife left.

315
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,560
I remember it clearly.

316
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,040
Xuegui bought two cartons.

317
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,790
He even took down
his contact information.

318
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,990
Was it him?

319
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,350
Yeah.

320
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,560
He's the one who sold them.

321
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,750
His car was parked right here.

322
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,040
Everything happened right on this spot.

323
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,200
- Baozhu.
- 30 yuan off is impossible.

324
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,390
Xuegui.

325
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,350
I see you've got a visitor.

326
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,710
No. He's selling cheap cigarettes.

327
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,800
You don't want any?

328
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,990
Come take a look.

329
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,800
Let me see.

330
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,040
Take your pick.

331
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,320
(One thing seemed really off that day.)

332
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,710
(That guy selling cigarettes
seemed obsessed with kids.)

333
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,630
(He kept staring at little Zhang Hao,)

334
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:35,733
(and even played with him
for quite a while.)

335
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,630
Hello?

336
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,870
Jiajia.

337
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,430
Director.

338
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,670
Get on the DNA database

339
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,911
and check something for me.

340
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,377
Did you find a lead?

341
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,500
(July 18, 2009.
Binliu City Police Bureau)

342
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,710
Based on the info you gave us
on Meng Gui,

343
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,266
we pulled surveillance footage

344
00:15:21,444 --> 00:15:23,777
of the van he was driving
before and after the incident.

345
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:26,355
We've basically pieced
the whole thing together now.

346
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,630
(Hardware store entrance)
(The suspect followed Xuegui to Binliu,)

347
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,080
(and stayed near their hardware store
the whole time.)

348
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,200
(Using the plate number you gave us,)

349
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,200
(South C1798B,)

350
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,950
(we tracked it to a car repair shop.)

351
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,819
(Their surveillance showed)

352
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,790
(that when Meng Gui came in
to get his van fixed,)

353
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,320
(he was picked up by a motorcycle.)

354
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
(That motorcycle)

355
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,630
(matches the one caught
at the scene of the crime.)

356
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,350
Take a look.

357
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,110
Here's how the child went missing.

358
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,700
(Xinrong Hardware, Alley Entrance)

359
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:04,740
(Supermarket, Outdoor Area)

360
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,750
Something about Cao Guihua seems off.

361
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,110
You noticed it too?

362
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,590
After Zhang Xuegui filed the report,

363
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,320
we went to his home to gather info.

364
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,710
According to him,

365
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,160
his wife Cao Guihua
hasn't been quite right

366
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,200
since giving birth.

367
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,040
Eventually, she couldn't even
leave the house.

368
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,750
The criminals

369
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,350
took advantage of that.

370
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,230
After the child went missing,

371
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,950
her condition got even worse.

372
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,870
We wanted to find the child
as soon as possible

373
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,590
to help them through this.

374
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,990
But that village is too remote.

375
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,470
A lot of the infrastructure is lacking.

376
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,000
We searched everywhere,

377
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,470
and reviewed a lot of footage.

378
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,440
But after that,

379
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,080
there were no more leads.

380
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,710
One more thing.

381
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,950
We recently rescued a kidnapped woman.

382
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,769
She was trafficked
from your city, Linshan.

383
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,200
She's being treated in the hospital.

384
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,000
All we know

385
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,222
is her name is Liu Shumei.

386
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,640
We were about to reach out
to confirm her identity.

387
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,240
Then,

388
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,080
you all showed up.

389
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,590
Isn't that Meng Gui's wife?

390
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,910
Officer,

391
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,870
you've asked me so many times.

392
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,040
I swear I've never seen
Madam Hong's face.

393
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:35,390
I don't know where she is either.

394
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,150
Whatever I needed to say,

395
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,040
I've already said it.

396
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,760
We're not here today

397
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,280
to ask about Madam Hong.

398
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,520
We're here to talk about you.

399
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,430
Meng Gui,

400
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,280
how many kids did you abduct?

401
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,870
Just one.

402
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,510
The one at Central Garden Square,

403
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,800
the one my wife took.

404
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,840
Just that one?

405
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,590
What about the child from Watai Village?

406
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:00,830
Wa...

407
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,670
Watai Village?

408
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,350
Look at this photo.

409
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,840
This place.

410
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,720
Looks familiar?

411
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,190
Doesn't this place look familiar to you?

412
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
Weren't you there a year ago?

413
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,320
Did you forget?

414
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,240
I used to

415
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,350
sell contraband cigarettes.

416
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,630
I went there to promote my stock.

417
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,520
Dozens of households,

418
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,800
and you just happened
to sell to that one.

419
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,800
Zhang Xuegui bought
your cigarettes, right?

420
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,390
And you played with their kid.

421
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,630
Maybe...

422
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,760
I think so.

423
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
You think so?

424
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,680
And after that,

425
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,866
Zhang Xuegui went to Binliu
a couple of days later.

426
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:46,480
Then the child went missing.

427
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,560
You were in Binliu at the same time.

428
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:50,670
And after the kid went missing,
you came back.

429
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,760
Isn't that right?

430
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,670
I really don't know.

431
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,040
Man,

432
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,030
I don't know if you're

433
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,280
naive

434
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,520
or just plain dumb.

435
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,960
Don't you realize

436
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,190
what kind of trouble you're in?

437
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,560
Look at this.

(Trafficker Liu Shumei)

439
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,240
(Sold to An Old Bachelor While Fleeing)
This woman was caught

440
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,066
(Found Paralyzed from Beatings)
in Hexi a few days ago.

441
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,270
When she was running away,

442
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,400
another trafficking group abducted her
and sold her off.

443
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,390
She got beaten badly.

444
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:24,670
Luckily, the police got to her in time.

445
00:19:24,688 --> 00:19:26,288
She's still lying in the hospital.

446
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,000
Meng Gui,

447
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,355
we don't want anyone
to end up like this.

448
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,630
We're trying to help you.

449
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,000
If you come clean about

450
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,320
everything you know,

451
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:41,311
we can help reduce your sentence,

452
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:42,977
and get you a lighter punishment.

453
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,644
You're bluffing me, aren't you?

454
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:58,960
You're trying to scare me.

455
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:00,430
That's not my wife.

456
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,390

00:24:28,022 --> 00:24:30,733
Turns out he's also a major target
for our anti-vice task force.

543
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,088
He's no small fry.

544

He's the ringleader
of a prostitution ring.

545
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,533
Has over a hundred people under him.

546

are linked to him.

548
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,720
I've tailed him for a few days,

549
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:41,800
and found one of his bases
in Luojiang County.

550

551
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,630

00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,510

553
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,350
I'll go in.

554
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,430
Okay, Rui.

555
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,390

He didn't mention anything about this.

562
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,040
It's the rule.

563
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:13,533
You'll get it back when you leave.

564
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,760
Get on the bed.

565
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,080
Hurry up.

566
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,520
Don't be scared.

567
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,840
I'm a police officer.

568
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,430
Police?

569
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,000
Keep your voice down.

570
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,110
Whatever I ask,

571
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,155
just answer truthfully.

572
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,840
Okay?

573
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,222
Were you trafficked here?

574
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,110
Yes.

575
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,560
How long have you been here?

576
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,160
Four...

577
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,680
Three...

578
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,590
Three or four months.

579
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:21,720
Are there other girls like you here?

580
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,240
Yes.

581
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,750
There are about

582
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,590
seven...

583
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,720
eight girls.

584
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:30,350
Do you know who trafficked you?

585
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:35,560
How many of them are out there?

586
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,840
I...

587
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,960
The ones I've seen, maybe...

588
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,240
four or five.

589
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Look at these photos.

590
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,910
Were any of them locked up with you?

591
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,480
I've seen her.

592
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,080
She was locked up with me.

593
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,390
You saw her?

594
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,830
Are you okay?

595
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,870
Are you stupid?

596
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,280
Only if you do what they say

597
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,870
will we have a chance to escape.

598
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,590
Didn't I tell you that already?

599
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,800
Can you just listen to me?

600
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,750
Stop fighting back.

601
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,960
Just do what they say.

602
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,622
That's the only way we can get out.

603
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,390
Please cooperate, okay?

604
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,280
What are you doing?

605
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,440
What are you trying to do?

606
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,280
Leave us alone!

607
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:34,830
Go!

608
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,280
What are you people doing?

609
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,480
Weiwei!

610
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,960
Are you usually kept here?

611
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,680
Every time they bring us in,

612
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,080
our eyes are covered.

613
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,760
I don't even know where I am.

614
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,120
Please...

615
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,350
Please save us.

616
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,520
Don't worry.

617
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:17,630
We'll get you out of here soon.

618
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,320
Thank you.

619
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,910
Please save us.

620
00:30:21,088 --> 00:30:22,288
My name is Pingjiao.

621
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,560
How was it, buddy?

622
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,870
Not bad.

623
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,600
You were in there for quite a while.

624
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,950
I'm off.

625
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,760
Take care.

626
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,560
Go.

627
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,630
Hurry.

628
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:42,720
Officer Huang from the
Anti-Vice Task Force

629
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,311
helped us track down Skinner's location.

630
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,800
They've placed surveillance
on several of his hideouts.

631
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,390
Last night I snuck into his base
in Luojiang County.

632
00:31:49,844 --> 00:31:51,910
One of the girls inside said
she saw Zheng Weiwei.

633
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,280
Jiajia,

634
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:55,960
how's the sub-bureau prep coming along?

635
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Seven sub-bureaus are joining
this operation.

636
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,040
Over 600 officers in total.

637
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,910
Let's move.

638
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,080
Arrest Skinner

639
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,466
and rescue those girls.

640
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,350
Mo.

641
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,000
Leave here.

642
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,400
Wait,

643
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,640
Skinner said this chick's not
in good shape.

644
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,733
Told us to leave her alone.

645
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,640
He's not here, so I'm calling the shots.

646
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,480
Get out!

647
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,222
Please don't make this hard for me.

648
00:33:01,244 --> 00:33:03,088
(Luojiang County,
Huayuan Residential Complex)

649
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,080
Open the door!

650
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,000
Open up!

651
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,520
Stop hiding quietly in there.

652
00:33:10,577 --> 00:33:11,830
You built this illegal structure

653
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,190
right outside our back window!

654
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,720
Who is it?

655
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,560
Why are you yelling?

656
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:18,830
Don't move!

657
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,670
Hurry! Upstairs!

658
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,150
Move!

659
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,470
Freeze!

660
00:33:28,488 --> 00:33:29,239
Hands on your head!

661
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,950
Stay still!

662
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,960
Crouch down!

663
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,520
Come here!

664
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,550
Everyone crouches down!

665
00:33:33,755 --> 00:33:34,350
Where are they?

666
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,120
Chief, over here.

667
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,060
The henchmen are secured

668
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:36,844
on the first floor.

669
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,440
Director, the girls are upstairs.

670
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,280
Got it.

671
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,350
Everyone, look up.

672
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,520
Please stand up.

673
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,390
What's your name?

674
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,309
Not the girl I saw last time.

675
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,240
Okay, sit down.

676
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,520
Hi, please stand up.

677
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,630
What's your name?

678
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,110
Please sit.

679
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:09,955
Where are the other girls?

680
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,550
I don't know.

681
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,280
I'm new here.

682
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,480
Look up and face me.

683
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,444
Where's the girl
you brought me last time?

684
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,630
I really don't know.

685
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,400
I'm giving you a chance.

686
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:21,790
Think carefully before answering.

687
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:23,044
Where are the remaining girls?

688
00:34:23,088 --> 00:34:25,222
One was taken to the city yesterday
for the boss.

689
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:26,444
The other wouldn't take clients.

690
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:28,020
The boss said he'd find
another use for her.

691
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:29,240
She was sent away this afternoon.

692
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:30,200
Where did they take her?

693
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,040
I really don't know.
Ask him, he's my boss.

694
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,120
Hey, babe.

695
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,360
How are you doing?

696
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,920
That wound...

697
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,080
It breaks my heart to see it.

698
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,444
If only you'd behave yourself...

699
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,350
Come.

700
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,560
Let me teach you.

701
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,870
You dare bite me?

702
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,577
You sure this is the place?

703
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,910
I'm sure.

704
00:35:37,311 --> 00:35:38,320
That's the room.

705
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,430
Move in immediately.

706
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,100
(Police)

707
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,360
Report, Chief.

708
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,560
No sign of anything unusual.

709
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:12,466
Have them get in the car.

710
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,030
No one inside.

711
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,710
Didn't you say this was the place?

712
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,030
Chang Rui.

713
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,880
Are you messing with me?

714
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,720
Rui.

715
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,310
Where is Skinner?

716
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,350
Chang Rui!

717
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,310
You're pretty clever.

718
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,960
We've all been running in circles
around you.

719
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,840
That thin,

720
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,880
dark-skinned guy just now,

721
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,440
he was about to confess.

722
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,310
Do you know why?

723
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:09,000
Because he can reduce his sentence.

724
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,630
For criminals like you,

725
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,440
who are tough to crack,

726
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,550
if your accomplice gives up useful info

727
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,480
to convict you,

728
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,200
he gets credit and a lighter sentence.

729
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,550
Do you get it now?

730
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,560
What our director means is

731
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,480
that if all of you cooperate,

732
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,888
no one's getting much of a break.

733
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,520
But if you alone refuse to cooperate,

734
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,790
your accomplices get off much lighter.

735
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,590
In fact,

736
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,333
they should be thanking you.

737
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,560
Ready to talk yet?

738
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,110
By the looks of it,

739
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,960
you don't have much time left.

740
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:50,000
Speak now if you're going to talk.

741
00:37:56,044 --> 00:37:57,070
No need to press him.

742
00:37:57,755 --> 00:37:58,977
The others spilled everything.

743
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,160
Take him back.

744
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,550
Wait...

745
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,510
Wait, Officer.

746
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,800
I'll talk.

747
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:12,200
How dare you bite me?

748
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,430
What's going on?

749
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,390
What the hell?

750
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,790
Didn't I tell you not to touch her?

751
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:19,220
They're cracking down hard right now,

752
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,488
and you keep stirring things up.

753
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,280
I didn't touch her.

754
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,520
She's nuts! She bit me!

755
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,550
Is she okay?

756
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,577
She's fine.

757
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,670
Was I talking to you?

758
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,710
Did I ask you?

759
00:38:49,755 --> 00:38:52,066
With a beating like that,
how's she supposed to work?

760
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,550
Make a call.

761
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,550
Order a fresh one.

762
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,377
The client's impatient.

763
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,600
Take care of it.

764
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,910
Guys!

765
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,870
Guys?

766
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:51,977
What's the situation?

767
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,360
Director,

768
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:52,880
no one here.

769
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,840
Search inside.

770
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,070
Any leads?

771
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,720
What did you find?

772
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,680
Nothing yet.

773
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,600
Move aside.

774
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,430
Hold this.

775
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,470
It's Zheng Weiwei.

776
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
She's still breathing.

777
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,170
Get her to the hospital.

778
00:40:59,177 --> 00:40:59,870
Got it.

779
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,160
Copy that.

780
00:41:11,355 --> 00:41:12,600
Is this Zheng Weiwei?

781
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,550
Yes.

782
00:41:13,622 --> 00:41:14,750
They left her in the freezer.

783
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,288
Probably thought she was dead.

784
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,160
What about Skinner?

785
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,120
Still no sign of him.

786
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,670
Hurry to the hospital.

787
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,110
To the ER.

788
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:22,910
Yes, Sir.

789
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,440
Hurry!

790
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,280
Quick!

791
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:40,180
(Emergency Treatment in Progress)

792
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,100
(Nanjie Provincial People's Hospital)

793
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:55,480
Who's the patient's family?

794
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,320
Please pay the fee.

795
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,470
I'll do it.

796
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,430
Come with me.

797
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,620
(Emergency Treatment in Progress)

798
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,630
(Emergency Room)

799
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,470
Weiwei.

800
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,840
Weiwei.

801
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,880
Where's the emergency room?

802
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,550
Up ahead.

803
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,110
Weiwei.

804
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:17,880
Over there!

805
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,350
Weiwei!

806
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,320
Weiwei!

807
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,240
Weiwei!

808
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:21,840
Weiwei!

809
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,350
- Parents of Zheng Weiwei.
- Weiwei!

810
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:24,360
Weiwei!

811
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,360
Weiwei, it's Mom.

812
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:26,910
Weiwei!

813
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,510
Excuse me,

814
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,920
what's going on?

815
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,040
The doctors are fighting
to resuscitate her.

816
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,470
Resuscitate?

817
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,470
Yes.

818
00:42:37,244 --> 00:42:37,800
The doctor...

819
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,510
No...

820
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,040
She...

821
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,400
What happened to her?

822
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,640
Ma'am.

823
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:44,511
- Help her sit down.
- Ma'am, please have a seat.

824
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,080
What happened?

825
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,270
Where is she hurt?

826
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,150
Why does she need resuscitation?

827
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,600
(Emergency Room)
She was very weak when we found her.

828
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:53,840
So we brought her to the hospital.

829
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,310
She's still not out of danger.

830
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,310
Danger?

831
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,350
Ma'am.

832
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,590
Weiwei...

833
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,200
Please try to stay calm, ma'am.
