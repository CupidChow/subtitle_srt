3
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,440
I can't believe you.

4
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,740
Why did you lie to me again?

5
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,430
Everyone's home?

6
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,790
Director's here.

7
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,230
Just in time for a meal.

8
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,190
No need to be so formal.

9
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,190
Let me introduce you.

10
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,270
This is Officer Ai

11
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,222
and Officer Yan.

12
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,590
Jing's father.

13
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:08,990
- Hello.
- Hello.

14
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,830
We've found a new lead recently.

15
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,190
These are children's clothes.

16
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,790
Check if any seem familiar.

17
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,422
How about this one?

18
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,590
Do you recognize it?

19
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,150
This one

20
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,150
looks kind of familiar.

21
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,230
Are you sure?

22
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,590
Take a closer look.

23
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,150
Yes, I remember it.

24
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,190
I bought this in town.

25
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,990
Honey.

26
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,555
Let's go.

27
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,350
Honey.

28
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,710
Honey.

29
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,990
Look, the shirt in the photo.

30
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,670
Do you remember it?

31
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,990
We three went to the market

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,577
and bought it there.

33
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,577
Think about it.

34
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,870
Who said it?

35
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,020
I sewed this on myself.

36
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,310
You don't remember?

37
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,350
You even said it looked ugly back then.

38
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,950
But Jing liked it.

39
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,644
She even refused to take it off
when going to bed.

40
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,070
Right, Jing?

41
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,770
You don't remember?

42
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,550
You even slept in it.

43
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,670
Mom sewed it with love.

44
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,630
How could I forget?

45
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,110
I remember it now.

46
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,430
It was in 1997.

47
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,670
The return of Hong Kong, China.

48
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,430
The whole country was celebrating.

49
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,000
Our family wanted to celebrate too,

50
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,990
so we went

51
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,330
to the town market.

52
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:21,760
See?

53
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:23,310
We made some progress today.

54
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,510
Let's head back

55
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,130
and report this to Director Deng.

57

Xiaoxing?

59
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,590
Didn't Director Deng and the others say

60
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,700
they'll notify you
once they have something?

61
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,270
Waiting at home
is the same as waiting here.

62
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,870
I can't sit still anywhere.

63
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,390
It's been 11 years.

64
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,230
For the first time,

65
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,930
I feel Xiaoguang is close.

66
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,160
Only here

67
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,830
can I feel at peace.

Someone new?

70
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,470
If you're still
asking about my hometown,

71
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,150
I really have nothing more to say.

72
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,570
These were found in your old home.

73
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,950
You said you only took three kids.

74
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,000
Then what about these?

75
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,390
I bought them.

76
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,150
I like kids' clothes.

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,230
What's wrong with that?

78
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,177
Where did you buy them?

79
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:58,990
How much?

80
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,710
It's been so long. Who would remember?

81
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,590
We verified

82
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,190
the kitten on this shirt.

83
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,590
It was hand-stitched
by the child's mother.

84
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,430
I found it.

85
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,630
Is that a crime too?

86
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,030
Hong Jinfeng.

87
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,110
Whether you admit it or not,

88
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,430
these are clothes from abducted kids.

89
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,070
They're evidence of your crime.

90
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,150
I didn't abduct them.

91
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,790
I was saving them.

92
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,350
The parents of the boy from Pingli Town

93
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,590
were busy eating breakfast themselves.

94
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,430
They left him

95
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,710
playing by the roadside alone.

96
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,430
He nearly fell into a ditch.

97
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,030
I saved him.

98
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,910
And that little girl.

99
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,510
I gave her some candy,

100
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,190
and she left with me.

101
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,750
She looked like

102
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,510
she couldn't even afford candy.

103
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,230
I sent her to a wealthy family

104
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,430
in the provincial capital.

105
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,870
She got to live in a huge villa.

106
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,910
Tell me. Could her parents

107
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,670
give her that?

108
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,270
So you're saying
you're doing a good deed

109
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,622
by helping them and saving them.

110
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:24,355
Aren't I?

111
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,790
They're doing great.

112
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,350
They're happy.

113
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,310
We found more stuff in your old home.

114
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,910
Where did you find that?

115
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,950
That's mine.

116
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,990
You can't touch it.

117
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,910
Where did all this come from?

118
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,390
I earned it.

119
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,470
I worked hard for it.

120
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,870
That's my hard-earned money.

121
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,290
How is that hard-earned money?

122
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,430
It's dirty money you made
from abducting kids.

123
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,790
- What do you mean?
- I'm telling you.

124
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,030
You're not getting a single cent.

125
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,590
Those parents

126
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,630
gave it to me to thank me.

127
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,070
I was helping them.

128
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,830
I helped those parents.

129
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,590
Those parents needed kids.

130
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,270
I helped those kids too.

131
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,870
I gave them a better life.

132
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,470
How is that dirty money?

133
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,310

We've mentioned so many kids,

136
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,870
yet you showed no reaction.

137
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,550
But you panic at the mention of money.

138
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,230
That's my money!

Money's all you care about?

141
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,910
Let me tell you.

142
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,430
If you won't confess,

143
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,910
you'll lose more than just money.

144
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,310
Don't take my money.

145
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,590
Don't take my money!

146

Don't take my money...

I...

155
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,550
I'll confess.

156
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,270
I'll come clean.

157
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,550
Let's start with the lawyer's son.

158
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,190

159
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,950
He kept crying.

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,310
(Linshan City Police Bureau)
No matter what I do, it didn't work.

161
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,750
I was afraid someone might discover,

162
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,540
so I buried him.

163
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,430

164
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,666
and let Lawyer Sun go there?

165
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,270
We never expected that.

166
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,030
He was staking out downstairs,

167
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,150
watching our cars.

168
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,910

do you believe it's Sun Xiaoguang?

I hope not,

172
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,350
but the info matches.

173

If that's the case,

174
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,070
he's really unlucky.

175
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,750
It was his only hope.

176
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,590

177

only to get this result.

178
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,510
Will he break down?

than wait forever.

What's come over you, Lawyer Sun?

192
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,750
What are you doing?

193
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,190
Lawyer Sun.

194
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,550
What's come over you?

195
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,670
Say something.

196
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,110
Lawyer Sun.

197
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,210
You...

198
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,360
What happened?

199
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,350
What's going on? What happened?

200
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,950
Lawyer Sun.

201
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,710
I'm fine.

202
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,790
Madam Zhang.

203
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,440
No...

204
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,150
You don't look fine at all.

205
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,990
Xiaoxing.

206
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,820
This is

207
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,030
your brother Luo Xiaoyu's

information

209
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,290
and leads I found earlier.

210
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:12,370
I've asked Bring Lost Children Home

211
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,470
to keep looking for him.

212
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,350
Take it.

213
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,710
Take it.

214
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,590
No.

215
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,710
What's wrong with you?

216
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,710
I'm sorry, Xiaoxing.

217
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,510
I have to go.

218
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,890
Go?

219
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,890
Where are you going?

220
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,110
Are you leaving for work or...

221
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,950
Lawyer Sun.

222
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,610
Madam Zhang.

223
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,390
Take care.

224
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,980
Lawyer Sun.

225
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,510
Something's wrong.

226
00:13:59,070 --> 00:13:59,990
Just tell us.

227
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,550
What's going on?

228
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,430
You're worrying us.

229
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,030
Yeah, just tell us.

230
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,910
Xiaoguang...

231
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,310
might be gone.

232
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,170
What do you mean?

233
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,870
He's dead?

234
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,480
Lawyer Sun!

235
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,260
Lawyer Sun!

00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:36,540
(Tuanyuan Restaurant,
Help Find My Daughter)

237
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,740
Is my Xiaoyu

238
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,600
also dead?

239
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,230
No.

240
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,220
Xiaoxing, no.

241
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,470
- I'm scared.
- We'll find Xiaoyu.

242
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,333
Don't be scared.

243
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,070
Don't be scared.

244
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,870
I promised my mom...

245
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,670
Don't be afraid.

246
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,350
We must stay hopeful.

247
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,230
Stay hopeful.

248
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:39,940
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

249
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,622
Director, you're still here.

250
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,110
Hong Jinfeng gave us some leads.

251
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,590
I need to sort them out right away.

252
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,030
Why are you still here?

253
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,950
You didn't eat with them?

254
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,880
We have already finished.

255
00:16:08,044 --> 00:16:09,550
Mr. Yin told me to bring you supper.

256
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,550
I left it outside.

257
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,590
Eat if you're hungry.

258
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,777
I didn't realize it was this late.

259
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,390
You should take a break.

260
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,350
You've caught experienced traffickers

261
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,590
like Madam Hong and Huang Chuan.

262
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,500
You don't need

263
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,750
to prove yourself this hard.

264
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,190
If you burn out, it's all pointless.

265
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,270
So you think

266
00:16:34,622 --> 00:16:35,977
I'm doing this to prove myself.

267
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,710
Let me tell you a case.

268
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:43,720
Back in 1986,

269
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,470
an abduction case happened

270
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,430
near Linshan's Wenchang Street.

271
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,470
1986, Wenchang Street?

272
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,430
You mean the case

273
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,830
with Tuanyuan Restaurant's
owner's daughter?

274
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,711
I heard former director
mention it before.

275
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:57,870
A crippled man

276
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,377
took the girl away.

277
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,510
There was a witness,

278
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,310
but she was terrified.

279
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,940
She just kept saying "Cripple".

280
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,550
All she knew was

281
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,750
he was crippled,

282
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,390
so it became a cold case.

283
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,030
Yes.

284
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,590
What if I said

285
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,110
I was that witness?

286
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,950
I was the one

287
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,190
who saw my friend

288
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,990
get taken away.

289
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,630
I was frozen in fear and helpless.

290
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,470
Would you still think

291
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,710
I was born for the job

292
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,890
to fight trafficking?

293
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,510
No way.

294
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,830
I have no reason to lie about this.

295
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,030
Ask former director.

296
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,390
He'll tell you if it's true.

297
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,680
You're not joking?

298
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,390
It

299
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,230
was Thursday, October 2, 1986,

300
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,030
around 4 PM.

301
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,110
Like usual,

302
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,270
we were playing outside.

303
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:58,444
We were both in 2nd grade

304
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,150
at Linnan Primary School
on Songtao Road.

305
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,910
Ranran, stop hiding!

306
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,630
Come out!

307
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,910
Ranran!

308
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,622
Her name was Lin Ran.

309
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,060
My best friend.

310
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,550
You couldn't find me.

311
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,910
You hid really well.

312
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,830
Back then,

313
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,190
school ended at 3.30 PM.

314
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,110
We played a bit.

315
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,430
She was heading home,

316
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,410
but I wanted her to stay longer.

317
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,310
So...

318
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,270
I did something I regret deeply.

319
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,750
I made her stay and play with me.

320
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,170
Play with me a little longer?

321
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,070
It's my birthday today.

322
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,190
It's your birthday?

323
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,430
Happy birthday!

324
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,260
She wanted to buy me a gift.

325
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,940
(Little Sun Grocery Store)

326
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,310
So we went there together.

327
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,150
But

328
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,310
we didn't bring enough money.

329
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,710
Here.

330
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,390
It went up by a yuan this year.

331
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,350
It's six yuan minimum.

332
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,290
It's your birthday today.

333
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,630
How could I let you get the money?

334
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,350
I'll go get it.

335
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,150
You're the best.

336
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,360
Wait for me, okay?

337
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,710
Yanyan, wait for me!

338
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,630
Okay!

339
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,390
Just like that, she left my sight.

340
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,870
I remember clearly.

341
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,200
After Lin Ran left,

342
00:19:11,222 --> 00:19:12,911
the shopkeeper said
only two sentences.

343
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:13,533
Little girl.

344
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,040
You really like this music box?

345
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,355
That was the first sentence.

346
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,510
The second sentence was...

347
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,750
"It's getting late."

348
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,910
"Why not take it home first?"

349
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,510
"Pay me another day."

350
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,590
It's getting late.

351
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,710
Why not take it home first?

352
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,030
Pay me another day.

353
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,480
Those two lines
only took about five seconds.

354
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,750
And then,

355
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,750
I saw

356
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,790
the most terrifying thing in my life.

357
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,110
Ranran!

358
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,670
The alley isn't long.

359
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,070
Only about 60 meters.

360
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,670
Ranran!

361
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,200
An eight-year-old running to the end

362
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,222
would take over seconds.

363
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:50,990
Ranran!

364
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,430
Ranran!

365
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,350
In just ten seconds,

366
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,100
they vanished.

367
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,390
Ranran!

368
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,550
Ranran!

369
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,310
This whole thing

370
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,920
could've been avoided.

371
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,430
Because

372
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,750
my birthday isn't October 2nd.

373
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,750
It's October 4th, two days later.

374
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,310
I said that to make her

375
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,510
play with me longer.

376
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,790
If I hadn't lied to her,

377
00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:26,950
she wouldn't have met that trafficker.
Yanyan!

378
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,070
Yanyan!

379
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,180
No matter what, I caused this.

380
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,090
I ruined Madam Zhang's family.

381
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,070
So I keep thinking

382
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:05,270
none of this would've happened

383
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,270
if I didn't exist.

384
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,750
She could've gone to school,

385
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:09,870
found a job,

386
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,390
chased her dreams,

387
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,466
and lived the life she wanted like me.

388
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,430
But now,

389
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,860
I don't even know
if she's alive or dead.

390
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:22,110
(To Lin Ran)
(Ever since that day,)

391
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,430
(I've always written her letters.)

392
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,750
(I pretended she just went far away.)

393
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,110
(I wrote for over 20 years.)

394
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,270
(Later, Madam Zhang took over)

395
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,120
(the noodle restaurant
we used to go to.)

396
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:36,311
(She was afraid
Lin Ran wouldn't find her way home.)

397
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,670
(Former director told me
the tech department long ago created)

398
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,022
(a simulation of what
Lin Ran would look like as an adult.)

399
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:49,933
(Missing Person)
(But Madam Zhang)

400
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,650
(insisted on using
her eight-year-old photo)

401
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,111
(on the missing person posters.)

402
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,570
(I know)

403
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,360
(she's never been able to move on.)

404
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,870
(Neither have I.)

405
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,260
(In the 90s, Zhao Bingli was seen
near Little Sun Stationery Store.)

406
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,100
(In 2004,
a trafficker was linked to Zhao Bingli.)

407
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,900
(Name: Lin Ran)

408
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,910
(To find Lin Ran,)

409
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,444
(I entered the police academy.)

410
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,790
(I repeatedly applied to my superiors)

411
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:14,444
(to join the Anti-abduction Office.)

412
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,910
(I gave everything I had)

413
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,955
(and caught many people.)

414
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,480
(I saw through the hypocrisy,)

415
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,630
(indifference, lies, and madness,)

416
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,070
(but I still couldn't find Lin Ran.)

417
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,070
(Nanjie Province, Linshan City Map)
(But I know)

418
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,230
(it's all worth it.)

419
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,710
(Those smiles of reunion)

420
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,750
(keep me going,)

421
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,710
(pushing me forward)

422
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,590
(to help the ones suffering)

423
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,070
(Missing Person)
(reclaim their stolen lives)

424
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,070
(so that they can grow up safely,)

425
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,430
(study, fall in love, and grow old.)

426
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,070
(Just like Lin Ran should have.)

427
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,300
(Name: Lin Ran)

428
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,640
(So)

429
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,910
(if I used to only
want to find Lin Ran,)

430
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,830
(now I want to find everyone.)

431
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,070
Maybe that's why I keep investigating.

432
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:46,580
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

433
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:49,266
The test report for that child
in Yalu Village is out.

434
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,244
He's not Lawyer Sun's son,
Sun Xiaoguang.

435
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,590
The child's mother

436
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,444
is the editor-in-chief
of a local magazine.

437
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,740
Her name is Qiao Suhan.

438
00:23:57,222 --> 00:23:58,470
Her husband's surname is Chen.

439
00:23:58,888 --> 00:23:59,870
He was also a lawyer.

440
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:01,644
After their child went missing,

441
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,470
Lawyer Chen took his own life.

442
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,350
Notify the family.

443
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:16,244
What's wrong?

444
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,550
How do we tell them?

445
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,350
They searched for their child for years.

446
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,270
We finally found him,

447
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,590
only for us to say...

448
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,750
"Please claim the body at the station."

449
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,830
I can't say it.

450
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,820
(DNA Test Report)

451
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,430
Hello?

452
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,550
Is this Ms. Qiao Suhan?

453
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,000
This is Linshan City Police Bureau's
Anti-abduction Office.

454
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,110
We've found your son, Qiao Zhe.

455
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,070
But he has passed away.

456
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:34,060
We hope you can make a trip

457
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,110
to the station.

458
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,390
Telling her the truth

459
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,111
is better than letting her wait forever.

460
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:29,380
(Trafficking is cruel, but love exists.
The search for lost children shows it.)

461
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,990
The suspect

462
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,110
has been brought to justice.

463
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,990
The law will give you justice.

464
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,266
Please accept our condolences.

465
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,350
If there's anything you need,

466
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,790
you can tell us.

467
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,550
There's nothing that I need.

468
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,650
Thank you.

469
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,830
Thank you

470
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,170
for finding my child.

471
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,790
All these years,

472
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,030
I kept hoping...

473
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,070
I hoped he'd come home

474
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,230
and call me "Mom" again.

475
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,550
But now...

476
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,110
But now...

477
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,790
But...

478
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,070
It's better this way.

479
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,720
He died shortly

480
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,860
after getting taken away.

481
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,030
I guess

482
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,870
he probably didn't suffer much.

483
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:21,990
Qiao.

484
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,150
Go home with me.

485
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,190
I'll take you home.

486
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:44,860
(Trafficking is cruel, but love exists.
The search for lost children shows it.)

487
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,550
(Many told me)

488
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,620
(anti-trafficking work is hard.)

489
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:02,755
(But no matter how hard,)

490
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,470
(there's still hope)

491
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:06,400
(as long as we don't give up.)

492
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,830
(But what lies at hope's end?)

493
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,220
(What Qiao Suhan suffered)

494
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,680
(is what I feared the most.)

495
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,630

496
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,977
(for anti-trafficking officers.)

497
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,710

498
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,710
(that Lin Ran)

499
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,070
(may never come home.)

500
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,550

501
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,710
(no matter how slim the hope,)

502
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,110
(we must keep searching.)

503
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,420

Hello?

511
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,610
Lawyer Sun, this is Deng Yan.

512
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,340
We ran the DNA test on the child

513
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,888
and found that he's not Sun Xiaoguang.

514
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,350
So please don't worry.

515
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,700
We'll keep investigating.

516
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,580

But if I didn't,

740

wouldn't the child have died?

742
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,870

00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,550
But

751
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,350
this kid is really smart.

752
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,400
He has good grades.

753
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,710
All the award certificates
behind you are his.

754
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:38,030
(Award Certificate)
If his parents take him home,

755
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,470
he won't bring them shame.

756
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,750
I'm just afraid

757
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,530
that his parents might reject Yuan

758
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,070
because I raised him.

759
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,030
You saved him

760
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,870
and raised him into a good kid.

761
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,350
No one will reject him.

762
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,520
And no one will reject you either.
