00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The next one is the most difficult one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's a very difficult one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's a very difficult one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a very difficult one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a very difficult one.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Are you ready?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I am ready.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I am ready.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I am ready.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,180
I'm going to the

Oh IIF

43
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,420
Think the

44
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:40,600
You glanced at the

45
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,560
You bite a

46
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:45,960
This

47
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,520
We have to eat, Mr. Zhang.

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,120
How much is left?

49
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,040
2,000.

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,480
This is 500.

51
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,560
This is 1,500.

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,920
Is it enough?

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,520
Yes.

54
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,040
Okay, Mrs. Zhang.

55
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,280
Next time,

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,960
pay the rent as soon as possible.

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,920
Don't embarrass everyone, right?

58
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,680
Okay.

59
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,320
I'll go now.

60
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,320
Thank you.

61
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,760
Okay.

62
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,680
You can go ahead.

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,520
Okay.

64
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,200
Okay.

65
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,600
Okay, thank you, Xiaoqiang.

66
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,000
Mr. Sun,

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,640
I'm so sorry.

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,160
This...

69
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,040
I'll lend you some.

70
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,720
As long as I can make enough money,

71
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,440
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

72
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,080
No, no, Mrs. Zhang.

73
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,120
I come to this small restaurant often.

74
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,560
If you're embarrassed,

75
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,280
just take it as my rent.

76
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,320
I'll work here.

77
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,520
Work here?

78
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,120
Look,

79
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,320
our small restaurant is so simple.

80
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,360
How can it be matched with your big lawyer?

81
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,680
There are many people here.

82
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,440
It's lively.

83
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,440
By the way, Mrs. Zhang,

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,280
this girl is Luo Xiaoxing.

85
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,360
She came to Lin Shan City to find her brother.

86
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,360
She has been kneeling on the side of the road for days.

87
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,320
She has no food or drink.

88
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,160
Look,

89
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,920
our small restaurant needs help.

90
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,960
Find her a place to sleep.

91
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,120
Mrs. Zhang.

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,800
Xiaoxing.

93
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,680
Hello, Mrs. Zhang.

94
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,200
It's so poor.

95
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,000
Look,

96
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,680
it's not easy for a girl.

97
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,160
How about this?

98
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,720
You stay here.

99
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,320
Look,

100
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,200
you can take these as your family.

101
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,840
Okay?

102
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,320
Xiaoxing, auntie.

103
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:34,920
Get up.

104
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,440
Xiaoxing.

105
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,080
This is my brother Luo Xiaoyu.

106
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
I've been looking for him for 15 years.

107
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,560
I can find him.

108
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,160
I can do anything.

109
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,960
Thank you.

110
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, okay, Xiaoxing.

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,520
Stop talking.

112
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,160
Look,

113
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,760
on this wall,

114
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,720
there are

115
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,840
the same things

116
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,000
you've experienced.

117
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,640
Look.

118
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,320
Look.

119
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,080
Look.

120
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,840
Look.

121
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,520
Look.

122
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,120
Look.

123
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,840
Look.

124
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,560
Look.

125
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,880
The same people have experienced it.

126
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,320
Don't worry.

127
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,120
We will help you.

128
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,600
Song Tishi.

129
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,840
Leave her to me.

130
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,320
Don't worry, okay?

131
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,600
Don't cry.

132
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,120
Come on.

133
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Where is Zhao Dafeng?

134
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,520
What are you doing here?

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,880
Where is he?

136
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,640
I don't know.

137
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,280
I'll lock you up.

138
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,280
Where is Zhao Dafeng?

139
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,800
I don't know.

140
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,880
I really don't know.

141
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
I really don't know.

142
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,800
Where is he?

143
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,840
Zhao Dafeng.

144
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,600
Zhao Dafeng.

145
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,280
He ran away with my money.

146
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,240
He told me he had a problem.

147
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,920
I looked for him.

148
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,960
Now he's gone.

149
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,800
He asked me for money.

150
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,520
What can I give him?

151
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,920
I'm telling you.

152
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,240
I can't find him.

153
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,120
I'm done.

154
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,600
I'm done.

155
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,800
Everyone is done.

156
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,600
Xiaoxing.

157
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,440
Xiaoxing.

158
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,520
I...

159
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
I have a problem.

160
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
I have a problem, Brother Qi.

161
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,120
I have a problem, Brother Qi.

162
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
I really have a problem.

163
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,120
Brother Qi.

164
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Brother Qi.

165
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,320
You're young and beautiful.

166
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,880
You're young and beautiful.

167
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,760
Don't tell me.

168
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,520
I won't.

169
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,960
I'll give you my phone.

170
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,760
Wait for me.

171
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
Wait for me.

172
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Wait for me.

173
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

174
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Hello.

175
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Hello.

176
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Hello.

177
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Hello.

178
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Boss Yin.

179
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Hey, bro.

180
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
What's wrong with you?

181
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Why didn't you send me a message for days?

182
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Don't rush.

183
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
We have goods.

184
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
We have goods.

185
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
We definitely have goods.

186
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
I'm going to pick up the goods now.

187
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
The price is as we agreed.

188
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
OK. OK. OK.

189
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Yeah, I don't make money.

190
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
OK.

191
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
I'll send it to the old place after I get the goods.

192
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
OK. OK.

193
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
We'll contact you again.

194
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Hurry up. Hurry up.

195
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Check where it is.

196
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Move to the south of the city.

197
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
The plane is leaving.

198
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
How much are you going to sell?

199
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Don't ask if you shouldn't ask.

200
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Where are we going?

201
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Are you kidding me?

202
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
No. No.

203
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
We're almost there.

204
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
We're almost there.

205
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
I'm going to the airport.

206
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
I'm going to the airport.

207
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
I'm going to the airport.

208
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
I'm going to the airport.

209
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
I'm going to the airport.

210
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
How long is it?

211
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Brother Rui's car is still running.

212
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
It's five kilometers away from us.

213
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
Don't be tired.

214
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Hurry up under safe conditions.

215
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
OK.

216
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Hurry up.

217
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Are you serious?

218
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Where's the goods?

219
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
What are you doing?

220
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Black!

221
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Stop!

222
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Police!

223
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Catch him.

224
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Where are those girls?

225
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Which girl?

226
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
Look at him.

227
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Look at him.

228
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Brother Xie.

229
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
You... you're kidding me.

230
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Follow him.

231
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Are you sure those girls are here?

232
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
There should be no problem.

233
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Everything is normal from the parking lot to the door.

234
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Then I don't know why he suddenly grabbed my bag.

235
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
I ran outside.

236
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Then you came.

237
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Let's split up.

238
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
OK.

239
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Let's go.

240
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Turn around.

241
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Behave yourself.

242
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
Go away.

244
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Ready to be settled.

245
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
Don't touch me.

246
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Don't touch me.

247
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Help me.

248
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Don't touch me.

249
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,760
Don't touch me.

250
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Don't touch me.

251
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Don't touch me.

252
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
Ready to be settled.

253
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Don't touch me.

254
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Zhou Min.

255
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
This is a doctor's room.

256
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Don't touch me.

257
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Don't touch me.

258
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
Don't cry.

259
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Are you her family?

260
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
No.

261
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
Her family is on the way.

262
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Don't touch me.

263
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
I'll treat her right away.

264
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
Mark, take a look.

265
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
I know she's scared now.

266
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
Zhou Min.

267
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
Zhou Min.

268
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
This is a doctor.

269
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Don't hurt her.

270
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
She's in the hospital now.

271
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
OK?

272
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
It hurts.

273
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
Let me go.

274
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Let me go.

275
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
I'll get a doctor to do a check-up for you.

276
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
OK?

277
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Don't hurt her.

278
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Don't hurt her.

279
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
Let me go.

280
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Help me.

281
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Let me go.

282
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Be gentle.

283
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
She's hurt.

284
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
Be gentle.

285
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
I can't see her.

286
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
I need to treat her.

287
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Please leave right away.

288
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
OK.

289
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Please leave right away.

290
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
OK.

291
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Please be gentle.

292
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
She's hurt.

293
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Don't touch me.

294
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
Don't touch me.

295
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
Don't touch me.

296
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
I'm sorry.

297
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
I'm sorry.

298
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
I'm sorry.

299
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,760
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
I'm sorry.

301
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Director.

302
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Why don't you go back first?

303
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
I'll just stay here and watch.

304
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
OK.

305
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Call me when she wakes up.

306
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Don't worry.

307
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
How is she?

308
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
She's still unconscious.

309
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
She's still unconscious.

310
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Did the doctor say when she'll wake up?

311
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
He didn't give us the exact time.

312
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
So let's go back and check on Baibai.

313
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
If we don't ask her anything,

314
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
Baibai is a old man.

315
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
He won't say anything.

316
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
We haven't found Zheng Weiwen yet.

317
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
If we delay for one more minute, it'll be more dangerous.

318
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
What are you asking now?

319
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
She's still in a coma.

320
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
Besides, she can't stand the stimulation.

321
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Instead of stimulating her,

322
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
we should go back and stimulate Baibai.

323
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
OK.

324
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Zhou Min.

325
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
You took her away a month ago.

326
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
She's hiding in the corner of the house.

327
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
You took us there.

328
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
She's my girlfriend.

329
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Girlfriend?

330
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,760
Girlfriend?

331
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
In the wall.

332
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Have you ever been in a relationship?

333
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,760
You should be playing with her.

334
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,760
If she does something wrong, you should punish her.

335
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
Stop it.

336
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Why did you take Brother Xie with you?

337
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
You asked a good question.

338
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Ask him.

339
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Did you just become a cop?

340
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Stop it.

341
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,760
We've got your criminal evidence.

342
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,760
If you tell the other suspects now,

343
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
you can also get a chance to make a contribution.

344
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Why don't you catch her and put her in my place?

345
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
You're illegal, you're a criminal.

346
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Zhou Min, what other evidence do you have?

347
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Bai Wentao.

348
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
You can't rely on him.

349
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Brother Xie.

350
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
What's your real name?

351
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
What does it have to do with you?

352
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Now...

353
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Baibai.

354
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
We're not kids anymore.

355
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
It's not easy to get out.

356
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,760
You'll have the evidence.

357
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Zhou Min is in the hospital.

358
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
She'll come to you as soon as she wakes up.

359
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
You can't escape.

360
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
I can't.

361
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Do you know what I was doing?

362
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
No.

363
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
I'm a chicken pox.

364
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
I'm handling big cases.

365
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,760
The public security department is handling big cases.

366
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,760
I'm facing a real life-threatening case.

367
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
You're just a bunch of blind soldiers.

368
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
A bunch of blind soldiers?

369
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
That's right.

370
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
Let's not waste time.

371
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
There must be evidence.

372
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Just say what you have.

373
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
You have to admit that you're a man.

374
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
So I asked you,

375
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,760
who else did it with you?

376
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
Did you kidnap anyone else?

377
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
No.

378
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Do you know this person?

379
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
Baibai, my daughter.

380
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Your biological daughter?

381
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
My biological daughter.

382
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Don't lie to me.

383
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I'm not lying.

384
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Your father will know about this in one glance.

385
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,760
She...

386
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,760
She's my adopted daughter.

387
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Adopted daughter?

388
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
Do you have any documents?

389
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,760
No.

390
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
You don't know.

391
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
We don't have...

392
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Some people here don't want to have a daughter.

393
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
They just leave her on the side of the road.

394
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
I happened to pass by and picked her up.

395
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
I thought she was very cute.

396
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
So I adopted her.

397
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Of course, I know that.

398
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Adoption of a child...

399
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
You have to get married.

400
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
You have to have a good financial foundation.

401
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
I...

402
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
I can't.

403
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
So we have to have a procedure.

404
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
I adopted her.

405
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
But she's just like my biological daughter.

406
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
Continue.

407
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
I didn't.

408
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Continue.

409
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
I really didn't.

410
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Where?

411
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
When?

412
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
In my hometown.

413
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
The time is...

414
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
2002.

415
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
Winter.

416
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
November.

417
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
Bai Wenqiang.

418
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
You're lying.

419
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Do you believe it?

420
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
I'm not lying.

421
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
This girl is called Qiu Luo.

422
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Not Fangfang.

423
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
You brought her here.

424
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Qiu Luo?

425
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
And I'm Ting?

426
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
So I'll give you one last chance.

427
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Who else have you brought here?

428
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Just one.

429
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
Since she was born,

430
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
I've been with Cai.

431
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
I can't bear to see her cry and touch her.

432
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
We've been good friends.

433
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,760
But she's only been with me for a week.

434
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
How could this happen?

435
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
How can you say that?

436
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Yeah, you're right.

437
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,760
You're so mean.

438
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,760
Besides, this is an accident.

439
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,760
My brother-in-law might have met someone on the ground.

440
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
It's not right to do this.

441
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
It's not right to do this.

442
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
You can't just ignore a man.

443
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Who doesn't want to see a child?

444
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
A child is like this.

445
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
You don't want to see a child?

446
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
Your son is a bad son.

447
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,760
You don't want to see a child?

448
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
You don't want to see a child?

449
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
You don't want to see a child?

450
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Wait, wait, wait.

451
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
I'll go if you don't.

452
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Look at you.

453
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
Get rid of her anger.

454
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,760
We're still the same.

455
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
You're still mad at me.

456
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
What are you doing to her?

457
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
What are you doing to her?

458
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Okay, okay.

459
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
What's the use of arguing?

460
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Why don't you think of a way to get the child back?

461
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
I'm sorry.

462
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm sorry.

463
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
I'm sorry.

464
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
I'm sorry.

465
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
I'm sorry.

466
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
I'm sorry.

467
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
I'm sorry.

468
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
I'm sorry.

469
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
I'm sorry.

470
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
I'm sorry.

471
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
I'm sorry.

472
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
I'm sorry.

473
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
I'm sorry.

474
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
I'm sorry.

475
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
I'm sorry.

476
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
I'm sorry.

477
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
I'm sorry.

478
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
I'm sorry.

479
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
I'm sorry.

480
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
I'm sorry.

481
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
I'm sorry.

482
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
I'm sorry.

483
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
I'm sorry.

484
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
I'm sorry.

485
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
I'm sorry.

486
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
I'm sorry.

487
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
I'm sorry.

488
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
I'm sorry.

489
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
I'm sorry.

490
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
I'm sorry.

491
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
I'm sorry.

492
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
I'm sorry.

493
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
I'm sorry.

494
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
I'm sorry.

495
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
I'm sorry.

496
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
I'm sorry.

497
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
I'm sorry.

498
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
I'm sorry.

499
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
I'm sorry.

500
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
I'm sorry.

501
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
I'm sorry.

502
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
I'm sorry.

503
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
I'm sorry.

504
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
I'm sorry.

505
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,760
I'm sorry.

506
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
I'm sorry.

507
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
I'm sorry.

508
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm sorry.

509
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
I'm sorry.

510
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
I'm sorry.

511
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
I'm sorry.

512
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
I'm sorry.

513
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
I'm sorry.

514
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,760
I'm sorry.

515
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
I'm sorry.

516
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
I'm sorry..

517
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
I'm sorry.

518
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
I'm sorry.

519
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,760
I'm sure this whiteboard is a small head in their group fire

520
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,760
It's a good chance to get in with Zhao Liang and Hu Xifan

521
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
I guess it's all connected in advance

522
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,760
But we don't have any evidence at all

523
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Yes, Zhou Min

524
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,760
Zhou Min's current state is not suitable for providing any information for us

525
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
Wafa is too young

526
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
What he said can't be a testimony

527
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Then you can only grind it with the whiteboard

528
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
I don't have time to grind with him

529
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Now only Zhou Min is found

530
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
What about Zheng Weiwei and Xiao Yangyu?

531
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
How can I grind without a single week?

532
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
You ask me

533
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
How do I know? I'm not the master

534
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
Hello, Xiao Yangyu has a message

535
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Hello

536
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
OK, I'll be there right away

537
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Director Zhang

538
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Take a nap

539
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
I can't sleep

540
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,760
In our industry, we have to do the same as Xiao Lu

541
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,760
The wind is blowing, you can rest

542
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
I'll sleep in peace when I find the baby

543
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Master, do you think it's not a big hope to find this child?

544
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,760
I just don't dare to be too happy

545
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
Old Hu

546
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Director Li

547
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
This is our Director Deng

548
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Hello

549
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Hello

550
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
Old Hu from Nanyang branch

551
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Is this beautiful woman

552
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
Director Li

553
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
The child I bought you on the phone

554
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
Is in the village of Yangyong

555
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
You check

556
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Is it the little girl you are looking for?

557
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
This Nanyang village

558
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
In the 90s, it was a famous auction village

559
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,760
The people in the village are surprised

560
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
Be careful

561
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Let's go, take us to see

562
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
This is it

563
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Yangyong, are you home? Open the door

564
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Yangyong

565
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Who?

566
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,760
What are you knocking at noon?

567
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Is it a funeral?

568
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
Director is here

569
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
Officer Hu is here too

570
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Director, I didn't do anything

571
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,760
Why did you bring the police?

572
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
It's like this

573
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Now, the city and the district lines

574
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
Are doing martial arts education

575
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
We are here to check

576
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
Martial arts

577
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Open the door

578
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
Come in and sit

579
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Come in and sit

580
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Don't take it, don't take it

581
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Hurry up, go, go, go

582
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
No milk

583
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
How many rooms do you have?

584
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Just a few

585
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
How old is your child?

586
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
I have no children

587
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
You have no children

588
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
Then these milk powder

589
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,760
And these children's toys

590
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,760
Are all for you

591
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Not for me

592
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
This

593
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
I have been married to my wife for several years

594
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
I thought

595
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
I couldn't have children all the time

596
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
I just wanted to take these things

597
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
I would look for them

598
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
What if I get pregnant?

599
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
If you really have a problem

600
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
You should go see a doctor

601
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
I'm listening to others

602
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
Comrade, sit down

603
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
I'll talk to you

604
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
It's okay, it's okay

605
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,760
What is your village's martial arts education?

606
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
All have

607
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
Comrade, what are you looking for?

608
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
I'm looking for the bathroom

609
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
There is no bathroom

610
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Okay, then you go out and see

611
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
There is no bathroom here

612
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,760
The bathroom is far away

613
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Okay, I can find it

614
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Do you know the rules of the 240th and 241st criminal law?

615
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
I don't know

616
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Come, let me tell you

617
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,760
The 240th criminal law of the Republic of China

618
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
For children who sell their parents

619
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
They are sentenced to five years or more

620
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Ten years of imprisonment and punishment

621
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
The criminal is severely sentenced to death

622
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,760
And confiscated property

623
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
You don't sell your children

624
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
Where did you buy this child?

625
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Do you know?

626
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
Buying children is also illegal

627
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
I don't know

628
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
I don't know

629
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
I don't know

630
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
I don't know

631
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
I don't know

632
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
I don't know

633
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
I don't know

634
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
I don't know

635
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
I don't know

636
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
I don't know

637
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
I don't know

638
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
I don't know

639
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
I don't know

640
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
I don't know

641
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
I don't know

642
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
I don't know

643
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
I don't know

644
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
I don't know

645
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
I don't know

646
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
I don't know

647
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
I don't know

648
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
I don't know

649
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
I don't know

650
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
I don't know

651
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
I don't know

652
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
I don't know

653
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
I don't know

654
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
I don't know

655
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
I don't know

656
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
I don't know

657
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
I don't know

658
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
Take out

659
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Take out

660
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Aunt Lin

661
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Yanyan

662
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Xiaoyang, do you have any news?

663
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
It's like this. We are now...

664
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Auntie Lin, we haven't heard from you yet.

665
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,760
We have news. I'll inform you as soon as possible.

666
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
I'm busy now.

667
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
I know.

668
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
If you have news, tell me.

669
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Okay.

670
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
I'll tell you.

671
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,760
Master, why didn't you tell Auntie Lin?

672
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,760
I'll tell her when the result is out.

673
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Okay.

674
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,760
You said you didn't know the person who sold your child.

675
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
Do you know what he looks like?

676
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,760
I really don't know.

677
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
The police are so strict now.

678
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
I can't see anyone.

679
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,760
You didn't see the criminal. How did you get in touch?

680
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
We...

681
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,760
We... We are going to...

682
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,760
Yes, the east entrance of the village.

683
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,760
It's about a mile away.

684
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,760
There's a row of trees.

685
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,760
There's a bread truck under the tree.

686
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
What about the truck?

687
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
What does the truck look like?

688
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,760
It's just a normal bread truck.

689
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,760
There's no sign.

690
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
It's broken.

691
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,760
It's old. It looks like it's going to be broken.

692
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,760
They put the child in the car and gave it to us.

693
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
The child is pretty good.

694
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,760
Just like the price we talked about before.

695
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,760
They put the money in the car and took the child away.

696
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Did you see anyone get in the bread truck after you took the child away?

697
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,760
We were so upset at the time.

698
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,760
We didn't even look back and didn't notice the car.

699
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,760
I don't even know when the car was driven away.

700
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,760
How did you get in touch with that person?

701
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,760
My wife has a cousin who lives far away.

702
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
He knows we don't have children.

703
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,760
He's doing pretty well in Lingshan.

704
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,760
We asked him to help us get rid of a child.

705
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,760
Then someone called us.

706
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
What about your cousin? What's his name?

707
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
What does he do in Lingshan?

708
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
His name is Han You Gang.

709
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,760
I don't know what he does specifically.

710
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
Tell the kids.

711
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
We got the wrong child.

712
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,760
He had a DNA comparison with his family.

713
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Now the blood of the child is used to make blood tests.

714
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Xiao De, you have to find a child.

715
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Don't be angry.

716
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
I'm not angry.

717
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
It's good to find a child.

718
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,760
But this little boy, he doesn't have any clues.

719
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Xiao De,

720
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,760
this case of the police is not as simple as you think.

721
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,760
You have to be mentally prepared.

722
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,760
Especially those long-term cases.

723
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,760
The evidence chain is broken and the cycle is long.

724
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,760
So every meeting, one child is a victory.

725
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,760
The point is, what should you do next?

726
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,760
You have to think about it.

727
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
Right, Han?

728
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
Don't be angry.

729
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
If you have anything, just call me.

730
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Xiao Ji said, if I don't support you,

731
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
he'll have to take care of me.

732
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,760
Hello, old comrade.

733
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Can we be a little softer?

734
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
We made an appointment today, right?

735
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,760
We agreed to come to eat this meal.

736
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Now in the unit, Da Xiao is also a leader.

737
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
It's right to put the main energy on work.

738
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,760
I went to the police department to get to know about the case.

739
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
It's not easy to do this job.

740
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Yan Yan must be there.

741
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
I just think that

742
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,760
she might be in danger.

743
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,760
You don't understand your own daughter's temper.

744
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
She can listen to you.

745
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Actually, I know why she must go to the police department.

746
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,760
It's all because of Lin Ran.

747
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,760
But that thing can't blame Yan Yan.

748
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
We agreed to go out and play together.

749
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Who would have thought that Lin Ran would be taken away?

750
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
I just think

751
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,760
if Yan Yan can't do what she wants

752
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,760
in this matter,

753
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,760
then...

754
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,760
It seems that she hasn't let go of this matter for so many years.

755
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,760
But she is an adult now.

756
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,760
She has the ability to think independently.

757
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
Let's not worry about her.

758
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Let's eat.

759
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Xiao Guo?

760
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Xiao Guo?

761
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Xiao Guo?

762
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Xiao Guo?

763
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Xiao Guo?

764
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Let go of me.

765
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
Let go of me.

766
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,760
I can't run anymore.

767
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,760
I'm scared.

768
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,760
I'm sorry.

769
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Let's go home.

770
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,760
I'm scared.

771
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,760
I'm scared.

772
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,760
I'm scared.

773
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Xiao Guo?

774
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,760
Let's go home.

775
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,760
What are you doing? Let go of my child.

776
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,760
What are you doing? Let go of my child.

777
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,760
What are you doing?

778
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
What are you doing?

779
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Xiao Guo Guo, you're wrong.

780
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
I'm sorry. You're wrong.

781
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
I'm wrong? Who are you lying to?

782
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
How can you be wrong?

783
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
You're a criminal.

784
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

785
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,760
You're a criminal. Xiao Fang, don't cry.

786
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,760
I'm sorry. It's my child.

787
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Xiao Fang, don't cry. I'm sorry.

788
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
I'm sorry.

789
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,760
I'm sorry. It's my child.

790
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Is your child okay?

791
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,760
He's fine.

792
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,760
His father took him home.

793
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,760
Let me explain.

794
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
He's a criminal.

795
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,760
His child was kidnapped a few decades ago.

796
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
He's very poor.

797
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,760
I'll take him.

798
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,760
I'm sorry.

799
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,760
I'm sorry.

800
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,760
Forget it.

801
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
I'll go home, too.

802
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Okay, I'm sorry.

803
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Take care.

804
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
Mr. Sun, wake up.

805
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
Wake up.

806
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
I'm looking for my son.

807
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,760
My son's name is...

808
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,760
His name is Sun Xiao Guang.

809
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,760
He was kidnapped when he was two years old.

810
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,760
He was kidnapped in the Jinxiu Yan community of Fushan Academy.

811
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
Drink some water.

812
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
After our examination, we can conclude that

813
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
the patient was not invaded.

814
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
Except for the bruises on his hands and feet,

815
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,760
there are no obvious wounds in other parts.

816
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,760
His condition is good.

817
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,760
But the patient's spirit

818
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,760
is greatly affected.

819
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Plus, the parents' strong demands.

820
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,760
So, he's in the hospital for a few days.

821
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,760
I understand.

822
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,760
So, apart from his spirit,

823
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
he's fine now?

824
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
I found that

825
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,760
the patient's magnetic field is high.

826
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
But it's not a big problem.

827
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Magnetic field?

828
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Take your time.

829
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Be careful. It's hot.

830
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Officer Deng, come in.

831
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,760
Sit down.

832
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,760
It's okay.

833
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
This is for you.

834
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Thank you.

835
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
It's beautiful.

836
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
Officer Deng.

837
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
I'm so happy this time.

838
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Me, too.

839
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Min Min,

840
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
come and see this.

841
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,760
Min Min,

842
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,760
Officer Deng is here to see you.

843
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Call him.

844
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
You should thank him.

845
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Thank you, Officer Deng.

846
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
You're welcome.

847
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,760
It's our duty.

848
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,760
Min Min, come with me.

849
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,760
Okay.

850
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,760
Min Min,

851
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
I'm here today

852
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
to ask you about something.

853
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,760
We suspect that

854
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
a victim is in the criminal's hands.

855
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
Can you ask Min Min to help us?

856
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,760
Officer Deng,

857
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Min Min is better now.

858
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
She can't be stimulated by a single scratch.

859
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,760
Just ask me if you have any questions.

860
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
But we need to

861
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
know the details of the case.

862
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
You caught the criminal, didn't you?

863
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
The criminal who was killed in the funeral.

864
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Can't you ask him directly?

865
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
He's a tough guy.

866
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
If we can get more direct clues

867
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
from the victim,

868
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
maybe we can save them faster.

869
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
He's tough.

870
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
If he's tough,

871
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
can you police do anything?

872
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
You can't beat him,

873
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
scold him,

874
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
or force him to say anything.

875
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Min Min, calm down.

876
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
We can't force him.

877
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Then we deserve to die?

878
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
I didn't mean that.

879
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Look at my poor daughter.

880
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
She's having nightmares every day

881
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
when she closes her eyes.

882
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
She can't even sleep.

883
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,760
I wish I could

884
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760
dig her memory out of her head.

885
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Do you still

886
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
want her to remember it?

887
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Don't you think

888
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
you're too cruel to your daughter?

889
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
I'm sorry.

890
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Honey.

891
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
Look.

892
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
What's wrong?

893
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,760
It's okay.

894
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
Min Min, why are you here?

895
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Did you hear me?

896
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Look, I bought you a cake.

897
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Your favorite, chocolate and cream.

898
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Come on.

899
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Let's cut the cake.

900
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
Come on.

901
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
16 years old.

902
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Let's sing a birthday song.

903
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
Let's sing together.

904
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
Happy birthday to you.

905
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
Happy birthday to you.

906
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Happy birthday to you.

907
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
Happy birthday to you.

908
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
Happy birthday to you.

909
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
I've already paid for it.

910
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
I'm going to buy you a birthday gift.

911
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
You like the white coat the most, right?

912
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Come on, I'll take you to buy it.

913
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Look at my poor daughter.

914
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
She sleeps every day.

915
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
She sleeps in a nightmare when she closes her eyes.

916
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
She can't even sleep with a solid smile.

917
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
I'm going to buy you a cake.

918
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,760
Come on.

919
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
Come on.

920
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
You're a good girl.

921
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
Come on.

922
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Come on.

923
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
Come on.

924
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
Come on.

925
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
Come on.

926
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
Come on.

927
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
Come on.

928
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Come on.

929
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,760
Come on.

930
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Come on.

931
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
She just hid.

932
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
Can Zhong Min come to Wenhua?

933
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Still no.

934
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
How long has it been?

935
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
Let me ask.

936
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
I have my own way.

937
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
No matter who uses what kind of method, his mother doesn't agree.

938
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
It's just not okay.

939
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Besides, even an adult, he met something like this.

940
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
He doesn't want to remember.

941
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
What kind of method did he use?

942
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
In my opinion,

943
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
he should start from the white-and-white set.

944
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
After all,

945
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
one person has a lot of lies.

946
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
It's impossible not to record the truth.

947
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
It's hard to say, naturally.

948
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
Yeah. But the problem is that he doesn't say anything.

949
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
White-and-white can't ask.

950
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Zhong Min can't ask.

951
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
What we did is all white-and-white.

952
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Maybe

953
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,720
What a breakthrough!

954
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,360
We've cybotenone

955
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,160
We've cybotenone

956
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
of you.

957
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,320
The pill

958
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,320
accounts for!)

959
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:12,800
cytonagn used

960
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,480
with lack of 161, and

961
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,360
the effect

962
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,200
can speed up faster development.

963
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,760
Therefore, SM-2 could use it.

964
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,080
Do you want your medicine?

965
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,360
I don't want mine.

966
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,320
I'm an adult.

967
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,280
Why me?

968
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,920
So whose medicine should I take?

969
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
Is this medicine for Zhou Min?

970
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
You want him to grow fast

971
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,760
So he can sell silver

972
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,760
Do you admit it?

973
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Oh, you two

974
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,760
This medicine

975
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,760
Who is this for?

976
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
This question is very good

977
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
It is

978
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,760
I was eaten by Zhou Min

979
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Zhou Min is my girlfriend

980
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,760
You have all seen

981
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
She is a girlfriend, why do you give her this medicine?

982
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
