1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The next one is the most difficult one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's a very difficult one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's a very difficult one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a very difficult one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a very difficult one.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Alright, it's the last one.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You know what?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,180
I'm going to the

9
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,240

I'm going to the

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:00,680
I'm going to the

39
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm going to the

40
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,400
me

41
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,580
I don't have a picture of

42
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:32,680
I don't have a picture of

43
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,640
I don't have a picture of

44
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,580
This case is子

45
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,780
Big.

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,720
We're looking for

47
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,280
How should I fill a hole to

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,360
How should I fill a hole to

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,780
How should I fill a hole to

50
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:45,860
How should I fill a hole to

51
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,420
how should I fill a hole to

52
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,620
How should I fill a hole to

53
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,200
How should I fill a hole to

54
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,700
I don't know how I'm going to

55
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,020
I don't know how I'm going to

56
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,120
I don't know how to do it

57
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,180
I don't know how to do it

58
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,420
I don't know how to do it

59
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,060
I don't know how I'm doing to

60
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,660
business.

61
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:52,960
Anyway it did not

62
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
I'm sorry.

63
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Who is in charge of the Lushen case?

64
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Our vice president.

65
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
Are they familiar with each other?

66
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Of course not.

67
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
They can still take such a case.

68
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,960
But it's not easy to do it now.

69
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Otherwise,

70
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
they wouldn't take any case

71
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
and make so much trouble for themselves.

72
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,960
What did Mr. Deng ask us to do?

73
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,960
He said that Lushen and Dingshun's contract

74
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
was signed by a vice president named Wu Bin.

75
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Hello.

76
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Hello.

77
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
I'm looking for Wu Bin.

78
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Are you looking for Mr. Wu?

79
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
This way, please.

80
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
I'm sorry.

81
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
I'm sorry.

82
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm sorry.

83
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
I'm sorry.

84
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
I'm sorry.

85
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
I'm sorry.

86
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Comrade Jiang,

87
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
I've decided.

88
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
I want to get married.

89
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
I want to make a contribution.

90
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Who are you going to report?

91
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Well,

92
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
I want to ask you.

93
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,160
What's the benefit of

94
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
raising money?

95
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
You tell me first.

96
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
How much does a child worth?

97
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Do you think it's a market?

98
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
You even bargain to pay off the price.

99
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
You can say whatever you want, but you don't want to talk about A'Dao.

100
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Say it.

101
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Say it.

102
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Say it.

103
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
That's...

104
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
The child of the secretary

105
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,960
was kidnapped because of money.

106
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
Which secretary?

107
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,960
The general manager of the Kaiyi Trade and Trade Company.

108
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Officer A'Rou,

109
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
what do you need me to cooperate with?

110
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
I just want to know some things.

111
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Say it.

112
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Do you have a client named Wusheng?

113
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Yes.

114
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Did you sign a big order some time ago?

115
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Yes.

116
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
You know that

117
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,960
our company is a major trading company in Southeast Asia.

118
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Wusheng signed a contract with us.

119
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,960
We want to buy the iron pot and the stone pot in the country of Qimang.

120
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,960
We paid him 5 million in purchase.

121
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
I didn't expect to meet Hainan.

122
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
So far,

123
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
their company has not reached 5 million

124
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
to our account.

125
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Such a big money.

126
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,960
That means you have a different relationship with Wusheng.

127
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,960
That's the motivation of our cooperation.

128
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Why didn't you call the police?

129
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
You lied to us.

130
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,960
I didn't lie to you.

131
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Don't worry.

132
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
I'll tell you slowly.

133
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,960
It was two months ago.

134
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Sheng Qinglin went to our company

135
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
to buy iron pot and stone pot.

136
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Their small company is usually small.

137
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,960
I just collected the deposit as usual.

138
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
Then I asked Ding Shun Group

139
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
to purchase the goods from Qimang.

140
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Who knows something bad will happen.

141
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
Hainan is out of stock.

142
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Sheng is so annoying in the company every day.

143
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Do you know Wusheng?

144
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Are you familiar with him?

145
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
I met him at the OUERZ.

146
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
What kind of person is he?

147
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,960
He has a bad temper and likes to flirt.

148
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
Don't move.

149
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Don't move.

150
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
I'm coming.

151
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
Don't move.

152
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Mr. Lu.

153
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
I'm sorry.

154
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
I was drunk.

155
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
I went to the wrong room.

156
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
I'm sorry.

157
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
I'm sorry.

158
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
I'm really sorry.

159
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Sorry.

160
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm sorry.

161
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
It's embarrassing to bump into you.

162
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
I have to go.

163
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,960
That's the way it is.

164
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Is it this girl?

165
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
It's been a long time.

166
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
I can't remember.

167
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,960
But it's been a long time.

168
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
He's annoying in the company every day.

169
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
He's bothering me.

170
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
He's annoying me.

171
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Tell me why you blame Sheng Jingming's child.

172
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
I just said it.

173
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
He's like a dog's ass.

174
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,960
He's annoying me every day.

175
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Mr. Lu.

176
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Sit down.

177
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
I won't sit.

178
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
I have something to talk to you.

179
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
What's the matter?

180
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Mr. Lu.

181
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
I paid the money.

182
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
But the goods are gone.

183
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,960
You have to give me an explanation.

184
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Jingming.

185
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
I told you.

186
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Hainan belongs to the heaven.

187
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
You don't need to find me.

188
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
If I can't get the goods.

189
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
You have to return the goods to me.

190
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Otherwise, I'll be in trouble.

191
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Mr. Lu.

192
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Sheng Jingming.

193
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Are you going too far?

194
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
You went to the company the day before yesterday.

195
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,960
Yesterday you went to the park to read.

196
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Today you came to our house.

197
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
What are you going to do?

198
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Go back and take a good look at the picture.

199
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
What does it say?

200
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
It's clearly written.

201
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,960
The loss caused by the irreversible factor

202
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
is borne by both of us.

203
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
You ask me to return the money.

204
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
I'll ask someone else.

205
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
I...

206
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
I know.

207
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
I know it's written on the contract.

208
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
But now I really have no choice.

209
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
I have no way.

210
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
You...

211
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
You do it.

212
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
This is the money.

213
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
You...

214
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
You return half of it.

215
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
You can return half of it.

216
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Luo Qinglin.

217
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
I tell you.

218
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
You can't return a penny.

219
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
If you don't accept it.

220
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
You go to the police station and sue me.

221
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
Did you hear me?

222
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Go out.

223
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Mr. Lu.

224
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Grandpa Zhang.

225
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Song Ge.

226
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Mr. Lu.

227
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Listen to me, Mr. Lu.

228
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Go.

229
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Don't push me.

230
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Go away.

231
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Go away.

232
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Listen to me.

233
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Don't push me.

234
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
If you want to be finished, we'll be finished together.

235
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
You're giving me a face, aren't you?

236
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Go out.

237
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
Go away.

238
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Don't push me.

239
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
I can walk on my own.

240
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
Wait for me.

241
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
I tell you.

242
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
I tell you.

243
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
I tell you.

244
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
I tell you.

245
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
You're a accomplice.

246
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
You did it by force.

247
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm not an accomplice.

248
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
I didn't mean that.

249
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:20,220
I meant that you were a

250
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,220
You scared me.

251
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,220
Why did you come here?

252
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,220
I beg you.

253
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,220
I beg you.

254
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,220
Mr. Lu.

255
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,220
I don't want the money.

256
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,220
But you don't touch my child.

257
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,220
I beg you.

258
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,220
Mr. Lu.

259
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,220
Don't touch my child.

260
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,220
I beg you.

261
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,220
What are you talking about?

262
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,220
Who touched your child?

263
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,220
If you say that again, I'll break your mouth.

264
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,220
I beg you.

265
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,220
I told you to get out.

266
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,220
Did you hear me?

267
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,220
I beg you.

268
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,220
I beg you.

269
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,220
Don't touch my child.

270
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,220
I beg you.

271
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,220
I don't want the money.

272
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,220
Take her away.

273
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,220
I beg you.

274
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,220
Mr. Lu.

275
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,220
What are you doing?

276
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,220
Mr. Lu.

277
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,220
I don't want the money.

278
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,220
Don't touch my child.

279
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,220
Mr. Lu.

280
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,220
I don't want the money.

281
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,220
How can you do this?

282
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,220
You're so ungrateful.

283
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,220
I'm not that kind of person.

284
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,220
I said that for my good performance.

285
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,220
I said that.

286
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,220
Okay, we'll figure it out.

287
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,220
Don't go.

288
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,220
I'm a major accomplice.

289
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,220
Comrade Jiang, am I an accomplice?

290
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,220
I'm not an accomplice.

291
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,220
Mr. Liu, do you know Fei Yan?

292
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,220
Fei Yan?

293
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,220
Mr. Fei, right?

294
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,220
Yes, he's a regular customer of Tianhai Jixiang.

295
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,220
He's generous.

296
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,220
Are you familiar with him?

297
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,220
I'm glad you asked.

298
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,220
Let's put it this way.

299
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,220
I've basically known everyone who came to Tianhai Jixiang.

300
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,220
But knowing someone doesn't mean that you're close.

301
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,220
What happened to him?

302
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,220
Do you have surveillance cameras?

303
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,220
Yes, we don't have many.

304
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,220
But we only keep one.

305
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,220
Let's go to the surveillance room and take a look.

306
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,220
Okay.

307
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,220
Stop.

308
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,220
Mr. Liu, can you confirm if it's this person?

309
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,220
It's him.

310
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,220
Is this your last time seeing him?

311
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,220
Oh, right.

312
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,220
What's going on?

313
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,220
Do you know...

314
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,220
I can.

315
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,220
If he's in touch, please notify us as soon as possible.

316
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,220
Of course.

317
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,220
Is it our duty to cooperate with the police?

318
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,220
We checked the customer information of Tianhai Jixiang.

319
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,220
Fei Yan does go there often.

320
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,220
But he's just a regular customer.

321
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
There's no particular reason.

322
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220
I think he's a regular customer.

323
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,220
He doesn't want to go there.

324
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,220
But he's just a regular customer.

325
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,220
There's nothing wrong with that.

326
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,220
What do you think about Liu Gang?

327
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,220
He's just a regular customer.

328
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,220
And he asked Fei Yan what his relationship was with him.

329
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,220
He said he was a customer.

330
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,220
There's no particular reason.

331
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,220
I think Liu Gang has a problem.

332
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,220
He knows we'll go there and ask him questions.

333
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,220
Where is he?

334
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
He's inside.

335
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,220
Director Yin, Xin.

336
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,220
Director Yin.

337
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,220
Director, we went to Wu Bin to ask him questions.

338
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,220
We didn't find anything wrong.

339
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,220
But Wu Bin provided us with a message.

340
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,220
He said he saw Lu Sheng with a girl who looked like Zheng Weiwei in Tianhai Jixiang.

341
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,220
Tianhai Jixiang?

342
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,220
Are you sure?

343
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,220
We're not sure about the location.

344
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,220
We just said he looked like her.

345
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,220
It's Tianhai Jixiang again.

346
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,220
What's going on between them?

347
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
Good evening, Miss.

348
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,220
You ruined my business.

349
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,220
I'm going to throw her out.

350
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,220
Don't be angry.

351
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,220
Why are you angry with her?

352
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,220
Xin, you must be scared.

353
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,220
Go back to sleep.

354
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,220
Don't be angry.

355
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,220
You drank so much.

356
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,220
I'll get you a glass of water.

357
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,220
Don't be angry.

358
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,220
What's wrong?

359
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,220
Did the police come today to do something troublesome?

360
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,220
What trouble?

361
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,220
Fei Yan went abroad.

362
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,220
The police couldn't find anything.

363
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,220
I couldn't sleep well these two days.

364
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,220
I had a bad blood pressure.

365
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,220
Are you afraid?

366
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
Who am I afraid of?

367
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,680
What can a little

368
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,220
dachshund do to me?

369
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,220
You'd better be careful.

370
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Don't come these days.

371
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,220
You'd better take care of your family.

372
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,220
You can do everything.

373
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,220
I can do nothing.

374
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,220
At most...

375
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,220
You talk too much.

376
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,220
What are you doing?

377
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,220
You should say something.

378
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,220
You shouldn't say something.

379
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Do you understand?

380
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,220
Yes.

381
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,220
Smile.

382
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,220
You smile so well.

383
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,220
Good girl.

384
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Good girl.

385
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,220
How many actions do you think Lu Sheng said?

386
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,220
His rape has been proven.

387
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
Is it necessary to lie?

388
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,220
Wang Guangqing needs to check again.

389
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
Sheng Qinglin.

390
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,220
This name has an impact.

391
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,220
Is it related to you that Sheng Qinglin and the child were kidnapped?

392
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,220
Of course it's not related to me.

393
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,220
I won't do anything that is out of the question.

394
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,220
I remind you that this is related to Boss Li.

395
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,220
Boss Li?

396
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
There is such a party.

397
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,220
There is such a party.

398
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,220
At that time, Sheng Qinglin offended Boss Li.

399
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,220
Then he asked me to find two younger brothers to teach him a lesson.

400
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,220
There is such a party.

401
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,220
I tell you, I don't want this girl.

402
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,220
I'll send her back. I don't want her.

403
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,220
OK, OK, OK. We don't want her.

404
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,220
You smile.

405
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,220
I'll find you a better one in two days.

406
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,220
Wait for my notice.

407
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,220
What's wrong?

408
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,220
What kind of person or what makes you not feel good?

409
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,220
You can be a rogue.

410
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,220
I'll deal with him.

411
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,220
I'm a professional rogue.

412
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,220
If you tell me, I'll give you a solution.

413
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,220
Boss.

414
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,220
How to teach him?

415
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,220
You say it in detail.

416
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,220
I just want to touch the body first.

417
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,220
I haven't done it yet.

418
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,220
I just received a call from the old rogue.

419
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,220
Are you talking about the person called Wang Chuan?

420
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,220
I don't know.

421
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,220
Anyway, it's called the old rogue.

422
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,220
Maybe it's a person.

423
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,220
I'll go.

424
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,220
What does he call you for?

425
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,220
To borrow money.

426
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,220
Brother, you're finally here.

427
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,220
Brother, what's the matter?

428
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,220
I'm in trouble.

429
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,220
We can't meet.

430
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,220
If we meet, if Brother Qu knows,

431
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,220
I can't care so much.

432
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,220
Brother, I really have no way to go now.

433
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,220
You have to help me.

434
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,220
Brother, to be honest,

435
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,220
You're also a big hit for Brother Qu.

436
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,220
This plate doesn't suit me.

437
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,220
What happened to make you like this?

438
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,220
Don't mention it.

439
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,220
Recently, the police are very strict.

440
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,220
They took my place.

441
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,220
I don't know where Hongyi is hiding.

442
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,220
And they took my money away.

443
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,220
You put all the money in Hongyi's hands.

444
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,220
We've been living together for 20 years.

445
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,220
I didn't expect the goods to fly.

446
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,220
He flew and gave me a wrapping party.

447
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,220
Brother, it seems you've met your true love.

448
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,220
Brother, the wind is strong now.

449
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,220
I have to leave Lingshan immediately.

450
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,220
Please lend me some money.

451
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,220
I'll pay you back later.

452
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,220
Brother, why don't you look for Brother Qu?

453
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,220
I want to find him.

454
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,220
But can you find him?

455
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,220
You know it.

456
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,220
Brother, please help me.

457
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,220
When I get over the trouble,

458
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,220
I'll be more generous.

459
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,220
Brother, I can't lend you the money.

460
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,220
It's not the right thing to do.

461
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:00,220
But I can find you a job that can pay you back.

462
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,220
What job?

463
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,220
Well...

464
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,220
I don't know what's coming.

465
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,220
Wang Guangxin, you don't like to kidnap children.

466
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,220
Why do you give Huang Chuan this method?

467
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,220
You're trying to teach him a lesson.

468
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,220
How can it be a lesson?

469
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,220
He called me every day.

470
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,220
It's annoying.

471
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,220
I had to go to the boss.

472
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,220
I didn't let him kidnap the children.

473
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,220
He's going to kidnap the children, right?

474
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,220
Did he ever look for you?

475
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,220
No.

476
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,220
Do you remember what he looks like?

477
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,220
He's over 50 years old.

478
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,220
He's a middle-class man.

479
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,220
He's a little bald.

480
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,220
The most obvious mark is

481
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:56,220
there's a mole on his face.

482
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,220
Go get the makeup artist.

483
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,220
I'll be right there.

484
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,220
Okay.

485
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,220
How is it going, Director?

486
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
Wang Guangxin told me that

487
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
the children of She Qinglin are related to Huang Chuan.

488
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,220
This is her statement.

489
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,220
But there's no record of She Qinglin losing her child

490
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
in the Deng's family's investigation system.

491
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,220
Director, Assistant Director,

492
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,220
the pictures of Huang Chuan.

493
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,220
Take a look.

494
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,220
With this picture, we've made a big step forward.

495
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,220
How about I go and apply to the police?

496
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,220
We'll follow this picture to get the warrant.

497
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,220
No hurry.

498
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,220
Wait a minute.

499
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
We've been chasing this person for 20 years.

500
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,220
He's very cunning.

501
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,220
If we get the warrant now,

502
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,220
I'm afraid it'll alert him.

503
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,220
Yes. And now we do need more information on Huang Chuan.

504
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,220
I've already asked Yan Lei and Jia Jia

505
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,220
to investigate She Qinglin.

506
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,220
Let's see what She Qinglin says first.

507
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,220
200,000 yuan for the training team.

508
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,220
The price is so high.

509
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,220
180,000 yuan is fine.

510
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,220
When do you want to come over?

511
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,220
Okay, I got it.

512
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,220
You two are here to open the company.

513
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,220
I'll take you to see.

514
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,220
Please accompany me to investigate the police case.

515
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,220
What happened?

516
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,220
We came to you today

517
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,220
for the matter of you and Lu Shen's contract dispute.

518
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,220
Officer Yan,

519
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,220
that matter has been turned upside down.

520
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,220
There's nothing to say.

521
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,220
But according to Lu Shen's confession,

522
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,220
you lost your child and went to him.

523
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,220
No, no.

524
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,220
Are you sure?

525
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,220
It's not like that.

526
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,220
It's a misunderstanding.

527
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,220
My child is fine.

528
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,220
Officer Yan,

529
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,220
I'm going to close the company.

530
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,220
I want to go back to Zhongning.

531
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,220
I don't want to do business anymore.

532
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,220
Thank you for your concern.

533
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,220
I'm really busy today.

534
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,220
I don't have time to entertain you.

535
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,220
Please go back.

536
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,220
Let's go first.

537
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
I need to talk to him.

538
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,220
Jia, let's talk.

539
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,220
She Qinglin must have something to hide from me.

540
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,220
I think so too.

541
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,220
Let's talk to Dong Zhuo first.

542
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,220
Let's go.

543
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,220
Jia,

544
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220
did she really not report to you?

545
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,220
No.

546
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,220
She said it was a misunderstanding.

547
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,220
Those two main perpetrators

548
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,220
admitted that they did kidnap the child.

549
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,220
What's the point of playing a victim?

550
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,220
That means the victim has a problem.

551
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,220
This Lu Shen,

552
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,220
is related to this case with Zheng Weiwei.

553
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,220
This Wang Wangqing is also related.

554
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,220
The child was sold

555
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,220
is also related to Wang Wangqing.

556
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,220
And these two people

557
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,220
are also related to Tiepi Shi Hu.

558
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,220
We need to continue investigating She Qinglin.

559
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,220
She Qinglin's child is really here.

560
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,220
She's really here.

561
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,220
It's good that she didn't lose it.

562
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,220
Why is she moving out now?

563
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
Who are you hiding from?

564
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,220
Lin Lei,

565
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,220
go to the night market and check their surveillance.

566
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,220
Director,

567
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
there's a discovery.

568
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
Song Song, let's go.

569
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,220
She Qinglin,

570
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,220
we still want to find out about She Qinglin.

571
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,220
Officer,

572
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,220
didn't I already tell you last time?

573
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,220
My child is fine.

574
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,220
Look,

575
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,220
isn't this good?

576
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,220
I really don't have much to say.

577
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,220
And the team is moving out.

578
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,220
So please, officers,

579
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,220
let me go.

580
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,220
It's a duty of every citizen to cooperate with the investigation of the public security agency.

581
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,220
We won't delay you too long.

582
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,220
Just a few minutes, okay?

583
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,220
Okay.

584
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,220
This is the surveillance video

585
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,220
we got from your neighborhood.

586
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,220
No,

587
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,220
that old man is my relative.

588
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,220
I'm just kidding.

589
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,220
I'm just kidding. He'll be back soon.

590
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,220
That old man's nickname is Old Yellow Dog.

591
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,220
It's a way to kidnap children.

592
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,220
We've been investigating him for a long time.

593
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,220
So we hope you can provide us some clues so we can catch him as soon as possible.

594
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,220
So your child

595
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,220
was kidnapped before, right?

596
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,220
If you don't catch him,

597
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,220
it's no use moving out.

598
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,220
He kidnapped your son once, and there will be a second time.

599
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,220
Did you hear that?

600
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,220
That man is a real man.

601
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,220
I'm not saying he's a real man.

602
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,220
He's a good boy.

603
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,220
How can I say that?

604
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,220
If you don't tell me when the police are here,

605
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,220
when are you going to tell me?

606
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,220
Tell me!

607
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,220
Do you want to lose Congcong again?

608
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,220
That day was August 9, 2009.

609
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,220
I received a strange message from the company.

610
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,220
I left home immediately.

611
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,220
Congcong!

612
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,220
Congcong!

613
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,220
Congcong!

614
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,220
Congcong!

615
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,220
Did you put it in?

616
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,220
I'm so scared!

617
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,220
Congcong!

618
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,220
Do you have money in your hands?

619
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,220
Yes!

620
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,220
Go get it!

621
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,220
Go!

622
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,220
There's no one here!

623
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,220
Where's Congcong?

624
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,220
Don't ask. Let's go!

625
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,220
Let's go!

626
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,220
Congcong!

627
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,220
Did you give the money back to the kid?

628
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,220
No.

629
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,220
I paid the money to the client.

630
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,220
The kid didn't come back until the time was set.

631
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,220
It's 12 o'clock.

632
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
When is Congcong coming back?

633
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,220
Don't worry.

634
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,220
It's so late.

635
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,220
Congcong!

636
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,220
No! We can't call the police!

637
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,220
Why can't we call the police?

638
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,220
If we call the police, they'll give us the money!

639
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,220
Nonsense!

640
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,220
Wait!

641
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,220
I lost a message.

642
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,220
I thought about who I offended before.

643
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,220
I finally understood.

644
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,220
It was Mr. Lu who was guilty.

645
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,220
I had to apologize to him.

646
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,220
I'm begging you.

647
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,220
I don't want the money.

648
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,220
But don't touch my kid.

649
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,220
Don't touch my kid.

650
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,220
What did you say?

651
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,220
If you say that again, I'll sue you!

652
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,220
But I think Mr. Lu doesn't know what he's doing.

653
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,220
When I was in the end,

654
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,220
the thief sent me another message.

655
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,220
I came to the address in the message.

656
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
I met the kid this time.

657
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,220
It's here.

658
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,220
Congcong!

659
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
Congcong!

660
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,220
Mom!

661
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,220
Congcong!

662
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,220
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

663
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,220
I'm here.

664
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,220
I was so scared.

665
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,220
So I didn't call the police.

666
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,220
I didn't go to Mr. Lu to urge for money.

667
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,220
I heard that Mr. Lu was arrested.

668
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,220
I was afraid that I would be the one who called the police.

669
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,220
So I came to find trouble.

670
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,220
I wanted to leave Lin Shan as soon as possible.

671
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
I think Huang Chuan asked him for 30,000 yuan.

672
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,220
If this family called the police earlier,

673
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,220
maybe Huang Chuan was arrested.

674
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,220
There's one thing I don't understand.

675
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,220
Why did Huang Chuan return the kid?

676
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,220
He asked for money.

677
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,220
He asked for money once.

678
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,220
Why can't it be the second time?

679
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,220
As long as he doesn't return the kid,

680
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,220
he can ask for more money.

681
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,220
He can even sell the kid.

682
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,220
He used to do it.

683
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
So what's the reason

684
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,220
that he was so kind

685
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,220
to send the kid back?

686
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,220
I don't understand.

687
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,220
Did he notice

688
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,220
something?

689
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,220
What if he called the police earlier?

690
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,220
At that time,

691
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,220
we should be in Shen Menggui.

692
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,220
If he called the police,

693
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,220
Huang Chuan would be arrested.

694
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,220
So he knew that Hongyi was wanted.

695
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,220
So he didn't let him call the police.

696
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,220
He was worried that Hongyi

697
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,220
might be involved in it.

698
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,220
He didn't want to reveal

699
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,220
his reason.

700
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,220
So he didn't want to leave.

701
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,220
So Huang Chuan is still in Lingshan.

702
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,220
A few years ago,

703
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,220
we took a case of a prostitute.

704
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,220
We already knew

705
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
that the criminal was Huang Chuan.

706
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,220
We set up a trap

707
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,220
at the station and the dock.

708
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,220
But when we caught him,

709
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
we didn't let him go.

710
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,220
Because he didn't go to the place

711
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
where we set up the trap.

712
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,220
He left directly from Shenshan Old Lin.

713
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,220
That was the closest time

714
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,220
that I caught him.

715
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,220
I think I know him well.

716
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,220
He is different from Wang Guangqing.

717
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,220
He is specializing in

718
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,220
Wang Shenshan Old Lin's prostitution.

719
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,220
So this place

720
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,220
where Huang Chuan is hiding

721
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,220
must be in the same area as Lingshan.

722
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,220
There is only one place

723
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,220
that meets this condition.

724
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,220
That is Wangma Town, under the foot of Shanruishan.

725
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,220
Erqing,

726
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,220
contact Wangma Town Police Station.

727
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,220
Let them send a notice of investigation.

728
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,220
We must catch this old fox.

729
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,220
Yes.

730
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,220
Master,

731
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,220
how much for this case bill?

732
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
Ten packs.

733
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,220
What about this?

734
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,420
This one isIII hundred almost ten.

735
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,220
What about this?

736
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,220
We got no spare ones.

737
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,220
How about this?

738
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,220
Only 20 yuan

739
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,220
Can it be cheaper?

740
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,220
This is the original imported one

741
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,220
It's not expensive anymore

742
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,220
My hat is also imported

743
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,220
I have a discount

744
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,220
Take a look

745
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,220
How to get there?

746
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Director Deng

747
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,220
We got news from Lao Xun

748
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,220
Our people found the traces of Huang Chuan

749
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,220
This is a screenshot

750
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,220
Ok, I'll go with Chang'er

751
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,220
I'll go with you

752
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,220
Master, the road is far

753
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,220
We split up to act

754
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,220
You contact the local police

755
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,220
I and Chang'er will go to the scene first

756
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,220
Ok, be careful on the road

757
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,220
Hurry up

758
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,220
We can only stop here

759
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,220
Ok

760
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,220
Be careful

761
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,220
Director Xu

762
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,220
Eat something

763
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,220
I want to say something

764
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,220
There are many fires in the mountains

765
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,220
We should be careful

766
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,220
If strangers come in

767
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,220
We can call the police

768
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,220
Ok

769
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,220
Ok, thank you

770
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,220
Sit down

771
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,220
Ok, bye

772
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,220
Attention, everyone

773
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,220
We will go to the mountain

774
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,220
To search for the mountain

775
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,220
Do you understand? Yes

776
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,520
The mountain, given by the police

777
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,060
Brother

778
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,220
It's getting dark.

779
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
Please make yourself comfortable.

780
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,220
What's your situation?

781
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,220
I'm a tourist.

782
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
I like to walk around the mountain.

783
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
This mountain is quite narrow.

784
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
I get lost as I walk.

785
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
It's getting dark.

786
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
Can I stay here for a night?

787
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
No.

788
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
This place used to be a bedroom.

789
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
Bro,

790
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
I beg you.

791
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,220
Put it away.

792
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,220
Don't smoke.

793
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,220
How about this?

794
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,220
I'll ask our leader to let us know.

795
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,220
We'll send you out.

796
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,220
Don't think about staying here.

797
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
It's not good.

798
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,220
If that's the case,

799
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,220
then...

800
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,220
I won't bother you.

801
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,220
I won't bother you.

802
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,220
Okay.

803
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,220
Let's go.

804
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,220
I'll go.

805
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,220
Hey, Lao Yin.

806
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,220
Okay, I got it.

807
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,220
This bitch.

808
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,220
She's really scary.

809
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,220
Deputy Director Yin.

810
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,220
Director Deng and the others are back.

811
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,220
I'm sorry.

812
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,220
I'm sorry.

813
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,220
I'm sorry.

814
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,220
Director.

815
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
Lao Yin, get in the car.

816
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,220
Okay.

817
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,220
Yin Shu, you're a good shot this time.

818
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,220
If you didn't lock the escape route of Lao Huang Gou,

819
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,220
it would be too late to catch him.

820
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,220
Tell me.

821
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,220
How did you catch him?

822
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,220
After receiving your call,

823
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,220
we contacted the forest guard.

824
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,220
The guard said there was a donkey last night.

825
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,220
He went that way too.

826
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,220
I feel strange.

827
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,220
Who else would go that way?

828
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,220
Be careful.

829
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,220
There are a lot of vegetables in the mountains.

830
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,220
Especially the wild boar.

831
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,220
There are a lot of traps on the face of the hunt.

832
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,220
Don't go anywhere.

833
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,220
Help.

834
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,220
Help.

835
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,220
Help.

836
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,220
Help.

837
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,220
Help.

838
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,220
Didn't you find our friend who was leaving last night?

839
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,220
Don't touch me.

840
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,220
It's hot.

841
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,220
Don't touch me.

842
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,220
You could have let him go down the mountain yesterday.

843
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,220
He didn't have to go around.

844
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,220
Now he's a dead donkey.

845
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,220
What should we do?

846
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,220
This is a trap.

847
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,220
You're not a boar.

848
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,220
You're a yellow dog.

849
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,220
See if you can catch him.

850
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,220
Why am I so unlucky?

851
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,220
Qiucai told me

852
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,220
he heard the sound of the wild boar and wanted to hide.

853
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,220
But he found the trap that the hunter put on.

854
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,220
That thing.

855
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,220
It hurts, right?

856
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
Help.

857
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,220
Let's give a big gift to our colleagues at the police station.

858
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,220
Hello.

859
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,220
Who is it?

860
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,220
Boss, the yellow dog is trapped.

861
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,220
Bad luck.

862
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,220
Uncle Zeng.

863
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,220
Why haven't you left?

864
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,220
Qiao.

865
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,220
You're on leave for a few days.

866
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,220
I'm trying to find a way.

867
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,220
I'm not not giving you time to wait.

868
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,220
I've waited for you to renew your contract for a long time.

869
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,220
I didn't wait for you.

870
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,220
I even signed a contract with him.

871
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,220
He'll come to see the house in a minute.

872
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,220
If he sees you still there, I'll compensate with the penalty.

873
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,220
Qiao, I understand your difficulty.

874
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,220
Qiao.

875
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,220
Your mission is here.

876
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,940
I'll move out right away

877
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,060
I won't wait anymore

878
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,140
I'll tear this wall

879
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,860
I'll tear it

880
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,620
I have to tear it

881
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,100
What are you doing?

882
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,380
What are you doing?

883
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,300
I'll tear it

884
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,900
You think I'm doing business?

885
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,860
I'll tear it

886
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,420
I can't tear it

887
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,340
What are you doing?

888
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,300
Thank you

889
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,420
I'll tear it

890
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,980
Give it to me

891
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,060
I don't want to die

892
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,420
I'll tear it

893
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,980
I don't want to die

894
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,940
I don't want to die

895
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,220

00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,220
I'll tear it

939
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,220
I'll tear it

940
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,220
I'll tear it

941
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,220
I'll tear it

942
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,220
I'll tear it

943
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,220
I'll tear it

944
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,220
I'll tear it

945
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,220
I'll tear it

946
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,220
I'll tear it

947
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,220
I'll tear it

948
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,220
I'll tear it

949
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,220
I'll tear it

950
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,220
I'll tear it

951
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,220
I'll tear it

952
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,220
I'll tear it

953
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,220
I'll tear it

954
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,220
I'll tear it

955
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,220
I'll tear it

956
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,220
Hugging the end

957
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:59,220
It will never change

958
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:03,220
Just like my heart

959
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,220
It will never be deep

960
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,220
The blue heart

961
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:15,220
It will never be deep

962
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:24,220
The blue heart
