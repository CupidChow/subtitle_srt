1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I am ordinary

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am alone in the battle

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Time is rough

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I am ordinary

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I am loyal

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I am stupid

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I have a bright future

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I am confused

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I am young and I have a bright future

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I am happy when I come back

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I am loyal

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I am a hero in the world

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I will be the hero in the world

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Legend of Chusen

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Fang Yu was not fooled

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He is not a coward

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Come out

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I am waiting for you

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I will take you back

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and watch the door

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Since I took away the primordial spirit

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I will leave the body to you

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
All the beasts in level 2

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
are treasures

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I will take you back

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and watch the door

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
All the beasts in level 2

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
are treasures

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
if you can break his armor

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You are a little shame

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You have many treasures

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't kill people for the treasure

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
To you, it's a treasure

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
To me, it's just a pair of useless things

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You are really crazy

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The tip of the pepper and the claws

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
are all the materials of the top-quality magic weapons

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a waste to use them like this

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Get up, go to the side

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
To cut the beasts, you need to take the internal order

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's been a long time since I did it myself

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I am a little hurt

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But I can't lose face

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What is this?

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The tape should be very tight

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What is this?

49
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Qi Hudan

50
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,580
YOU NEED LOVE

51
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,860
Don't give me a hard time

52
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,060
This way, keep going.

53
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,780
I..

54
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,420
I can't protect you now.

55
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,420
The door to the forbidden area is about to close.

56
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,420
Students, leave quickly!

57
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,940
The school year is over.

58
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,420
The door to the forbidden area is about to close.

59
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,420

What's wrong with me?

63
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,420
What's wrong with me?

64
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,420
The forbidden area is about to close.

65
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
Why did I fall for so long?

66
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,420
The door to the forbidden area is about to close.

67
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,420

00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,420
wig

98
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,460
XY happen

99
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:10,420
after

100
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,420
Next, let's go.

101
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,020
Select quad.

102
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,420
Let's go back.

103
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,220
Go over there and check on them.

104
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,220
Yes.

105
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,420
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,020
How long are you going to sleep?

107
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,620
It's too late if you don't leave now.

108
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,420
I...

109
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,220
I've been sleeping...

110
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,620
for a long time, right?

111
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,020
It doesn't matter.

112
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,620
The door is about to close.

113
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,220
The door to the forbidden area is about to close.

114
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,420
Students, leave now!

115
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,220
The forbidden area is about to close.

116
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,420
What should we do with this guy?

117
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,420
Should we kill him now?

118
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,020
So that he won't talk nonsense outside?

119
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,020
You're not leaving?

120
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,620
That's a silver bag from the Mojia.

121
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,220
I didn't expect it to be a rare bow.

122
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,620
Any self-contradiction that touches it

123
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,020
will release

124
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,020
the poison of the urge to love.

125
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,420
I'm the kind of person that you should know.

126
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,220
What happened between us

127
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,420
was just a misunderstanding.

128
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,820
Just treat it as a dream.

129
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,220
I know.

130
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,020
If you dare to say anything about today...

131
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,820
There will be no third party to know.

132
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,620
I took this box.

133
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,820
You don't mind, do you?

134
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,420
No, I don't mind.

135
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,820
Then these spirits...

136
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,820
The blood-spirits flower belongs to me.

137
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,820
Take away the rest.

138
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,020
Hope no one knows.

139
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,620
Take it away!

140
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,620
The體米果 finally arrives.

141
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,820
I feel like I deserve a calling.

142
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,260
How could we ensure he doesn't know that

143
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,700
much about a female body parts because of婚姻?

144
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,000
You just got the wrong girl already.

145
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,500
Or else, I wouldn't continue to roasted him.

146
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,660
But how I don't know how to rub her Environment is about how much and don't how much?

147
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,020
In the contestants boxes,

148
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:54,360
I could've cooperation with some kind of

149
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,280
In the destiny,

150
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,320
we continue to live on

151
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,940
eternally.

152
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,720
Thank you.

153
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400

154
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,940

156
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,620
help if I were you?

157
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,260
And I don't think I would!

158
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,320
Yes.

159
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,000
They must learn to trust us.

160

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,300

I used my golden dabble treasure to destroy it

180
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Is it important to die?

181
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,300
I'm Han Li.

I'm Han Li.

193
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,300
I'm Han Li.

194
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,300
I'm Han Li.

195
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,300
I'm Han Li.

196
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
I'm Han Li.

197
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
I'm Han Li.

198
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,300
I'm Han Li.

199
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,300
I'm Han Li.

200
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
I'm Han Li.

201
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,300
I just casually ask,

202
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
you can also say those things.

203
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
My name is Nan Gongwan.

204
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,300
My name is Han Li.

205
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
If you call me anything that has nothing to do with me,

206
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,300
after you're out,

207
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
we're strangers.

208
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,300
Nan Gongwan,

209
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
there's only one day,

210
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,300
when you're in danger,

211
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,300
I will come help you.

212
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Take care of yourself first.

213
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Don't come for me.

214
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,300
The time is coming.

215
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
The Golden Emperor is going to close.

216
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,300
No one should come out.

217
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
It's not dark yet.

218
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Wait a little longer.

219
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
If there's still someone alive,

220
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,300
we'll come out soon.

221
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
Everyone,

222
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
I'll take a step forward.

223
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Han Li.

224
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Han Li.

225
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
So easy.

226
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,580
There are only a few left.

227
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,100
Let's go.

228
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,900
It seems that

229
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,820
this time the trial is really dangerous.

230
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,140
It actually hurt so many disciples.

231
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,100
Lan Gongwan,

232
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,020
has he left?

233
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,980
Who are you?

234
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,020
What are you going to go for?

235
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,540
There's no need to go further.

236
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,460
Weideian'sando thinks.

237
00:18:52,300 --> 00:19:10,220
Зем

238
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
Old Inst 혹药

239
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,420
Don'tamento

240
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,280
Come back!

241
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,300
Let's go!

242
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,540
How did your spirit grow?

243
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,900
Mister!

244
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,660
Master has taught me that

245
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:50,060
I should avoid

246
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,060
I met some friends of other sects

247
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,060
who were killed and killed

248
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,060
and picked up the spirits they left behind

249
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,060
You picked up these spirits?

250
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,060
You are lucky

251
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,060
Come here

252
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,060
Come here

253
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:24,060
From today on, you will be my disciple

254
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,060
Thank you, Grand Master

255
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,060
What Grand Master?

256
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,060
Call me Master

257
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
Yes

258
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,060
I, Han Li, greet you, Master

259
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,060
I call you Han Li

260
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,060
Han Li

261
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
Come up

262
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,060
Han Li, come to me

263
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Come

264
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,060
So many people were killed because of the failure

265
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,060
The path of cultivation is really a step forward

266
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,060
and endless

267
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,060
You are still sad for your fellow sect

268
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,060
You are really a good kid

269
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
This is the path of cultivation

270
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,060
There are many different landscapes

271
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Since you are alive, you should think about it

272
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,060
The so-called thought-and-answer is like this

273
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,060
Here is the Qingyuan Sword-Writing Manual

274
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,060
Take it

275
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
Take it as a greeting

276
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,060
But it is only suitable for practice

277
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,060
Don't practice too much

278
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,060
If you get the chance to practice

279
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,060
I will give you another method

280
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,060
Thank you, Master

281
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,060
Master, I have something to report

282
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
Say it

283
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,060
When I was in the Blood-stained Gold Emperor

284
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,060
I met some disciples of Lin Shoushan

285
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,060
They were misbehaving

286
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,060
They always feel that they are not like the righteous people

287
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,060
Tell me in detail

288
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:58,060
I think most of what they do is the cultivation of evil

289
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,060
They are very cruel

290
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,060
They don't take the spiritual grass, they just kill people

291
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,060
They don't even let go of their fellow sect

292
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,060
They are really those guys

293
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,060
Han Li, report to me everything

294
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,060
This is good

295
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
But this is important

296
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,060
Don't leak it

297
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
Yes, Master

298
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
So many disciples have been lost

299
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,060
Will it have anything to do with this?

300
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,060
I don't know

301
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,060
I don't know

302
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,060
I don't know

303
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,060
Will it have anything to do with this?

304
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
Master

305
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Master

306
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
Master

307
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,060
Master

308
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,060
Master

309
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,060
Master

310
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Master

311
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,060
Master

312
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,060
Master

313
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,060
Master

314
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,060
Master

315
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Master

316
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,060
Master

317
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,060
Master

318
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,060
Master

319
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,060
Master

320
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,060
Master

321
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,060
Master

322
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,060
Master

323
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,060
Master

324
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,060
Master

325
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,060
Master

326
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,060
Master

327
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,060
Master

328
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,060
Master

329
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,060
Master

330
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,060
Master

331
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,060
Master

332
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,060
Master

333
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,060
I always feel weird after you came back from the forbidden place

334
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,060
Not a person is born

335
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,060
Just vent to the box

336
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
I don't think so

337
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,060
You still say no

338
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,060
It's hard to get this box back

339
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,060
Can't open it

340
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,060
Can you be angry?

341
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,060
I didn't let you press the old guard in

342
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,060
You don't

343
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,060
I didn't expect it to be like this

344
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,060
The blood lotus is for Yan Jiabao

345
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,060
You forgot

346
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,060
The first thing you do when you come out of the forbidden place

347
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,060
Is to tell Qing to go to Yan Jiabao

348
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,060
It should be time soon

349
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,060
Waner

350
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,060
You tell me honestly

351
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,060
What happened in the forbidden place?

352
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,060
I always feel that you are different from before

353
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,060
How can the power be completely lost?

354
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,060
The Su Nvronghui Jue doesn't work either

355
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,060
Not to blame that Mo Jiao

356
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,060
And when I was killing him

357
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,060
I was cut off

358
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,060
Otherwise, how could I be so embarrassed?

359
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,060
How did you get out alone?

360
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,060
Senior

361
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,060
I suspect that this time the forbidden place

362
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,060
There are dirty forces coming in

363
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,060
Otherwise, it is impossible to hurt so many disciples

364
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,060
You mean

365
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,060
The Demon Sect?

366
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,060
And these people are under our eyes

367
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
Enter the forbidden place

368
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,060
I'm afraid they've been mixed up in the seven sects

369
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,060
Maybe the Yanyue Sect is also affected

370
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,060
The Demon Sect is not strange

371
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,060
Their mother likes to toss and let them toss

372
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,060
As long as you and I are in the Yanyue Sect

373
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,060
There can't be a big mess now

374
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,060
But those disciples

375
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,060
Look at you now

376
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,060
Even if the demon really wants to come

377
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,060
What are you going to fight with them?

378
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,060
The most important thing now is to recover your cultivation early

379
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,060
Those disciples who didn't come out of the forbidden place are a pity

380
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,060
Everything is abnormal

381
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,060
I hope that those who survived

382
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:27,060
Can be more smooth on the way to the future

383
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,060
Zhongwu

384
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,060
Uncle Zhong

385
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,060
Congratulations to the young master

386
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,060
Say it

387
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,060
Young master

388
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,060
You gave me the task

389
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,060
I think it's a success

390
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,060
Those seven sects

391
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,060
No, the stupid seven sects

392
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,060
The loss is nearly 70%

393
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,060
And they are all the seven sects

394
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,060
It definitely hurts their foundation

395
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,060
So there are still 30% left

396
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,060
You have to wait for me to help you solve it

397
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,060
Young master, calm down

398
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
The elephant is waiting, let alone 30%

399
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,060
Even if it's 30% or 30%

400
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,060
It's not a big deal

401
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,060
Stop talking nonsense

402
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
Young master, calm down

403
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,060
Did you do what I asked you to do?

404
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,060
I didn't forget

405
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,060
It's a success

406
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,060
It seems that it's not a complete waste

407
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,060
It can still be useful

408
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,060
Thank you for your time, young master

409
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,060
Go back to the forest and forest mountain

410
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,060
Make more trouble to some stupid seven sects

411
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,060
To lean on my Guilin Sect

412
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,060
It's best to help the machine

413
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,060
Yes, sir

414
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,060
Don't talk nonsense

415
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,060
You have to hide

416
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,060
Look at me

417
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,060
A talent

418
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,060
You have good taste

419
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,060
The two disciples who came back from the Blood Pond

420
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,060
Have been kneeling there for a night

421
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
You'd better see them

422
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,060
If you don't go back to the Blood Pond

423
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,060
They have the face to come back

424
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,060
Elder Liu

425
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,060
Is there no news from the seven sects?

426
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,060
What's the matter?

427
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,060
The Blood Pond has been closed for several days

428
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060
In theory

429
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,060
The blood lotus should be delivered

430
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,180
The people are the

431
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,060
I came to see the Master of the Yan family

432
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Master Cao, the blood lotus is delivered

433
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
Thank you, Erlang

434
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,060
They also arrived

435
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,060
Who is in the forest of my Yan family?

436
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,060
Blood Lotus

437
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,060
Don't be afraid, Elder Liu

438
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,060
I just want to be friends with you

439
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,060
Master

440
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,060
Master

441
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,060
Do you remember the person from Guilin Sect?

442
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,060
I remember

443
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,060
I remember

444
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,060
Master

445
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,060
He found us again

446
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,060
This time he said

447
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,060
He could save the young master

448
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,060
Would you like to see him?

449
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,060
Please

450
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,060
Please

451
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,060
With your skills

452
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,060
You dare to come alone

453
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,060
You are quite bold

454
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,060
To show my sincerity

455
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,060
I came here

456
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
To ask for the gift

457
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,060
For the young master

458
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,060
Forget about the gift

459
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,060
What he needs most now

460
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
Is a medicine

461
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,060
I also have the blood lotus

462
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
But he can't do this

463
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,060
And it will hurt the foundation when it is taken

464
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,060
I'm afraid

465
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,060
He can't cross the period of the monarchy in his life

466
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,060
Master

467
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,060
Do you really have the heart?

468
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,060
What do you mean?

469
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,060
Do you have any other ways?

470
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,060
Of course

471
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,060
There is a special skill in Guilin Sect

472
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,060
It's better than the blood lotus

473
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,060
Not only can you wake up

474
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,060
You can also completely cure his eyes

475
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,060
You are kidding

476
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,060
No matter how anxious I am

477
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,060
I won't be careless

478
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,060
You won't be worse

479
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,060
You can let me try first

480
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,060
If it doesn't work

481
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,060
Then I can use the blood lotus to cure him

482
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,060
It's not too late

483
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
Tell me

484
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,060
What conditions do you want to exchange with me?

485
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,060
The friendship of Yan family

486
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,060
is very important

487
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,060
The blood lotus

488
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,060
is finally back alive

489
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,060
Brother Heng

490
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,060
You are back

491
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,060
Why are you here?

492
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,060
I come to see you

493
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,060
I heard that many people died in the blood lotus

494
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,060
That's right

495
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,060
Isn't the cultivation of immortality for immortality?

496
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,060
The disciples gave their lives for the elixir

497
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,060
What's the point?

498
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,060
There are many good things in this world

499
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,060
You can go and see for me

500
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,060
This is the way to cultivate immortality

501
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,060
On this road

502
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,060
You will see many different scenery

503
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,060
It's true

504
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
But

505
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,060
It's so good that you can come back safe and sound

506
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,060
Good luck

507
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,060
Mo Lao

508
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:10,060
I seem to understand what you mean now

509
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,060
He used to call us uncle

510
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,060
Now he is a disciple of the master

511
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,060
But he also has our senior and senior

512
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,060
We are of a lower rank

513
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
I'd rather he called me senior

514
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,060
Uncle is the wife of the Yan family

515
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,060
Someone seems to be more intimate than us

516
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,060
Sitting together very close

517
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,060
Don't tell me you are jealous

518
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,060
Yes, I am jealous

519
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,060
Xun has nothing to do with you

520
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,060
I am jealous

521
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,060
I am jealous

522
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,060
I am jealous

523
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,060
Xun has nothing to do with you

524
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,060
Why?

525
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,060
Han Li

526
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,060
I heard that the master appointed you as his disciple

527
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,060
Then we will be brothers from now on

528
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,060
Junior

529
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,060
I am going to ask you for a leave

530
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,060
Junior

531
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,060
I heard that you have worked hard in the snow

532
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,060
You should have a good rest

533
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,060
You should practice hard

534
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,060
Don't embarrass the master

535
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,060
I am going to ask you for a leave

536
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
Junior

537
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,060
I am going to ask you for a leave

538
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,060
Junior

539
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,060
I am going to ask you for a leave

540
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Junior

541
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,060
I am going to ask you for a leave

542
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,060
Junior

543
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,060
I am going to ask you for a leave

544
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
Junior

545
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,060
I am going to ask you for a leave

546
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,060
Junior

547
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,060
I am going to ask you for a leave

548
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,060
Junior

549
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,060
I am going to ask you for a leave

550
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,060
Junior

551
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,060
I am going to ask you for a leave

552
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
Junior

553
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,060
I am going to ask you for a leave

554
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,060
Junior

555
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,060
My name is Han Li

556
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,060
I am history

557
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,060
I am fed up

558
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,060
I don't know when I can get my islands back

559
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
I am Han Li

560
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,980
My name is Han Li.

561
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,660
What's your name?

562
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,580
Can I know your name?

563
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,460
My name is Han Li.

564
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,580
Li Bei's Li.

565
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,300
So annoying.

566
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,780
The first thing to do when leaving the Pass is to kill you.

567
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,460
Then I'll make you a cup.

568
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:23,860
The first thing they do when leaving the Pass is to kill you.

569
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,100
Since one palm Valentin is not safe,

570
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,300
I'm going to hunt 10 or 20.

571
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,260
I'll wait until the grass is mature.

572
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,460
I'll have to get to the 13th floor as soon as possible.

573
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,060
The 13th Floor

574
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,460
My feet haven't been on the ground yet.

575
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,260
Why is the shower already set up?

576
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,660
Wugong, aren't you waiting for me to unwind you?

577
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,060
Don't pull the poison.

578
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,660
How can he still be so fond of me?

579
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,060
I'm begging you.

580
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:09,060
Big Bro, you're here. You really know how to be brave.

581
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,860
You came just in time. The ceremony has just begun.

582
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,260
Whose wedding night is this?

583
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,660
Of course, it's me and you.

584
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,060
We're in the first battle of Jiang State.

585
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,460
We've captured Jiang State.

586
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,660
We can only wait for the day to conquer Qi State.

587
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,260
Next, it's Yue State.

588
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,460
Wugong, Yue State is mine.

589
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,660
Yue State is mine.

590
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,660
It's not just a place that's blood-red.

591
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,260
I killed a few disciples who were practicing.

592
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,060
I'll make you so angry.

593
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,860
You have 50,000 elite soldiers.

594
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,460
I'm so tired that I only won one battle.

595
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,260
I'm back to eat some food.

596
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,060
So, in terms of appearance,

597
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,460
I can't beat him.

598
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,260
Big Bro, don't be angry.

599
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,860
There's no evil intention here.

600
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,260
Then, I'll just die.

601
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,060
Oh, right.

602
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,860
You've been running around Yan's house lately.

603
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,460
No wonder you can't let go of Yue State.

604
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,260
Could it be that you like their daughter

605
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,860
and want to go to Dao Cha Gate and be a foster daughter-in-law?

606
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,660
How did she know about Yan's family?

607
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,060
Don't be angry.

608
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,460
She can cross the land in the name of Yan.

609
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,860
We can do it.

610
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,660
We can even get the silver.

611
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,060
Then, let's just die.

612
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,060
Okay.

613
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,660
I understand.

614
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,460
But I have my reasons for doing this.

615
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,460
Can I think about it myself?

616
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,660
Just remember to close your mouth and eyes.

617
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,660
I'll close my eyes.

618
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,460
I'll close my eyes.

619
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,260
And your official words,

620
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,660
can you be a little more careful?

621
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,060
Take you to Yan's family.

622
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,460
You stay here. I'll close my eyes.

623
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,660
You stay here. I'll close my eyes.

624
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,860
What are you doing?

625
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,360
Women should both be filthy like water.

626
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,860
I cannot change my manners to do nothing.

627
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,860
Please understand.

628
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:35,060
Purple flowers, you are finally piting them.

629
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,660
There are also the single-pointed bullets.

630
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,660
With these, it's enough to train more than ten bullets.

631
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,660
We've finally reached the thirteenth level.

632
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,660
We only need the bullets.

633
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,660
The first level is the most difficult.

634
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,660
It's the most difficult.

635
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,660
