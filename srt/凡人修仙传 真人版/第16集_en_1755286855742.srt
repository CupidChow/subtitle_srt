1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,480
♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,160
♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,160
♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,545
♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫

5
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:36,160
♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,000
♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,974
♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫

8
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:46,520
♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,000
♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,135
♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫

11
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,289
♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫

12
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,604
♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫

13
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,280
♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,960
♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,780
♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,100
♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,240
♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,096
♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,960
♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,580
♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,130
You've exceeded your permission!

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,670
I came to bring Yan some medicine.

23
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,480
It is a secret concoction from my sect,

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,030
capable of preserving one's power
for a brief moment.

25
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,450
Would you like to try it, Lord Yan?

26
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,040
I was told you kept staring at a woman

27
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,820
from Yellow Maple Valley in the city.

28
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,150
You're mistaken.

29
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,680
I already have Yan.

30
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,350
I don't need another woman.

31
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,590
But I have need of that woman
from Yellow Maple Valley,

32
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,400
so I need to scour more information.

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,280
Worry not.

34
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,820
No one knows my identity.

35
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,040
In that case,

36
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,420
perhaps we can postpone the plan
against the common folks for the moment.

37
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,650
Lord Yan,

38
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,140
are you having a moment of compassion?

39
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,680
Impossible.

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,870
Those cultivators just arrived.

41
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,800
I don't want anything to happen to you

42
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,970
before the ceremony tomorrow.

43
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,910
All right then.

44
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,930
As you wish.

45
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,560
The plague is almost over.

46
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,300
- Make sure to take the medicine.
- Thanks, Miss Mo.

47
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,520
Here.

48
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,870
Thank you.

49
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,060
- Take this.
- Thanks.

50
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,190
Take the medicine on time.

51
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,300
Okay. Thank you.

52
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,060
Mister.

53
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,750
Miss Mo!

54
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,530
Miss Mo!

55
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,190
I have 20 gems here.

56
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,710
Like what you said previously,

57
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,460
I should have enough for two Moongazing Grass.

58
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,320
Unfortunately, Miss Mo,

59
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,080
many cultivators have arrived in this city.

60
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,470
Moongazing Grass has become a scarcity.

61
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,430
20 gems was the price from 3 months ago.

62
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,120
You know what?

63
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
I don't need the grass.

64
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,490
Can I buy some seeds from you?

65
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,800
That's a fool's errand.

66
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,870
The spiritual power is weak in the Lower City.

67
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,840
It's not conducive for cultivating herbs.

68
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,040
Miss Mo,

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,600
have you thought about moving to the upper level?

70
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
Thank you.

71
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,750
It's okay then.

72
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,310
Miss Mo. Hear me out.

73
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,372
Like I said, be my second wife

74
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:08,040
and you can have whatever herbs you want.

75
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,070
Miss Mo.

76
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,390
Miss Mo. Hear me out!

77
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,480
I am the biggest herb supplier in this stronghold.

78
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,720
You'll have a comfortable life,
even as my second wife!

79
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,070
Miss Mo. Listen to me.

80
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,090
A comfortable life awaits. Just come with me!

81
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,090
Li?

82
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,780
Miss Mo.

83
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,900
♫ The ripples disappear into the river ♫

84
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,360
♫ My robe is soaked under the drizzle ♫

85
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,650
Over here, Li.

86
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,380
♫ The current flows swiftly,
the mountains weigh heavily ♫

87
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,740
♫ The setting sun outlines the returning fleet ♫

88
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,300
♫ As I meander in the mortal world ♫

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,200
♫ The breeze brushes through the corridor ♫

90
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,920
♫ As the swallows whisper overhead ♫

91
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,800
♫ The setting sun graces the bamboo forest,
for whom do I harmonize? ♫

92
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,720
♫ Leaning against the rails,
water ripples below me ♫

93
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,600
♫ The wind whispers to the forest ♫

94
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,400
♫ I wander into the dream under the clear galaxy ♫

95
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,280
♫ This journey that spans across the universe ♫

96
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,305
♫ Feels both familiar and unfamiliar ♫

97
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:59,120
♫ Looking at the various faces of our world ♫

98
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,080
♫ Each word, each utterance ♫

99
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,080
♫ Carries the hopes of a lifetime ♫

100
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,954
♫ Let's make use of our present
to build a legacy ♫

101
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:13,935
♫ Reunion and departure, looking around... ♫

102
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:15,616
It's been many years.

103
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:18,746
And you are as reticent as ever, Miss Mo.

104
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,650
It's been a decade.

105
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,670
How have you been, Li?

106
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,270
♫ And the gentle drizzle... ♫

107
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,350
I'm doing great.

108
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,020
I didn't expect to run into you here.

109
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,180
How is your family?

110
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,820
They are gone.

111
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,650
Three years ago,

112
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,900
the Five-Color Sect found an affluent ally
and became powerful.

113
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,800
As you already know,

114
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,800
they have been trying to usurp my family's legacy.

115
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,010
My family was slaughtered in a night.

116
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,380
Only I survived.

117
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,280
To be frank, my family has expected that.

118
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,470
They just didn't know it would happen this soon.

119
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,350
And this brutally.

120
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,940
The Five-Color Sect.

121
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,800
What about Qu Hun?

122
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,500
Did he not protect you?

123
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,335
Several months before the tragedy,

124
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:45,085
he lost control and ran to the mountain.

125
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,500
I couldn't catch up to him.

126
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,750
It's fine,

127
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,090
Li.

128
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,330
It's history anyway.

129
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:13,810
I found my way here, and founded this apothecary.

130
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:20,240
Even though I'm all alone,
I'm content with my life.

131
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,240
The tea has gotten cold.

132
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,360
Li, drink this instead.

133
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,470
I just brewed it.

134
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,470
How did you cross that cultivator just now?

135
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,480
Li, no need to worry about me.

136
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,110
I can protect myself.

137
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,110
Okay.

138
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,520
Just let me know if you need my help.

139
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,900
Don't be shy.

140
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,120
I'm fine.

141
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,410
Li, stay here to rest up if you want.

142
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,900
I still need to retrieve some herbs.

143
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,230
Let me do it.

144
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,260
Take a break.

145
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,520
Let me do it.

146
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,020
I can carry it.

147
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,640
People roam here in haste.

148
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,720
No one has the time to look up.

149
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,330
To me, this is such a relief.

150
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,120
Now I understand
why Han Li wishes to avoid attention.

151
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,420
Solitude feels good.

152
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Why must I have the gift of enchantment?

153
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,840
A mortal can live freely.

154
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,360
Yet I always attract conflicts

155
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,810
even though I don't mean to hurt anyone.

156
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,600
I have no freedom.

157
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,120
I arrived here yesterday.

158
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,720
And I heard that there were
some mysteries in the Lower City.

159
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,520
Are you aware of them?

160
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Mysteries?

161
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,760
Like the sudden death of some commoners
or rookie cultivators.

162
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,930
I did hear that some people disappeared
under mysterious circumstances at night.

163
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,830
But no one has found their bodies.

164
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,290
Miss, it is a great evening tonight.

165
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,140
Why are you sulking alone?

166
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,570
Relax.

167
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,570
We are not bad guys.

168
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,120
We just hate to see a frown on your face.

169
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,990
Miss, try this.

170
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,470
It makes me feel happy?

171
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,330
Have you not heard of this saying?

172
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,500
Liquor can drown your sorrow away.

173
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,360
We're not trying to make you drunk.

174
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,450
We just don't want to see you sulk.

175
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,720
And I know you're not bad guys.

176
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,000
I just can't bring myself
to drink the moon in this cup.

177
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,510
You worry for naught.

178
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,410
The moon will appear in all things that flow.

179
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,900
Just as all things that flow
will reflect the moon.

180
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,540
So long as your cup is filled,

181
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,540
I... The moon will always be in your hands.

182
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,450
Well said.

183
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,690
Thank you.

184
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,360
It's beautiful. Cheers.

185
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,070
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

186
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,720
It burns.

187
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,600
That's it.

188
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,810
Again.

189
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,360
You can drink.

190
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,570
Okay. You can drink, miss.

191
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,880
You hold your cup.

192
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,140
Let me fill it.

193
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,300
Li, you must be a powerful cultivator now.

194
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,110
I only reached the Foundation Establishment Stage.

195
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,900
Well, just strong enough to protect myself.

196
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,360
Beautiful.

197
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,820
Look over there.

198
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,010
It's so beautiful.

199
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,240
So pretty.

200
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,830
Look there.

201
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,840
I am Dong Xuan Er of Yellow Maple Valley.

202
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,090
How may I address you?

203
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,210
I am Wu You Zi of Clear Void Sect.

204
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,600
I am Ba Chu Shui of Giant Sword Sect.

205
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,170
Are you here for the betrothal ceremony?

206
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,450
We're here to catch the bad guys.

207
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,170
But this doesn't matter.

208
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,760
Come. Drink up.

209
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,170
- Come.
- Yes, it doesn't matter.

210
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,070
- Come.
- Thank you.

211
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,680
Great!

212
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,150
There's more.

213
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,760
Wow!

214
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,620
Bravo.

215
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,255
I've never seen him this happy before.

216
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:52,365
He found a new girl this soon in a foreign place.

217
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,565
Let's go down and check it out.

218
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:59,650
Well, we shall take our leave.

219
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,760
We'll be admiring the fireworks.

220
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,040
Enjoy the drink.

221
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,970
Thank you.

222
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,630
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

223
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,520
♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream... ♫

224
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,700
Li, is it impossible to be a cultivator

225
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,037
without a spirit root?

226
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:43,110
♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫

227
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,040
♫ Old scenes rise again ♫

228
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:52,840
♫ Too hard to forget, easier just to miss ♫

229
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,560
♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫

230
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,600
♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫

231
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,178
♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫

232
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:12,640
♫ Swept away by time ♫

233
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,160
♫ Eyes once looked far now lost in the shift ♫

234
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,835
♫ Autumn winds stir, smoke curls once more ♫

235
00:20:25,835 --> 00:20:31,756
♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky
returning to my eyes ♫

236
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,360
♫ Looking back from the mountaintop,
time lost its name ♫

237
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,840
♫ Was it yesterday or tomorrow? ♫

238
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,640
♫ The world has changed beyond recall ♫

239
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,040
♫ Time will fade ♫

240
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,040
♫ All the words ever spoken ♫

241
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:03,420
♫ Only this longing remains ♫

242
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:09,640
♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫

243
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,332
♫ In a fleeting moment ♫

244
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:17,120
♫ we call eternity ♫

245
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,170
You there.

246
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,300
Come.

247
00:21:24,978 --> 00:21:27,970
You're hit by my enchantment.

248
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,970
Look at me. Look at me.

249
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,430
I am Dong Xuan Er of Yellow Maple Valley.

250
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,520
You are all enchanted.

251
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,480
Look at me. Look at me.

252
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,670
Oh, no. She's in danger.

253
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,320
Miss Mo, please go home first.

254
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,780
I still have things to do. I must go now.

255
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,320
Keep this.

256
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,610
If those cultivators give you trouble,

257
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,430
throw it at them.

258
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,850
These are the seeds of mystic herbs

259
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,610
and the pills good for mortals.

260
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,670
You can take them, or sell them after refining.

261
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,000
Don't sell them for too cheap.

262
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,470
They are good pills.

263
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,130
If anything, leave a message at the inn.

264
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,230
Will we meet again?

265
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,240
I'll see you off.

266
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,080
Go home.

267
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,390
Okay.

268
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,520
So beautiful.

269
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,130
My dear, just come with me.

270
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,850
I'll make you feel good.

271
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,410
I'm not your dear.

272
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,775
I'm Dong Xuan Er of Yellow Maple Valley.

273
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:35,650
I Know that.

274
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,890
You know me?

275
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,560
I know your father, mother,
grandmother, and grandfather.

276
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,000
All of them.

277
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,800
I can recite your family lineage.

278
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,040
Oh, I know now.

279
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,970
You're enchanted by me.

280
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,320
Yes.

281
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,260
I'm so enchanted by you.

282
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,320
Where does this guy come from?

283
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,560
Who are you?

284
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,690
Don't get in our way.

285
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,280
You want to play the hero?

286
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,780
Are you strong enough?

287
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,800
You want to play the hero?

288
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,850
Are you strong enough?

289
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,080
You two should fight.

290
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,890
I'll go with the winner.

291
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,000
Okay?

292
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,370
All right. Come on.

293
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,910
Fight.

294
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,750
Fight now. Fight.

295
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,890
What a weird technique.

296
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,240
Why won't he show his face?

297
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,470
Perhaps he doesn't want to draw attention.

298
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,950
Wow. That's amazing!

299
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,190
Who's there?

300
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,780
He fled.

301
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,930
You won.

302
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,390
I'll come with you!

303
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,760
You are all enchanted by me.

304
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,720
I am Dong Xuan Er of Yellow Maple Valley.

305
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,190
Can you resist my enchantment?

306
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,495
Oh, no.

307
00:25:51,495 --> 00:25:54,866
If my master and mentors see her like this,

308
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:56,947
they'll hold me accountable.

309
00:25:56,947 --> 00:25:58,687
I need to sort this out first.

310
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,540
Han, where am I?

311
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,720
Drink the medicine.

312
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,240
What medicine is this?

313
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,480
Stop staring at me.

314
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,580
Drink it.

315
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,320
Dong Xuan Er,

316
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,450
I told you to stop using your enchantment.

317
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,560
That man took advantage of you
and damaged your spirit.

318
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,670
You need a few days to fully recover.

319
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,450
We promised to stay out of each other's business.

320
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,020
Why are you following me?

321
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,170
Following you?

322
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,720
I'm following your kidnapper.

323
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,560
I've sensed his gaze on you
many times in the city.

324
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,720
He's following me?

325
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,860
Yes.

326
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,690
I have an ominous feeling.

327
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,930
Stay close to me tomorrow.

328
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,080
We'll go back as soon as the ceremony ends.

329
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,280
Obey my order for now.

330
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,480
Then, we stay out of each other's business.

331
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,450
This is not a negotiation.

332
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,100
Okay.

333
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,320
Where are you going, Han?

334
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,100
I mean, can you stay the night?

335
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,910
I will keep watch tonight.

336
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,230
I hope you won't tell my master
about what happened today.

337
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,040
I never intend to cross anyone.

338
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,190
Why is it my fault every time?

339
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,580
All right.

340
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,890
I know you don't mean to use your gift.

341
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:19,100
I won't tell anyone about today.

342
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,300
You promise?

343
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,630
I promise.

344
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,720
Han, I'm hungry.

345
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,130
Sleep.

346
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,410
But what about my tummy?

347
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,760
You don't feel hungry when you're asleep.

348
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,230
But I want to...

349
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,300
You're boring.

350
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,260
Han, is it cold over there?

351
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,000
Quit staring.

352
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,610
Where are you from?

353
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,890
I am Xuan Yue of Moonshadow Sect.

354
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,710
My sect has instructed me
to retrieve this month's gems.

355
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,320
Xuan.

356
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,750
Xuan.

357
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,760
They are our loyal patron.

358
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,100
No need to check. Go back to your work.

359
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,860
Follow me.

360
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,850
How come you're early, Xuan?

361
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,890
We're two days before the deadline.

362
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,580
My sect needs it urgently.

363
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,700
Can you

364
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:20,585
help us?

365
00:30:26,264 --> 00:30:27,760
Oh, come on.

366
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,200
We always reserve the best for your sect.

367
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,130
Enjoy your tea first.

368
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:47,598
My friend, what has happened to the quarry?

369
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:50,310
I see many new faces.

370
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,000
Young Lady is getting married.

371
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,130
So we station more people here
for better security.

372
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,667
The groom is so fortunate then.

373
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:03,570
He will own the entire quarry.

374
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,090
He got lucky.

375
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,310
Which sect does the groom hail from?

376
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,745
He is fortunate enough to marry
the daughter of Lord Yan.

377
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,915
I heard he's a foreign cultivator.

378
00:31:19,915 --> 00:31:21,655
A foreign cultivator?

379
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,790
From where?

380
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,704
What background?

381
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:28,503
Stop asking already.

382
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:29,544
This is for the higher-up.

383
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:30,785
We should just stay quiet.

384
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:32,565
Come. Have some tea.

385
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,595
The Mountain Barrier is hit?

386
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:42,926
Xuan, stay here.

387
00:31:42,926 --> 00:31:44,376
I'll be back soon.

388
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,720
Ouch. Easy.

389
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,310
Tell me now.

390
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:51,790
Why mobilize so many people
for the betrothal ceremony tomorrow?

391
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,000
Ouch.

392
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,240
Xuan. Stop asking.

393
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,330
For old time's sake, listen to me.

394
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,170
Run.

395
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,590
I might not be able to return here again.

396
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,890
I need to carry out my plan soon.

397
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,590
Grandmaster.

398
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,150
Yes?

399
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,480
The Jiang Kingdom
and The Cheqi Kingdom are no more.

400
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,040
The whole royalty was eradicated.

401
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,020
The Ghost Spirit Sect did it.

402
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,196
Inform all elders to meet at Yellow Maple Valley
for a discussion.

403
00:32:40,196 --> 00:32:44,984
And tell Xuan Yue
to report back about the Yue Kingdom's border.

404
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:46,390
Noted, Grandmaster.

405
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,740
Go now.

406
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,740
Is a war about to break out?

407
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,420
It's so crowded.

408
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,320
Han, Dong. Morning.

409
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,850
- Morning.
- Morning.

410
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,650
- Morning.
- Morning.

411
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,860
Did you two find anything last night?

412
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,240
Well... The fireworks were mesmerizing.

413
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,560
The liquor was intoxicating. Yes.

414
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,000
After the ceremony,
we'll return to what we came here for.

415
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,700
Exactly. Han, join us.

416
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,650
Sure. I'll join you.

417
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,850
- We do it together.
- We do it together.

418
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,720
Do what together?

419
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,060
It's a secret.

420
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,172
Listen. We can't...

421
00:33:41,172 --> 00:33:44,170
You said someone was following me last night.

422
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,080
Did you find him?

423
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,930
No.

424
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,520
But you must stay close to me.

425
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,780
Don't go anywhere.

426
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,890
Look, Han.

427
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:23,930
It's so festive in front.

428
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,670
Let's check it out.

429
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,720
How odd.

430
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,820
I sense something ominous.

431
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,435
It's majestic.

432
00:34:55,435 --> 00:34:57,195
The grandeur!

433
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,210
Let's stand in the front row.

434
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,500
Stay behind me.

435
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,890
Where is Lord Yan?

436
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:07,970
I know, right?

437
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,250
It's a betrothal ceremony.

438
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,030
None of the elders is here.

439
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,510
Yan Ru Yan looks weird.

440
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,510
He was the person from last night.

441
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,160
Him?

442
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,890
Why would Lord Yan pick someone like him
to be his son-in-law?

443
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,150
Hush.

444
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,640
There's something off about this ceremony.

445
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,970
Follow me.

446
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:54,550
Welcome to the betrothal ceremony
between Yan and me.

447
00:36:56,330 --> 00:37:00,670
The banquet begins now.

448
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,900
Wait.

449
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,590
My power is all gone.

450
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,770
Oh, no. My power has been suppressed.

451
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,000
The Wind Boat doesn't work here.

452
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,710
Han, my power has been suppressed.

453
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,180
My power has been suppressed too.

454
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,890
Run!

455
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,560
It's the Blood Spirit Spell
by the Ghost Spirit Sect.

456
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,260
Run! Run!

457
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,780
Yan and I received your gifts with thanks.

458
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,892
The so-called righteous seven sects

459
00:39:16,892 --> 00:39:21,780
pride themselves with their generosity.

460
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:27,000
Then surrender your power

461
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,230
to save the future heiress of the Yan Clan.

462
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,980
At this critical juncture,

463
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,970
forgive me.

464
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,190
There is...

465
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,460
No turning back for my clan.

466
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:41,480
Lord Yan, these people are not dead.

467
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,520
They merely turn into power
and are fused with Yan.

468
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,380
They should thank me

469
00:40:51,788 --> 00:40:54,358
for this honor.

470
00:40:57,741 --> 00:40:58,970
No.

471
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,150
They should thank you,

472
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,780
Lord Yan.

473
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,770
We made a Truedeath Oath.

474
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,230
If you fail to save Yan,

475
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,380
I will make you pay.

476
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,340
Yan is my wife.

477
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,820
I want her back more than you do.

478
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,640
Yan is still unconscious.

479
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,300
Despite all this power,

480
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,970
she does not wake up.

481
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:01,630
My wife sure has a big appetite.

482
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,850
Be patient.

483
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,330
A few escaped just now.

484
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:25,780
I'll chase after them and feed them to Yan.

485
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:08,280
♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫

486
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,190
♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫

487
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:17,630
♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫

488
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,160

♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫

492
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:40,840
♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫

493
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,280
♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫

494
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,720
♫ Swept away by time ♫

495
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,841
♫ Eyes once looked far ♫

496
00:43:49,841 --> 00:43:54,282
♫ Now lost in the shift ♫

497
00:43:54,282 --> 00:43:57,520
♫ Autumn winds stir ♫

498
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,960
♫ Smoke curls once more ♫

499
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,880
♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫

500

00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,510
♫ Time lost its name ♫

503
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,750

00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:20,880
♫ Or tomorrow? ♫

505
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,240
