The Soul Seeker

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,320
Episode 36

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,480
I can't do this anymore.

4
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,440
Lord Han.

5
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
A lot inside me prefer台固大.

6
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,520
I'm never shouting in the middle.

7
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,360
Then it was long ago.

8
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,980
Have you ever seen the

9
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,640
Dou body ofnan di which attains immortal lights?

10
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,160
nascent light잖아요 aright?

11
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,340
Do you mean the one in charge?

12
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
Anyone?

13
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,280
No.

14
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,180
Resign to the house.

15
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,320
That's right.

16
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,880
Well...

17
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,440
Safe and sound.

18
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,280
Open the door.

19
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,280
Yes.

20
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,240
Are you alone here?

21
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,140
Why do you look so bad?

22
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,420
No one can see it.

23
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,740
What is it?

24
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,700
Here.

25
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,740
Warm and Yang-Bao-Yu.

26
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,260
Take it to detoxify.

27
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,580
Warm and Yang-Bao-Yu?

28
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,180
How is that possible?

29
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,940
Don't worry.

30
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,300
This is the real Warm and Yang-Bao-Yu.

31
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,220
I won't harm you.

32
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,180
Warm and Yang-Bao-Yu.

33
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,620
Figure control.

34
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,220
1,2 Are youigg around the world?

35
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,220
Yeah.

36
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,820
Yeah.

37
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,180
Han Because he is células,

38
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,300
he is not fat?

39
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,740
Why is he so poisoned?

40
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,000
The

41
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The

42
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The

43
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The

44
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The

45
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The

46
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The

47
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The

48
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The

49
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Brother Han

50
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The

51
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The

52
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Brother Han, you are awake

53
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The

54
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Brother Han

55
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Look

56
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's really a warm-up

57
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I fell asleep just now

58
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes

59
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Come

60
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is the blood that I just put for your blood transfusion

61
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It was black in the beginning

62
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now it's normal blood color

63
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Otherwise, you can't wake up now

64
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let me

65
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Drink it

66
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
How did you get this jade?

67
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
How could they let you give it to me?

68
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Actually

69
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
My mother and sister are good people

70
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They were just bullied by the bad guys

71
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They were afraid

72
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
They wanted to keep you to protect us

73
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
They didn't have any bad intentions

74
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
They just didn't understand

75
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This Jiayuan City

76
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Even my father can't keep it

77
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
How can he keep you?

78
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Drink this first

79
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is Sanqisan

80
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This warm-up

81
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
is the dowry that my father left to me

82
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
My sisters also have their own dowry

83
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I told my mother

84
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I won't marry anyone

85
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So I don't need the dowry

86
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And this

87
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The jade pill

88
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You like medical books

89
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I learned it from my father's medical books

90
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Mo Lang is a good doctor

91
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a pity

92
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He doesn't want to be a doctor

93
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He just wants to be a fairy

94
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I didn't believe

95
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
that the warm-up jade

96
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
can be so powerful

97
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Me too

98
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Although your father poisoned me

99
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I still believe

100
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
that only the warm-up jade

101
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
can save me

102
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No

103
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What he said is not all right

104
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You saved me

105
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Give me the jade

106
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I mean

107
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Take it out and dry the sun

108
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
See if it can restore the snow white

109
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Ok

110
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What are you doing?

111
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I am going to the toilet

112
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You go first

113
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Ok

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I will go first

115
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Ok

116
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Ok

117
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ok

118
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Ok

119
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Ok

120
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Ok

121
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ok

122
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Ok

123
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Ok

124
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Ok

125
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You should keep it

126
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I have a favor to ask

127
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Tell me

128
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Who?

129
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No

130
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I want

131
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I want

132
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You take me away

133
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I am sorry

134
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I am sorry

135
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I am sorry

136
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I am sorry

137
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Ok

138
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Ok

139
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So

140
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You live in the Mo family

141
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You live in the Mo family

142
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If you are troubled

143
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
you can protect them

144
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
When I find a place

145
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
to rest

146
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I will come to pick you up

147
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Ok

148
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Ok

149
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Miss Mo

150
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I am leaving

151
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Xu Huan is my good brother

152
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
He is also your father's good apprentice

153
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I will leave his surname in the Mo family

154
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If someone is troubled

155
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I will be worried

156
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This bottle of elixir is for you

157
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Hanli Ju Gong

158
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The star is like a dream

159
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and the moon is like a dream

160
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I am lost

161
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
thousands of miles

162
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I am familiar

163
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
with the scenery

164
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
in this world

165
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I am thinking

166
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I am laughing

167
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and I am feeling

168
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Brother Han

169
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I am not convinced

170
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
of this world

171
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I am thinking

172
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I am thinking

173
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I am thinking

174
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I am thinking

175
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I am thinking

176
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I am thinking

177
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I am thinking

178
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I am thinking

179
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I am thinking

180
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I am thinking

181
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I am thinking

182
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I am thinking

183
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I am thinking

184
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I am thinking

185
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I am thinking

186
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I am thinking

187
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I am thinking

188
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I am thinking

189
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I am thinking

190
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I am thinking

191
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I am thinking

192
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I am thinking

193
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I am thinking

194
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I am thinking

195
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I am thinking

196
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I am thinking

197
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I am thinking

198
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I am thinking

199
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I am thinking

200
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I am thinking

201
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I am thinking

202
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I am thinking

203
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I am thinking

204
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I am thinking

205
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I am thinking

206
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Sister Lengzhu

207
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Waner

208
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's been 20 years

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You finally let go

210
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Senior

211
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,120
It's just a fight.

212
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,800
Luckily, the ancestor made a rule.

213
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,080
It's wise to stop interfering in the imperial court.

214
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,400
Yes.

215
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,200
Some people like to keep their life short.

216
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,880
If I give them more time,

217
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,400
I don't know what they will do.

218
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,080
You know everything.

219
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,800
Why do you still go down the mountain to deal with those things?

220
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,600
It's fine to be evil and evil.

221
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,400
You can't get rid of them.

222
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,800
Why don't you just focus on your cultivation

223
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,640
and ignore them?

224
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,080
You're so calm.

225
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,360
It's a pity that I'm cultivating the Soul-gathering Trial.

226
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,360
I'm just doing it for fun.

227
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,800
I have to do it.

228
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,640
I have to go down the mountain more often.

229
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,800
You won't listen to me.

230
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,520
The red dust is the most poisonous.

231
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,440
Be careful not to get it.

232
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,480
You can't get it.

233
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,240
Don't worry, Senior.

234
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,040
I'll go to the other six sects for a visit.

235
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,240
Then I'll go to see

236
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
if there's any evil cultivation or evil sects.

237
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,920
I'll be back soon.

238
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Don't forget to come to the next Immortal Conference.

239
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,120
It's our turn.

240
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,440
Don't worry, Senior.

241
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,200
The Cultivators

242
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
The Cultivators

243
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,720
The Cultivators

244
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,440
rarely appear in the world.

245
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,600
Where are they usually?

246
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,120
Are there really Cultivators in the valley of Tainan?

247
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,840
I also want to see

248
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,880
the scenery in their eyes.

249
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,840
The valley of Tainan, which is 100 miles south of Jiayuan City,

250
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,680
was conquered by clouds and fog in the Middle Ages.

251
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,320
The valley of Tainan on this map

252
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,160
should be here.

253
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,040
This is a good mountain.

254
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,200
How do you think of my life?

255
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,520
Hanli.

256
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,600
So you're Han Xiong.

257
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,560
I think you're not a businessman.

258
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,960
You must be thinking of

259
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,160
the mountain valley of Tainan.

260
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,080
No.

261
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,200
We can be partners.

262
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,680
Partners?

263
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,480
Are you lost?

264
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,000
I mean, Han Xiong,

265
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,520
don't look down on me.

266
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,360
Although I don't have much cultivation,

267
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,480
I've already figured out

268
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,960
the way to the valley of Tainan.

269
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,600
Okay.

270
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,880
Let's go together.

271
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,800
Your way.

272
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,960
Go.

273
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,680
What's the umbrella you just said?

274
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,640
Just like you and me.

275
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,760
We're not the disciples of the Seven Sects

276
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,640
of the Yanyue Sect.

277
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,680
We're not from the cultivating world

278
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
like the Yanjia Castle.

279
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
We always cultivate alone.

280
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,680
This is the umbrella.

281
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,360
This person seems to know

282
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,760
a lot of cultivation methods.

283
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,760
Maybe he can ask something.

284
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,800
Han Xiong.

285
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,840
Han Xiong.

286
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,440
Briefing people

287
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,680
that they've had a problem

288
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,640
around us

289
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,360
You almost look like

290
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,480
a cultivator.

291
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,320
This challenge

292
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,960
is like every ten years,

293
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,120
but it won't work.

294
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
It means the time has not come yet.

295
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,120
Here, have some examines.

296
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,080
Before I heard

297
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,920
that the immortal doesn't know about the valley,

298
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,440
The wind is blowing, eating the stone.

299
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,960
It doesn't seem real.

300
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,960
That is the True Immortal.

301
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,640
You and I can only call him the cultivator.

302
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,160
The True Immortal can be with the Heaven and Earth.

303
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,240
With the Heaven and Earth?

304
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,760
No wonder Doctor Mo is so determined to be the cultivator.

305
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,960
But with our current cultivation, we can live for a hundred years.

306
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,960
A hundred years is not too long.

307
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,160
It's open!

308
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,560
Brother Wan.

309
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,160
Brother Wan.

310
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,560
Come in!

311
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
Come, come, take a look.

312
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Han Bing, come and get to know us.

313
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,760
This is called the knife ice activity.

314
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,160
This is called the knife ice activity.

315
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,760
Come and take a look.

316
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Brother Wan, this is...

317
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,360
This is the Tainan small meeting.

318
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,560
The Tainan valley activity will last for three days.

319
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,760
We are in a good mood. We are about to start.

320
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,160
We are here.

321
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,760
Twenty yuan snacks.

322
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
Come and take a look.

323
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Here you are.

324
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Here you are.

325
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,560
Come, come, come.

326
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
A hundred years of the Tainan small meeting.

327
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,360
This is the most interesting activity.

328
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,760
Han Bing, come and take a look.

329
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,560
Look at my Han Bing.

330
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,760
Twenty yuan snacks.

331
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Come, come, come.

332
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,960
Do you want to take a look?

333
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,360
Come and take a look.

334
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,160
Little brother, little brother.

335
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,560
Come and take a look at our treasure.

336
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,160
High ice service.

337
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,360
High ice service only requires three snacks.

338
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
These are all common goods.

339
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
I'm useless.

340
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
This is common.

341
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Come and take a look.

342
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
Come and take a look.

343
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,560
Are these the friends who want to exchange snacks?

344
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,760
Besides,

345
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,160
it's not fair to marry me.

346
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,760
Snacks

347
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,360
are the common goods of the cultivation world.

348
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Let's go, brother Han.

349
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,760
This snack is known to be

350
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
a mineral that is full of spiritual energy.

351
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
Good snacks are transparent.

352
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
It can be used as a lighting instrument.

353
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,960
Although this snack is a little bit sharp,

354
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,160
it can be used to charge the energy of the law

355
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
or to repair the spiritual energy after using it as a weapon.

356
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,360
It's also possible.

357
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,320
It's also a

358
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
powder.

359
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
How many are there?

360
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,720
Master,

361
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
the seventh one.

362
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Master,

363
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
I found this nearby.

364
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Smoke?

365
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
Could it be a family treasure?

366
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
These disciples of the Shi family

367
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
are especially happy to bully powder.

368
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Enough.

369
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Let's go.

370
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Let's go.

371
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Let's go.

372
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Let's go.

373
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Let's go.

374
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Let's go.

375
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Let's go.

376
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Let's go.

377
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Let's go.

378
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,080
Don't be careless until you figure it out.

379
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Yes.

380
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
The barrier has been opened.

381
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Now there are a lot of

382
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Disciples and disciples of the Shi family in the valley.

383
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,080
Both sides have been willing for a long time.

384
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,080
Anything can happen.

385
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
Yu'er, Qing'er,

386
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
send more people to guard the valley.

387
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
Before the meeting of the holy incense is held,

388
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
there can be no more new incidents.

389
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Yes.

390
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,080
Miss, you have a good eye.

391
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
The green gem on this table

392
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,080
is made of the eyes of the second-grade hands.

393
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
It's a little more expensive.

394
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Five hundred taels.

395
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Five hundred?

396
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Why don't you go grab it?

397
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
Do you know?

398
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,080
Enough.

399
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Don't take it too seriously.

400
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
My father will definitely like it.

401
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Miss,

402
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,080
this...

403
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Take it.

404
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
Thank you, miss.

405
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Thank you, miss.

406
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
And...

407
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Why is it so cold in here?

408
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,440
Stop!

409
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
They killed Liu Daoyou!

410
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Nonsense!

411
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
Where are you going?

412
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
The Ji Xiu Shi was actually a bodyguard for him.

413
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
What is this girl doing here?

414
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Senior Fu,

415
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
who told you to come?

416
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Miss Luo Yan, please calm down.

417
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Your safety is the most important thing.

418
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Please keep your orders.

419
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
You must be safe.

420
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
She's Yan Ru Yan.

421
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Yan Ru Yan?

422
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Is this Yan family very famous?

423
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Of course.

424
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
The Yan family is the most famous

425
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
and top-notch bodyguard in Yue.

426
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
The one who took care of Yan Yunshan

427
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
is this girl's father.

428
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
That's a rare bodyguard.

429
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Brother Wan, you really have a lot of experience.

430
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
I admire you.

431
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
He really knows a lot.

432
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
I have to listen to him.

433
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Let me tell you.

434
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
In the whole of Yue,

435
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
there's no one like me who doesn't know about this.

436
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
If you want to know anything, just ask.

437
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Thank you, brother Wan.

438
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Let me teach you a little trick.

439
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Little trick?

440
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
The Seven Sects have orders.

441
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Whoever makes trouble,

442
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,160
will be expelled from the mountain valley in Tainan

443
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
and be expelled from the Hezu River.

444
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
You are the first ones to be expelled.

445
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,160
You can't make any mistake.

446
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Leave now.

447
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
The one she's holding,

448
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
is the right hand of the Seven Sects

449
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
of the Yanyue Sect.

450
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
Miss Ru Yan,

451
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
the grandmaster of the South Palace has a favor to ask.

452
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
What does this mean?

453
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Did you become a few scattered sects

454
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
and you want to make it difficult for the Yanyue Sect?

455
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
You are being rude.

456
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
You can leave now. I'll be right back.

457
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Let's go.

458
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
What day is it today?

459
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
You are a bodyguard for the Ji Xiu Sect.

460
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
You even saw the back of the Ji Xiu Sect.

461
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
This is called

462
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
a mountain is higher than a mountain.

463
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,520
Let me tell you, Brother Han,

464
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
in the future, if you see someone like this,

465
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
you will be the one who will run away.

466
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Run?

467
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
Let's go. I'll take you to continue walking.

468
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
This journey is really hard for you, Brother Xiaoshan.

469
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
You are welcome.

470
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
The world is full of brothers.

471
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
Brother Han, what else...

472
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
Are you okay?

473
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
I'm fine. Thank you.

474
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Watch the road.

475
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
This Taoist friend is really good at it.

476
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,880
But

477
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,880
we should return the pouch to that Taoist friend.

478
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
Didn't you promise us that you won't steal anymore?

479
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,880
Brother Xiaoshan,

480
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
it seems that this cultivating fairy is a thief again.

481
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,240
She stole your money.

482
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,240
I'll get you some interest.

483
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,240
You...

484
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,240
I just want to come in and play.

485
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
It's not that I won't return it.

486
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
Give it to me.

487
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Give it to me.

488
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
She won't return it.

489
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,240
You two,

490
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,240
let's see if there are any treasure losses.

491
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Yes. This happened at the Qingwen Society.

492
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
Our Taoist friend

493
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
will not sit and watch.

494
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
You are from the Qingwen Society?

495
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
I'm Pa Hao Qingwen. This is my Taoist friend, Hu Pinggu.

496
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Since you know about the Qingwen Society,

497
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
then give us two a chance.

498
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Don't bother with that brother Sanxiu.

499
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
You guys from the last group

500
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
didn't arrange it well, right?

501
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Brother Han,

502
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
this Taoist Qingwen is very strong.

503
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
He has a good reputation in our Sanxiu.

504
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Since we didn't lose anything,

505
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
then let's forget about it.

506
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
It's okay. Let's go, Han Xing.

507
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
Give me the money.

508
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,960
Thank you.

509
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,960
You two,

510
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Wu Jiuzhi is playful, but he is not mean.

511
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
If you have any trouble,

512
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
I'm willing to apologize for him.

513
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Yes.

514
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
If they are not men,

515
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,960
they must be good people.

516
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
You're welcome, Taoist.

517
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
This is my brother, Han Li.

518
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
He exposed my name?

519
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
You two are here

520
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
to participate in the selection, right?

521
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Our Qingwen Society has a place nearby.

522
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
We are preparing to

523
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
discuss the selection with those Sanxiu.

524
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
If you are interested,

525
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
why don't you come?

526
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
Okay.

527
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
Master,

528
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Miss Ru Yan from Yanjia Bao is here.

529
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
Yanjia Bao, Yan Ru Yan,

530
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
greets Master Nangong.

531
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
I heard you came to Tainan

532
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
with many guards.

533
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
Master Nangong,

534
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
I don't know what other families are like.

535
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
But I can guarantee that

536
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
since I entered Tainan,

537
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
my guards have been protecting me all the time.

538
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
The disappearance of Sanxiu

539
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
has nothing to do with Yanjia Bao.

540
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
Your information is clear.

541
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
But how do you explain this?

542
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
I found this near a dead body

543
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
of a Sanxiu.

544
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Master,

545
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
my maid was stolen

546
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
from Tainan.

547
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
Someone was behind this.

548
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
Which sect did you join?

549
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Grandfather mentioned Lin Shoushan many times.

550
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
But I prefer the Yanyue Sect.

551
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
You have a better taste than your grandfather.

552
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Alright, go back.

553
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
Prepare for tomorrow's meeting.

554
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,680
Master,

555
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,680
the Sanxiu's impulsive behavior

556
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,680
was clearly used by someone else.

557
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,680
But I rarely interact with people.

558
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,680
Do you know

559
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
who wants to frame us?

560
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
In my opinion,

561
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
their goal is not only Yanjia Bao.

562
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,680
Your every word and action

563
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,680
are not only for Yanjia Bao.

564
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
You are also

565
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
for your family.

566
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Someone is trying to

567
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
frame the family

568
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
and the conflict between Sanxiu.

569
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
I'll leave now.

570
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Grandmaster,

571
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,040
you are so smart.

572
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
You can't be

573
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
robbed by Lin Shoushan.

574
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
This is the gathering place

575
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
of our Qingwen Society.

576
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
Come to our place.

577
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
The Sanxiu's family is the same.

578
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Welcome.

579
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Welcome.

580
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Welcome.

581
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Welcome.

582
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Welcome.

583
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Is this the map of Yue?

584
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,760
Yes.

585
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,760
This is the place of Yanjia Bao.

586
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
It's interesting.

587
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
You can find the seven sects

588
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,760
on it.

589
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
This is the Yanjia Sect.

590
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
This is the Huadao Sect.

591
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,760
This is the Tianjia Sect.

592
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
This is the Huangfeng Sect.

593
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,760
These seven sects

594
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,760
are called the seven sects.

595
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,760
They were left after the war

596
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,760
a thousand years ago.

597
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,760
What about Yanjia Bao's place?

598
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Sanxiu.

599
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Not only on the map,

600
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,120
I'm afraid that Yue

601
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,120
will lose its place.

602
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Okay, Qingwen.

603
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
You are here to discuss the seven sects.

604
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Why are you here?

605
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
Sorry.

606
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,120
Recently, there are many missing brothers.

607
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
There are many people who are missing.

608
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Qingwen.

609
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
What do you mean?

610
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
You are here to talk about it.

611
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,480
You are the cultivators.

612
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
Why is it that some people

613
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,480
can get all the cultivation resources

614
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
when they are born?

615
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,480
We just want to make a base.

616
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
We have to pay with our lives.

617
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Base?

618
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
What is a base?

619
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
You must know this.

620
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,480
A base is to help the cultivators

621
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,480
to break through the training period

622
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
and enter a higher level of base.

623
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Training period?

624
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Which period am I in?

625
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
This is the training period.

626
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
The ones who just started to cultivate are all training period.

627
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
What about then?

628
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
And then, let me tell you.

629
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
This cultivating period

630
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
is divided into three levels,

631
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
upper, middle and lower.

632
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840
The lower level is divided into

633
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
training period, base, base,

634
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
base, base, and five levels.

635
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
The middle level is divided into

636
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
training, core, and three levels.

637
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
In the upper level,

638
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
there is only the level of passing the barrier.

639
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
After passing this level,

640
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
you can fly to the heaven and live with the heaven.

641
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
But it is just a legend.

642
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
No one has seen

643
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
the level above the base.

644
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
This base

645
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
is not easy to get, right?

646
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,200
It's not just hard to get.

647
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
This base

648
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
determines the fate of a cultivator.

649
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
It's more about

650
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
the future of the sect.

651
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
So,

652
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
these plantar pills

653
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,560
were all sold by the sect and the cultivator's family.

654
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
They were all in their hands.

655
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
Until

656
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,560
the life-sacrifice selection was made.

657
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
Let me tell you something.

658
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
The life-sacrifice selection

659
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
was supposed to

660
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
compete for the reputation of the sect.

661
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,560
But in fact, it was all for the plantar pills.

662
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,560
500 years ago,

663
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
a senior cultivator

664
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
gathered thousands of cultivators

665
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
to compete for the reputation

666
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,920
of the sect.

667
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,920
But they were all against it.

668
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
But in fact,

669
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,920
the cultivation of the plantar pills

670
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
was not fair

671
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
compared with the cultivation of the plantar pills

672
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,920
that we have been using since we were young.

673
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Yes, it was fair.

674
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
They are all in their hands.

675
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
No wonder they have such a big interest

676
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,920
in the cultivation of the plantar pills.

677
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,920
How is the cultivation of the plantar pills?

678
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
Several people have been sent

679
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
to monitor the core members.

680
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
The leader is called Qingwen.

681
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Although he only practices 11 levels of qi,

682
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
he has a good mouth and a good kung fu.

683
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
There are many followers

684
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
in the cultivation of the plantar pills.

685
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Keep an eye on them.

686
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Report to me if there is any trouble.

687
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
Yes.

688
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
Everyone,

689
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,280
there are two tests that the sect has set for us.

690
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
The first one is the test of tomorrow's spiritual root.

691
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
The second one is the

692
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Tianwu Tai's life-sacrifice selection competition the day after tomorrow.

693
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,640
Tianwu Tai has been in the competition for nine lives.

694
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
So, we must

695
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
get the quota when we test the spiritual root.

696
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
The spiritual root

697
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,640
is divided into five types of gold, wood, water, fire, earth.

698
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,640
Five types of material.

699
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,640
Everyone knows it, right?

700
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,640
We know it. We can't practice it.

701
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,640
The more spiritual roots, the worse the cultivation.

702
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
There are four or five types of spiritual root cultivation.

703
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
Even if it can

704
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,640
affect the spiritual energy in the world,

705
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
it can only

706
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
practice three levels of qi for a lifetime.

707
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
This kind of spiritual root is called the tail spiritual root.

708
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Tail spiritual root?

709
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
There are two or three types of spiritual root.

710
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's called

711
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
the real spiritual root.

712
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Priest, what if it's a single spiritual root?

713
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
That's the eternal spiritual root.

714
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Such cultivation

715
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
is absolutely the favorite of heaven.

716
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
The speed of cultivation is definitely against heaven.

717
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So, the cultivation of the immortal is so related to the Tianwu.

718
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Then, I am the real spiritual root.

719
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I can only practice the real spiritual root.

720
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I can only practice the real spiritual root.

721
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,360
Then, am I the real spiritual root or the tail spiritual root?

722
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,360
Dr. Mo didn't say it either.

723
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,360
I hope I am the eternal spiritual root.

724
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,360
By testing the spiritual root,

725
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
the number of people who enter the seven sects is limited.

726
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Those Shi family's children

727
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
are eager to practice our cultivation.

728
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,360
They have us out of the seven sects

729
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
to stop us from cultivating immortality.

730
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
It seems that the cultivation of immortality

731
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
is also respected by strength.

732
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
One to thirteen layers

733
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
is the full version of Zhang Chongge.

734
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Buy one.

735
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
How much?

736
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,720
Nine yuan for a room.

737
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
Nine yuan for a room? That's too much.

738
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,720
I don't want to buy it.

739
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
I don't want to buy it.

740
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
Ten layers of cultivation?

741
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
You know I'm good, right?

742
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
You don't want to buy the spirit of the Buddha?

743
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,080
Little girl,

744
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,080
I do want this martial art.

745
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,080
But nine yuan is too much.

746
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Can you give me a discount?

747
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
How much do you want?

748
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Two yuan?

749
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Big brother, second brother,

750
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
third sister, fourth brother,

751
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
come quickly.

752
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
Why didn't you come?

753
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
I'm here.

754
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,080
You're not giving me a discount

755
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
even if you steal my martial arts.

756
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
I'll buy nine yuan. He'll only give me two yuan.

757
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
What kind of fighting logic is this?

758
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
How do you know?

759
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,080
How do you know we've done fighting before?

760
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,080
How do you know?

761
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
I've known for many years.

762
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
How do you know?

763
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
You say you know.

764
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Everyone,

765
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,080
what I mean by two is

766
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
how about this martial art?

767
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Give me the book.

768
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,440
Stop! Don't move!

769
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
I'll give you all the money.

770
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
What else do you want?

771
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
You're so...

772
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
You should hide.

773
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
Right.

774
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
I'll give you the dog.

775
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
This is the first generation of the teacher.

776
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
I'll give it to you.

777
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,440
I'll give it to you.

778
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,440
You're so brave.

779
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,440
I'll give it to you.

780
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
You're so brave.

781
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
You're so brave.

782
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Goodbye.

783
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
I won't give it to you.

784
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
It seems that this pill is better than the spiritual teacher.

785
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Luckily, I brought more when I left the valley.

786
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Now,

787
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
I have someone I can't wait to see.

788
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
I don't need to bring a bunch of small things anymore.

789
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Your magic treasure is not a piece of high-grade snacks.

790
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
Sell it to me.

791
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
No.

792
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
It's a magic treasure that can be repaired by the bill.

793
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
After a long time,

794
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
what's the use of your magic treasure?

795
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
I have it.

796
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Look.

797
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Using this magic treasure to hide my little green screen is not bad.

798
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,800
So, the magic treasure is in your hand.

799
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,160
But your magic treasure is too small.

800
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
How about this?

801
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Since you're a good person,

802
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
I'll give you a pill that can be repaired by the bill.

803
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
Lu Shao, you're taking advantage of me.

804
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,160
I'll give you six snacks.

805
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
How much will you sell it to me?

806
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
I'll give you seven.

807
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
Eight.

808
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,160
Okay, eight snacks.

809
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,160
I'm sorry.

810
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,160
I was just kidding.

811
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
I was just kidding with him.

812
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,520
Besides, you can't afford to be a loser.

813
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,520
Miss, don't go.

814
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,520
I'll take it if they don't want it.

815
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,520
One.

816
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,520
I'll give you one.

817
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,520
I'll give you seven.

818
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
Do you want to give it to others?

819
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
I don't think

820
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
there will be any more people asking for a price.

821
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
Is there any more?

822
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
Two bottles of gold water pills

823
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
for the magic treasure.

824
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,880
You're not a loser, are you?

825
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,880
Deal.

826
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,240
Deal.

827
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,240
What do you mean?

828
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,240
You ruined my deal.

829
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,240
You want to leave?

830
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
But

831
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,240
I bought the right thing at a reasonable price.

832
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,240
This is a normal fair deal.

833
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,240
Okay, I'll show you.

834
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,600
What is fair?

835
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,240
I'll give you seven.

836
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,240
I'll give you seven.

837
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,240
I'll give you seven.

838
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,240
I'll give you seven.

839
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,240
I'll give you seven.

840
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,240
I'll give you seven.

841
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,240
I'll give you seven.

842
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,240
I'll give you seven.

843
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
I'll give you seven.

844
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
