Welcome to Jiayan City, sir.

00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,000
This way, please.

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,400
No need.

6
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,000
This is my shop.

7
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,800
You stole my Duba Shenzhou's business.

8
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,600
You don't want to live anymore?

9
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,000
Hurry.

10
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,000
You dare to blackmail me?

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll kill you.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
Sir, sir, sir.

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,600
Welcome to Jiayan City.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,800
We have a small shop here.

15
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,000
The food of our small shop

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,800
is very delicious.

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Have a drink of this big hotpot.

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
That's comfortable.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,400
Come on.

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,200

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,800
Please.

22
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Please.

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,800

26
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Please.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,800
Please.

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,000

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Come on.

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,200
Sir, please try it.

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,200
The tea of our shop

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,600
is very delicious.

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,200
I want to ask you something.

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
You are the one who asked me to come here.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In Jiayan City,

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
there is nothing that I don't know.

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,400
What do you want to ask?

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,200
Mo Churen.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Mo Churen. Mo Daizi.

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,200
We know everything about his shop.

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,000
We are from the same village.

42
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,400
We don't know anything.

43
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,720
There is aiğ great things

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,200
coming to Mo Churen Eight?

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,000
What things?

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm telling you.

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,720
The disciple of the closed door.

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,440
Who?

49
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,120
Wu Jianing.

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't make a sound.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,520
Move aside.

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,240
Move aside.

53
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,040
Don't make a sound.

54
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,600
You're really a dog.

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,040
My son can't hear you.

56
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,760
Move aside.

57
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
It's him.

58
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,560
Don't block me.

59
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,440
He's not a cheap man.

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,480
He was caught in a trap

61
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,800
and was expelled from the Five-Sides School.

62
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,520
Don't block me.

63
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,800
He claimed to be the disciple of Mo.

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,360
He was engaged to the daughter of Mo

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,720
and was to be married the day after tomorrow.

66
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,880
The Mo family has a huge business.

67
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,840
He's going to take over it.

68
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,360
So,

69
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,520
the warm and healthy jade of the解毒

70
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,920
is going to be added to the daughter?

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,040
What's wrong with you?

72
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,080
Why are you sweating so much?

73
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,160
Are you having a cold?

74
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,920
Waiter.

75
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,000
Bring me a bowl of mung bean soup.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,520
Hurry.

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,560
Do you have a guest room?

78
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,520
Yes.

79
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,680
Find me a room first

80
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,960
and arrange for my brother to stay.

81
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,840
Okay.

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,360
Don't worry.

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,880
Okay.

84
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
You're a good boy.

85
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,560
The demon shadow is getting more and more vicious.

86
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,240
I have to get the jade before the lady gets married.

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,560
I have to get the jade before the lady gets married.

88
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,120
I have to get the jade before the lady gets married.

89
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,040
Otherwise, the warm and healthy jade

90
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,040
will be destroyed by the demon.

91
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,640
You stay here.

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,320
Don't move unless you hear the bell.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,440
The secret of Changping Town

94
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,040
is that I sent 7300 taels of silver.

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,840
The secret of Luo Valley

96
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,440
is that I sent 5800 taels of silver.

97
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,680
The secret of An Duo is getting more and more vicious.

98
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,120
The silver sent this year

99
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,960
is one quarter less than last year.

100
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,480
What's this?

101
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,720
This is a ring of the world.

102
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,840
Don't touch it.

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,840
I'm not a thief.

104
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,240
No one may find out the truth.

105
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,520
Who are you and why do you wander here?

106
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,120
It's completely true.

107
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:21,920
Young Master

108
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,760
Okay.

109
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,120
Come with us to the hall.

110
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,640
You hand the letter to mother.

111
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,320
Okay.

112
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,880
The

113
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,280
Be careful.

114
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
Master has been away for so long.

115
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,360
He finally remembers us.

116
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,160
One.

117
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,640
Really?

118
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,440
Finally,

119
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
today we have such a little news about him.

120
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,160
Two.

121
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,320
What kind of half-brother is he?

122
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,680
Three.

123
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,560
What does he look like?

124
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,360
Four.

125
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,040
Oh my god.

126
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,080
Five and six.

127
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Why are there so many people?

128
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,280
Be careful.

129
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay.

130
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,440
We just have to take a look.

131
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
You're the new apprentice.

132
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,680
He's much better now than that fake Whom Registrant.

133
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
Why haven't I heard of him before?

134
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,120
This new apprentice

135
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,100
is okay indeed.

136
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,300
This is my mother, Mo Li.

137
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,420
Third mother, Mo Liu.

138
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,020
Fourth mother, Mo Yan.

139
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,940
Fifth mother, Mo Wang.

140
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,220
Han Li.

141
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,700
Greetings, maids.

142
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,380
Han Li.

143
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,380
Big sister, Yuzhu.

144
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,620
I'm Feng Wu.

145
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,220
This is my sister, Cai Huan.

146
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,380
Greetings, third sister.

147
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,060
It turns out she's not a maid.

148
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,620
Kid.

149
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,180
Did the dead ghost say when it will come back?

150
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Third mother.

151
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,900
What master wants to say is written in the letter.

152
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,340
Letter?

153
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,980
Where's the letter?

154
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,780
No wife, no daughter, the sword is like a face.

155
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,860
I'm in a bad situation,

156
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,580
I can't go home in a short period of time.

157
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,380
The person who sent the letter

158
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,180
is my disciple, Han Li.

159
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,580
He's a reliable kid

160
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,580
with a weak heart.

161
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,380
If anything happens to Mo's family,

162
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,780
you can leave it to him to solve it.

163
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,380
If he can keep Mo's family safe,

164
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,580
he can get out of Yuzhu

165
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,380
and go to the capital.

166
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,380
If Feng Wu and Cai Huan are together,

167
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,780
they will be married.

168
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,380
As for the family,

169
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:44,180
just use the warm

170
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,900
Now we only spend 30 days

171
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,580
in the village.

172
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,780
If we are always lonely,

173
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,180
then

174
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,580
we should make time for a good time.

175
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,180
This is different from the time last time.

176
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,700
Think about it,

177
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,380
It'll take a few days

178
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,180
for us to travel to Yuzhu to...

179
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,580
Master has a stomachache in his province.

180
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,940
to stay in the mansion first.

181
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,260
As for other things,

182
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
we'll talk about it tomorrow.

183
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,340
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

184
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,460
Yuzhu, Feng Wu, Cai Huan.

185
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,140
Hurry up.

186
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,780
Send Mr. Han to the west room to rest.

187
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,980
Please.

188
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,740
Early summer

189
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:57,620
They sent me away in a hurry.

190
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,740
Remember what he said

191
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,500
to us when he left, don't you?

192
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,460
If somebody burns some jewels

193
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,060
it's separete.

194
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,540
It must be bad news

195
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,380
if the letters left are burnt,

196
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,660
it's maybe stories.

197
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
Let the secret letter be a danger.

198
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,700
Secret letter?

199
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,540
The old devil is really in a hurry.

200
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,900
I told you not to make a fuss.

201
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,180
Mother seems to be quite satisfied.

202
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,940
What's wrong?

203
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,380
A basin of water?

204
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,220
Why do you take water?

205
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Why is there no sound?

206
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,420
Brother Tan.

207
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,100
Mr. Yi said,

208
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
what do you think of my sister?

209
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,740
What do you mean?

210
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,100
My father said before

211
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,220
that he would give us a

212
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,780
future disciple to marry him.

213
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,940
You are all very respected.

214
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,140
What Master said is just a joke.

215
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,420
It's not true.

216
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,540
You don't have to take it seriously.

217
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,380
Please promote the inner palace.

218
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,820
Inner palace?

219
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,180
The letter shows that I have no more acquaintance.

220
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,780
The killer is...

221
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,220
Hey, my father can't...

222
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,980
Is it over?

223
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,660
Damn it.

224
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,540
What did the letter say?

225
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,060
Mr. Tan, actually you came just in time.

226
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,020
So annoying.

227
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,540
I can't hear anything.

228
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,780
The person can marry you.

229
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,780
It's him.

230
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,100
Look at the old devil.

231
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
He is so annoying.

232
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
He is so annoying.

233
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
He is so annoying.

234
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,100
He is so annoying.

235
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
He is so annoying.

236
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
He is so annoying.

237
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
He is so annoying.

238
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
He is so annoying.

239
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Look at his attitude.

240
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,500
He can't be so arrogant.

241
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,140
You can't underestimate

242
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,140
those people who hide from you.

243
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,820
What are they talking about?

244
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,780
So we can't just let it go.

245
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,820
We have to make it clear.

246
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,020
We can't let him off.

247
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,700
What should we do?

248
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,820
Killing is nothing more than just a few moves.

249
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,860
That Poisoned Pearl

250
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,260
was left to me by Master before he left.

251
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,380
After we've raised it for so many years,

252
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,820
we should let him come out and look for it.

253
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,940
There's a secret recipe I got.

254
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,100
Master said it's a key item.

255
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,100
I'll make the medicine tonight.

256
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,180
Fourth Sister, hurry up and make the medicine.

257
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,580
Put it on my jade phoenix needle.

258
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,900
Before we start,

259
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,580
you can put my soul-soul incense in first.

260
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,700
Also, although Father said you could choose,

261
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,300
you can only marry me first.

262
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,220
Because my sister is the eldest.

263
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,300
I can't hear you clearly.

264
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,180
The Mohist School is all their fault.

265
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,580
I can't marry her.

266
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,780
Does the Eldest Miss have a warm bath?

267
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,460
Don't worry.

268
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,780
Since Mother said so,

269
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,500
the young men will definitely arrange it well.

270
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,540
No.

271
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,180
I mean,

272
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,580
are you a greedy person?

273
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,500
My sister is so beautiful,

274
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,180
but you can't see her.

275
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,940
You only care about her.

276
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,780
Forget it, Feng Wu.

277
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,860
Don't make things difficult for Mr. Han.

278
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,780
Sister, you can't say that

279
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,540
until you get married.

280
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,780
I don't have one.

281
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,940
There's no way ahead.

282
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,900
Where do I live?

283
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,340
You just care about talking?

284
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,180
West Chamber.

285
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,100
This way.

286
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,700
When will you start?

287
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,180
Tonight.

288
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,300
Don't be late.

289
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,300
Okay.

290
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,580
Wait.

291
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,100
Mr. Han, please.

292
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,900
Please.

293
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,020
Thank you for your cooperation.

294
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,060
Rest early.

295
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,140
I didn't say anything wrong just now.

296
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,540
Mr. Han, get angry.

297
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,260
Why don't you leave?

298
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,780
Say a few words.

299
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,180
Okay, let's go.

300
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,380
Let's go.

301
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,780
What did I say just now?

302
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,580
Nothing.

303
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,420
How is it?

304
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,660
Finally, she left.

305
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,180
It's still the fourth sister's little Zhu Yue.

306
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,420
It's strange.

307
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,860
Why didn't she say anything?

308
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,340
It's all yours.

309
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,460
It's in your hand.

310
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,380
Okay.

311
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,140
Since everyone agreed,

312
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,820
we should treat her well.

313
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,060
Let her eat and drink well

314
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,740
in the mansion.

315
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,740
And take care of her health.

316
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,220
In this way,

317
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,940
it will be more useful

318
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,700
for us in the future.

319
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,860
Mrs. Wu.

320
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,140
Mr. Han's breakfast is more rich.

321
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,420
Just as the standard of the master.

322
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,300
No matter what they are calculating,

323
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,780
the warm and healthy treasure promised to me

324
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
must be obtained.

325
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,100
Because last year our soup was so delicious

326
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,260
that the owner told me

327
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,660
to do one day visit.

328
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,220
Mr. Han.

329
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,300
We have to fight with him next time.

330
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,380
No one can help us now.

331
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,500
Anyway,

332
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,180
don't let anyone do this to you again.

333
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,380
Mr. Han.

334
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,620
You've tried many times.

335
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,340
Let me tell you the story

336
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,660
Good morning, Mr. Han

337
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,500
Mom told Ms. Wu to prepare the breakfast

338
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,220
Go eat, eat together

339
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,020
Mr. Han, eat

340
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,300
Mom tell Ms. Wu to prepare this

341
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,100
Yes, your size

342
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,860
Are you drinking in vain?

343
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,660
All obviously

344
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,580
around us

345
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,660
Let me pour it for you

346
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,260
Yesterday, some of them were too big

347
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,860
and made mistakes

348
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,620
I think they have been políticoist

349
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,080
No one even Legitimate

350
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,900
when other guys invited him

351
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,460
Really too much

352
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,300
It's enough

353
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,980
only just ask for it

354
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,380
Is it good for your health?

355
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,500
Well

356
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,100
Does this dish or Additionally

357
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,220
have the smell of date sting?

358
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,660
the royal jade of Zhenyang.

359
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,140
Such a precious royal jade

360
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,340
is sent to us by hand.

361
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,700
You don't like us, do you?

362
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,020
Fenwu,

363
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,340
stop talking nonsense.

364
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,540
These

365
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,340
are all made by my mother.

366
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,940
I don't know if they suit your taste.

367
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,020
I'll ask my mother to make more if you like it.

368
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,980
Although these two girls are lonely,

369
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,340
they are at least better than their mother.

370
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,860
Before we find the royal jade,

371
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,740
we'd better deal with them first.

372
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,380
It's delicious.

373
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,620
Do you like it?

374
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,900
If you like it,

375
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,660
I like it, too.

376
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,860
Do you think seeing people

377
00:18:51,860 --> 00:19:04,680
playing

378
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,340
with love

379
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,680
and hard work

380
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,340
is meat pie at the same time?

381
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,580
Where is it?

382
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,060
Aren't you the prince?

383
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,980
Look for it.

384
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,680
It's sitting alone,

385
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,880
Is this him?

386
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,600
Don't tell me he went in here.

387
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,280
Not in here.

388
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,960
It's all fake.

389
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,520
What's he good at?

390
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Go, everyone.

391
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,000
Behave.

392
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,480
I have something to personally ask you.

393
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
I killed him.

394
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,040
You're quite bold.

395
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,600
He wants to kill me first.

396
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,920
I can do it,

397
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
but I can't protect myself.

398
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
We can

399
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,680
not investigate the old master's case.

400
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,600
But you have to promise us one thing.

401
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,400
Okay.

402
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,280
But I want you

403
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,920
to give me the Nuan Yang Treasure

404
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,760
after your doctor Mo's

405
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,320
imperial edict.

406
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,400
Do I know what you want me to do?

407
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,720
I will get the Nuan Yang Treasure.

408
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,780
won't be able to

409
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,520
get the imperial edict.

410
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,440
You have to go back

411
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
after the Imperial Edict.

412
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,880
This person's name is Ouyang Feitian.

413
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,160
They likes to do evil and sides with justice.

414
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,080
They kill the innocent.

415
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,720
Recently, theyrod us

416
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,520
to kill Mo Mansion.

417
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,600
Killing her

418
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,880
will safeguard our safety

419
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,480
and eliminate the bad guys for the people.

420
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,640
That goes.

421
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,040
above the Lord

422
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,520
and he's very careful

423
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,920
He's afraid that if he shoots the king of the Celestial Realm

424
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,080
the enemy will only let you die faster

425
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,880
Did you hear it clearly?

426
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
You don't have to worry about these things

427
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,040
What about your sincerity?

428
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,040
Okay

429
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,840
We can swear by the spirit of the dead

430
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,800
If you solve the biggest trouble

431
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,040
of Ouyang Feitian for us

432
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,920
we'll give it to you

433
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,840
Deal

434
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:57,720
Deal

435
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,320
But it was too fast

436
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,240
I'm willing to do anything to protect you.

437
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,120
But׳±

438
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,200
In this world...

439
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,160
Everything is different from what you see.

440
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,600
Where is the commander?

441
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,600
Where are you going?

442
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,160
Just go.

443
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
You're the King of the Sky?

444
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
This is a quiet place.

445
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,040
You can't make a mistake.

446
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
You're so hurt.

447
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
You still say it's quiet?

448
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
The country is a cultivator.

449
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
A cultivator

450
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
A cultivator

451
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
should also be involved in the fight between the world and the world.

452
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Which family

453
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
would you like to come to?

454
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I'm willing to pay double the price.

455
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Please

456
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
forgive me.

457
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
I've investigated

458
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
the price.

459
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
You usually

460
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
make a lot of decisions.

461
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
You want to exchange a life for it?

462
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
You

463
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
don't have to

464
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,040
make it difficult for me.

465
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
I've sent people

466
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
to search the Tainan valley

467
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
but

468
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
I didn't find the whereabouts.

469
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Today I see the place

470
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
I want to

471
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
have a good

472
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
relationship with you.

473
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Tainan valley?

474
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Yes.

475
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Since ancient times,

476
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,040
Tainan valley

477
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
is where the immortals gather.

478
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,040
It's said that a hundred years ago

479
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
there was someone

480
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
who was taken

481
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
by the immortals.

482
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
Please look.

483
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
This is the map

484
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
of Tainan valley.

485
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
If you want it,

486
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
I'll also

487
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
pay double the price.

488
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
Tainan valley?

489
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,040
I think I've heard of it.

490
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,040
Is there anyone else there?

491
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,040
It seems that you're not interested in it.

492
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Then, I don't need it.

493
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Tainan valley

494
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,040
After this,

495
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,040
I'll go to Tainan valley.

496
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Tainan valley

497
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Mother!

498
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
The back pressure is flying!

499
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
There's news!

500
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
What's wrong?

501
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,040
She's dead.

502
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
So fast!

503
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Mother!

504
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
She's back!

505
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
So fast!

506
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Only she can

507
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
make the herbs every day.

508
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
It seems that Dr. Mo's medical skills

509
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
are passed on to this dumb.

510
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
The job is done.

511
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Take the warm-sand-tree-tree.

512
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
It's indeed

513
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,040
the heirloom of the Ouyang family

514
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
of the Duba mountain villa.

515
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
What do you mean?

516
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
You want to turn a blind eye?

517
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
No.

518
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,040
It just happened suddenly.

519
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
We... we didn't prepare well.

520
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Prepare what?

521
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
We agreed before.

522
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
After helping you, you gave me the treasure.

523
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
How long will it take?

524
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Ten days.

525
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Ten days?

526
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
We originally calculated that

527
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
you and Ouyang Feitian

528
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
would fight for ten days.

529
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Ten days is the key

530
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
to our plan to acquire the Duba mountain villa.

531
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Who knows you can kill him in an hour?

532
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
You ruined our plan.

533
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
You're too fast.

534
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
You want me to kill Ouyang Feitian?

535
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
It's not a few days.

536
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Besides, you swore.

537
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Yes.

538
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,040
We swore.

539
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
We want you to solve Ouyang Feitian's big trouble

540
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
and give you the warm-sand-tree-tree.

541
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
But now?

542
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
How can we solve it?

543
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
After Ouyang Feitian left,

544
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Ouyang Feitian died.

545
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Not only the Jinjiao Society,

546
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
the whole Jiayuan City will be in chaos.

547
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
I also received a message that

548
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
the Five-color Gate will be activated.

549
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Five-color Gate?

550
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
If the Five-color Gate takes over the Duba mountain villa,

551
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
we'll be in danger.

552
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
What should we do?

553
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
It seems that you not only killed the master,

554
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
but also caused the death of the whole family.

555
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
We're orphans.

556
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
What should we do?

557
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
What should we do?

558
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,040
I think you want to defame us.

559
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
I don't want to defame you.

560
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Then how can you give me the treasure?

561
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
You stay.

562
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Impossible.

563
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
How can it be impossible?

564
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
The Nanyang Treasure is the treasure of our Mo family.

565
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,040
We can discuss it.

566
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
All three girls in our family

567
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
will marry you.

568
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
The Nanyang Treasure is just a dowry.

569
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
It's all yours.

570
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,040
I have to go to the temple.

571
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Our daughter is the daughter of the Mo family in Jiayuan City.

572
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
I tell you,

573
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
many people want to be high-ranking, but they can't.

574
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
You're so generous.

575
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
The Nanyang Treasure is yours.

576
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
It's all yours.

577
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
You're so generous.

578
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Stop.

579
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Are you done? I'll talk.

580
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
I can't stay.

581
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Change the conditions.

582
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
There are bad people in Jiayuan City.

583
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
I don't know where they hide the Nanyang Treasure.

584
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,040
We can give it to Brother Han together.

585
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,040
If they are too strong,

586
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
they will destroy it.

587
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,040
You girl.

588
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Brother Han, are you willing to do it?

589
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
If the bad people are killed,

590
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
it's a good thing for the people.

591
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,040
But we can't let them be.

592
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,040
We can't let them be.

593
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
Let's go.

594
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Go.

595
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
It's yours.

596
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,860
I prepared an amulet of divinity.

597
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,920
It's the auspicious sign random reim vindician housing.

598
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,400
You know how to do it?

599
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,140
If it happens,

600
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,160
we have to use it.

601
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,600
You're just like your father.

602
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,360
Goddess, something is up again.

603
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,200
I'm very sorry

604
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,560
for leaving you alone again.

605
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,600
No need.

606
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,320
This has

607
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,440
belonged to Mr. Mo.

608
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,360
The Mo family is just a little bit more capable

609
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,360
and quiet.

610
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,360
It seems that someone in the Mo family has inherited Dr. Mo's medical skills.

611
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
It's a pity that he can't talk.

612
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
I'll go.

613
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Mr. Han.

614
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,360
Mr. Han, have some tea before you go.

615
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
No need.

616
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,360
I'll go.

617
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,360
This is a good question.

618
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,360
This person is called Black Bear.

619
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,360
He is the first competitor of the next leader of the Five-color Sect.

620
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
He is good at killing and raping.

621
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
He often doesn't even let go of the old people and children.

622
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,360
Killing him is like killing the Mo family's star.

623
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,360
It's also to eliminate the harm for the people.

624
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,360
After the test is done, I will definitely give you the warm and cool treasure.

625
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,360
No more words.

626
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,360
You are Black Bear.

627
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,360
It seems that you are really a completely evil person.

628
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,360
Black Bear is also you.

629
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,360
He won again.

630
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,360
He really killed Black Bear.

631
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,360
What should we do?

632
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,360
Could it be that we can't take the three of them away?

633
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,360
We have to take away the warm and cool treasure?

634
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,360
No. If he leaves,

635
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,360
there will be only the four of us left alone.

636
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Besides, there are so many enemies.

637
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,360
That's why we have to try our best

638
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,360
to keep him.

639
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,360
I'm afraid that he will be a little bit more dangerous.

640
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,360
I'm afraid that he will stay.

641
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,360
Why is it so quiet?

642
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,360
There is no one here.

643
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,360
Could it be that they don't want to come to war

644
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,360
and run away from home?

645
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,360
Mr. Han, we are looking for you.

646
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
You're not going out?

647
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,360
We have been waiting for you.

648
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,360
What are you doing here?

649
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
I'm here to give you a new dress.

650
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
I don't have time to wash my clothes these days.

651
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
You have killed two people.

652
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
What are you doing?

653
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
I'm washing your clothes.

654
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
No, no.

655
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
Ma'am, no.

656
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
From now on, your clothes

657
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
and ma'am will help you all.

658
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
No, no.

659
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
You have killed two people.

660
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,360
Your clothes are all dirty.

661
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,360
My handwork is very good.

662
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
From now on, I will do all your clothes for you.

663
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
No need.

664
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
You only help ma'am.

665
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,360
Are you asking me to help you again?

666
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Yes.

667
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Guihua Lane, Mr. Wu.

668
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
I'm not going.

669
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
Han Li.

670
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Han Li.

671
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
No.

672
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,360
I can't wait any longer.

673
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Come on.

674
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Drink some tea.

675
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,360
It will help you to cool down.

676
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,360
You...

677
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
You...

678
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,360
You...

679
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,360
You...

680
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
You...

681
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
You...

682
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
You...

683
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
You...

684
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
You...

685
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
You...

686
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
You...

687
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
You...

688
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,360
You...

689
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
You...

690
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,360
You...

691
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,360
You...

692
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Young Master.

693
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
You are finally back.

694
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
Jia Yue City has been in a mess these days.

695
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,360
Ou Yang, Fei Tian, Hei Xiong

696
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
and the son-in-law of the Mo family

697
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,360
are all dead.

698
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Where is my brother?

699
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Don't mention your brother.

700
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,360
He is sick because of Xiang Si.

701
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,360
He doesn't eat, drink or sleep.

702
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
He just stays here.

703
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,360
He can't even do business.

704
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,360
Qiu Wen.

705
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,360
Let's go.

706
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
We are running out of time.

707
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
They are here this time.

708
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
You are welcome.

709
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
You are welcome.

710
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
Why do you bring...

711
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Help.

712
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,360
Look.

713
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,360
Did you misunderstand us?

714
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
What?

715
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
You think

716
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
we will be in trouble?

717
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,360
You know it very well.

718
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
I have done

719
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,360
what Doctor Mo told me to do.

720
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,360
As promised,

721
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
I will bring the warm bath now.

722
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Don't worry.

723
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
You guys

724
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,360
go and bring the things.

725
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
Young Master Han.

726
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
There are rumors out there

727
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,360
that the Mo family

728
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
has a son-in-law

729
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
who has a good method.

730
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Really.

731
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,360
Really.

732
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,360
Don't be too happy.

733
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,360
At least we have a son-in-law.

734
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
Look.

735
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
There is nothing to say now.

736
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,360
Look.

737
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Look back.

738
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,360
The dowry is here.

739
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
The first box

740
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,360
is a valuable gold and silver jewelry.

741
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
In the future,

742
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,360
I will give you all the profits

743
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,360
of the secret bank.

744
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
The second box

745
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
is the medical supplies

746
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
and the key to the warehouse

747
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
of the clinic

748
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
that our family passed down.

749
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
The third box

750
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
is all the weapons of the Jin family

751
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,360
and the Hall Leader's order

752
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,360
that can command the people.

753
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Use these

754
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,360
to keep me in Mo Pu.

755
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,360
And three thousand golds.

756
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,360
And

757
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,360
all four of us

758
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360
want to leave.

759
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
And me.

760
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,360
We will all

761
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,360
leave with you.

762
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,360
You take us

763
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,360
and go far away.

764
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
Who will go with you?

765
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
To be honest,

766
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
I won't go with

767
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,360
the three of them.

768
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
And the four of you,

769
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
I can't take them with me.

770
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,360
Fu Ze,

771
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,360
take me with you.

772
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,360
Go back.

773
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,360
I only want the old and the young treasure.

774
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
You...

775
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Why don't you want me?

776
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,360
The Mo family

777
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
doesn't deserve you.

778
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
Who gave you the confidence

779
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,360
to be friends with the Mo family?

780
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,360
I'm still the head of the Han family.

781
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,360
You can't say no to me.

782
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
You can't say no to me.

783
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,360
There will be no man

784
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
in the family in the future.

785
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,360
What should we do?

786
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
No one will be there.

787
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
I know that

788
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
it's their scheme

789
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
to make the mother cry.

790
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
Don't cry.

791
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,360
Since father is gone,

792
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,360
the people who are close to the Mo family

793
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
will take the opportunity to do it.

794
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
Don't cry.

795
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Mother wants to

796
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,360
keep this cultivator

797
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,360
and protect us.

798
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,360
As for the daughter

799
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
and the warm and healthy treasure,

800
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
they don't want to give it to her.

801
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,360
I hope that Han's brother

802
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,360
won't be angry.

803
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,360
If you keep making trouble,

804
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,360
I'll burn this Mo Mansion.

805
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,360
Father,

806
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,360
is there no one to discuss?

807
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
No.

808
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,360
The treasure

809
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,360
is here.

810
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
Don't talk nonsense with him.

811
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,360
Do it.

812
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
You're poisoned by the Devil's Shadow.

813
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,360
You can't last long.

814
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,360
After being poisoned by the Devil's Shadow,

815
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
you can't only cultivate your body,

816
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,360
and you can't live long.

817
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
I can't live.

818
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
You can't live either.

819
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
You stay.

820
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
No one needs to die.

821
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
Warm and healthy treasure.

822
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
Give it to the old man or not?

823
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
No.

824
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,360
It's all about death anyway.

825
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,360
You have the ability.

826
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
Kill me.

827
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
Kill us.

828
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Kill us.

829
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
What are you doing?

830
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
Kill us.

831
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
Kill us.

832
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,360
What are you doing?

833
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
Kill us.

834
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,360
Kill us.

835
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
Kill us.

836
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
Kill us.

837
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
He's poisoned.

838
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
You can talk.

839
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
Kill us.

840
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,360
Hurry up.

841
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Hurry up.

842
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Hurry up.

843
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
Hurry up.

844
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
Lin Ye.

845
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Hurry up.

846
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
I'm sorry.

847
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
I'm sorry.

848
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
I'm sorry.

849
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,360
I'm sorry.

850
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
I'm sorry.

851
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360

I'm sorry.

856
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,360
I'm sorry.

857
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
I'm sorry.

858
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
I'm sorry.

859
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,360
I'm sorry.

860
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,360
I'm sorry.

861
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,360
I'm sorry.

862
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
I'm sorry.

863
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
