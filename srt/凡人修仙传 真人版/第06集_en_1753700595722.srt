The Legend of Xiao Chuo

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I used the right price to buy the right thing.

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is the normal fair trade.

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay, then I'll show you what is fair.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Senior Brother Lu, this magic treasure is already very valuable.

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The test is about to start.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We should not get involved in this.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Junior Sister Chen has opened her mouth.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Of course, we should listen to her.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I won't be so lucky next time.

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's go.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
These Shi family's children are really domineering.

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you for helping me out earlier.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
My name is Han Yun Zhi. What is your name?

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Han Li.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Brother Han, you are also taking the test?

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's about to start. Let's go together.

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The Legend of Xiao Chuo

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The Legend of Xiao Chuo

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Dear cultivators, this round of meeting is hosted by our seven sects.

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
As long as you pass the test, you will have the chance to be hired by any sect.

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I thought you were not good enough.

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I might get more invitations from more sects.

27
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Then the contestants will choose.

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Brother Han, are you okay?

29
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Let me tell you.

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In our cultivating world, there are different sects.

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The lower sects can't be the first to choose.

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The upper sect is the Shi clan of the Jiedan clan.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You must not look down on it.

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is the Jiedan clan?

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The number of invitations is limited.

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Please be careful.

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The Jiedan clan is the most powerful sect in the world.

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:11,600
H então s

52
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,000
The council takes the jade building.

53
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,900
It's so beautiful here.

54
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,140
I.

55
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,840
w donc,

56
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,660
because I hope to

57
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,220
send a message to you.

58
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,660
What is that?

59
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,900
It is Yanyue Sect.

60
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,180
I heard that Yanyue Sect

61
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,020
is the most powerful

62
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,940
among the seven Heavens now.

63
00:05:49,900 --> 00:06:15,260
Never anything

64
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,100
Nityou

65
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,140
Don't let people die

66
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:18,980
Untie

67
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,980
Do you mean the source of fire wood and trees?

68
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,580
prince sharp

69
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,740
Waterffen

70
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,740
Water Nebula

71
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,740
Firewood and forest roots

72
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,660
Pass

73
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Wu Ven Migration Berg

74
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:13,380
Fragrance Approach

75
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,940
Duan Yunli

76
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,980
Oh my god, B告訴大哥

77
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,620
What do we do now?

78
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,620
Are you all right, B?

79
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,300
B

80
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,300
Follow the fire and the soil to get to the forest root.

81
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Pass.

82
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
Here, here, here.

83
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Slow down, slow down.

84
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
It's okay. You're still alive.

85
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,300
You didn't get selected by the Seven Sects.

86
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
You're eliminated.

87
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,300
What?

88
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Why didn't you get selected?

89
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,300
I can't be compared to them.

90
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
Is this the so-called fairness of the Seven Sects?

91
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Don't you know what you've done?

92
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,300
I got it.

93
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
The fire and the soil to get to the forest root.

94
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
You got selected.

95
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Brother Han, it's your turn.

96
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,300
Brother, it's not your turn yet.

97
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,300
It's too hard.

98
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,300
It seems that your forest root is definitely not good.

99
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
This person is so stubborn.

100
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
How could the cultivation of immortality be so bad?

101
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
The wind and the earth to get to the forest root.

102
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
Pass.

103
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
The Yellow Wind Valley.

104
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
So boring.

105
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
It's just like a palm tree.

106
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Show me.

107
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
The forest root to get to the forest root.

108
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Pass.

109
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,300
The Yellow Wind Valley.

110
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Give him the ball.

111
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,300
The Yellow Wind Valley.

112
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,300
The fire and the soil to get to the forest root.

113
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,300
You got selected.

114
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,300
This is not good.

115
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
You're really bad.

116
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,300
You got selected.

117
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,300
You got selected.

118
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
That's why you came to the Immortal Conference.

119
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,300
You're really not afraid of embarrassing people.

120
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,300
That's right.

121
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,300
Embarrassing people.

122
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,300
The forest root to get to the forest root.

123
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Pass.

124
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,300
I choose the Lian Shou Mountain.

125
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,300
This is the last person who passed the test today.

126
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,300
I didn't expect that we two would be brothers.

127
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Don't be angry.

128
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
Isn't there a competition in the Tianwu Station?

129
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Competition?

130
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Can we pass the competition?

131
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,300
Even if it's a competition,

132
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,300
we, the monks and the disciples who grew up in the jar of the spirit medicine,

133
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,300
what's the advantage?

134
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,300
Are we the monks and disciples destined to be bullied by these disciples?

135
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,300
I can't take this.

136
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
Why are you saying all these things?

137
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
Actually, there's no way out.

138
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,300
I have a good idea.

139
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,300
But it depends on your help.

140
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,300
What's the good idea?

141
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
We can't wait.

142
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Hurry up.

143
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,300
You don't sell the jar.

144
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
Brother Wan,

145
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
if we meet on the Tianwu Station,

146
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
what's your win?

147
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
You're really joking.

148
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,300
Your cultivation is above me.

149
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,300
Of course I can't beat you.

150
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Then,

151
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
what if I lend you this talisman?

152
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,300
This is an ultimate weapon.

153
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,300
Then,

154
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
there should be 50% of it.

155
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
If I lend you this,

156
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,300
I'll give you another 20% of it.

157
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Good.

158
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
The competition in the cultivation world,

159
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,300
besides relying on cultivation,

160
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
also depends on various weapons,

161
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
talismans, and elixirs.

162
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
In terms of strength and martial arts,

163
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
we can't beat those arrogant people.

164
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
But we have one advantage.

165
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
They can't beat us.

166
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,300
That's unity.

167
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
If there are 100 monks and disciples in our Qingwen Society,

168
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,300
and everyone is willing to contribute a treasure,

169
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,300
then we have 100 treasures.

170
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Since there are so many treasures,

171
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
not to mention the top level of cultivation,

172
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,300
even if we help the chicken to cultivate,

173
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
there may be a battle.

174
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
Yes.

175
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,300
I'm willing to lend you my ultimate talisman.

176
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,300
Qingwen.

177
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,300
Since I proposed it,

178
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,300
I have to make a statement.

179
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
I said,

180
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
the reason to set up the Qingwen Society

181
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
is to establish a group of people of the cultivation world.

182
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
I want those people of the world to know,

183
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,300
we can't beat them.

184
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Yes.

185
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,300
Yes.

186
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,300
What are they?

187
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
I said,

188
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,300
prepare for the wrong thing.

189
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
I know.

190
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,300
Although there are so many treasures,

191
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,300
you can't win.

192
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
But as long as we do our best,

193
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,300
even if we can't win,

194
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
we have to let the people of the world know,

195
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,300
we can't bully them.

196
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,300
We can't bully them.

197
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
Taoist, although I'm not qualified,

198
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,300
I want to make a difference.

199
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Okay.

200
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,300
If you want to make a difference,

201
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
follow me.

202
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,300
Okay.

203
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,300
Okay.

204
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
Make a difference.

205
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,300
This is mine.

206
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
This is mine.

207
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,300
So this is what they want.

208
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Brother Han,

209
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
are you willing to make a difference?

210
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,300
I heard Taoist's statement just now.

211
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,300
Now I don't have much hope for the Seven Sects.

212
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,300
I won't participate in the competition of Tianwu.

213
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Brother Taoist,

214
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,300
this is a good opportunity for us to win.

215
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,300
Yes.

216
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Yes.

217
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
We have to do our best.

218
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
It seems that I can't escape without bleeding.

219
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,300
What treasures do you have?

220
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,300
Take it out and share it.

221
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,300
How about this?

222
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
I accidentally got a ton of

223
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
tonic to accompany people.

224
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
I wanted to keep it for myself.

225
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
Since it's like this,

226
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
I'll share it with everyone.

227
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Thank you, Taoist.

228
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,300
This is good.

229
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,300
It hurts.

230
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
I'll go and get some instant noodles.

231
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,300
You two, you two.

232
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
Brother Han.

233
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
Are you okay?

234
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
I'm fine.

235
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Brother Ran,

236
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,300
are you here to persuade me to participate in the Seven-Sectar Competition?

237
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,300
Of course not.

238
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,300
But Brother Han,

239
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
don't you plan to go to Tianwu to compete?

240
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,300
You have to win because of Zhu Jinan.

241
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,300
You're not Zhu Jinan?

242
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,300
Although I'm a good player,

243
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
I have to risk my life to go.

244
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
I knew that you were a thoughtful person.

245
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,300
By the way,

246
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
aren't you going to participate in the competition?

247
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
Why are you sharing the treasures?

248
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,300
To earn some face for our disbandment.

249
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,300
Brother Ran,

250
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,300
I always feel that those disbandment is not that simple.

251
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
You are not convinced at all.

252
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
It's easy to lose.

253
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
No way.

254
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
The disbandment is a family.

255
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
You're thinking too much, Brother Han.

256
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,300
Although we have already collected 38 magic weapons,

257
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
I heard that

258
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
it's better to take these magic weapons

259
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
and go far away.

260
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
No.

261
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,300
The ban on the Tainan Society will be lifted after the competition.

262
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
We can't leave now.

263
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
If those disbandment

264
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
give the treasure out,

265
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,300
that's the best.

266
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
If they don't,

267
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
don't worry.

268
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
If they don't,

269
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
I'll be the first one.

270
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,300
Brother, don't let them off.

271
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,300
You've said that so many times.

272
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
Don't always hurt him.

273
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
Put it in your mouth.

274
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
Come.

275
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
It's a big wound.

276
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,300
Go down.

277
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,300
Brother Han.

278
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,300
I finally found you.

279
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,300
What else?

280
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
I still have some talismans here.

281
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
I want to exchange some elixirs with you.

282
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Is that okay?

283
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
I have the Juli Talisman and the Han Ice Talisman.

284
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
These are attack-type.

285
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,300
These are defensive-type.

286
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
This Jin Gang Talisman is very powerful.

287
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
It can resist the power attack

288
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
of the ten levels of elixir.

289
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,300
What about this?

290
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
This is the Thunder Fire Talisman.

291
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,300
It can also attack the Thunder and Fire.

292
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,300
Look.

293
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,300
How about

294
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
I exchange two new ones with you?

295
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,300
That's not right.

296
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
I'm doing it in the way of the book.

297
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,300
Brother Han,

298
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
how about these two talismans?

299
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,300
I guarantee that

300
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,300
the quality is absolutely good.

301
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,300
These two...

302
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Miss Han,

303
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,300
why do you need the elixir?

304
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
I want to cure my brother.

305
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Sorry.

306
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,300
Your talismans

307
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,300
are of little use to me.

308
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
However,

309
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
if you have

310
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
the elixir of the talisman and talisman paper,

311
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
I can consider it.

312
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,300
You want to learn how to make talismans?

313
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Talisman?

314
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,300
You can definitely use this.

315
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
This is the Golden Bamboo Pen.

316
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,300
The tip of the pen is made of the second level of the demon beast's tail hair.

317
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,300
The pen stem is made of

318
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,300
the combination of metal and gold.

319
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,300
It is made of the help of the mechanical tool.

320
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,300
It uses the secret of practicing the magic to train the help of the magical tool.

321
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,300
This is the special tool that can make talismans.

322
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,300
This is a treasure.

323
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
You really want to sell it to me?

324
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Actually,

325
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
this is my family's plant.

326
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
But you have seen it.

327
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,300
I am not talented in talisman.

328
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
So this Golden Bamboo Pen

329
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,300
is not of much use to me.

330
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
How much is the price?

331
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Two bottles of elixir.

332
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,300
How about it?

333
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
I can also add these talismans

334
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
to make the talisman.

335
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,300
I can also make the talisman.

336
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,300
I can also make the talisman.

337
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
I can also add these talismans,

338
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,300
the bamboo sand and the talisman.

339
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,300
Deal.

340
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Brother Han.

341
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
I have a book here.

342
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
There are many books

343
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
about the secret of practicing the magic to train the magic.

344
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,300
I have read them all.

345
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
If you think it is boring,

346
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,300
you can take it to relieve your boredom.

347
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,300
I just want to know more.

348
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
Thank you.

349
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
The Seven Sects' Life-Giving Order

350
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
can be entered into the sect

351
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
and get an additional elixir.

352
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
What is the Life-Giving Order?

353
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
The Seven Sects' Life-Giving Order

354
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,300
is expected to be sent to you, from now a few days.

355
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Brother Han,

356
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,300
take a look at the Orange Triangle.

357
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,200
I heard that

358
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,760
to attract the contestants,

359
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,680
all major schools

360
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,120
have given out many rewards.

361
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,240
Except for the main event,

362
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,040
the first place has many snacks

363
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,800
and skills.

364
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,840
Little Brother Ren,

365
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,040
I got a book.

366
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,240
There are many

367
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,280
books on it.

368
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
It's not a real one.

369
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,120
Would you like to read it together?

370
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,080
Sure.

371
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,200
Come.

372
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,880
Qingxi Pencil.

373
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,440
What's this?

374
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,560
This...

375
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,960
It looks like

376
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,560
a token of some sect.

377
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,840
It's not a token.

378
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,480
Look at the words on it.

379
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,080
The Holy Order.

380
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,520
What is the Holy Order?

381
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,680
The Holy Order is...

382
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,160
I heard...

383
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,720
I heard that

384
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,920
the Holy Order is

385
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,800
that you don't need to fight

386
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,640
or test your spirit

387
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
as long as you have the Holy Order.

388
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,040
You can enter the Seven Sects directly.

389
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,720
Is there such a way?

390
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,680
Nonsense.

391
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,120
If that's the case,

392
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,080
let's just take the Holy Order.

393
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,640
Who would want to fight in the Heavenly Martial Arts Hall?

394
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,240
That's right.

395
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,560
It's a waste of time.

396
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,600
Master, you're right.

397
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,520
Many disciples of the Shi family

398
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,200
have come to the Wei Sect to test their spirit.

399
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,160
The Qingwen Society

400
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,760
is not idle at all.

401
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,080
They even dared to do it at the test.

402
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,360
What should we do now?

403
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,340
It's true that those

404
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,240
who are out of the world

405
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,560
have nothing to do with them.

406
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,600
They even want to frame the Shi family.

407
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,800
After the competition,

408
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,080
take them down.

409
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,600
Yes.

410
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,160
It seems that

411
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,480
the Holy Order

412
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,960
is referring to the Yellow Wind Valley.

413
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,760
The Yellow Wind Valley?

414
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,520
I heard that the Seven Sects

415
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,160
also belongs to the Big Sect.

416
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,080
It's really lucky.

417
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,640
It's finally over.

418
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
You know that you can't beat me, but you still want to die.

419
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
Do you deserve this Elixir of Life?

420
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,880
I've been waiting for this day

421
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,080
for decades.

422
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,760
You brat,

423
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,600
don't be so arrogant.

424
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,560
What's going on?

425
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,960
Why are there so many treasures?

426
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,040
Will Brother Lu lose?

427
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,760
He won't.

428
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,960
He's about to win.

429
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,200
Stop!

430
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,360
Brother,

431
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
let it slip.

432
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,020
huh ?

433
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:29,920
Where is the

434
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,360
key?

435
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,480
Be careful

436
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,920
Don't bother

437
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,980
Thank you, Grand Master, for the

438
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,180
disaster that happened to our San Xiu.

439
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,180
Yes.

440
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,180
We're sorry.

441
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,180
We're sorry.

442
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,180
I know that there are many missing details of San Xiu.

443
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,180
Our Yan Yue Sect will definitely investigate this matter to the end.

444
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,980
If someone dares to stir up the conflict between the San Xiu and the Shi family, and disturb the

445
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,980
cultivation world order, I will definitely not forgive them.

446
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,660
Lu Ming Yuan, the winner, is given a

447
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,660
bullet.

448
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,660
Thank you, Grand Master.

449
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,660
You're amazing.

450
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,660
Good.

451
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,660
The cultivation of the immortal's strength is not only based on the spiritual roots, but also

452
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,660
the magic, talisman, formation, and bullet.

453
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:23,660
Using all the skills of the immortal, you can also

454
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,660
use the power of the immortal to control the world.

455
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,660
I'm sorry.

456
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,660
I'm sorry.

457
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,660
I'm sorry.

458
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,660
I'm sorry.

459
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,660
I'm sorry.

460
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,660
I'm sorry.

461
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,660
I'm sorry.

462
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,280
Using all the useful things to move in a certain direction, and then using a

463
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,280
light attack, maybe this is the path that suits me the most.

464
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,280
But in front of absolute strength, any trick will be useless.

465
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Congratulations, Sixth Senior!

466
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
Congratulations, Sixth Senior!

467
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,280
He seems to be also from the Huangfeng Valley.

468
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
He really is the Lu Zhan of Yuan Family.

469
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,280
Only one trick left.

470
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,280
Only one trick left.

471
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,280
Xingwen, that guy is the genius of the immortal's power.

472
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
There's no need to befriend him.

473
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,280
If we can't do it this time, we can try harder next time.

474
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Next time?

475
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
There's no next time.

476
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
I told you.

477
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
The world is a place of cultivation.

478
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
Don't take it to heart.

479
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
Stop talking.

480
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
Say something that's on my mind.

481
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,280
You!

482
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,900
I'm saying, everyone, don't be so pessimistic.

483
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,900
I heard that if you get something, even if you don't participate in the

484
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,900
competition at the Heavenly Martial Arts Festival, you still have a chance to join the Seven Sects.

485
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
What is it?

486
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,900
It seems to be called...

487
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,900
Immortal Spirit!

488
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,900
Immortal Spirit!

489
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,900
Immortal Spirit!

490
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,900
Immortal Spirit!

491
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
Immortal Spirit!

492
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Listen to me.

493
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
I'm telling you.

494
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
I'm telling you.

495
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,900
I'm telling you.

496
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,900
I'm telling you.

497
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
I'm telling you.

498
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,520
Taoist Qingmen, I was just about to ask you.

499
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,520
You know about the Immortal Spirit Order, right?

500
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,520
The Immortal Spirit Order is the seven sects of Yue Country.

501
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,520
In order to reward those who have made great contributions to the cultivation of the Immortal Family,

502
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,520
it can be passed down for generations.

503
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:16,520
I heard that those who keep this order can enter the sects and get the main chicken egg.

504
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
The main chicken egg?

505
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
How did you know?

506
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
How did you know?

507
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,520
You can get the main chicken egg after you enter the sect?

508
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,520
You're indeed getting more knowledge.

509
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,140
But this thing hasn't appeared for hundreds of years.

510
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,140
How did you know?

511
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,140
It's not me.

512
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,140
It's Han Xiong who asked...

513
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,140
It's him who saw it in a book.

514
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,140
Did he ask you about it?

515
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,140
No.

516
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,140
It's nothing.

517
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,140
It's just that the two of us were chatting here.

518
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,140
What about Han Li?

519
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,140
Why didn't you see him?

520
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,140
Han Li...

521
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,140
Han Li didn't see me.

522
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,140
Aren't you two always together?

523
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,140
I'm not familiar with him.

524
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,140
He seems to have left.

525
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,140
Left?

526
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,140
The forbidden rule hasn't been broken yet.

527
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,140
Where did he go?

528
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,140
He...I...

529
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,140
Hello?

530
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,140
Hello?

531
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
I...I have a stomachache.

532
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,140
I'm going to put on some cotton.

533
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,140
What's going on?

534
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,140
What's wrong?

535
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,140
He ran away.

536
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Is he a coward?

537
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Really?

538
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,760
It seems that this time,

539
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,760
I didn't make it.

540
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
These treasures will be of great help to the future cultivation.

541
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
I'll just follow the spiritual root.

542
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,760
With this sacred star token, I won't let it go.

543
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
Right now, make it happen.

544
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,260
I can't see Wu Xie.

545
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,360
Find r austerity.

546
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,680
Hurry and make it.

547
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Hurry.

548
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Make it.

549
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,680
What do you think?

550
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,760
Go all the way up

551
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,220
and follow the strands

552
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,320
of blood from the

553
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:41,620
heart of the

554
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,560
Tungus you

555
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,020
soldiers

556
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,820
Yes

557
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,480
That direction

558
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,420
That direction

559
00:32:49,780 --> 00:33:02,960
Wildest

560
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,360
�Henshitou!

561
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,980
H existou.

562
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,140
The slit...

563
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,180
The slit...

564
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,980
I'm sorry.

565
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,980
I...

566
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,980
I've caused you trouble.

567
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,980
The truth about the Holy Spirit has been exposed.

568
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,980
I'm sorry.

569
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,980
I'm sorry.

570
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,980
I'm sorry.

571
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,980
I'm sorry.

572
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,980
I'm sorry.

573
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
I'm sorry.

574
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,980
I'm sorry.

575
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,980
I'm sorry.

576
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,980
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,980
I'm sorry.

578
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,980
I'm sorry.

579
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,980
It's exposed.

580
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,980
Brother Han, why are you running?

581
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,980
You're going to get drunk.

582
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,980
Where are you running?

583
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,980
What do you mean?

584
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
What do you mean?

585
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,980
It's the truth.

586
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,980
Brother Han, stop pretending.

587
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,980
Brother Han, you're not going to tell us about this, are you?

588
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,980
You got a treasure like the Holy Spirit Order.

589
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,980
If you don't take it out, you'll open your eyes to us.

590
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,980
Holy Spirit Order?

591
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,980
What Holy Spirit Order?

592
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,980
I've never heard of it.

593
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,980
But you guys are trying to kill us in broad daylight.

594
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,980
Aren't you afraid of being chased by the enemy?

595
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,980
Stop talking nonsense with him.

596
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,980
Take it first.

597
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,980
Search his body.

598
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,980
Where did he go?

599
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,980
Search.

600
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,980
There's no way to go on like this.

601
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,980
That Qingwen is still hiding.

602
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,980
Brother Han,

603
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,980
I'm sorry.

604
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,980
I'm sorry.

605
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,980
I'm sorry.

606
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,980
I'm sorry.

607
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,980
I'm sorry.

608
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,980
I'm sorry.

609
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
I'm sorry.

610
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,980
I'm sorry.

611
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,980
I'm sorry.

612
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
Brother Han,

613
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,980
I saw you.

614
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,980
Stop hiding.

615
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,980
Come out.

616
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
Holy Spirit Order.

617
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,980
Holy Spirit Order.

618
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
Qingwen.

619
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,980
Help me.

620
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
Qingwen.

621
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
You really appeared.

622
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,980
You killed Wan Xiaoshan?

623
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,980
Brother Xiaoshan is a good person.

624
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,980
But a good person is inevitable to die.

625
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,980
Your people are dead too.

626
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,980
Why don't you save them?

627
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,980
I've been thinking that you're hiding your back.

628
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,980
So I let them do it first.

629
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,980
It's really right.

630
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,980
So that's it.

631
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:10,980
You three have one life force.

632
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,980
I have no choice.

633
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,980
Brother Han is smart.

634
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
He has evaluated me for many years.

635
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,980
If this is not about the big way,

636
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,980
I wouldn't do so.

637
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,980
You're really a wicked person.

638
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
Brother Han,

639
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,980
this Swordless City

640
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,980
is your last resort, right?

641
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,980
Take a guess.

642
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,980
Ziyuan Hall.

643
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,980
Princess,

644
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,980
let's go down there.

645
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
All right.

646
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,980
Go.

647
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,980
Go, go.

648
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,980
Go.

649
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,980
It's here.

650
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,980
This?

651
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
What are you searching for?

652
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,980
Nothing.

653
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,980
It's this way?

654
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,580
I'll kill you and avenge them.

655
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:19,940
Do you think those

656
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,940
or do you think I believe you?

657
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,940
Fine.

658
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,940
I'll take out my life energy.

659
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,940
I'll give it to whoever can kill you.

660
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,940
You!

661
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,980
For the token,

662
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,980
you should pay with your life.

663
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,980
You're still young.

664
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,980
Don't you know the meaning

665
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,980
of this token?

666
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,980
Who?

667
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,980
You're Taoist Qingwen?

668
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,980
You're dying.

669
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,980
But the owner said

670
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,980
you can't die yet.

671
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,980
You're still alive.

672
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,980
You're still alive.

673
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,980
You're still alive.

674
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,980
It seems that

675
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,980
I'll let him die.

676
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,980
What's the situation?

677
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,980
I can't even see his movements.

678
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,980
If I catch him,

679
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,980
I'll die.

680
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,980
Run!

681
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,980
Who are you?

682
00:41:41,980 --> 00:42:07,100
You're the one who did the

683
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
What's the treasure

684
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,100
that the Qu Sect

685
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,100
has?

686
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,100
Do you want to be

687
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,100
the assistant?

688
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,100
Assistant?

689
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,100
If you can help me

690
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,100
become the assistant,

691
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
I'll be willing to do anything

692
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,100
to repay you.

693
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,100
Senior.

694
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,100
You're

695
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,100
dying.

696
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,100
You're still thinking about the assistant?

697
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,100
Senior Jing didn't help me.

698
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,100
Forget it.

699
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,100
You're a big shot.

700
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,360
Lin Chaoyuan

701
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:20,360
In the dream, there's a piece of dream

702
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,740
Snow falls on the water

703
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,820
Suddenly I'm longed for...

704
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,600
where it can be seen

705
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:39,600
It's hard to forget, it's better to forget

706
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,600
It's always said that the past is like a night

707
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,600
Looking back, it's absurd

708
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,600
The lonely books in the bustling city

709
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,600
The regret of the past is gone

710
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,600
The past is gone

711
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,600
The wind rises and blows

712
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:18,600
It's like the change of fate

713
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Looking back, it's absurd

714
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,600
I've forgotten the past

715
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,600
It's tomorrow

716
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,600
The three days of the sea are not as good as the past

717
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:44,600
Time will also erase all the promises in the world

718
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:54,600
Only this year has passed thousands of years

719
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:01,600
In the moment of eternal life

720
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:12,600
In the moment of eternal life

721
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,600
The wind rises and blows

722
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,600
It's tomorrow
