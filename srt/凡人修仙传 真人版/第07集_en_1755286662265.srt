OST credit

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,505
♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫

4
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:27,120
♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,160
♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,445
♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫

7
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:36,140
♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,040
♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,000
♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,520
♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,000
♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,945
♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,280
♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,660
♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,280
♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,620
♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫

17
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,800
♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,960
♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,160
♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,515
♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,920
♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,480
♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,960
Title

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,860
Master.

25
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,000
What unruly creature dares to cause trouble here?

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,030
We'd better move.

27
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,160
If we don't leave now,
a Core Formation cultivator might show up.

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,920
Yes, sir.

29
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,310
You're spared for now.

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,390
How could such a fiend
appear among rogue cultivators?

31
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,560
Could this be the work
of those demonic sects again?

32
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,460
That young man should
count his blessings.

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,960
I've been saved.

34
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,640
A high-level cultivator must have stepped in.

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,121
I escaped by the skin of my teeth.

36
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,510
It seems being a rogue cultivator
means hardship at every turn.

37
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,960
If I want to survive,
I'll have to join a worthy sect.

38
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,480
What's going on?

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,200
Where is Wu Jiu Zhi's body?

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,000
It's gone.

41
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,800
♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream... ♫

42
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,240
Let me tell you something, Han.

43
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,080
When it comes to cultivation in the Yue Kingdom,

44
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,280
I know everything there is to know.

45
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,360
Ask me anything you want.

46
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,840
I learned a lot from you yesterday.

47
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,590
We rogue cultivators are like one big family.

48
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,900
Living free and easy as a rogue cultivator
for life doesn't sound so bad.

49
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,002
♫ Too hard to forget, easier just to miss ♫

50
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:22,762
♫ They say the past fades like smoke... ♫

51
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,940
Once I reach Yellow Maple Valley,

52
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,150
I will leave behind the world of mortals.

53
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,840
Worldly ties will no longer concern me.

54
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,780
Before I go, I should head home one last time.

55
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,030
Third uncle came. He's here to take you
to the Seven Mysteries Sect entrance exam.

56
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,240
Father borrowed three big bowls of noodles

57
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,120
from the sixth uncle, Madam Zheng, and Gou Sheng's families,

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,360
just to send you off.

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,810
He even had me pull up some scallions.

60
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,940
Before I knew it, Xiao Mei was already of marrying age.

61
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,880
Father.

62
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,420
Mother.

63
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:03,280
Li, do you think you can pass
the Seven Mysteries Sect exam?

64
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,650
Yes. I'll definitely pass.

65
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,750
My brother said he'll pass the exam!

66
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,960
My eldest grandson will surely make it.

67
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,770
Without a doubt.

68
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,740
♫ Time will fade ♫

69
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,400
♫ All the words ever spoken ♫

70
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,200
♫ Only this longing remains ♫

71
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,119
♫ Crossing centuries and days... ♫

72
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:35,080
Grandfather, Brother, Xiao Mei.

73
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,955
I'm glad I got to see you all
before I set off on this long journey.

74
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,040
I pluck a piece of cloud to send home, to let them know I am safe.

75
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,080
Show-off.

76
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,000
- Yan Ru Yan!
- What's wrong?

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,680
Yan Ru Yan!

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,950
The entrance to Yellow Maple Valley should be around here.

79
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,150
Where exactly is it?

80
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,010
Come back!

81
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,880
Come back!

82
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,520
Get back here!

83
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,510
A sky full of yellow maple leaves.

84
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,880
Is this Yellow Maple Valley?

85
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,590
What's this?

86
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,410
That's mine...

87
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,620
Fu Yun Zi.

88
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,370
Remember these tiles?

89
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,270
Show-off.

90
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,960
Is today not the day new disciples are admitted?

91
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,980
Shouldn't you be somewhere else
rather than playing mahjong here?

92
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,080
Of course.

93
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,510
But you know the rules of Yellow Maple Valley.

94
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,740
When it is time for new disciples to enter,

95
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,750
I open betting pools.

96
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,040
It helps liven things up, you know?

97
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,750
Of course. Absolutely.

98
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,480
You came at the right time.

99
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,500
The first round shall begin now.

100
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,750
Great!

101
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,930
Left is odd.

102
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,240
Right is even.

103
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,420
- Place your bets. No changes after this.
- Come on.

104
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,140
A hundred-year lingzhi.

105
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,120
- I bet on odd.
- Odd for me too.

106
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,320
Me too.

107
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,910
I bet on even.

108
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,400
Here.

109
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,510
Wouldn't want you to say I cheated.

110
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,300
Show us the results.

111
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,910
One, two.

112
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,870
Five, six.

113
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,060
Seven. Eight.

114
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,310
16.

115
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,500
16 is even, right?

116
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,930
- Is 16 even?
- Yes, Grandmaster.

117
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,240
It is even!

118
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,600
Collect them!

119
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,670
Collect them all!

120
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,300
My talisman!

121
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,080
Take them. What's all the fuss about?

122
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,600
There are wins and losses in gambling.

123
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,245
- That's right.
- Accept your loss.

124
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:28,480
- Don't be a sore loser.
- Good.

125
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,510
Hua Yuan, boys, we will end here for today.

126
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,900
I bid you goodbye.

127
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,600
- Mentor Fu Yun Zi.
- Liu.

128
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,780
Master, I have something important to report.

129
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,400
What is it?

130
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,690
A young man holding an Ascension Token has arrived in the valley.

131
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,460
Ascension Token?

132
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,720
I haven't seen this thing
in over 400 or 500 years.

133
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,510
Indeed.

134
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,090
This is a rare item.

135
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,510
Indeed. This...

136
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,930
Wait a minute.

137
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,170
How many were there just now?

138
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,530
- 16.
- 16.

139
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,790
Add this one and...

140
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,970
What's 16 plus 1?

141
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,900
18.

142
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,320
Fu Yun Zi.

143
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,410
I have seen cheating,
but never someone this shameless!

144
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,500
Isn't it 18?

145
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,750
It's 17!

146
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,670
Give me that!

147
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,000
- Get it!
- Hurry!

148
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,790
- Quickly!
- Whose is this?

149
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,630
- Oh, you.
- My talisman!

150
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,510
This token couldn't have come at a better time.

151
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,650
I'll remember you.

152
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,870
This is yours.

153
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,810
Hold up.

154
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,200
My talisman.

155
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,210
- Where is he?
- At the bottom of the north valley.

156
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,940
Mentor. What precious
possessions have you brought today?

157
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,600
Snow Mountain Ice Lotus.

158
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,770
Paired with hundred-year banana leaf you brought,

159
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,620
it balances cold and heat. Nourishes the spirit root.

160
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,240
Excellent.

161
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,740
Wu. What about you?

162
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,200
What I brought is nothing

163
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,840
compared to what you all have.

164
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,270
- That's a fine item.
- Nine Heavens Mystic Cicada.

165
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,550
Gentlest of all.

166
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,400
Please.

167
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,280
What tea are we having today?

168
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,730
Let's enjoy some fine tea.

169
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,750
Allow me.

170
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,450
Watch this.

171
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,210
Excellent tea.

172
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,300
Enjoy.

173
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,550
Having tea without me?

174
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,620
Here comes the tea moocher.

175
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,560
Quick! Finish the tea!

176
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,550
I hope the tea scalds you, you money-grubber.

177
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,610
Who says I am mooching tea?

178
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,960
Look.

179
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,260
I brought something.

180
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,840
A hundred-year spirit herb.

181
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,730
Excellent choice.

182
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,830
Hong Fu, I brought it just for you.

183
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,080
Everyone, today Yellow Maple Valley
welcomes a rare guest.

184
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,750
Someone who's the likes of whom
we haven't encountered in a hundred years.

185
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,030
Come and have a look at this.

186
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,660
What is it?

187
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,550
I'm Song Meng, a Foundation Establishment disciple
of Yellow Maple Valley.

188
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,150
This is my sixth junior brother, Wu Xuan,
and this is our seventh junior sister.

189
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,440
So he is the one who brought the Ascension Token?

190
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,130
That is right.

191
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,950
What is your name?

192
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,820
My name is Han Li.

193
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,400
Why is he here?

194
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,320
That guy has the Ascension Token?

195
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,200
That guy?

196
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,790
No way.

197
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,530
Someone with a fake spirit root
couldn't possibly have an Ascension Token.

198
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,630
They say anyone who enters with an Ascension Token

199
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,630
receives a Foundation Pill by default.

200
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,520
Why?

201
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,360
Because their ancestors rendered great service
in the past.

202
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,790
He doesn't look like someone
from a meritorious bloodline.

203
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,430
A mere mortal trying to sneak
into the cultivation world.

204
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,000
Their ancestors did great service?

205
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,890
Cultivation clans use their most precious
resources

206
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,860
on their own descendants.

207
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,390
Even I had to fight for my life at Tianwu Arena

208
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,510
just to earn the right to a Foundation Pill.

209
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,020
What gives him the right?

210
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,660
Enough. We are here to cultivate, so let us focus on that.

211
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,050
Do not judge others.

212
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,120
- Understood.
- Got it.

213
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,720
Qiao Qian is right.

214
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,264
We came here to become cultivators,

215
00:15:44,264 --> 00:15:46,870
unlike someone who came to be a toad
lusting after a swan.

216
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,080
Right.

217
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,010
Pay no mind to their comments.

218
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,320
Four of the five elements spirit roots,
all at once.

219
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,030
You could not ask for worse.

220
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,360
Indeed. And a fake spirit root at that.

221
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,620
Indeed.

222
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,520
Which clan would waste an Ascension Token on someone this useless?

223
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,760
If I remember correctly,

224
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,870
sect rule 23 states that
anyone bearing the Ascension Token

225
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:21,630
must be accepted without questioning
their background or aptitude.

226
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,790
That is right.

227
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,470
And by the rules, he should be given one Foundation Pill as well.

228
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,050
What? Giving him a Foundation Pill is such a waste.

229
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,690
What about my disciples then?

230
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,670
Yellow Maple Valley
has already done him a huge favor

231
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,390
by accepting this fake spirit root.

232
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,140
Must we give him a Foundation Pill too?

233
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,860
What is owed must be given.

234
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,580
- We can't break the rules over one pill.
- Indeed.

235
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,250
If word gets out, we'll become the target of mockery
from the other six sects.

236
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,080
Indeed.

237
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,510
He's right.

238
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,700
Regardless of his talent, he should be accepted
into the sect.

239
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,980
The Foundation Pill should be given too.

240
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,570
However...

241
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,510
However what?

242
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,080
The Foundation Pill quota
is set in advance every year.

243
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,690
This year, we only prepared one, for the champion of the Tainan Bazaar.

244
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,000
If we give it to this newcomer,
then the champion will not get one.

245
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,060
Then so be it.

246
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,600
My suggestion is
that we temporarily replace it with gems.

247
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,130
After all, the champion
will surely qualify next year.

248
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,920
Well. It's settled then.

249
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,900
It's settled then.

250
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,380
Wu, go and welcome him into the valley.

251
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,930
Yes, Sect Master.

252
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,930
Hong Gu, please.

253
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,490
You brat, I just repaid
that gambling favor earlier.

254
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,990
Let's have some tea. Come.

255
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,660
Lovely tea.

256
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,510
Sect Master Zhong, where's my cup?

257
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,510
Here you go.

258
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,040
No tea for latecomers.

259
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,700
The tea's rather ordinary.

260
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,750
It's good.

261
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,900
There's more.

262
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,730
Really?

263
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,560
Senior Wu.

264
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,520
Senior Wu.

265
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,600
You are the one who brought the Ascension Token?

266
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,910
Yes.

267
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,730
My name is Han Li.

268
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,910
The Ascension Token is a rare item.

269
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,790
Even I have never seen one before.

270
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,080
How did you come by it?

271
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,720
It was passed down from my ancestors.

272
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,680
Are you perhaps from a cultivation clan?

273
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,900
Or do you have a senior family member working in one of the seven sects?

274
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,880
I come from the mortal world.

275
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,090
I am not from a cultivation clan.

276
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,400
No matter.

277
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,350
The Ascension Token is rare.

278
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,690
The fact that you received one means
you have fate with Yellow Maple Valley.

279
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,030
My surname is Wu.

280
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,690
From now on, you may call me Mentor Wu.

281
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,480
Welcome to Yellow Maple Valley.

282
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:43,732
I am officially a disciple of Yellow Maple Valley now.

283
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,490
Thank you, Mentor Wu.

284
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,310
For today, I will act as your guide

285
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,920
and help you understand
the basic rules of the valley.

286
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,530
Follow me.

287
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,820
Mentor, watch your step.

288
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,160
That is the Qianji Library.

289
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,640
It holds basic cultivation manuals
and alchemy recipes.

290
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,070
You can borrow them by paying gems.

291
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,740
I also work there.

292
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,830
To the west
is where Qi Refining Stage disciples live.

293
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,240
Aside from being hot like a steam furnace,
it is not too bad.

294
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,780
If you have enough gems, you can apply to move to the rear mountain,

295
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,510
where the accommodation is better.

296
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,090
Move aside.

297
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,030
Otherwise, you will have to wait
until you reach the Foundation Establishment.

298
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,540
- Thank you.
- And establish your personal abode.

299
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,300
There are many things
that require gems in the valley.

300
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,810
How can I earn them?

301
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,000
You can go to Baiji Hall and take on tasks
to earn gems.

302
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,400
What kind of tasks?

303
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,160
Tasks such as caring for spirit beasts
in the valley,

304
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,450
supervising mining operations at the quarries,

305
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,240
or instructing new disciples in basic techniques
at the Chuangong Pavilion.

306
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,010
Each task pays a different amount
depending on its difficulty.

307
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,110
Baiji Hall is overseen by Mentor Ye.

308
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,830
He has a rather eccentric temperament, so stay sharp around him.

309
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,790
This is the Alchemy Room.

310
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,970
Once you've saved up enough gems,
you can come here.

311
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,690
Ye. What are you doing so early in the morning?

312
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,780
I brought a new disciple
to pick up his entry supplies.

313
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,920
Didn't someone just come earlier?
Why are we doing this again?

314
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,240
Greetings, Mentor Ye.

315
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,160
You must be the one with the Ascension Token?

316
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,750
Even you've heard about it.

317
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,400
These youngsters have no interest in learning,

318
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,140
but they are all experts when it comes to gossip.

319
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,030
You may not have much talent,
but you sure are lucky.

320
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,980
Wait here.

321
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,210
Don't touch anything.

322
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,420
Come here.

323
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,140
This is the Yellow Maple Valley entry token.

324
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,450
Draw a strand of spiritual power
and inject it to activate it.

325
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,450
After that, it will be bound to you.

326
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,610
Go ahead and infuse your spiritual power.

327
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,960
A tenfold mystic pouch, one Cultivation Basics,

328
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,310
a set of daily refining tools,

329
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,930
the Solarflame Sword and Cold Moon Blade,

330
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,800
and a yellow entry robe.

331
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,830
You will take tasks to earn gems,

332
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,670
and spend them on gear and tools here with me.

333
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,770
Come back when you have more gems.

334
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,340
Thank you, Mentor Ye.

335
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,440
Well? Does the Yellow Maple Valley
disciple's robe not look flawless?

336
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,480
It does.

337
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,310
It is the first time in my life
I have seen a robe without stitching.

338
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,260
Walk with me.

339
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,600
That is about all you need to know
about the valley for now.

340
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,380
According to sect rules, anyone entering with an Ascension Token

341
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,240
is to receive a Foundation Pill in advance.

342
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,920
This one is yours.

343
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,960
Take it.

344
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,030
A word of advice.

345
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,480
There are many who covet Foundation Pills.

346
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,210
Keep it safe.

347
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,870
If you lose it, no amount of gems
will get you another.

348
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,110
Thank you, Mentor.

349
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,240
I am responsible for teaching
the disciples basic cultivation techniques.

350
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,740
If you ever encounter difficulty
in your cultivation, come find me anytime.

351
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,043
I will never forget your guidance

352
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:09,030
when I succeed
in reaching the Foundation Establishment.

353
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,560
Don't worry
about Foundation Establishment just yet.

354
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Regardless of whether you succeed,

355
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,330
this pill must be carefully safeguarded.

356
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,310
I'll remember that.

357
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,400
Hurry back to your quarters.

358
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,410
Even if they gave me a Foundation Pill,

359
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,100
with a fake spirit root like mine,

360
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,620
I'll never reach the Foundation Establishment.

361
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,240
That must be what he meant.

362
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,620
Don't give me that look.

363
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,720
Wasted on the undeserving.

364
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,160
Like giving a lamp to a blind man.

365
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,170
An absolute waste of resources.

366
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,810
Look at that snow. So white.

367
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,550
Hey, it's Ascension Token!

368
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,170
Ascension Token!

369
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,160
My name is Han Li.

370
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,270
"Han Li" doesn't sound
nearly as impressive as "Ascension Token."

371
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,480
Why not just rename yourself?

372
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,440
You can be "Ascension Token" from now on.

373
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,630
You two, that's enough.

374
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,070
Grandmaster Hong Fu.

375
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,850
Choose a leaf you like.

376
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,230
You will ride it through the skies.

377
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,400
Yellow Maple Valley's expanse is such that,

378
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,010
you wouldn't cover it in ten days
using just your legs.

379
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:15,820
If you can't fly,
you'll never find your place here.

380
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,590
Most of you have only taken flight in your dreams.

381
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,540
Some are too timid to even dare dream of flying.

382
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,170
Those people will never leave the ground.

383
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:31,450
Cultivation begins
by breaking past the limits in your heart.

384
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,270
If the Kunpeng can soar, so can people.

385
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,180
Harness the power of Heaven and Earth,

386
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,508
command the six energies,

387
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,650
and fly upon the wind through the void.

388
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:46,440
Grandmaster, are you saying that if we believe, we can fly?

389
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,960
Then what does that make us cultivators?

390
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,010
Fools chasing dreams?

391
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,270
Whether something is possible is one thing,

392
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,510
but whether you can do it is another.

393
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,110
Just because others can doesn't mean you can.

394
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,280
Just because others cannot
doesn't mean you cannot.

395
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,780
Remain steady in both praise and shame,

396
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,300
and let your heart guide your every move.

397
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,790
This is the state that cultivators seek to attain.

398
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,110
All right.

399
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,570
I've explained what needs to be explained.

400
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,960
Fly beyond the mountain ahead,

401
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,550
and you will be formally inducted
as disciples of Yellow Maple Valley.

402
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,970
Any other questions?

403
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,920
Grandmaster Hong Fu, we just need
to fly over the mountain.

404
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,030
We don't need to use these leaves, do we?

405
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,250
The choice is yours.

406
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,070
I will be waiting on the other side.

407
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,590
I don't need this lousy leaf!

408
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,820
- Come on!
- Come on!

409
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,810
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

410
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,630
How did this turn into tug-of-war?

411
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,020
Harness the power of Heaven and Earth.

412
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,250
Command the six energies.

413
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,080
Here I go!

414
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,110
With the Kunpeng in my heart,

415
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,100
I will surely take flight.

416
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,350
This is too slow.

417
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,960
This is no Kunpeng.

418
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,260
This is a bug.

419
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,867
What do you think?

420
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:49,440
When did you learn this spell?

421
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,240
While the flowers of April
fade in the mortal realm,

422
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,040
peach blossoms bloom anew at the mountain temple.

423
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,300
It's just a small trick of mine.

424
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,240
Don't let Xuan Er see you using this.

425
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Seeing all these flowers and plants

426
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,240
will only distract her more from her cultivation.

427
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,270
You're right.

428
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,410
One moment.

429
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,720
There.

430
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,880
No more of that.

431
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,020
I'll never use that again.

432
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,640
Hong Fu, why are this year's new disciples
so untalented?

433
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,350
They're the worst group I've ever seen.

434
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,530
That's not entirely true.

435
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,270
What about the disciple with the Ascension Token?

436
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,550
Surely, his possession of such a rare item

437
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,950
indicates that there is something
exceptional about him.

438
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,900
It is a waste of a Foundation Pill.

439
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,590
Still, he is not without merit.

440
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,140
Maybe because he knows he is mediocre,

441
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,340
he has a good attitude and strong will.

442
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:13,650
A human life is short, like trees in autumn.

443
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:18,580
With a talent like his,
I fear he might grow old and die

444
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,290
before he ever uses that Foundation Pill.

445
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,590
What was that for?

446
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:45,830
I gave him some wind to wield.

447
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,790
Let us see if he is a sparrow

448
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,820
or a great swan.

449
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,860
♫ Chasing wind  I set out afar ♫

450
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,560
♫ The road ahead lost My voice unheard ♫

451
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,520
♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫

452
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,860
♫ Laying low I plan every move ♫

453
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,560
♫ With a mortal heart And lingering ties

454
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,000
♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫

455
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,400
♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫

456
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,860
♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫

457
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,420
♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫

458
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,580
♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫

459
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,380
♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫

460
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,860
♫ I fight alone As chaos shakes the world ♫

461
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,460
♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫

462
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,001
♫ Kind at heart Ruthless when I must be  ♫

463
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:06,040
♫ Forged by trial I rise through three realms ♫

464
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,322
♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫

465
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,110
From today onward,

466
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:16,030
you are officially disciples
of Yellow Maple Valley.

467
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,320
As your Sect Master, I have only one request.

468
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,360
Focus on your cultivation
and avoid causing trouble.

469
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,840
Your purpose here is cultivation.

470
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,220
The first major milestone in cultivation is the Foundation Establishment Stage.

471
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,400
- Once you reach the Foundation Establishment...
- Want some?

472
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,450
I'm fine. Thank you.

473
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,410
You can absorb the essence
of the sun, moon, earth, and heavens.

474
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,800
You will no longer need to consume food
or take in worldly impurities.

475
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,300
So, even if you are still
in the Qi Refining Stage,

476
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,930
you should already begin practicing fasting.

477
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,440
You should eat later.

478
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,380
It's fine.

479
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,220
I can eat while he talks.

480
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,070
I can understand if it takes time

481
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,760
to let go of gourmet food.

482
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,090
But if you can't even
put down a piece of flatbread,

483
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,010
how will you ever succeed in cultivation?

484
00:37:37,023 --> 00:37:40,030
Who says cultivating means you can't eat?

485
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,700
My family told me

486
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,660
there's a Core
Formation Grandmaster who loved eating.

487
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,670
They carry all their utensils with them.

488
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,970
What's wrong with me eating a flatbread?

489
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,380
It's better than starving.

490
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,330
Bad examples shouldn't be followed.

491
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,970
Is there really a Core Formation Grandmaster
that greedy?

492
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,180
Indeed.

493
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,820
Don't listen to his nonsense.

494
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,000
What a joke.

495
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,900
Is there really
such a gluttonous Core Formation cultivator?

496
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,610
The rule of the Ascension Token
was set by our ancestors.

497
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,180
It's not something that can be changed.

498
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,360
If you work hard and make good progress with your variant spirit root,

499
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,730
the Valley may grant you another Foundation Pill as a reward.

500
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,390
Another one?

501
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,090
These 300 gems are compensation for you.

502
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,660
Sect Master, I was the champion
at the Tianwu Arena.

503
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,180
According to sect rules,
I should receive a Foundation Pill.

504
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,220
You were simply unlucky.

505
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,340
By the sect's rules,

506
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,740
the Foundation Pill must go to him first.

507
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:48,140
That is a rule we cannot alter.

508
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,820
Sect Master, I cannot accept this!

509
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,650
Enough.

510
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,860
Just accept your loss and move on.

511
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,780
Did you not hear what the Sect Master said?

512
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,130
The Foundation Pill
goes to the Ascension Token holder first.

513
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,110
- But...
- You are engaged

514
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,570
to the daughter of the Chen family.

515
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,060
The Chen family has plenty of Foundation Pills.

516
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,010
What's the matter?

517
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,110
Too proud to ask them for one?

518
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:19,660
If you want to blame someone,
blame the one with Ascension Token.

519
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,920
Watch closely.

520
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,410
Did everyone understand?

521
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,393
Is there learn a specific technique
you wish to learn?

522
00:39:40,393 --> 00:39:43,530
- Mentor.
- Mentor.

523
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,690
You, over there, go first.

524
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:51,416
♫ We made a promise to reunite ♫

525
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:55,520
♫ And walked into the unknown ♫

526
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,490
♫ But now that we've met again... ♫

527
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,480
I want to learn

528
00:40:01,435 --> 00:40:03,360
Aura Concealment.

529
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,740
A fake spirit root wants
to learn Aura Concealment?

530
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,570
What aura do you have to hide?

531
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,380
Aura Concealment, as the name suggests,

532
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,380
uses spiritual aura
to isolate yourself from the outside world.

533
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:21,900
If done well, it can hide your
presence and actions from others.

534
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,780
Observe.

535
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,580
♫ Never let yourself become a hollow husk
of what you once were... ♫

536
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,510
What?

537
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,000
Where is he?

538
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,860
Where did he go?

539
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,480
- Where's Mentor Wu?
- He vanished in an instant.

540
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,130
Amazing.

541
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,710
- Come.
- No wonder they call it Aura Concealment.

542
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,560
Now, you give it a try.

543
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,420
♫ We're just fleeting mortals ♫

544
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,360
♫ Time slipped by before we knew ♫

545
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,620
♫ Yet we burn that spark of light ♫

546
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:01,720
♫ Into this starry sky ♫

547
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,000
♫ Starlight fades into the Milky Way... ♫

548
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,510
He didn't conceal anything.

549
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,430
What did you even conceal?

550
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,940
Mentor Ye.

551
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:18,500
Today's lesson is on talisman crafting.

552
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,520
♫ Each step of fate's game unclear ♫

553
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,680
♫ Who can guess the ending? ♫

554
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,820
♫ But my heart has never rested ♫

555
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,780
♫ Ever chasing, still searching on... ♫

556
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,180
Give it a try.

557
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:39,280
♫ Through all the joy and sorrow ♫

558
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,440
♫ How do I choose the way? ♫

559
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,560
♫ Now we part, so far apart ♫

560
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,380
♫ We walk our separate paths ♫

561
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:30,880
♫ Just as I rise to compete,
the years have already fled... ♫

562
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,940
The morning glow really does feel better
than the evening glow.

563
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,740
♫ To be one who stands tall
between heaven and earth ♫

564
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,230
♫ Never let yourself become a hollow husk
of what you once were ♫

567
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,980
♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫

568
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,651
♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫

569
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:13,086
♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫

570
00:43:13,086 --> 00:43:15,505
♫ Old scenes rise again ♫

571
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:18,866
♫ Too hard to forget ♫

572
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:23,620
♫ Easier just to miss ♫

573
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:29,430
♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫

574
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:36,120
♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫

575
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,680
♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫

576
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,060
♫ Swept away by time ♫

577
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,280
♫ Eyes once looked far ♫

578
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,560
♫ Now lost in the shift ♫

579
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,009
♫ Autumn winds stir ♫

580
00:43:53,009 --> 00:43:55,360
♫ Smoke curls once more ♫

581
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,400
♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫

582
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,420
♫ Returning to my eyes ♫

583
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,700
♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫

584
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,760
♫ Time lost its name ♫

585
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,001
♫ Was it yesterday ♫

586
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:16,160
♫ Or tomorrow? ♫

587
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,640
♫ The world has changed ♫

588
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,785
♫ Beyond recall ♫

589
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:23,806
♫ Time will fade ♫

590
00:44:23,806 --> 00:44:29,240
♫ All the words ever spoken ♫

591
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,860
♫ Only this longing remains ♫

592
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:39,080
♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫

593
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:45,772
♫ In a fleeting moment we call eternity♫

594
00:44:45,772 --> 00:44:56,472
♫ In a fleeting moment called eternity ♫
