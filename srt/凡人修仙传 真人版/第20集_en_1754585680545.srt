00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm going to the hospital.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm going to the hospital.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm going to the hospital.

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm going to the hospital.

20
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to the hospital.

21
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm going to the hospital.

22
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm going to the hospital.

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm going to the hospital.

24
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm going to the hospital.

25
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to the hospital.

26
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm going to the hospital.

27
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm going to the hospital.

28
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm going to the hospital.

29
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm going to the hospital.

30
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to the hospital.

31
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm going to the hospital.

32
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to the hospital.

33
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm going to the hospital.

34
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm going to the hospital.

35
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to the hospital.

36
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to the hospital.

37
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm going to the hospital.

38
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to the hospital.

39
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm going to the hospital.

40
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to the hospital.

41
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm going to the hospital.

42
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to the hospital.

43
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm going to the hospital.

44
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to the hospital.

45
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to the hospital.

46
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to the hospital.

47
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm going to the hospital.

48
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm going to the hospital.

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Senior Sister, why don't you let me take the disciples out of the battle?

50
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Do you think that if we don't resist, the demon will let us go?

51
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You are good at everything, but you don't know what to do.

52
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Six Sects are great.

53
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They are not comparable to the Seven Sects.

54
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Even if we do our best now, we can't fight them.

55
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why don't we use the Mirror to move and preserve our strength?

56
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The Six Sects' purpose is to cultivate resources.

57
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't think they will make it hard for us.

58
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Senior Sister, if they take over Yue State and capture the mortals who have spirits,

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
what should we do?

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't know if this is a cultivation of resources.

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But I know that we can't just sit around and do nothing.

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Aren't you afraid that killing the real fire will lead the Six Sects to kill the Yuan Ying ancestors?

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Instead, you will be wronged and lose your life.

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It won't be like that.

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If we don't know what to do, we will do our best.

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Moreover, the Yuan Ying ancestors are mostly unreasonable.

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They don't know what to do.

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll tell you what I can't say.

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The evil path is so long.

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Do you know why the seven sects' Yuan Ying ancestors don't take action?

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's simple.

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because they know that they can't defeat them.

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The power of the Cultivation Immortal Sect is respected.

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The people of the Yuan Ying are all the same.

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The seven sects' Yuan Ying ancestors are all the same.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The six sects' Yuan Ying ancestors are all the same.

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The seven sects' Yuan Ying ancestors are all the same.

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The six sects' Yun Lu ancestors have fought before.

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But they all lost the battle.

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So in order to break through the war,

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
they worked hard to get into a fight with the evil path.

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The Yuan Ying ancestors of both sides are not allowed to participate in this battle.

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's true.

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I just started the war.

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's actually over.

86
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's actually because the war has been over for too long.

87
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The evil path is like a treasure in the heart.

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's like a thief.

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Not only the evil path,

90
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the Cultivation Immortal Sect is also a mess.

91
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They are waiting for the evil path to enter Yue Country.

92
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They can fight with each other to the death.

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Only then can they be in a mess.

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Senior Sister,

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
are you just watching the people of Yue Country suffer?

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I knew you would say that.

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So I'll give you one year.

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What one year?

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This year, no matter what you want to do,

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
killing the evil path or saving the mortal,

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I will not interfere.

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But the Cultivation Immortal Sect will not give you too much support.

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
After all, it's the decision of the Elder Tai Shang.

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can't go against it.

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
With your words,

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I am already very contented.

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Protect yourself.

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If the end of this war is destined,

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
then my mission is to save one more person.

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Senior Sister, I will use the time you have been fighting for me.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Episode 2

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The evil sect's troubles are quite arrogant lately.

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This month, we have lost more than twenty lands.

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Everyone, give me the sign.

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't fall into their trap.

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How is that possible?

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's still day time.

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm going to kill you.

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm going to kill you.

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm going to kill you.

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm going to kill you.

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm going to kill you.

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm going to kill you.

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm going to kill you.

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm going to kill you.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going to kill you.

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm going to kill you.

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm going to kill you.

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm going to kill you.

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm going to kill you.

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm going to kill you.

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm going to kill you.

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm going to kill you.

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm going to kill you.

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm going to kill you.

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to kill you.

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm going to kill you.

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What's wrong with the evil sect?

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Recently, what they are filming is a show of tricks.

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,900
Yan family and immediately

141
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,620
retreat to Jiuh negusion ofIn E Ni girls

142
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,000
Since the dissolution of Yan Family

143
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,080
This battle

144
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,320
We've fought for one year

145
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,480
The fighting also changed from the original

146
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,420
Big outs

147
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,100
Into mutual decision

148
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,240
Since the alliance was landscape

149
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,640
Many of them were located behind the front line

150
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,440
and were exposed under the fierce attack of the Demon.

151
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,380
Nothing is certain

152
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,740
Compared to the Teleport Army,

153
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,260
there are many fewer people

154
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,220
toating for the progeny.

155
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,260
And there were many ambushes

156
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,620
andns whip.

157
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,340
Both sidesaced the attack

158
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,780
and didn't attack at all.

159
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,260
The call of the soldiers

160
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,460
had a method of fighting

161
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,220
to foot-bbah

162
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,900
even if I want to bite him.

163
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,900
Few brothers and sisters

164
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,660
all participated in the big war at the beginning year.

165
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,420
It's meaningful

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,960
for you to give up all of it.

167
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,400
To me.

168
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,280
you've Syrian Vulture skills,

169
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,880
and the best opportunity for learning Jews.

170
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
and got a lot of spiritual masters' weapons.

171
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,080
But if we keep fighting like this,

172
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,480
will there be any result?

173
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,880
The King's Avatar

174
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,280
Do you remember the descendants of the royal family

175
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,480
of the State of Jiang and the State of Che?

176
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,280
I have arranged a way for them.

177
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,680
Now you will send them to a safe place.

178
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
What place?

179
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,080
The Nine-Gate Alliance.

180
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,480
Did you find a way for the Yanyue Sect?

181
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,080
Only go in, not retreat.

182
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Our Yanyue Sect will suffer a great loss.

183
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
If we retreat, the sea will be vast and the sky will be empty.

184
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,280
The seven sects will be defeated.

185
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
The sky will be empty.

186
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,280
Those old guys

187
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
should have arranged their retreats long ago.

188
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,280
It's a pity that those ordinary disciples

189
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,480
are so weak and weak.

190
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,080
The Yanyue Sect will survive under the leadership of the sect leader.

191
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,680
It's just that I am like a bird

192
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,880
who keeps talking.

193
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,280
But I can't save anyone

194
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,680
and save anyone.

195
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,680
I have to save you.

196
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Han Li.

197
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,080
I shouldn't have thought of him.

198
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,080
Where did you go?

199
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,480
Where did you go?

200
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
We are still fighting.

201
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
You are just like masters.

202
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
I have been holding this in my heart.

203
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,680
I can't see you anyway.

204
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,680
It doesn't matter if I tell you.

205
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,480
Are you willing to talk to me?

206
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,880
As long as you are willing to talk,

207
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,680
it doesn't matter what you say.

208
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,080
Before the war,

209
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,760
the seven sects and the Taoism Trial

210
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,280
signed a secret agreement.

211
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
Don't talk about such a secret thing.

212
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,080
Now,

213
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,080
the war situation is determined by the agreement.

214
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,480
The seven sects surrender.

215
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,280
Surrender before the fight?

216
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,480
This is not your style.

217
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,680
The agreement is agreed.

218
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,680
This war is only for the practitioners

219
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,080
under the Yuan Yin Qi.

220
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,280
So,

221
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,080
I can't save everyone.

222
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,280
We are low-level disciples.

223
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,080
We are still fighting in a stupid battle.

224
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,680
We have death and injury every day.

225
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,080
And you already know the ending.

226
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,080
It's so unfair.

227
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,080
The war is not an ordinary person's game.

228
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
But in the end, they have to pay the price.

229
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,280
I have been living for three hundred years

230
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,480
but I still don't understand.

231
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,880
It's so sad.

232
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,680
Don't cry.

233
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,680
You didn't do anything wrong.

234
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,280
I didn't do anything wrong.

235
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,280
I didn't do anything wrong.

236
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,080
I didn't do anything wrong.

237
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,080
I didn't do anything wrong.

238
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,880
I didn't do anything wrong.

239
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,080
I can't stop you.

240
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,280
I can't stop you.

241
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,880
Don't cry.

242
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,480
I'm here.

243
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Where are you?

244
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,480
Here.

245
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
I'm here.

246
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:56,980
Could Your Highness have youtube reaches to 15 now?

247
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,940
Stone God of Nan palace

248
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,080
You haven't moved

249
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,020
Will I arrive soon

250
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,900
About an hour from now

251
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,800
Is there anything wrong?

252
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,620
Nobody.

253
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,840
Lord Chen Liang.

254
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,100
This is the就會道助机器修施所

255
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,800
that three of us Самurai learnt today.

256
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,720
The operation was quite complicated.

257
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,180
He almost escaped.

258
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,820
We're new here.

259
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,260
Please be polite.

260
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,900
Why is there him everywhere?

261
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,180
Han Li.

262
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,820
Long time no see.

263
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,060
Han Li, Xiaoyou.

264
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,660
You've brought me a lot of gifts this time.

265
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,460
Now there is nothing to fear.

266
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,780
Nice.

267
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:43,220
You got five

268
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,500
I'm here to see you.

269
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,700
I'm here to see you.

270
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,660
Senior Han.

271
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,580
I haven't heard from you for a long time.

272
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,900
I didn't expect you to be here.

273
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,980
We haven't met for years.

274
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,460
I'm glad to see you.

275
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,580
You too.

276
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,020
Your cultivation is getting better.

277
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,580
Congratulations.

278
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,460
You got a chance to learn the Seven Devils.

279
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,540
It's just a coincidence.

280
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,460
I'm glad I came back without any trouble.

281
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,820
This is my second time

282
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,620
to learn the Seven Devils and learn the Seven Cultivations.

283
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,340
Congratulations.

284
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,820
I have something to do.

285
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,980
You asked Tong Qi to help you with the cultivation?

286
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,700
Congratulations.

287
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,140
I have something to do.

288
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,380
Why do I feel that

289
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,820
Han Li is getting different from before?

290
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,860
Why do I feel that

291
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,580
he doesn't look up to us now?

292
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,820
He told Senior Li.

293
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,300
How can he look up to us?

294
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,740
Senior Li likes to take in

295
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,420
a disciple who doesn't have any roots.

296
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,540
He's a weird old man.

297
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
Enough.

298
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,140
You don't even have a family?

299
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,740
That's not what I meant.

300
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,020
I mean...

301
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,820
Look at him.

302
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,660
He looks like a dog watching a man.

303
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,300
He's just like us.

304
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,220
He's just like us.

305
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,740
What's there to be attracted about?

306
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,100
This is your battle record.

307
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,460
Take it and leave.

308
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,740
You're making a fuss.

309
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
Elder Chen.

310
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,260
You're a member of the Chen family.

311
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,900
Why are you so nice to outsiders

312
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,180
than to us?

313
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,780
Could it be that he killed the Elixir Master?

314
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,700
How could it be?

315
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,780
Han Li killed the Elixir Master

316
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,820
who was in the same world as us.

317
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,860
That's right.

318
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,220
Could it be that he killed the Elixir Master?

319
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,140
How could it be?

320
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,260
Han Li killed the Elixir Master

321
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,260
who was in the same world as us.

322
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,100
That's right.

323
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,940
Why are you so cold to him?

324
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,420
He's just being rude to us.

325
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,740
Han Li killed the Elixir Master

326
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,300
for the 17th time.

327
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,700
He's a good fighter.

328
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,740
He killed the Elixir Master for the 17th time.

329
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,300
How could it be?

330
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,180
You killed the Elixir Master for the second time.

331
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,900
And you three killed him together.

332
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,580
And you're still here.

333
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,220
You're so shameless.

334
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,500
How could it be?

335
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,900
How could it be?

336
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,380
Miss Qiao Qian.

337
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,620
I think Han Li has a good cultivation.

338
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,180
He's been advancing and retreating.

339
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,260
He has a bright future.

340
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,180
If you have a relationship with him,

341
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,060
you must not miss it.

342
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,020
If you recruit more young fighters like him,

343
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,980
you'll be of great help to our Chen family.

344
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,260
I see, Elder Chen.

345
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,260
The high-level elixir furnace that was replaced by the military power

346
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,740
hasn't been tested yet.

347
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,340
You can try it.

348
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,940
Lotus powder.

349
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,540
The scent of the lotus.

350
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,100
What's the name of this elixir?

351
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,240
¡ road to sun,

352
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,460
фit with charcoal .

353
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,700
It will last youthful longer than smoke pearls.

354
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,220
It's nice.

355
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,620
Try it.

356
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,140
Yes.

357
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,660
He spread it.

358
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,340
Han.

359
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,340
I'm so envious.

360
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,340
I remember we entered the school together.

361
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,340
In terms of cultivation, you should be much taller than me.

362
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,340
Is it unreasonable to call me your junior again?

363
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,340
It's fine. I'm used to calling you that anyway.

364
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,340
I won't eat if you break through again.

365
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,340
I can call you whatever I want. It's fine.

366
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,340
Is there anything I can do for you?

367
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:28,340
Junior, do you know that our Chen family...

368
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,340
I want to ask you to be the guest of our Chen family.

369
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,340
This is the fixed date. We'll have to wait until next year.

370
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,340
I can't bear to leave you.

371
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,340
I'm still young and I'm not good at it.

372
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,340
Although I'm the master of the Wei Lin Sect,

373
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,340
if I really encounter any big problems,

374
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,340
I'm afraid I'll be the hindrance to the family.

375
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,340
Senior Chen, I'm afraid it's hard for me to bear this.

376
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,340
I can't take this temporary.

377
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,340
Why is it her?

378
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,340
Junior Han.

379
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,340
Take it.

380
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,340
You take it.

381
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,340
I can't take it.

382
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,340
Keep it.

383
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,340
You're indeed brilliant and smart.

384
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,340
You're smart and clever.

385
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
Shut your mouth.

386
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,340
Did you hear anything from that person?

387
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,340
I'm sorry, Young Master.

388
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,340
He's dead.

389
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,340
Dead?

390
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,340
No, I mean, I don't know where he is.

391
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,340
Don't worry about it.

392
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,340
I'm not worried?

393
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,340
Then you're worried?

394
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,340
What's the other side of the sea?

395
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,340
You don't want to know?

396
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,340
The world on the other side of the sea?

397
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,340
It's a pity that we've been investigating for so long.

398
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,340
We still don't know where the formation will go.

399
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,340
It's over there.

400
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,340
Junior Han, here.

401
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,340
Junior Han.

402
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,340
Not bad.

403
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Senior, Senior, long time no see.

404
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,340
Who wants to see you?

405
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,340
Junior Han, if you don't have feelings for Junior Sister Dong,

406
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,340
you should give her to Junior Wu.

407
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,340
You idiot.

408
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,340
Who would like someone to be with them?

409
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,340
Junior, don't blame Senior Liu.

410
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,340
He's angry because he touched a nose of ash

411
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,340
at Junior Xun'er's place.

412
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,340
Junior Dong is here too?

413
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,340
Junior Xun'er didn't want me to tell you.

414
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,340
He was confined by Uncle Hongfu for a long time.

415
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,340
Why did I think of him?

416
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,340
Wei Niang, don't take the same path.

417
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,340
Junior Han, not only we're here,

418
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,340
Master is also at the Golden Valley Garden.

419
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,340
The assassin is looking for you.

420
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,340
Senior, what's the matter that Master is looking for me?

421
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,340
Master didn't do anything.

422
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,340
He just said he had something important to discuss.

423
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,340
Hurry and go.

424
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,340
Even a lowly monk like Master came here to make a scene.

425
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,340
And so many core disciples.

426
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,340
It seems that the war here is getting more and more tense.

427
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,340
This place is not a place to stay for long.

428
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,340
I have to make a plan early.

429
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,340
It's necessary to send the stone.

430
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,340
The stone is bad.

431
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,340
There's something wrong with the stone.

432
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,340
Come here.

433
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,340
Let's go and collect the soldiers.

434
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,340
We've already caught a few of the Seven Sects.

435
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,340
We'll take them back to investigate.

436
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,340
Maybe we can find out the whereabouts of that guy.

437
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,340
It's him.

438
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,340
You...

439
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,340
It's really you.

440
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,340
What a coincidence.

441
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,340
Look.

442
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,340
Such a big place.

443
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,340
Yet we ran into each other again.

444
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,340
You didn't come to me on purpose, did you?

445
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,340
I want to take a good look at you.

446
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,340
Don't look at me like that.

447
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,340
Your face is not good.

448
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,340
Let me take a good look at you.

449
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,340
Not bad.

450
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,340
Really not bad.

451
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,340
Yun?

452
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,340
Why do you think my eyes are so easy to look at?

453
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,340
I can see you with my eyes.

454
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,340
I can figure out anything.

455
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,340
Why don't you talk?

456
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,340
Right.

457
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,340
You...

458
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,340
You demon!

459
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,340
Untie your demon tree and let me go.

460
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,340
You're really a man of your word.

461
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,340
Who are you scolding?

462
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,340
If you really talk about a demon,

463
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,340
you should call me cousin.

464
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,340
That day, in Yanjia Bao,

465
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,340
if that guy didn't step on you,

466
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,340
I would have accepted you long ago.

467
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,340
Who wants to be with you demon?

468
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,340
Who wants to be your relative?

469
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,340
My master is the first single-brother of the Yellow Wind Valley,

470
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,340
the Red-Haired Fairy.

471
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
Wait.

472
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,340
Red-Haired Fairy?

473
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,340
Your master?

474
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,340
Are you afraid?

475
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,340
Then this Red-Haired Fairy,

476
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,340
she didn't tell you anything?

477
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,340
She didn't tell you,

478
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,340
but she let you take her with you.

479
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
That means,

480
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,340
after so many years,

481
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,340
she still can't forget her.

482
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,340
She's really a man of her word.

483
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,340
What do you mean by that?

484
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,340
I don't understand.

485
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
Let me go.

486
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,340
You can't let me go now.

487
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,340
The Red-Haired Fairy

488
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,340
owes me a great favor.

489
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,340
What are you going to do?

490
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,340
Take you to your relative.

491
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,340
Let's go.

492
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,340
Let me go.

493
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,340
Demon, where are you taking me?

494
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,340
Demon,

495
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,340
I found you're a street merchant.

496
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,340
You're a great man of your word.

497
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,340
You said that your Wanbao House

498
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,340
has so many branches.

499
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,340
What's the point of

500
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,340
making a deal with us?

501
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,340
Besides,

502
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,340
that Han Bing Fu...

503
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
Han Bing Fu.

504
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,340
It's all over the street.

505
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,340
At most, it's worth two pieces of snacks.

506
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,340
Two pieces.

507
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,340
Do you know how much he sells?

508
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,340
Twenty.

509
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
Look.

510
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,340
A street merchant?

511
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,340
Who's a street merchant?

512
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,340
Who are you calling a street merchant?

513
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,340
Now the war is urgent.

514
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,340
The snacks are not enough.

515
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,340
The price has risen.

516
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,340
Do you want money?

517
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,340
The goods are transported to the front line.

518
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,340
Do you want money?

519
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,340
Not to mention the major sects.

520
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,340
Even the demons

521
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,340
come to me to steal things.

522
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,340
It's not

523
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,340
that much of a cost.

524
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,340
Do you understand?

525
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,340
Do you understand, you fool?

526
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
No, you...

527
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,340
Don't stand there and talk.

528
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,340
Don't be angry.

529
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,340
I'm not angry.

530
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,340
I'm not angry.

531
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,340
Don't stand there and talk.

532
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,340
Don't be angry.

533
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,340
Besides,

534
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,340
these are all

535
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,340
exchanged for war.

536
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,340
They say that

537
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,340
after the demons run away,

538
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,340
they'll pay the price together.

539
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,340
I'm so angry.

540
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,340
You're just like that.

541
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,340
Who knows the price of the moon and the moon?

542
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,340
So,

543
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,340
I'm doing business seriously.

544
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,340
A serious fair trade.

545
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
I'm asking you two seriously.

546
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
Do you understand?

547
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,340
Yes.

548
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,340
You...

549
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,340
Why can't you talk to him?

550
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,340
You always can't talk to me.

551
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,340
I'm not doing well today.

552
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
What are you doing?

553
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,340
You don't even eat.

554
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,340
You still want to fight with me?

555
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
You're so bold.

556
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,340
You...

557
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,340
Wait, wait.

558
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,340
Okay, you can do business.

559
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,340
But can you

560
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,340
read the friendship of your peers?

561
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,340
What attitude are you talking about?

562
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,340
Do you remember?

563
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,340
When Wanbao House was opened,

564
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
we paid for it.

565
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,340
Yes.

566
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,340
You're so stupid.

567
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,340
And...

568
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
Senior.

569
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,340
What are you looking at?

570
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,340
I'm talking to you.

571
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,340
If Senior didn't

572
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,340
give you two housing units,

573
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,340
would you be able to live there?

574
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,340
Yes.

575
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,340
You promised to help your peers

576
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,340
and make money.

577
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,340
Now,

578
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,340
you've changed.

579
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,340
Yes.

580
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,340
You've changed a lot.

581
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,340
You're not that disgusting.

582
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,340
No, no.

583
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,340
So, you...

584
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,340
You can't forget your promise, right?

585
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,340
What about your promise?

586
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,340
What about your promise?

587
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,340
You've lost your job.

588
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,340
Why are you still talking about your promise?

589
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,340
How can you two

590
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,340
talk about your promise to me?

591
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,340
Back then,

592
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
I couldn't afford to buy the unit.

593
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,340
I could only buy the housing unit.

594
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,340
You two have become

595
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,340
a big repairman.

596
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,340
A big repairman?

597
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
How can you know

598
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,340
about our low-level

599
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,340
and low-level repairs?

600
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,340
When and what you're going to say?

601
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,340
Do you understand or not?

602
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,340
I don't understand.

603
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,340
You...

604
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,340
You still have the nerve

605
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,340
to say low-level repairs?

606
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,340
I do.

607
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,340
You're counting your own family.

608
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,340
If you add them together,

609
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,340
it's even more important than the Yellow Wind Valley.

610
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,340
That's mine.

611
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
You have two relatives.

612
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,340
That's right.

613
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,340
You're right.

614
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,340
Right.

615
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
Right.

616
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,340
If you have a way, think about it.

617
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,340
If not, just die.

618
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
Go!

619
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,340
I can't stand it anymore. What about you?

620
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,340
I can't stand it anymore.

621
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,340
Okay.

622
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,340
I have to bully you today.

623
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,340
I'll let you taste

624
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,340
the real pain of losing your job.

625
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,340
Who's going to hit the machine?

626
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
Come back.

627
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,340
Who's going to hit the machine?

628
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,340
Stop. Don't run.

629
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,340
Who's going to hit the machine?

630
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Don't hide.

631
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
I'm not hitting you.

632
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,340
Enough.

633
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,340
Shi Bin, be respectful.

634
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
You're right.

635
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
Be respectful.

636
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
I'm talking about you.

637
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,340
You two.

638
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,340
It's okay not to bully you.

639
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,340
It's okay to cut the wrong part.

640
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,340
If we win,

641
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,340
the materials you sell to us

642
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,340
will be cheaper.

643
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,340
What are you cutting?

644
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,340
Isn't this a wrong part?

645
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,340
Wait.

646
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,340
Is it still the internal card?

647
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,340
No.

648
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,340
That's good.

649
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,340
It's better than the internal card.

650
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,340
This is a fake skill

651
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,340
made by the four-level monster.

652
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,340
It's made by the master of the door,

653
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
the master of the training machine,

654
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,340
who has worked hard for six months.

655
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,340
Not only is it very strong in defense,

656
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,340
it can also

657
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,340
break all the divine and practical tests.

658
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340
That's great.

659
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
But,

660
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,340
I just added a piece of paper.

661
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,340
I'm not suitable for the card today.

662
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,340
If you want to eat,

663
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
I'll leave.

664
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,340
Fu Yunzi.

665
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,340
Fu Yunzi.

666
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,340
You're so short.

667
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,340
How can you play the game?

668
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
You can't.

669
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
You always win.

670
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,340
Why do you run?

671
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
He's always like this.

672
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,340
You're still working with him.

673
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,340
What do you think?

674
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,340
Don't talk about him.

675
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,340
You're not as good as him.

676
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Then,

677
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,340
come on.

678
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,340
How can you come when you're short?

679
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,340
Why is it him?

680
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,340
I'm Wang Yu,

681
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,340
the manager of Wanbao House.

682
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,340
I'm Li Feiyu.

683
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,340
He's so well-known,

684
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,340
but he's also called Li Feiyu.

685
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,340
He can't recognize him.

686
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,340
Let's go.

687
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,340
Come on.

688
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,340
Boy.

689
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,340
Come here.

690
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,340
It's been a long time.

691
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,340
You don't play mahjong, do you?

692
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,340
I do.

693
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
Remember.

694
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,340
I'll pass the sound to you.

695
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,340
Give me the sound card if you want.

696
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,340
Master.

697
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,340
Come on.

698
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,340
We're here.

699
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,340
Nice to meet you, Uncle Hongfu.

700
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,340
This is my apprentice.

701
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,340
I'm Han Li.

702
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,340
Li Beizi Li.

703
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,340
He's Wang Yu.

704
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,340
He's the boss of Wanbao House.

705
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,340
All right.

706
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,340
We're here.

707
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,340
If I win,

708
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
give me half of your money.

709
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,340
Come on.

710
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,340
Get up.

711
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
Junior Xuan'er.

712
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,340
Junior Xuan'er.

713
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,340
Junior Xuan'er.

714
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,340
Wu.

715
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,340
I'm looking for Junior Xuan'er.

716
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,340
Did you see her?

717
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,340
No.

718
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,340
Xuan'er.

719
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,340
Wu.

720
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,340
Come on.

721
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Eat.

722
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
Mr. Han.

723
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,340
It's been more than a year.

724
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,340
You're already at the mid-term.

725
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,340
Your cultivation has improved so fast.

726
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,340
I'm flattered.

727
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,340
I'm just a coincidence.

728
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,340
I've got some financial concerns.

729
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,340
But my foundation is not stable.

730
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,340
I need to go to Qin's house to train.

731
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,340
Senior, I told you.

732
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
He's lucky.

733
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,340
He's good.

734
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,340
And he's a good person.

735
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,340
He's as mature and stable as me.

736
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,340
Brush your teeth.

737
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
What are you laughing at?

738
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,340
No.

739
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,340
I don't think so.

740
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,340
Why?

741
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,340
He's lucky.

742
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,340
He's much better than you.

743
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,340
He's done.

744
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,340
You're a real businessman.

745
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,340
Are you done?

746
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
Why are you done again?

747
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
You...

748
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,340
You're still not satisfied with your future?

749
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,340
I'm not stupid.

750
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,340
I can't see it.

751
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
Who's done?

752
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,340
Who's done?

753
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,340
Come on.

754
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Go on.

755
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,340
You can't leave without?

756
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,340
You're really dead for these two sons.

757
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,340
No, I can't.

758
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,340
I'll give you the dowry.

759
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
What?

760
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,340
No, I'll give you the dowry.

761
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,340
Really?

762
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,340
Yes.

763
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
You can't go back on your word.

764
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,340
Why?

765
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,340
I'll give you half of it.

766
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
That's more like it.

767
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,340
It's so obvious.

768
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
Hateful.

769
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,340
Wait and see.

770
00:34:51,340 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm not

771
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,200
to repair this heart.

772
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,600
What's the use?

773
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,520
You're here

774
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,840
to hurt the spring

775
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,680
and carry the ball.

776
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
What's the use of you?

777
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,520
Think about it.

778
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,160
Who can't see

779
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,280
your mind about the world?

780
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,160
It's louder than your voice.

781
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,800
You have to chase it.

782
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,000
You have to chase it.

783
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,600
Next time, let's make another arrangement.

784
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,760
I don't know how many hundred years later.

785
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,520
I'll go.

786
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,560
Okay.

787
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,920
I'm leaving.

788
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,440
Be careful when you're fighting.

789
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,240
I said I'm leaving.

790
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,000
Do you want to see me off?

791
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,480
You've already paid the price.

792
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
There's nothing to see you off.

793
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,680
What else is good?

794
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,880
You old bastard.

795
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,280
I have to torug your snack.

796
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,520
Uncle.

797
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,600
Master asked me to see him off.

798
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,920
Teacher can't let youolutly wreck it.

799
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,480
Here.

800
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,040
This is

801
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,360
the Express authenticationmarket of Wanbao侯l.

802
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,040
In the future, you should take it

803
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,000
to our Wanbao侯l.

804
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,120
Whatever rare treasures you have,

805
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,760
just give me 9% discount.

806
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,000
Thanks, Master.

807
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Thank you, Master.

808
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:31,920
Look at me.

809
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,360
Li Feiyu.

810
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,320
I didn't expect that

811
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,240
you've been

812
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,520
a central player

813
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,080
in the past years.

814
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Not bad.

815
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,040
But you must be

816
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,080
well-trained.

817
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,840
You must be well-trained.

818
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,280
Don't worry.

819
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,800
I have a secret.

820
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,840
If you encounter

821
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,120
any precious spirits,

822
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,200
just tell me.

823
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,720
Old Poison Dog.

824
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,440
It's my first time

825
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,760
to see you.

826
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,960
I think you're not bad.

827
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,240
But you have no future.

828
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,560
Why don't you let him

829
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,640
be my master?

830
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,320
Let him pass.

831
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,440
You're so mean.

832
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,680
You even

833
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,080
noticed my disciple's attention.

834
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,120
Go.

835
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,680
Don't let me see you again.

836
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,880
You're so stingy.

837
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,280
This Wang is so bad.

838
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,640
He even said that he's a robber.

839
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,680
He's just like me.

840
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,560
I beat him.

841
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,800
The most important thing is

842
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,400
he dares to hide behind you.

843
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,000
Tell me.

844
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,640
Anyway, I know

845
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,000
that he'll definitely lose

846
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,080
once he's on the table.

847
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,880
Wake up.

848
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,480
Who lost?

849
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,880
The three of us.

850
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,920
He gave us a discount.

851
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,960
He lost.

852
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,760
He's so loyal.

853
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,280
It's so meaningful to give us a discount.

854
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,840
Yes.

855
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,440
It's not easy to get hurt.

856
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,840
With this batch of materials,

857
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,680
our disciples' survival rate

858
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,520
is higher.

859
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,040
That's right.

860
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,680
Even the most basic Han Ming Talisman

861
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,440
can be useful

862
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,640
at critical times.

863
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:16,960
Yes.

864
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,040
We've all

865
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,480
owed so much.

866
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,240
You don't care about

867
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,160
Mr. Song when Wang Yu left.

868
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,760
I'm not going to let him go.

869
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
I'm going to let him go.

870
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,640
I won't let him go.

871
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,280
If you don't let him go,

872
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,520
you're really not going to let him go?

873
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,480
Next time we meet,

874
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,960
maybe it'll be a few hundred years later.

875
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,960
Why do you say that?

876
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,080
He also said that

877
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,000
he didn't know

878
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,280
what would happen next time.

879
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,640
Don't say that anymore.

880
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,560
It sounds uncomfortable.

881
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,760
I hope it ends soon.

882
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:41,960
How about this?

883
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,640
Let's invite Wang Yu and Pu Yunzi

884
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,720
to Huangfeng Valley.

885
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,640
Let's have a good time.

886
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,440
Okay.

887
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,160
You agree?

888
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,640
Yes.

889
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,280
That bad guy, Wang Yu,

890
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,360
really...

891
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,960
He said that

892
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,680
my mind is

893
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,960
lighter than the sound of the ship.

894
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,080
Mind?

895
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,160
What mind can you have?

896
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,520
What mind can I have?

897
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,440
I only have one mind.

898
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,240
Then I know.

899
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,400
You know?

900
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,800
You're so thoughtful.

901
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,240
You're right.

902
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,320
Master.

903
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,080
Master.

904
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,400
What's wrong?

905
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,000
Something happened.

906
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,800
What's going on?

907
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,720
Master.

908
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,600
I found this

909
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,640
on the front of the town.

910
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,600
Xuan'er's hairpin.

911
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,240
What happened?

912
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,640
The maid went out alone this morning

913
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,720
and didn't let me follow her.

914
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,560
After two hours,

915
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,360
I didn't see her come back.

916
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
I went to find her just now

917
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,800
and found the hairpin.

918
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,680
There was a demon's entry in the underground.

919
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,640
We can't let Xuan'er

920
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,360
fall into her hands.

921
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,320
I have to find her.

922
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,320
Let's go.

923
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,960
I'll go with you.

924
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,280
You can't go.

925
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,120
You have to be the witness.

926
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,040
Well.

927
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,760
You need my help?

928
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,960
You can send me the message anytime.

929
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,040
Don't just stand there.

930
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,800
Follow me.

931
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,360
Yes.

932
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,960
Boss Wan sent you away?

933
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,720
Yes.

934
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,480
What did she say?

935
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,800
She said she missed you.

936
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,080
Nothing else?

937
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,720
I got an token

938
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,120
with an offer to strike a 90% discount.

939
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,200
Let me see.

940
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:45,020
What a infamous

941
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,680
I only left a son without any roots.

942
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,280
He became a mortal.

943
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,480
I once made a vow

944
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,080
to protect them for the rest of their lives.

945
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,480
Now, they are settled in the capital.

946
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,080
I think they are the fourth generation.

947
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:12,780
The past conflicts in the cultivation world never involved any

948
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,380
So I'm worried.

949
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,780
I'm worried that they will attack the world of Yue.

950
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,580
Speaking of this, you seem to be from Yue, right?

951
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,780
Master, I couldn't practice properly.

952
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,380
I lost some of my memories.

953
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,780
I really can't remember where I was born.

954
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,580
Everyone in the cultivation world has their own secrets.

955
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,380
You don't need to explain too much.

956
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,780
Just like your roots, I never ask too much.

957
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,380
Right?

958
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,380
I only asked you to take me to the capital.

959
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,980
If the evil road attacks,

960
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,580
I hope you can protect this family.

961
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,380
Yue is the fatherland. It's a good opportunity to leave the battlefield.

962
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,780
I can't help it.

963
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,580
This is the Qin family's ancestral talisman. Take it.

964
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,780
This can only be considered as a personal request from me.

965
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,380
The family is very suspicious of the interference in the affairs of the world.

966
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,380
You should understand what I'm saying.

967
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,180
I will act secretly.

968
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,380
But...

969
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,180
But now, I'm looking forward to the confrontation with the evil road.

970
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,380
It's the time for me to be touched by the evil road.

971
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,980
What kind of idea is this kid up to?

972
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,180
So many battles haven't been exchanged yet.

973
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,780
This is a huge loss.

974
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,580
If I leave now,

975
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,780
I will be in a bad mood.

976
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,380
If you have seven sects,

977
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,580
no matter how much you kill, you can still be a good assistant.

978
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,580
But Master, the evil road is too arrogant.

979
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,580
It's no use to bully me and my seven sects.

980
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,780
Enough. You're the most reliable disciple in my sect.

981
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,980
That's why I'm letting you go. It's settled.

982
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,580
The key is that I've accumulated a lot of battle achievements in the Golden Valley Garden.

983
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:17,380
If I can stay, I will surely be able to obtain more and more.

984
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:21,180
This kid really knows how to bargain. He's really a stubborn person.

985
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,180
Fine. Fine.

986
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,380
How about this?

987
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,180
This trip counts as you completing the task of the sect.

988
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,980
The battle achievements within the sect.

989
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,980
I'll count it. I won't be lacking you.

990
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,780
Is that okay?

991
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,180
Master is so loyal and loyal.

992
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,780
I will surely not disappoint you.

993
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,380
Brother, you're being too careful.

994
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:52,180
But I like it. That's why I'm letting you go.

995
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,980
I will write a letter to the current owner of the Qin family.

996
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,980
No need to explain what others are asking about you.

997
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,180
You're always cautious. I don't need to explain anything.

998
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,980
Take this voice mail.

999
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,580
If there's anything, just send it to me.

1000
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,580
The Nan Gong Taoist from the Moon Sect

1001
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,380
is passing by this place.

1002
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,980
I already told him about it.

1003
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,580
Just take them to the Sky Moon Divine Beads.

1004
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,380
It's easier to act with them.

1005
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,980
He...

1006
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,900
in the next life,

1007
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,340
will finally see the kinds of lessons

1008
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,180
I'm going to learn from you.

1009
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,260
Alright.

1010
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,060
Then I must make one last wish.

1011
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,740
Forget about me for another few days.

1012
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,960
Guan 16-year-old Xiao Luosong.

1013
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,280
I've already told him about you.

1014
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,380
Guan 16-year-old Xiao Luosong?

1015
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,580
It's simRNA женщしい

1016
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,580
Didn't even tell me?

1017
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1018
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1019
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1020
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1021
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1022
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1023
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1024
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1025
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1026
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1027
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1028
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1029
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1030
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1031
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1032
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1033
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1034
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1035
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1036
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1037
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1038
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1039
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1040
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1041
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1042
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1043
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1044
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,580
I will never forget your kindness.

1045
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:29,580
In the moment of forever.

1046
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:39,580
In the moment of forever.
