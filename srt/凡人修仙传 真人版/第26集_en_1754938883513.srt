Episode 15

4
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,420
Qu Huen

5
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,040
Where have you gone?

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
There are fragments of dreams in my dream

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The blood falls on the water

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't want to leave this chance

9
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
There is a risk in the future

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I found you

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'd rather have a bad memory

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I always say the past is like a leaf

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Looking back, it's absurd and unbearable

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The lonely books in the bustling city

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I only remember the past six years

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The past is like a cloud

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The wind rises and the water falls

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why?

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why does he have the power of the five or six-level chain?

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Zhang Tian, is that you?

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're back

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I've already forgotten the world at the top of the mountain

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's yesterday

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's tomorrow

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Er Leng!

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Er Leng!

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Where did you go?

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Time will also erase all the clouds in the world

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Only this year has passed thousands of years

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Really?

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Zhang Tian, it's really you

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're back

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Dad!

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Dad!

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Good girl

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're here to get medicine for me?

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I've already eaten my meal

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Really?

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He's not Zhang Tian

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Who is he?

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm Zhang Tian

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You're quite like a play

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Who are you?

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Who are you?

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I should be asking you

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't understand what you're saying

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Really?

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're in someone else's body

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This woman and child are not yours

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I'm asking you

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Who are you?

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You know me

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
To be honest

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Since Wu Ning invited me to the cliff

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I've forgotten all the past

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't remember my name

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't know why I'm here

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
A friend seems to be calling me

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
She calls my name again and again

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But I just can't remember

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I must have forgotten something important

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Why?

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why can't I remember?

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Why?

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why can't I remember?

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why can't I remember?

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can't remember

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Zhang Tian

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't be like this

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's not your fault

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Zhang Tian

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
My name is Zhang Tian

73
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're not Zhang Tian

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How could you be him?

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're really like him

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He looks at you eating

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He's caring

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He even talks to you

79
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I almost believe that he's really back

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But a person's eyes can't fool others

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You have too many tricks in your eyes

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It can't be him

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So what?

84
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What does it have to do with you?

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The magic weapon

86
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
How could it be with you?

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This body doesn't belong to you

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Get out

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What's wrong, boss?

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Dad

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Did you hear anything?

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Dad

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
A wild cat wants to steal our little duck

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's out

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Madam

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This guest is...

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He's a friend of mine

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He insisted on me to give him a new weapon

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I've pushed him several times

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I didn't disturb you, right?

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Come in

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
No

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I have something to talk with my brother

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll go

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yue'er, go back to your room

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Close the door

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's windy

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Go

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Go back to your room

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Tell me

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Who are you?

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you tell me the truth

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I promise I won't hurt them

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If you dare to lie to me

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You can try

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I was fighting with my enemies

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I had to do this

120
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I had to control this body

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Please forgive me

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're still trying to make it up to me

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What's your profession?

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm from the forest tree mountain

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Do you also worship the same path?

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're a Taoist from the forest tree mountain

127
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I wonder if your sect's master is doing well

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I know him

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's great

130
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We're all familiar with each other

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes

132
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We're all familiar with each other

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You're familiar with each other

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You're not from the forest tree mountain anymore

135
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Are you not going to tell me?

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll tell you

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll tell you

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm the descendant of the Yuling Sect of Tian Du State

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm the descendant of the Liu Sect

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I was fighting with my enemies for years

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I was injured by the enemy

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
My body was damaged

144
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I was under the hideout

145
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I was under the hideout

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I found that there was no trick to the primordial spirit

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I found that there was no trick to the primordial spirit

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I didn't expect that my primordial spirit would become stronger after entering the ground

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I didn't expect that my primordial spirit would become stronger after entering the ground

150
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
In order to avoid the strong enemy

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I had to pretend to be an ordinary person

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I had to play a soldier in the city

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I played a soldier in the city

154
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I was alive

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Then I got more familiar with the people in the city

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Someone wanted to introduce me to the Qing clan

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Someone wanted to introduce me to the Qing clan

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Then they became my wife and children

159
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I didn't know that it had been five years

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,800
You didn't think of going back after you took the body?

161
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,880
The way of the devil is about the weak and the strong.

162
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,600
Now I have a lot of cultivation.

163
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
After I go back,

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,040
my friends will kill me.

165
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,600
Besides,

166
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,720
it's more comfortable to be held

167
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,800
than to be held by a sword.

168
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,800
And life is very peaceful now.

169
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,000
Why should I go back to die?

170
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,800
Peace?

171
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,480
The way of the devil is more than the country.

172
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,680
How long can the peace here be maintained?

173
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,600
The way of the devil?

174
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,800
How could it be?

175
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,400
You are really not a normal way of the devil.

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,600
Tell me.

177
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,040
Who are you?

178
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,760
It doesn't matter what my identity was before.

179
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,920
It's all over now.

180
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,280
Why should I be so harsh?

181
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,400
Just listen to me.

182
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,440
The seven sects have been defeated.

183
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
I'd better make a plan early.

184
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,080
Don't kill me.

185
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,120
He might know a lot.

186
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,000
We have to blow him up.

187
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,240
Now the war is about to begin.

188
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,640
The seven sects are all willing to fight against the devil.

189
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,840
The victory or defeat

190
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,320
is not a big deal, right?

191
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,640
The seven sects and the six sects are far apart.

192
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,520
The one who cultivates the way is the most selfish.

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,800
The one who stabs behind is the most common one.

194
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,320
You said the seven sects are like the same wall and the same wall.

195
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,560
I don't know

196
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,160
how we are infiltrated.

197
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,840
To be honest,

198
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,200
Ling Shoushan

199
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,240
is the spy of our Yueling Sect.

200
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,840
The six sects will win this war.

201
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,640
Ling Shoushan is a fake enemy.

202
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,480
He is a fake master of two big Jiedan Cultivators.

203
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,040
The seven sects are ignorant.

204
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,640
The spy is just

205
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,560
a ignorant person.

206
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,600
Without the king of the seven sects,

207
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,120
can you believe it?

208
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,920
Besides,

209
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,680
do you really think the king of the seven sects is a Jiedan Cultivator?

210
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,040
As far as I know,

211
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,200
there are three ways

212
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,200
to force the Jiuji Qi Cultivators to improve their skills

213
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,120
inside the six sects.

214
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,760
Although it's only effective in a short time,

215
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,680
it's enough to fool you.

216
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,960
Chuelles

217
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,160
Give me a reason

218
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,640
Qi Qingmetal Title gozira

219
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,340
If you could release me

220
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,300
I could tell your whereabouts

221
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,900
But I would seduce you from the technical knowledge

222
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,580
Anyway those things

223
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,140
can't fit into me

224
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,260
You have such a nice kind plan

225
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,480
Daoyou wealth

226
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,600
Never mind.

227
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,280
Now,

228
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,680
besides the magical weapon,

229
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,360
I also gave you

230
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,400
the letter of warning

231
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,480
from the spiritual leader.

232
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,680
If you don't like the thing,

233
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
you can kill me here.

234
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,160
I have no reason to do so.

235
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,080
But

236
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,280
please let them go.

237
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,560
They are ordinary people.

238
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,160
They are not evil.

239
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,240
This is so strange.

240
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240
Be careful not to get caught.

241
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,280
Where is the thing?

242
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,760
Right here.

243
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,720
If you are worried,

244
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,720
I will go with you.

245
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,240
Wait.

246
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,200
This doesn't seem like a good time

247
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,400
for you.

248
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,400
Let's take a little nap here.

249
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,020
All friends!

250
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,280
это

251
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,140
It's easy for you to say.

252
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,700
What are you afraid of?

253
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,380
This is a trap

254
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,900
What's none of your business?

255
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:57,760
Go

256
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,660
This is your peak time!

257
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,240
Now,

258
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,460
we are on the gardens here,

259
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:11,880
seeing the

260
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,760
chief inspector join us.

261
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Calling him

262
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,380
as Chief Inspector China,

263
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,160
showing my respect

264
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,800
for His Majesty.

265
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,400
I am

266
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,120
also willing to

267
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,680
tell you

268
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,640
ow!'

269
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,160
That's fast.

270
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:27,040
Braidspan Rock

271
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,920
You know to follow me

272
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,440
will disappear?

273
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:52,780
The

274
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,260
What is this?

275
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
It can fly?

276
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Even if it's not me,

277
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
I can't do it myself.

278
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:26,020
This is the skill of the

279
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,920
witch above me,

280
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,560
what you have always wanted to

281
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,680
disturb me from the start

282
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:56,840
so that he won't

283
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,240
escape the sinkhole

284
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,980
other strong

285
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,800
Will be Thinking Mm.

286
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,680
This is soCuCH.

287
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,440
We could have been je Solutions.

288
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,720
It's not far from Ma shock Brands login.

289
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,720
With such anды monster,

290
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,440
he couldn't escape.

291
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,600
There還是 be something

292
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,440
about the lancers with

293
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,960
Yulin clan on top of it.

294
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,920
But I can't change him

295
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Could it be that person is the one who stole the elixir?

296
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,640
Damn it.

297
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,600
I risked my life to get it back.

298
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,920
It's empty inside.

299
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,160
Fine.

300
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,000
You set up a trap on purpose.

301
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,160
Then don't blame me for being rude.

302
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,280
No.

303
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,600
I always just wanna have some fun.

304
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,000
You didn't die?

305
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,720
The power of this elixir

306
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,440
can rebuild yourootekaki instantly.

307
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
The Golden Diamond.

308
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
The Golden Diamond.

309
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
The Jade Emperor Sword.

310
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
The Golden Diamond.

311
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
The Golden Diamond.

312
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
The Golden Diamond.

313
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
And the Golden Diamond.

314
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
It seems that this person

315
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,920
used to be a Golden Diamond master.

316
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
The Golden...

317
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
The Golden Demon Wolf can't kill you.

318
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Today, I'm in your hands.

319
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
I'm not ashamed.

320
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
You are indeed a good master.

321
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
What else do you want to say?

322
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
Father.

323
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Big Father, what's wrong with you?

324
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
They...

325
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
They have nothing to do with this life.

326
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Please,

327
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
please don't make it hard for them.

328
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
I'm the one who made it hard for them.

329
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
You should know that

330
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
you are in a bad situation.

331
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,920
They have been with you for a long time.

332
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
They have lost their chance to live.

333
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
They should be able to live in a few days.

334
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
How can I not know?

335
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
My power

336
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
is in this pocket.

337
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
They are under the skin.

338
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
They can't afford to live.

339
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,920
They can only live for a few years.

340
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
You finally have a golden day.

341
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
Father.

342
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
I have been a bad person all my life.

343
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
I never wanted to live my last life

344
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,920
just for the sake of two mortals.

345
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
Big Father.

346
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Father, don't die.

347
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,920
The connection I made with you

348
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
is in my body

349
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
and in the cave.

350
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
I didn't lie to you.

351
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,920
The connection with the spirit beast mountain

352
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,920
and my identity card

353
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
are enough to prove what I said.

354
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Thank you, my friend.

355
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
Thank you.

356
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
After you wake up,

357
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,920
forget everything.

358
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
My friend,

359
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
what is real and what is fake

360
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
in your heart?

361
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
Now,

362
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,920
we should think about how to deal with that monster.

363
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
The five-star formation of the Hell Island

364
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
has never disappointed anyone.

365
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
The five-star formation of the Hell Island

366
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
This should be the remains

367
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
of the inner person of the Jade Tomb.

368
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
You are badly hurt.

369
00:28:47,920 --> 00:29:16,540
No wonder it's too late to clean up the

370
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:26,920
equipment,

371
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,920
The world's most powerful insect.

372
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,920
The Blood Fish Spider.

373
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,920
108th rank.

374
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,920
The Golden North Wolf. 73th rank.

375
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,920
The Stone Green Insect.

376
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,920
12th rank.

377
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
What?

378
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,920
It's not that reliable.

379
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,920
But the Golden North Wolf is actually only 73th rank.

380
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,920
It's not that reliable.

381
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,920
It's not that reliable.

382
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,920
But the Golden North Wolf is actually only 73th rank.

383
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,920
How to cultivate and control it?

384
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
Forget it.

385
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920
Let's study it when we have time.

386
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Found it.

387
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,920
A letter from the Lin Shoushan and Yulin Sect.

388
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
The Golden North Wolf.

389
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Episode 3

390
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Your master is gone.

391
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
You can rest in peace.

392
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,920
The account for my magic weapons

393
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
is the source of the material on you.

394
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
Zhou En.

395
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,920
I will be a great man for you by then.

396
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
It won't be easy.

397
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
Don't hurry.

398
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
I will be a great man for you by then.

399
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,920
One of the most powerful insects will die in the hurt.

400
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,920
This is the end of today's knowledge.

401
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,920
It's time to go back and do my news.

402
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
No matter what happens,

403
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
I still have to try my luck on everyone.

404
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,920
I'm not as good as you.

405
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,920
You're so skilled in fighting in the Golden Valley.

406
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
You can even face the enemy.

407
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
Now,

408
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,920
the Seven Sects are at the point of death.

409
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,920
Who can avoid it?

410
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,920
The younger disciples of the sect are still waiting.

411
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,920
I'm an old man.

412
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

413
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,920
Even if I don't fight for myself,

414
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,920
I can still fight for the sect.

415
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,920
I'm not afraid of the sect.

416
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
I have to fight for myself.

417
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
I have to fight for my own disciples.

418
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,920
Three of you, look who's here.

419
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Why don't you take a break?

420
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Shameless.

421
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
You're late.

422
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Why would you take a break?

423
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
I'm late.

424
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
I'm sorry.

425
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,920
Old Man Pan, when did you arrive?

426
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,920
I just arrived.

427
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Don't you think it's about the same?

428
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Stop it. Stop it.

429
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
I'm hungry. I'm thirsty.

430
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Hurry up and get the delicious cakes from the Golden Valley.

431
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,920
See?

432
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,920
There's plenty of food. Do you want some?

433
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
Enough. Enough.

434
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
Let's get to the point.

435
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
Hurry up and get your

436
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,920
upgraded version of the Four Seasons Demon Sword.

437
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Okay.

438
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,920
You're always so busy.

439
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
You're so boring.

440
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,920
Do you want to cut your teeth?

441
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
That's not bad.

442
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Take it back.

443
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
Fu Yun Zi,

444
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
don't come here every time

445
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
to eat and play.

446
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
I'm here to talk about business.

447
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
Exactly.

448
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Senior Sister, please.

449
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,920
According to the observation of the front line of our defense,

450
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
the bandits of the Demon Realm

451
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,920
are likely to set up a attack next month.

452
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
So, Junior Brother and I

453
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,920
are planning to arrange people

454
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,920
to guard the rear of their defense.

455
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,920
Aren't you going to prepare for the attack?

456
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
Senior Sister,

457
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
that's a great idea.

458
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,920
How about we make a bet

459
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
for this?

460
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
You have to make a bet?

461
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,920
Are you going to bet on success or failure?

462
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
Of course I'm going to bet on success.

463
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
What about us?

464
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Fail.

465
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
Get lost.

466
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,920
I'm going to die.

467
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Master,

468
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
I'm Han Li.

469
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
I'm from Jingqin.

470
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,920
I'm sorry that I've returned to Jingqin to be an official.

471
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Everything is fine in the valley.

472
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,920
I only think about you.

473
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
The front line of the defense is unclear.

474
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
On my way back to the valley,

475
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
I accidentally found that

476
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
the Lin Shou Mountain and the Jade Spirit Sect are colluding.

477
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
The plan is not good.

478
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,920
I've handed over the task to the sect leader.

479
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
The sect leader is powerful and powerful.

480
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
He has a wide range of abilities.

481
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
He's afraid that this will disturb the morale of the army

482
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
and will set a target.

483
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,920
I'm afraid that this will affect the front line of the defense.

484
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,920
It will make it difficult for you to deal with it.

485
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,920
I'll give you a few tips.

486
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
I'll write this letter as an order.

487
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Please be careful.

488
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
The people have arrived.

489
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,920
I hope that you can get the voice message

490
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,920
and think of a way to stop the worst outcome.

491
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,920
When the war starts,

492
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,920
you have to protect yourself.

493
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,920
This Golden-backed Wolf's armor...

494
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,920
Why are you thinking about it?

495
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,920
I'm just thinking,

496
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,920
I couldn't protect myself

497
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,920
after the Old Man Magistrate gave me the arrangements.

498
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
brown generic

499
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
red generic

500
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,920
light approximation

501
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,920
shadow

502
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
what about Kaixiang,

503
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
attacks of the third.

504
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
with tower?

505
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,920
The first thing in the third generation

506
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,920
ο

507
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,920
why don't you stop it?

508
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,920
The food is really big.

509
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
You ate a lot.

510
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Looks like this Ling Chong

511
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
is really not something that a normal person can afford.

512
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
I need to find time

513
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,920
to go to Baiyao Garden.

514
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Come.

515
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
Master, you're awake again so soon.

516
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,920
Under the mountain of Baili,

517
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
under the moon,

518
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,920
the sky is clear.

519
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,920
Why don't you walk for me?

520
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Do you still not recognize me?

521
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,920
Senior Sister Busy.

522
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,920
When I was young, my mother would often take me to the mountains to pick this wild chrysanthemum flower.

523
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:43,320
In her eyes, no matter how beautiful the flowers are, they are no match for the wild chrysanthemum here.

524
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,720
It's just that after she passed away a few years ago, I rarely came here.

525
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,520
Senior Sister, sorry.

526
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,920
It's fine.

527
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,720
It might be a kind of relief for her.

528
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,520
She also came to our Chen family for marriage.

529
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,120
Before the wedding, she and my father never met.

530
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,320
After marriage, they are very close.

531
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,520
But I know that they never had a fight.

532
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:27,920
Do you think that as a cultivator, I'm too ungrateful to think about these love affairs?

533
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Senior Sister, you're joking.

534
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,520
It's a pity that you don't know that these women from the Shi family,

535
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,320
since the day they were born, our lives are no longer ours.

536
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,920
Only day after day of cultivation, we bring benefits to the family.

537
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,120
There might be a rare talent that can be found within a hundred years,

538
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,120
and gain the trust of the seven sects,

539
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,720
and then exchange for the freedom of one's fate.

540
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,120
But more of them are like me.

541
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,520
Senior Sister, you're too modest.

542
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,520
Since you entered the valley, you've been very steady and unruly.

543
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,920
I think everyone sees you as that.

544
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,120
Even if you can't be called a talented person,

545
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,720
you're not as good as the disciples of the Shi family.

546
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,920
You know that I don't want to hear this from you.

547
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,720
Actually, I asked you here today to tell you

548
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,720
that in a few days, I might be getting married.

549
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,120
The other is the son of the Qi family.

550
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Although they never had a fight,

551
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,320
I heard that he was a decent man.

552
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,920
Now, the war is at its peak and everyone is at risk.

553
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,320
If our Chen family can ally with him and avoid war,

554
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,720
then...

555
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,720
In the capital, I saw Wei Niang and Senior Brother Liu.

556
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,120
I actually envy them a little.

557
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,120
At least they've met and loved each other.

558
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,920
Even if it's the two of them.

559
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,320
Even if it's the two of them,

560
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,720
it's better than

561
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,720
living a life

562
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,120
without freedom and having to be surrounded by sorrow.

563
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,720
Why?

564
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,920
Why did they want me to marry a man who's not even married?

565
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,320
Why did they treat me like a precious object?

566
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,720
Today, I'm marrying the Lu family. Tomorrow, I'm marrying the Qi family.

567
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,320
Why did they put the safety of the whole clan

568
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,720
on a woman?

569
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,720
No one ever asked me what I liked.

570
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,320
Never.

571
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,320
Can you let me lean on you?

572
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,520
Or you?

573
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,920
I know you're different from the others.

574
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Are you planning something?

575
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,720
Can you take me away?

576
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,320
Take me away from this place. Where can I go?

577
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,320
This is a free place.

578
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,720
This is a free place.

579
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,120
I've already done this much.

580
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,320
You can still hold on to it.

581
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,520
Isn't this embarrassing to you?

582
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,920
Could it be that you have someone you like?

583
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,720
Senior Sister, don't make fun of me.

584
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,320
The days and nights are still the same.

585
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,720
Thanks to the many times we've saved each other before.

586
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
I thank you again.

587
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,520
I don't have any suitable gift.

588
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,920
I have the embroidery craft.

589
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,920
I made a dress. Is it suitable?

590
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,320
It's the late-term embroidery. It should be more suitable.

591
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:33,520
It's just a gift. If you don't accept it, I can only throw it away.

592
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:40,640
Because I don't have

593
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,440
to touch it.

594
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,920
Senior Sister, it's really pretty.

595
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,120
Thank you, Senior Sister.

596
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,040
No mention.

597
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,600
And you still have the hairpin at the grantless water in Jing'an.

598
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,240
Senior sister.

599
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,760
I have some medicine with a good effect.

600
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,200
I made them myself.

601
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,400
Please take it.

602
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,520
Don't mind it.

603
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,520
As long as it's not some strange medicine.

604
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,280
It's late now.

605
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,320
I have to leave the valley.

606
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,280
Junior brother.

607
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,480
See you.

608
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,200
Take care, senior sister.

609
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,640
No matter what,

610
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,760
I hope you can find

611
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,560
your freedom.

612
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,320
It's always said that the past is like a night.

613
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:13,080
Looking back, it's absurd and unbearable.

614
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,200
The bustling city, loneliness and books

615
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,560
have destroyed the two sides of the same coin.

616
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,160
I only hope that

617
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
the past can be rewritten.

618
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,680
The wind rises and blows again.

619
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,560
It's like the change of fate.

620
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,240
Looking back, it's already in the mountain top.

621
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,080
I've forgotten the past.

622
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,360
It's yesterday.

623
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,600
It's tomorrow.

624
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,320
The sea of hurt is not as good as the past.

625
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:06,480
Time will also erase all the promises of time.

626
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,840
Only these four years

627
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,160
have passed thousands of years.

628
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:22,400
In the moment because of eternity,

629
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:33,600
in the moment because of eternity.
