Episode 16

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
How can there be such a half-blood in the Yellow Wind Valley?

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The main elixir is still in his hands.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This person really deserves to be killed.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But his cultivation is above me.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm afraid he can't beat me.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is the practice of the second level monster, Yin Du, of He Huang Wan.

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Come.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I really want to see how Junior Sister will become in a while.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I say, Taoist, after looking for so long, it's time to show yourself.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's you.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I've been looking for a chance to get rid of you.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I've come to the door myself.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I can only beat you.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I didn't expect you to be not only a thief, but also a thief.

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're so good at fighting.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're so good at fighting.

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're so good at fighting.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're so good at fighting.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're so good at fighting.

You're so good at fighting.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're so good at fighting.

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're so good at fighting.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're so good at fighting.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're so good at fighting.

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're so good at fighting.

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're so good at fighting.

You're so good at fighting.

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're so good at fighting.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You're so good at fighting.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're so good at fighting.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're so good at fighting.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're so good at fighting.

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're so good at fighting.

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're so good at fighting.

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're so good at fighting.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're so good at fighting.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're so good at fighting.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're so good at fighting.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're so good at fighting.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You're so good at fighting.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're so good at fighting.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're so good at fighting.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,960
Emperor Mei is here.

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,200
It works though hard.

72
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Purple Demon overdrei the Spirit Stone.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,880
You have no power left.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You haven't memorized it yet.

75
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,200
You're as weak as common weapons and you're still fighting me.

76
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,800
Pele?

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
from this ship.

78
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
After a trip of fifty microns,

79
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,040
your powered Arts canliament here at an instant.

80
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,960
Thank you for the reminder.

81
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,920
It is enough to use as a normal weapon.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
Isn't this my sister?

83
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
She didn't even change the box.

84
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,680
So, she sold the star-shaped one to her.

85
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,120
The boiled egg

86
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,920
is finally cooked.

87
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,360
The other one...

88
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,680
Just treat it as a revenge.

89
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,620
Qingyuan Commandery Council

90
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,760
Senior Chen.

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Senior Sister, be careful

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Your clothes, your clothes are open

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Your clothes are open

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Put your clothes on, quickly

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That bad guy gave you medicine

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Wake up, wake up

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Senior Sister

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Come

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Although it's a sword skill

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But killing a colleague is a big deal

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I can't do anything about killing

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So Senior Sister

103
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You'd better take the pill

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Take this pill

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
After taking this pill

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Everything that happened today

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And the fact that I appeared here

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You'd better forget it

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Senior Sister

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Have you got any news from Long Yan?

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I have

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I have

113
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Senior Sister

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Senior Sister

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Senior Sister

116
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Senior Sister

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Where are you?

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm here

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Senior Sister

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Senior Sister

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Senior Sister

122
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,160
Shall I demonstrate it?

123
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Okay

124
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
They say no one needed to wake up

125
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,160
But they're looking for the locust fetus

126
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
If we can find them

127
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
We'd have a better chance

128
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
The land is dangerous

129
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
We have tasks

130
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,160
Neither do we have time

131
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
to risk our lives

132
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Yeah

133
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,280
Once she's ill,

134
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,040
the plan is ruined.

135
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,400
Senior Sister,

136
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,800
I have an idea.

137
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,200
You can't do that.

138
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,160
The rules of Qi Sect are clear.

139
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,440
Only the disciples of the Qi Qi Sect

140
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,840
can enter the Blood Color forbidden area.

141
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,040
This is breaking the rules.

142
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
Senior Sister, you forgot?

143
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,080
The Su Niu Lun Hui Palace I built

144
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,480
can be separated from the palace.

145
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,240
As long as I suppress the cultivation of cultivation,

146
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
I'm a disciple of the Qi Qi Sect.

147
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,560
Who else can make a mistake?

148
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,400
Just for a blood flower,

149
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,480
you have to risk your life

150
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
to lower the cultivation of Qi Qi.

151
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,720
My ancestors

152
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,200
are willing to do it, but I don't agree.

153
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
The Yans' poison seed

154
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,760
has happened in our Yanyuan Sect.

155
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,680
I should do my best to help.

156
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,280
Moreover,

157
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,960
I like Yan Ru Yan very much.

158
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,520
Moreover,

159
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,800
Yan's Castle is on the border of Yue State.

160
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,040
It has been a hundred years since the seven sects have resisted the evil.

161
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,320
The effort is great.

162
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,840
I believe that as long as I go to the forbidden area,

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,640
I can definitely get the blood flower back

164
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,920
and save Yan Ru Yan's life.

165
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,400
And the thing we're looking for is very important.

166
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Only I can take it back without any loss.

167
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,800
Besides, the palace will recover soon.

168
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,040
It's settled then.

169
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,480
We must keep this secret.

170
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,920
Young Master,

171
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,320
your blood-spirit magic is getting more and more exquisite.

172
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,360
I asked you to investigate the people who went to the forbidden area

173
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,720
to practice in the Lingshou Mountain.

174
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,480
Where is the list?

175
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,840
There are many people who have signed up for it.

176
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,800
But aren't we going to pick

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,080
some obedient people?

178
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,360
Are we going to pick the obedient ones

179
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,320
or the important ones?

180
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,760
What are you talking about, Young Master?

181
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,600
I'm not going to pick the obedient ones.

182
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,320
I'm going to pick the most important ones.

183
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,680
Okay.

184
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,880
Let's say Yan Lei.

185
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,360
He has been here for seven or eight times.

186
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,920
It's the first time I've ever received a gift.

187
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,080
I think you'll like that gift.

188
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,080
But don't worry, Young Master.

189
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
We just kept it.

190
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,120
We still won't let him participate.

191
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,640
Who told him to be from Yan's family?

192
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,880
Yan's family?

193
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,720
Master,

194
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,120
the members of the various sects who participated in the blood-spirit test

195
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,320
have been decided.

196
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,680
Even if I, Yan's disciple,

197
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,320
give a gift,

198
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,480
I may not be able to go in.

199
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,720
But the people of the Yan Yue Sect said

200
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,160
they will find a way

201
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,120
to help us pick up the blood-spirit flower

202
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,720
and let us wait for good news.

203
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
Yan'er was in trouble at their place.

204
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,720
Yan'er was in trouble at their place.

205
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,480
Yan'er was in trouble at Yan's place.

206
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,360
Yan'er was in trouble at Yan's place.

207
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,080
Yan'er was in trouble at Yan's place.

208
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,880
Yan'er was in trouble at Yan's place.

209
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,360
They should have done that.

210
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,120
That's what I said.

211
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,400
But...

212
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,320
But in this world,

213
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,920
it's all about exchange of interests.

214
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,600
Elder Liu,

215
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,920
please go to the Yan Yue Sect again

216
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,120
and give this letter to their leader.

217
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,600
As long as they can get close to power,

218
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,480
and find the blood-spirit flower, Yan'er will be saved.

219
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,640
The mine of Yan's family treasure

220
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,000
is given to them.

221
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,720
Uncle Fang,

222
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,960
we can't do that.

223
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,600
No.

224
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,040
The mine's income

225
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,840
is the life of our family treasure.

226
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,960
It's easy to give it to the Yan Yue Sect.

227
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,440
I only have this daughter.

228
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,840
I can even risk my life to save her.

229
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,440
Not to mention the little spiritual stone business.

230
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,560
Who is it?

231
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,120
The Jiedan Xiu Shi.

232
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
It's just the first stage.

233
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,920
The second stage of the first stage

234
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
can only be led by the Jiedan Xiu Shi.

235
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
I just want to go to the Blood-spirit Flower.

236
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,800
What's the purpose of the Yan's family treasure?

237
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,840
Who are you?

238
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,160
I'm the Young Master of the Ghost Realm, Wang Chan.

239
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm the son of Wang Tian Gu.

240
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,760
That's right.

241
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I heard that the Master has been thinking of many ways

242
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,560
to make the disciples of the Yan's family treasure

243
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:52,100
to go to the Blood-spirit Flower to test the

244
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,600
I think there must be something important to take.

245
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,200
Since the Seven Sects are unwilling to help,

246
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,840
why don't you come to our Six Sects to discuss?

247
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,400
The Seven Sects have always been self-reliant

248
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,000
but they are also fighting against the Blood-spirit Flower.

249
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,400
It's hard for them to do things.

250
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,600
You are the master of the Yan's family treasure.

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So,

252
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,600
will you be too humble?

253
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
What do you want to say?

254
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,400
I can arrange someone to go to the forbidden area

255
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,200
and get what you want.

256
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
No matter what it is,

257
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,200
I can help you.

258
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,400
You haven't forgotten that

259
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
the Yan's family treasure and the Ghost Realm

260
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,200
were a family hundreds of years ago.

261
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
You should go back first.

262
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
I'm afraid that the Yan's family treasure

263
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
will be lost.

264
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Don't forget that

265
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,240
the one who is willing to help you is a friend.

266
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,640
Stop talking. Let's go.

267
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
How is the investigation going?

268
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Yan Yushan sent someone to the forbidden area

269
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
not to kill the chicken eggs,

270
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,240
but because he was ill and passed away.

271
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
His daughter?

272
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
His daughter?

273
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Yes.

274
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Her name is Jian Ruoyan.

275
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,240
She has been a part of the Tianling Sect for hundreds of years.

276
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Tianling Sect?

277
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
So,

278
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,240
the Yan's family treasure must be taken.

279
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
But

280
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,240
she is in danger of death.

281
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
She needs to be saved.

282
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
She needs to be saved by the snow lotus

283
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
that grew in the forbidden area.

284
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Then she will die.

285
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
I see.

286
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
That means

287
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
as long as she has the snow lotus,

288
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
she can take over the Yan's family treasure.

289
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
If she has the Yan's family treasure,

290
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,880
she can take over the chance of the war.

291
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Interesting.

292
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,880
Now, she has something to do at noon.

293
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Tianling Sect.

294
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
I finally found you.

295
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
Okay.

296
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,880
She won't remember what happened that day, right?

297
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
The weather is good today.

298
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
We can see snow mountains.

299
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Where is Master?

300
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Master.

301
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
You see?

302
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
This is the skill of the thousand-level attack.

303
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,880
You will be sent to the forbidden area

304
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,880
and will be attacked at random.

305
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
The location of your being sent

306
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
is all up to your luck.

307
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
What the sect can do is

308
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
to plant the skill of the thousand-level attack

309
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,880
on you.

310
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Within a certain range,

311
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,880
you can sense the direction of your fellow sect.

312
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
This time,

313
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
all the sects are fighting in secret.

314
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
The number of the grass picked

315
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
will directly affect

316
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,520
the status of the sects in the next 60 years.

317
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
The Yan Yue Sect is relying on their own power

318
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,520
to modify the time of the forbidden area.

319
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
We, the Lin Shoushan,

320
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
can never step on their feet for them.

321
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
We have to let them know

322
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,520
who is the most capable of the seven sects.

323
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
I'm sorry.

324
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
I know.

326
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
I know.

327
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
I know.

328
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
I know.

329
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
I know.

330
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Let's go.

331
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
What's this?

332
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
It's been a few days.

333
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Why are you getting fatter?

334
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Let's go.

335
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Hurry up.

336
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Let's go.

337
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Let's go.

338
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Let's fly.

339
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,160
Let's go.

340
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,160
Let's go.

341
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
Hold on.

342
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
We're almost there.

343
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Everyone,

344
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
be careful.

345
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Don't let the people of the Yan family

346
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
get the blood lotus.

347
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
The seven sects of the Yudou Sect

348
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
are the best disciples.

349
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
You must kill them all

350
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
and get the blood lotus.

351
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
Of course.

352
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
This is the forbidden area of the blood lotus.

353
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Why isn't there anything?

354
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
This is the forbidden area of the blood lotus.

355
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Why isn't there anything?

356
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,160
Why isn't there anything?

357
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Why isn't there anything?

358
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
The forbidden area is open.

359
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Why isn't there anything?

360
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
Why isn't there anything?

361
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Why isn't there anything?

362
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Why isn't there anything?

363
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Why isn't there anything?

364
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
Why isn't there anything?

365
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
Why isn't there anything?

366
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Why isn't there anything?

367
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,160
Why isn't there anything?

368
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
Why isn't there anything?

369
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
Why isn't there anything?

370
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Why isn't there anything?

371
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Why isn't there anything?

372
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Why isn't there anything?

373
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
Why isn't there anything?

374
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,160
Why isn't there anything?

375
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Why isn't there anything?

376
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
Why isn't there anything?

377
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
Why isn't there anything?

378
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,160
Why isn't there anything?

379
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Why isn't there anything?

380
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Why isn't there anything?

381
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Why isn't there anything?

382
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
Why isn't there anything?

383
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Why isn't there anything?

384
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
Why isn't there anything?

385
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Why isn't there anything?

386
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,040
Notice, Teacher.

387
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Treasure Dungeon.

388
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Go back.

389
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Where are we?

390
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,400
Hide first.

391
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Observe a bit.

392
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,560
Who's going to the door?

393
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,160
We can't go in.

394
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Senior Brother Li.

395
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Senior Brother Yuan.

396
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
We're here.

397
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,560
Hurry.

398
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Let's go.

399
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Are there disciples of Huangfeng Valley ahead?

400
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,360
Sister.

401
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Time is limited.

402
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,560
Let's go.

403
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,160
Let's go.

404
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,160
The secret of Little Green Bottle

405
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,560
can't be known to them.

406
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,960
Let's act alone next.

407
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,360
Brother Xiang.

408
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
Go.

409
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,560
The show is about to start.

410
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
The spirit energy has become weak.

411
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,360
Master.

412
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Master.

413
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
Master.

414
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Master.

415
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Master.

416
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Master.

417
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,560
I didn't expect the soul-suppressing talisman to be useful.

418
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,960
It seems that the spirit energy can be connected to each other.

419
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,560
Even if it's sent randomly,

420
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,560
there's a chance that it will be scattered around each other.

421
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,960
It's here.

422
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,560
It seems that we're lucky.

423
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,360
Why are you two coming?

424
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,560
Go and check it.

425
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,960
If we try to figure out it,

426
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,800
we still can't find it.

427
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,960
Then, we don't need to worry about fighting with others.

428
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,760
Just take some herbs and seeds and use the small green bottle to make it ripe.

429
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,760
The Green Bottle

430
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,160
Excuse me. Excuse me.

431
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,560
Come.

432
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,160
Come.

433
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,760
turmoil

434
00:27:47,760 --> 00:28:09,060
Golden Soldiers.

435
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,240
People will die so soon.

436
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,240
Watch out.

437
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
Don't be like him.

438
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,800
N�stong through Unaial Mongols

439
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,960
appears by hypothetical placed on a rock

440
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,480
The terrain has a shallow skin.

441
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,700
She is at the center of Mt. J才

442
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:53,420
With a map girl

443
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,480
That's strong

444
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,880
potatoes

445
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,640
Hanyan Grass

446
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,000
good material

447
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,800
forilly

448
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:30,760
who's there

449
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,680
Come out.

450
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,640
I saw you.

451
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,960
Is my hidden talisman out of order?

452
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,040
Come out.

453
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,640
I saw you.

454
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,400
Look and ask for me.

455
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,460
There you are, my little darling.

456
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,400
Let iconic halberd stay here.

457
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,920
Brother Yu,

458
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,800
you're so bad at offering energy drinks.

459
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
You're so nice to Han Bingchan.

460
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,120
He killed another martial arts expert.

461
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,920
These guys have made a great contribution.

462
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,160
Han Bingchan is a gentle person.

463
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,200
As long as we don't provoke him,

464
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,320
he won't attack anyone.

465
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,360
Old Ji, take the herbal medicine.

466
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,880
There's no need to do that for a grassy plant.

467
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,640
Let them take it.

468
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,400
My good boy.

469
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,600
I didn't expect to see you here.

470
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,600
Be careful. Don't get ambushed.

471
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,120
This person is very cautious.

472
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,600
I didn't expect him to die so quickly.

473
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,680
These two people went there to kill people.

474
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,880
What attack was it?

475
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,000
Why aren't they leaving?

476
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,600
Forget it. They won't leave. I'll leave.

477
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,320
I didn't expect him to be so handsome.

478
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,880
That's right.

479
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,520
Let's take his bag too.

480
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,000
Okay.

481
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,680
That's weird. He was here just now.

482
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,240
Could it be that there's someone else here?

483
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,280
I didn't find the forest grass.

484
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,880
But I did pick up a lot of bamboo.

485
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,280
Where should we go next?

486
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,480
There's no purple and red flowers around here.

487
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,480
It seems that the map sent by the sect is not reliable.

488
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Senior Xiao, the road is slippery. Slow down.

489
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,480
I just came here to get to know the road.

490
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
When I meet the spirit beast,

491
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,280
I'll have to rely on you young men.

492
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,480
What's the problem?

493
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,880
This forbidden area is like a dead maze.

494
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,680
Knowing the road is the most important.

495
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,480
Senior Xiao is a good student.

496
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,880
The three of us will be able to work together.

497
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,080
How come Senior Xiao is with other sect's disciples?

498
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,680
Junior Han, I didn't expect to meet you here.

499
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
Junior Han.

500
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
How is it?

501
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Let's go together.

502
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,480
We can take care of each other.

503
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,280
Junior Han, you don't know that

504
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,480
the map of the forbidden area

505
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,480
is marked differently by each sect.

506
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,280
So, it's more important to work together

507
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,480
and cooperate with each other.

508
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Thank you for your kind words.

509
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,080
But I'm not that good.

510
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,080
This is my first time here.

511
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,880
I just want to pick some herbs and plant them.

512
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,880
I don't dare to drag you down.

513
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,280
It's fine.

514
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,080
But Junior Han, you don't have to refuse so quickly.

515
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:38,880
Is there anything that Junior Han wants to achieve?

516
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,880
Since he's not a good student,

517
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,480
why do you have to talk to him?

518
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,880
That's right, Junior Brother Xiao. Let him kill himself.

519
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,480
Everyone, I'm leaving.

520
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,880
There's no other way. We can only change the direction.

521
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Junior Brother Xiao has reached the forbidden area.

522
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,880
How can he be different from the usual people?

523
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
Hello, Old Du.

524
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
Hello, Old Du.

525
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
Why didn't you say yes?

526
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,080
What's the matter?

527
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,880
Why don't we go back?

528
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,080
Why are you hiding? I won't hide.

529
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
This battle...

530
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,080
I'm not hiding.

531
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,080
I'm not hiding.

532
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,280
This battle is related to the development of our seven sects

533
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,280
for the next sixty years, right?

534
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,280
There's no problem.

535
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,880
So, let's bet on which sect will be the leader.

536
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,280
Fine.

537
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,080
What you said is not true.

538
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,880
What if it's the same?

539
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,280
Right? That's a problem.

540
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,080
Let me think about it.

541
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,880
How about this? Let's bet.

542
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,680
The disciples that came out, are they single or double?

543
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,880
Get lost.

544
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,280
Fatty, are you betting or not?

545
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,880
I'm not betting with you.

546
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,680
You're so boring.

547
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,880
Come on.

548
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,880
How about this?

549
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,880
I'll use two bloodline and internal organs

550
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,280
to make two pieces of metal.

551
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,480
It's cheaper than the war.

552
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,280
Bloodline and internal organs.

553
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,080
How about it?

554
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,880
Fine. Two pieces of metal.

555
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
Come on.

556
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,480
Straight to the soul.

557
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,280
Whoever guesses the soul is more likely to win.

558
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,480
We've agreed.

559
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,080
He's of my family.

560
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
Who the hellWo Someday

561
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,480
Why I family

562
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,880
That's the men,

563
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,080
The men of the dead again.

564
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,160
it's right here.

565
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,440
We can't

566
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,760
commit a murder to have a murder,

567
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,680
that's the first thing.

568
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,360
I'll come to see you next time!

569
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,020
Go for it.

570
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,220
Who's there?

571
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
It's that boy, Nan Xiaohui.

572
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Should we ask him?

573
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,480
I had to suppress my cultivation to get into the Golden Emperor.

574
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
It's just that I can't change my mind.

575
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
Let's move on with the mission first.

576
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
No need to be so direct.

577
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Let's think of a way to meet with the other disciples first.

578
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,480
Let's bury them.

579
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Yes, Grand Master.

580
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,480
This should be a safe place.

581
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,480
The first day is over.

582
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,480
I haven't found anything yet.

583
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Everyone in the West Sect,

584
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,480
congratulations on your luck in surviving the first day.

585
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,480
But the dark night that is now in danger is more dangerous than the day.

586
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
The dead may fall from the sky.

587
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Everyone, find a good place to hide.

588
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,480
That Senior Brother Xiang is so familiar with the Golden Emperor.

589
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
He actually came in three times and still hasn't come out.

590
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,480
I can't be like him.

591
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,480
I won't come to this Golden Emperor for the second time.

592
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,480
I won't come to this Golden Emperor for the second time.

593
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,480
This rain is so cold.

594
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
It smells so good.

595
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
Hurry and go to the Golden Emperor.

596
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Yes.

597
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Hurry.

598
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,480
Hurry.

599
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,480
Hurry.

600
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
Hurry.

601
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,480
Hurry.

602
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,480
Hurry.

603
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,480
Hurry.

604
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,480
Hurry.

605
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,480
Hurry.

606
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Hurry.

607
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,480
It smells so good.

608
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Hurry and go to the Palace of Jade and Cold.

609
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Why did so many people die on the first day?

610
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,480
It seems that the ones who fought this time are stronger than we thought.

611
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,480
The Heaven and Earth Spell have a reaction.

612
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
Hurry.

613
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,480
Don't kill me.

614
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,480
Senior Brother, save me.

615
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,480
What a terrible move.

616
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,480
Senior Brother.

617
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,480
You're hurting me again.

618
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,480
I'm sorry.

619
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,480
I'm sorry.

620
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,480
I'm sorry.

621
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,480
I'm sorry.

622
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,480
I'm sorry.

623
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,480
I'm sorry.

624
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,480

I'm sorry.

632
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,480
I'm sorry.

633
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,480
I'm sorry.

634
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,480

I'm sorry.

641
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,480
I'm sorry.

642
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,480
I'm sorry.

643
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,480
I'm sorry.

644
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,480
I'm sorry.

645
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,480
I'm sorry.

646
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,480
