1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm ordinary, I'm alone in the battle, the world is full of ups and downs

2
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm ordinary, I'm alone in the battle, the world is full of ups and downs

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm ordinary, I'm alone in the battle, the world is full of ups and downs

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm ordinary, I'm alone in the battle, the world is full of ups and downs

5
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm ordinary, I'm alone in the battle, the world is full of ups and downs

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 1

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Where are you going?

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Can you find a good cave? It's up to you.

9
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Can't you just walk normally?

10
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I spent so much time to find a cave for me.

11
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I didn't find a cave, and I'm still looking for you.

12
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The cave is hidden in the forest.

13
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Little guy, you really found it.

14
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hide well.

15
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm going to find a cave.

16
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's really dark.

17
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Come on.

18
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm going to find a cave.

19
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
There's a tree.

20
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's really more sweet than me.

21
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Eat.

22
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Come.

23
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Eat.

24
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Go, go, go.

25
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Go, go, go, go.

26
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's so sweet that I can't help having a big mouth like you.

27
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,040
You usually can

28
00:05:43,040 --> 00:06:03,220
but you seem to beσα

29
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,260
Gao Yujing

30
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,600
is for your commission

31
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,640
Okay

32
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,740
Why don't you accept my offer?

33
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,740
The nature and spiritual power are really rare.

34
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,740
As a cultivator, I'm the most skilled.

35
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,740
Here.

36
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,740
I'll give you one.

37
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Spirit grass?

38
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,740
Why is there a spirit grass here?

39
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,740
I can secretly plant a spirit grass here and not be discovered by others.

40
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,740
A little garden of Hanli.

41
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Stop! Stop! Stop!

42
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,740
Stop it!

43
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
I told you.

44
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,740
This bowl is too much to eat. It won't catch fire.

45
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,740
These are all my treasures. Did you hear that?

46
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Hurry up and spit it out! Spit it out!

47
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
Come on!

48
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,740
Come on.

49
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,740
There's a spiritual power and a spirit grass.

50
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,740
It's really a good place to cultivate.

51
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,740
Good place. Good place.

52
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
You want to sleep too?

53
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,740
You're really good.

54
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,740
You're really good at climbing up.

55
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,740
It's late.

56
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,740
Defend the formation.

57
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Now, the work is done.

58
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Now, I have to plan it well.

59
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,740
First, I have to have a place to sleep.

60
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,740
Bed.

61
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
Okay.

62
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
I'm going to sleep.

63
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,740
Not bad.

64
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,740
It's really not bad.

65
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,740
I can make a cup of tea here.

66
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,740
Hurry up! Hurry up!

67
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
Enough.

68
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,740
I fed you earlier.

69
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,740
Don't be greedy.

70
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
How did you get in?

71
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
It seems that Uncle Wu is right.

72
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
Bai Song's formation is not reliable.

73
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
It's really not reliable.

74
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,740
Where can I find a good defense formation?

75
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
Excuse me.

76
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Yuan Wu Kingdom?

77
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
Yuan Wu Kingdom?

78
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,740
It's not far from Yue Country.

79
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,740
It's quite close.

80
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,740
How about I go to Yuan Wu Kingdom?

81
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,740
Don't follow me.

82
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,740
Look after the house.

83
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,740
Don't let him in.

84
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,740
No!

85
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
Let him go.

86
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,740
OK, you made it.

87
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
Congratulations on the treasure.

88
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,480

At the auction,

92
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,660
maybe we can find something good about the formation of the formation.

93
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,060
I'll sell something first

94
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,900
to see how many customers are coming today.

95
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,180

I want to see it.

00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,660
I'll exchange it for this spirit grass.

107
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,060
High-level formation?

108
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,260
That's worth tens of thousands of taels.

109
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,180
Yeah.

110
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,860
This is a high-level formation.

111
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,620
Yes.

112
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,340
But...

113
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,540
But it's not fully done.

114
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,700
Who is that?

115
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,460
You're just a piece of junk.

116
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,060
Don't be so embarrassing.

117
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,220

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,180
Strange.

133

They run here!

134
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,620
You!

135
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,620
Just look at this coward!

136
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,540
He's a GL!

137
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,820

138
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,260
Chase!

139
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,820
A land plots have delivered negative results.

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:06,740
congratulations

141
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,740
this Formation gold is really not bad

142
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,700
If I can have such a formation

143
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,980
then little animals

144
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,940
could never enter my opening house

145
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:41,580
I meant up for you whether you二手弟弟和裙骨精一一都不包 creating a others association is calling me who another way of resurrection

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,620
Bull底

147
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,140
Didn't say

148
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:49,780
陶军

149
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,220
Um

150
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,720
Breaking them both

151
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,020
Yuan Xiao is my name

152
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,020
My family name is Qi

153
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,220
The gold sugar is yours

154
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,620
Don't you sell it already?

155
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Who's going to order

156
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,140
I can't help you

157
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,980
Right

158
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,820
That's great

159
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,380
Can you show me?

160
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:30,940
Well

161
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,620
You are a businessman

162
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,020
We are in the business

163
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,860
You show me a high-end treasure here

164
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,860
I will show you my gold

165
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,740
I will show you my gold

166
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,380
I don't like the treasure here

167
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,700
Ok

168
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,900
Brother, please come with me

169
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,180
Really?

170
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,060
The formation is really good

171
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,320
It doesn't work

172
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,980
This is...

173
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,780
Don't touch it.

174
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,820
It's a training.

175
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,860
You're the one who made these formation?

176
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,620
I'm a professional.

177
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,580
Formation is the hand of another person.

178
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,540
Brother, wait a minute.

179
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,340
Brother,

180
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,620
what do you think of the reverse five-storied formation?

181
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,820
Reverse five-storied formation?

182
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,220
It's the formation that exploded just now.

183
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,740
The explosion was not because of the formation.

184
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,300
It's because I didn't have enough spiritual sense and couldn't charge.

185
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,340
My reverse five-storied formation is a semi-permanent piece.

186
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,580
It can only perform one-fifth of its power.

187
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,660
But even so,

188
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,460
it's also a one-level defensive formation.

189
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,060
It can't withstand the attack of the mid-range.

190
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,500
Just ощущize that the major front is Katy Ravchenko's plan

191
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,860
to depiction of the situation in the biological bomb decide our heads.

192
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:43,780
It's the go-to for its

193
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,780
and blind's textures.

194
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,380
What do you think, Jerome?

195
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,220
l've had the same idea for endless days.

196
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,740
I will fix this formation as it was.

197
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,460
I will never let you change a miserable formation

198
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,580
with a thousand-year-old gold branch.

199
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,380
Brother,

200
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,940
I wonder if you are interested in training.

201
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,260
You mean

202
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,100
you want to teach me how to train?

203
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,500
To be honest,

204
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,860
my family is an elder in the God's Army.

205
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,260
He taught me all these skills.

206
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,300
It's my strength to be a magic weapon.

207
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,380
I have another thing.

208
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,220
The Heart Sutra of Yun Xiao

209
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,340
was made according to my own heart

210
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,340
after so many years.

211
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,900
In addition to the Transmitting Five Formations,

212
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,620
I am willing to violate ancestral teachings

213
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,140
and give this law to you.

214
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,500
I really need that

215
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,580
thousand-year-old herb as a medicine to save my life.

216
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,940
Well,

217
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,460
I happen to have some materials

218
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,300
that need to be trained.

219
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,900
Please help me train a few hair roots.

220
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,620
As for the Heart Sutra,

221
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,580
if you can fix the Transmitting Five Formations,

222
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,740
I won't open the leaf of this tree.

223
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,620
What do you think?

224
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,380
What about the thousand-year-old gold branch?

225
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,660
You want the thousand-year-old gold branch

226
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,260
to save people, right?

227
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,860
You are willing to exchange it with me at all costs

228
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,540
to prove your sincerity.

229
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,380
I will give you

230
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
the God of Humanity.

231
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,260
All right.

232
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,220
I have sealed this tree.

233
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,860
If you think it over,

234
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,700
you can put your spiritual power on it.

235
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,340
Even I can't turn it over.

236
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,500
In the future,

237
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,380
if you can fulfill your promise,

238
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,220
I will return this tree

239
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,020
to you.

240
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,780
You trust me so much.

241
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,100
I will do my best.

242
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,780
Deal.

243
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,180
Brother.

244
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,300
You can turn on the formation

245
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,300
according to the content of the pre-test.

246
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,420
Although the function of the Transmitting Five Formations

247
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,340
is not perfect,

248
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,820
it will be enough

249
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
if you only need to defend.

250
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,060
But...

251
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:32,900
What?

252
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,780
The formation

253
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,340
consists of 18 formation plates and one main formation plate.

254
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,740
There are 36 formation plates.

255
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,420
The formation is divided by the size of the sky.

256
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,060
The number of the trees in the picture

257
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,860
is 8.

258
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,060
It takes a lot of time to arrange it.

259
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,260
If you can study it for a longer time,

260
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,620
maybe you can simplify it.

261
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,860
It's okay.

262
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,260
Next,

263
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,420
we should talk about the sound of the qi.

264
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,220
These are the outer skin of the Second-Grade Wooden Cult,

265
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,540
gold wine,

266
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,300
liao ya and poison leaves.

267
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,700
These are the high-grade materials

268
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,260
that I've been dreaming of.

269
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:18,820
You only see the

270
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,020
Ren Shu with one look.

271
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,180
It seems that I haven't found him.

272
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,700
How long does it take?

273
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,420
Half a month is enough.

274
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,700
Don't worry.

275
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,380
These things

276
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,220
are enough to make several high-grade weapons.

277
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:31,940
By the way,

278
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,420
Brother Qi,

279
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,300
my name is Han Li.

280
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,300
Okay.

281
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:52,820
This is good.

282
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,780
We have been through everything.

283
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,820
We made it.

284
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,500
Can not make trouble

285
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,420
I'm really not in my right closely

286
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,420
I should have asked Qin Yunqiu.

287
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,700
Now I have to ask Bai Yanghao

288
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,220
to get the magic weapon.

289
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,260
Ye Fei.

290
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,220
Since you were killed by a bomb,

291
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,300
you should be invisible for the rest of your life.

292
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,140
Why do you need to contact the old man?

293
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,780
You taught Ye Fei.

294
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,420
In Qianzhu Sect,

295
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,900
you had to call the young master.

296
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,020
Fine.

297
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,020
I'll treat it as a favor.

298
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,380
As long as you hand over

299
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,060
the first scroll of the Great Eye.

300
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,460
I can say something good for you in front of the master.

301
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,740
I won't let you die.

302
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,140
The first scroll of the Great Eye.

303
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,580
What should I do?

304
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,380
Ming Tian,

305
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,780
stop feeding on bones,

306
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:31,900
or else I will have you

307
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,660
57!

308
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,580
Damn it.

309
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,580
This is a trap.

310
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,580
Who is it?

311
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,580
Come out.

312
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,580
It seems that he has a companion.

313
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,580
We must hurry up and go.

314
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
What's this strange thing?

315
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,580
What's going on?

316
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,580
Dead?

317
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,580
God of Yuan?

318
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,580
This is a big one.

319
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,580
As long as you find another body,

320
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,580
I will do it again.

321
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,580
I am willing to pass on my skills to you.

322
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,580
What's so great about the skill of a cripple?

323
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,580
It's just that it can control some puppets.

324
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,580
This skill can open up the world.

325
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,580
If you can cultivate it, you can also pass it on to others.

326
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,580
I can also do it.

327
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,580
I can also do it.

328
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,580
I can also do it.

329
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
I can also do it.

330
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,580
I can also do it.

331
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,580
I can also do it.

332
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,580
I can also do it.

333
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,580
At the same time, I can control hundreds of puppets.

334
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,580
Hundreds of them.

335
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,580
And then?

336
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,580
I can also increase the chance of being hit by bullets.

337
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,580
You can also increase the chance of being hit by bullets.

338
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,580
Don't try to fool me, okay?

339
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,580
No.

340
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
You are not lucky.

341
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,580
In my life,

342
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,580
I will never believe in the people who take the snake.

343
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,580
It's really a fine day.

344
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,580
It's really a fine day.

345
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
Come.

346
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,580
I think it should be done using the secret method of the bamboo glue.

347
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,580
Could it be that he mentioned Big Eye?

348
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,580
We must get the chance.

349
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,380
I can only swearrer,

350
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,300
I will give no mistake to you.

351
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,260
I am Gloria.

352
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,180
I got it.

353
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,620
No.

354
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:51,940
Don't worry.

355
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,580
They will never catch me.

356
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,460
Find a way.

357
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,540
It was a log just now.

358
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,860
Why is it a rat?

359
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,180
Good for you.

360
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,260
Zhongwu.

361
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,500
Uncle Zhong.

362
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,820
Follow me from now on.

363
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,220
I will serve you with my life.

364
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,220
If there's a lie,

365
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,420
I will be punished.

366
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,620
I will be punished.

367
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,020
Here.

368
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,140
Take it.

369
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,220
This is the list of the seven banners

370
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,140
you recruited.

371
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,620
Follow the list

372
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,620
and call them one by one.

373
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,380
After that,

374
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,820
we will meet at Yanjia Fort.

375
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,660
Yanjia Fort?

376
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,660
Congratulations, Young Master.

377
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,220
It seems that

378
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,740
Yue Country can open the gate for us.

379
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,460
Your ambition will be realized.

380
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,700
It's the gate that is open.

381
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,100
The gate?

382
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,260
Open the gate.

383
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,020
Head.

384
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,780
I can't open it at will.

385
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,620
But I can stand tall.

386
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,940
So I can see this place easily.

387
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,860
Walk fast.

388
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,260
I can't catch you.

389
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,780
You...

390
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,940
I can catch you if you don't keep walking.

391
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,780
Remember,

392
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,180
the gate is not open completely.

393
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,500
It should just be an entrance.

394
00:29:41,140 --> 00:30:09,640
The

395
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,380
to train the flying magic weapon.

396
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,020
Although it doesn't have any defense,

397
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,060
it's very fast.

398
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,020
But it hasn't come to name it.

399
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,900
Mo Jiaojiao is willing to follow the magic of the wind.

400
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,420
There is rarely a magic weapon

401
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,380
that can be as fast as her on the same street.

402
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,940
Shen Fengzhou.

403
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,900
How about calling her Shen Fengzhou?

404
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,300
The wind is as fast as the wind.

405
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,380
What a good name.

406
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,740
Han, look at these.

407
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,060
This is the dragon-shaped poison.

408
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,420
It's made from the teeth of Mo Jiaojiao.

409
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,780
This is the white-wood shield.

410
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,900
It's the hardest outer layer

411
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,460
on Mo Jiaojiao.

412
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,860
And this.

413
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,100
Mo Jiaojiao's poison

414
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,660
is a light flame.

415
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,060
It can help you

416
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,420
to get out of the magic.

417
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,700
You see.

418
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,100
I know where it is.

419
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,980
I can

420
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,180
sense the magic magic weapon

421
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,380
in fifteen days,

422
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,900
I respect your tower with child Conservator.

423
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,100
I should also thank me

424
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,540
for theexisting moral sense

425
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,820
for the past thousand years in my idleness.

426
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,220
Being oreunda can be better

427
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,300
to teach the magic weapon

428
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,580
to rein,

429
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,580
and then be rest easy.

430
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,220
Oreunda?

431
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,740
Who will we choose?

432
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,180
Life and death

433
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,820
I don't know

434
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,900
But I'm very lucky

435
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,300
because who I've loved

436
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,620
have their accounts

437
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,300
to keep

438
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,460
no

439
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,820
relationship

440
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,040
Heavenly Wind fighting boat

441
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:24,800
Holy Windmasking

442
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,220
Isn't it mischievous anymore?

443
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,900
I don't think so.

444
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,580
Such a sleeping beauty is useless.

445
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,460
Be careful.

446
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,580
You're here

447
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,580
to attack our example?

448
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,180
I'm willing to exchange the map of the Huangfeng Valley.

449
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,700
You're smart.

450
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,220
You've found the right person.

451
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,060
You're really a good actor.

452
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,180
Brother, you're great.

453
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,140
My brother is really good.

454
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,140
You're so good.

455
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,980
Don't you dare to praise me.

456
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,340
I won't.

457
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,980
It's easy to get away with this.

458
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,740
Right?

459
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,380
Then...

460
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,900
Don't worry, my brother.

461
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,900
Someone's here. Run!

462
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,060
Don't come here.

463
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,740
Don't surprise...

464
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,380
... فyou're not just a Project근,

465
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,060
but asexfighter.

466
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,620
Master,

467
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,060
you've been hiding too much these years.

468
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,660
Mr. Wu,

469
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,140
you know too much.

470
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,980
You've been blocking my way.

471
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,980
I should have killed you long ago.

472
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,980
You're such a despicable man.

473
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,980
I'll show you no mercy.

474
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
Kill him.

475
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,980
Kill him.

476
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,980
Die!

477
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,980
Master Wu.

478
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,980
Han Li.

479
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
Han Li.

480
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,980
Han Li.

481
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,980
Han Li.

482
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,980
Han Li.

483
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,980
Han Li.

484
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,980
Tell the leader that he's a spy.

485
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,980
He colluded with the demon of Lin Xiu Mountain.

486
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,980
It's too late.

487
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,980
Kill him.

488
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,980
Kill him.

489
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,980
Master Wu, catch me.

490
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,980
Kill him.

491
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,980
Master Wu, hold on.

492
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,980
My cave is ahead.

493
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,980
I can save you if you have the elixir.

494
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,980
Leave me alone.

495
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
It's too late.

496
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,980
Tell the leader that

497
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,980
the demon is a spy in the chessboard.

498
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,980
His surname is Yan.

499
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,980
The rest of them are dead.

500
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,980
Yan is the one who's the head of the Guji tribe.

501
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
Don't let them collude with the evil.

502
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,980
And be careful of Lin Xiu Mountain.

503
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
Stop talking.

504
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,980
Your life is more important.

505
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,980
Stop talking.

506
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,980
Your life is more important.

507
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,980
Stop talking.

508
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,980
Stop talking.

509
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,980
Stop talking.

510
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,980
Stop talking.

511
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,980
Stop talking.

Stop talking.

517
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,980
Stop talking.

518
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,980
Stop talking.

519
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,980
Stop talking.

520
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
Stop talking.

00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,980
Stop talking.

00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,980
Stop talking.

00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,980
Stop talking.

525
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,980
Stop talking.

526
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,980
Stop talking.

Stop talking.

Stop talking.

529
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
Stop talking.

530
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,980
Stop talking.

531
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,980
Stop talking.

532
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,980
Stop talking.

533
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
Stop talking.

534
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,980
Stop talking.

535
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,980
Stop talking.

536
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,980
Stop talking.

571
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,780
No,ese

572
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,780
No,ese

573
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,780
No,ese

574
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:00,980
Yang Jian.

575
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,500
I was at thecode of Unix in F기� fall two years ago.

576
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,100
How should I face Yang Jian now?

577
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,260
Yes.

578
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,780
As long as we could beat him,

579
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,620
he will never fare to defeat me.

580
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,100
He will never take Bai Yu to the battlefield.

581
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,420
When you ladies of theListened Army

582
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,920
were watching us after he failed to appear,

583
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,780
the developersização in Jiaying

584
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,020
heard

585
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,620
that it was toossä

586
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,860
to abandon our army.

587
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,220
But now

588
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,880
What's the rush to take care of myself?

589
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,660
I want you dead before your head's charged!

590
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,880
Kill you.

591
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,520
Update you!

592
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,340
The effect of one fifth of the attack

593
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,140
Can have such an effect

594
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,900
Can see the Five Stars Offensive completely

595
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,500
Can Yaoyao live for one day

596
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,700
After which

597
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,580
I have to rearm the formation

598
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,620
Boy

599
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,540
You are capable

600
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,740
If you come to help me

601
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,300
I'll spare your life this day

602
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,620
Xu

603
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,620
Honestly

604
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,900
I will teach you

605
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:25,900
You are so stupid

606
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,260
God of Warvolt.

607
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,140
Hanli!

608
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,020
The formation is Ancient Sword末m celebrities.

609
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,020
You won't last long!

610
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:33,220
The scenery is beautiful but hard to forget

611
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:38,220
It's better to miss you

612
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:44,220
It's said that the past is like a leaf

613
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:50,220
Looking back at the absurdity that is unbearable

614
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,220
The sound of the flute is like the sound of the flute

615
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,220
The lonely books are like the broken memories

616
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:03,220
The past is like the past

617
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:10,220
The wind rises and blows

618
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:16,220
The four seasons are like the eyes

619
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,220
Looking back at the mountain

620
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:26,220
I have forgotten the past

621
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:31,220
The future is still the same

622
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:37,220
The three seas are not inferior to the past

623
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:44,220
Time will also change all the promises of time

624
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:53,220
Only these four years have passed thousands of years

625
00:43:54,220 --> 00:44:00,220
In the moment of eternity

626
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:11,220
In the moment of eternity
