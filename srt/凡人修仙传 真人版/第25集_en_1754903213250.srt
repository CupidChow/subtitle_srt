00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The old god is in trouble, the world is in chaos

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The old god is in trouble, the world is in chaos

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The old god is in trouble, the world is in chaos

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The old god is in trouble, the world is in chaos

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The old god is in trouble, the world is in chaos

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The old god is in trouble, the world is in chaos

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The old god is in trouble, the world is in chaos

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The old god is in trouble, the world is in chaos

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Miss

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Brother

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Blood knot, it's the monster again

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Run

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Go

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Brother

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Brother

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Brother

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Brother

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let me help you one last time

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Don't worry

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
None of them can escape

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Bad

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The dead man is still in the forest

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You go first

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll stay with you

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You go to Zhuling Guzhen, I'll lead them there

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hurry

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ok

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Go

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't die anymore

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't explain to the inside

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The next arrangement takes time

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I have to delay it

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I underestimated you

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I would have dealt with you if I knew it

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's not too late to come now

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What was that just now?

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It was so close

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I almost died

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
At the end of Zhu Ji

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There is such a deep abyss

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's really

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's so hard to predict

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You little rascal

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What's your name?

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm the one who killed you

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm the one who killed you

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What's your name?

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
When you killed those bandits

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Did you ask their names?

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You should have seen the names on the tower

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I wrote them myself

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
They are just a part of me

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
They are just the steps to the red yard

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The bamboo forest that Han Shidi said should be here

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Madam, Senior Su, please help me

61
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The Black Shark Sect leader has almost entered the red yard

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Will this formation really work on him?

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Now

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can only trust Han Shidi

65
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's talk to him for a while

66
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They don't really need time

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You are the king of the world

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What other red yard can make you so persistent?

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
King?

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What king?

71
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
In the eyes of you immortals

72
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We are just a bunch of bandits

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We are just a bunch of bandits

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In the eyes of you immortals

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We are just a bunch of bandits

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We are just a bunch of bandits

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's continue talking

78
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let's continue talking

79
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
On the day of the founding

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The mortals are in the eyes of you immortals

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's just a family

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,260
You are always talking about the

83
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,000
The vile vile

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,960
Never thought of the

85
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
The vile vile

86
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,960
The king can't save the vile vile

87
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,960
This is also the rule of your seven sects

88
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
It's a pity

89
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,960
We two brothers have our own roots

90
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
But we can only learn from this

91
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,960
The learning of the vile vile

92
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,920
We just want to one day

93
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,920
No longer be the vile vile

94
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Let's talk a little more

95
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
You don't want to be a vile vile

96
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,920
But take the lives of those bandits as the foundation

97
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
You want to live forever

98
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Let your brothers die

99
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
In my eyes

100
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,920
You are a completely evil

101
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
The king is a man

102
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,880
I almost found your way

103
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,880
It seems that you know how to annoy me

104
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,880
It's about time now

105
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,880
Ok, then stand

106
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,880
See who is right and who is wrong

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,840
You are a vile vile

108
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Disgraceful vile

109
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Brother Han

110
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
You are hurt

111
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Are you ok

112
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Gu Bao

113
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
He is coming

114
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,840
You are really ungrateful

115
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
I don't want to enter

116
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,840
What can you do to me

117
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
Don't think that you can't save me

118
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
From the moment you came

119
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
You are already in my heart

120
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Come on

121
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
It's my turn

122
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,840
Diao Chong Xiao Jing

123
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,840

Master

135

Master

137
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840

Don't leave us

139

The way of revenge, robbery and robbery

140
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
Can you lie to us

141
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Let go

You are just some tricks

147
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,800
I used to raise spiritual pills

148
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,800
You dare to think about it

149
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
You want to live forever

150
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,800
How can I live forever if you don't die

151
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
How can you save me

152
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800

200
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
Master

201
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Let me go

202
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
Get lost

203
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,080
What is your discuss, Hong Yue

204
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
You areIV for provider

205
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
ü

206
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Useless

207
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,240
Die

208
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,360
You are just doing this for your own benefit.

209
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,960
You are just doing this for your own benefit.

210
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,760
You are just doing this for your own benefit.

211
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,360
You can't trap me.

212
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Come out!

213
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Come out!

214
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Come out!

215
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Come out!

216
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Come out!

217
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Come out!

218
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Junior Brother Han, is he crazy?

219
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
He is too obsessive.

220
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Come out!

221
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Your formation is really amazing.

222
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
From now on, I won't dare to offend him again.

223
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
From now on, I won't dare to offend him again.

224
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
But this formation can only be trapped for a moment.

225
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
But this formation can only be trapped for a moment.

226
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
We need to capture the information.

227
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
What is she trying to do?

228
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
What is she trying to do?

229
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,560
I didn't expect

230
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,200
I could use this.

231
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,360
Junior Han, let's fight against Li Yi Bo.

232
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Get ready,

233
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,760
come on!

234
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,320
Quiet.

235
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,760
Black powder.

236
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,440
The power of the fire.

237
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:31,200
You have aнаяa

238
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,600
With you

239
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,440
Xiaowen

240
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
I don't want to either.

241
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
The sect won't compensate me.

242
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
This medicine should be turned into chicken powder.

243
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,440
But why is the magic of the formation still not gone?

244
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,440
I never thought that you, the five elements of the formation,

245
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
would be so crazy.

246
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,440
You made me find a breakthrough.

247
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
As long as the blood is stillborn,

248
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
the blood will be reborn.

249
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
As long as my soul doesn't die,

250
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
you won't be able to kill me.

251
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
I can just be here,

252
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,440
training to break the barrier,

253
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,440
and take the bomb.

254
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
Then,

255
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
I will kill you.

256
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,440
This demon is really scary.

257
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
He actually used Han Shidi's formation in the opposite way.

258
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,440
If we don't kill him here,

259
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
there will be no hope for the future.

260
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Okay, Han Shidi.

261
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Leave the rest to me.

262
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Wei Niang, no!

263
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
This is what Jingge left for you.

264
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Wei Niang, you just used this thing.

265
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
This treasure and Senior Brother Liu's

266
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,440
are a pair?

267
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Han Shidi has good taste.

268
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,440
This thing is called Phoenix Token.

269
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,440
It is made from the same magic treasure.

270
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,440
It was given to me by Jingge

271
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
in the past.

272
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
Open up.

273
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,440
This monster was reborn,

274
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,440
We can finish бес acceptly,

275
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,440
I'm afraid there's no other way.

276
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Junior Han, thank you.

277
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Open the formation.

278
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,440
Miss.

279
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
I'm afraid there's no other way.

280
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
This is impossible.

281
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,440
I'm not willing to give up.

282
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
Brother Jing, look.

283
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,440
The evil blood can also burn out such a beautiful color.

284
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,440
This is the blood-sucking five-star elixir that this person will get at any cost.

285
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,440
And the hidden weapons and treasures of the ingredients.

286
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,440
Under the continuous attack of the talisman, the door is still intact.

287
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,440
It can be seen that they are not ordinary things.

288
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Junior Han.

289
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
I've informed the door.

290
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,440
The subsequent work will be taken over by the law enforcement.

291
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,440
The matter of Yue Huang will probably be made up and spread.

292
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Everything will be destroyed like before.

293
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
There's one more thing.

294
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,440
Just now, in a secret room where Yue Huang was hiding,

295
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,440
I found the body of Junior Wu Xuan.

296
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:02,440
It seems that he has suffered a lot before.

297
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,440
He却已不打倒了

298
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,400
right.

299
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Junior Han.

300
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,440
I also found the book from the blood of that demon.

301
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,440
During this battle, you saved me, Wei Niang, and Junior Sister Chen.

302
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,440
I thought about it and thought that I should leave it to you to deal with it.

303
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,440
This is a law of the art.

304
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,440
You can refer to it, but you must not be obsessed with it.

305
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,440
The book of the blood of that demon, the five-star elixir of blood,

306
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
and the magic of the body and body.

307
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,440
It seems that this is the origin of the black sand, the art of the black sand.

308
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Thank you, Senior Brother.

309
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,440
This book will be destroyed in a month.

310
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,440
I won't let it be left to die.

311
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Master taught me to destroy the black sand.

312
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,440
The art of the body and body are not in the right place.

313
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,440
The right place is in the heart of the people.

314
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Don't worry, Senior Brother.

315
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Okay.

316
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Let's go. We should go back.

317
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Go.

318
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Senior Sister Chen went back to the Shi family to report back to the order.

319
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,440
After that, she has always been a talkative person.

320
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,440
She has also become quiet.

321
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,440
Senior Brother, you have to go back to the Shi family.

322
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
I will go back.

323
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
Okay.

324
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
I will go back.

325
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Senior Brother, you have to go back.

326
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,440
I will go back.

327
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
I will go back.

328
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
I will go back.

329
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,440
I will go back.

330
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,440
I will go back.

331
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,440
Senior Sister Zhong is going to escort Senior Brother Liu's medical supplies back to the village.

332
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,440
Senior Brother Song will go with her.

333
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,440
In a few days, everything will be fine.

334
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,440
If you wish to safely get through this crisis,

335
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,440
go back to the valley and talk to them again.

336
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,440
When I close my eyes, I see Brother Jing.

337
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
I grew up with him.

338
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
He suddenly left.

339
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
I really can't stand it.

340
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,440
I heard from Brother Jing that you are the eldest son of the Song family.

341
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,440
He is just a poor man without a father and mother.

342
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,440
But you have always treated him well.

343
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,440
What eldest son?

344
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,440
If it weren't for him, I would have lost my life.

345
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
And the eldest son?

346
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,440
Brother Jing saved you?

347
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Back then, a evil monk sneaked into the Song family as a accountant.

348
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,440
He found out that Brother 10 and I have spiritual roots.

349
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,440
If it weren't for Brother 3,

350
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,440
I would have been the one who was tested by that demon.

351
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Senior Sister!

352
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
Bite me!

353
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Kill him!

354
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,440
Kill me!

355
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
Senior Sister, hurry and turn around!

356
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,440
After that, his body fell off the ice.

357
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,440
And he couldn't repair the elixir.

358
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
What?

359
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,440
He was so cruel to repair it because of this matter.

360
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,440
Brother Jing never said these to me.

361
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,440
He won't say it to you.

362
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,440
He always wanted to leave the best side to you.

363
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,440
He always wanted to leave the best side to you.

364
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
Silly.

365
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,440
I wish you could personally say these to me.

366
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,440
Junior Sister, don't be sad.

367
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,440
Let's send Brother Jing home together.

368
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
He should miss home too.

369
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,440
adjustments

370
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,440
This battle came in handy

371
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,440
I was bit disappointed.

372
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,440
But I didn't expect it overturned this time.

373
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
My skills were better,

374
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,440
and my supernatural powers were machen in the latter stage of the game.

375
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,840
I know this magic is not from the Southern Continent.

376
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
It's very suspicious.

377
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,840
Good thing I didn't take the Xuan Ning Five-star Pill.

378
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,240
This pill is made from the blood of the demon, Zhu Ji Qi.

379
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,240
No wonder the moon emperor gave this to them.

380
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,840
I'm afraid these five people won't know until they die.

381
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,840
They are just the demon straws that the moon emperor bit.

382
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,440
It's a pity that there are three times the chance of taking the pill.

383
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,440
But the pill is fake.

384
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
It can't be taken here.

385
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,440
It can even be eaten by the blood and turned into a beast.

386
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,440
If you lose the right to be a human, what's the use of living?

387
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,440
But the way of life and death recorded in this scripture can be studied.

388
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,700
The

389
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
The

390
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,700
The

391
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,700
The

392
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,700
What kind of magic is this? It's interesting.

393
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,700
Little rascal!

394
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,700
I told you to watch the Qin family.

395
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,700
You made such a big mess.

396
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,200
I'm telling you, the front line is in chaos.

397
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Don't come here and make trouble.

398
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Go back to Huangfang Valley and close the door and cook.

399
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,960
Wait for me to explain it to me.

400
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,460
Big Brother's theory is good.

401
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,960
The royal stewardess did find a lot of gold and silver treasures.

402
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,960
They were all found by Sister Mo and distributed to the poor people in the city.

403
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,960
But Sister Mo said that these magic weapons and talismans

404
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
should be left to you to deal with.

405
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,960
It seems that they were all found by those beggars.

406
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,960
I don't know how many of them are like Little Brother.

407
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
You're thoughtful.

408
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,960
Where is he? Why isn't he with you?

409
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,960
Don't mention it.

410
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
A while ago, we were rescued from the abandoned village.

411
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,460
A sister was seriously injured and died.

412
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,960
She left a little girl who was not old enough.

413
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,960
It's so strange. The girl cried when she saw me.

414
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
She couldn't even coax me.

415
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,960
Only by being in Sister Mo's arms can you be peaceful.

416
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,960
This is her.

417
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,960
She has never changed in all these years.

418
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Sister Mo is busy looking after Ying Ning. She can't come to see you.

419
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Ying Ning is that little girl. Her mother's surname is Li.

420
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
She might be following Sister Mo from now on.

421
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
You've done a lot this time.

422
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Tell me. What do you want?

423
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
He really has a hairpin?

424
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Can I have anything I want?

425
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
Will any big brother agree to it?

426
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
Tell me.

427
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Is it a pill, magic weapon, or a high-grade talisman?

428
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,960
What do you want?

429
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
I want to be a teacher.

430
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
I'll be your disciple.

431
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Get up.

432
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
If you have anything to say, say it.

433
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Stand up and say it.

434
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,960
If you think I'm not qualified,

435
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,960
I know I'm impulsive and self-righteous.

436
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,960
I'm not as good as your disciples.

437
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
But I really want to learn from you.

438
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,960
I promise I won't be disrespectful to you anymore.

439
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,960
I'll kick you every day.

440
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
I won't forget what you did.

441
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,960
I just want to make a little wish and accept it.

442
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
This little girl is really hard to deal with.

443
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
All right.

444
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
If you keep messing around,

445
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
I promise you'll lose everything.

446
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Although I don't have any plans,

447
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
I have something that can help you.

448
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,960
You're good at it.

449
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
But I'm not good at drawing.

450
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Take this jade card and go to the Yellow Wind Valley

451
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
to find the senior of the new horse.

452
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Do you understand?

453
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Miss Mo,

454
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
I'm sorry.

455
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
I'm sorry.

456
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
I'm sorry.

457
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
I'm sorry.

458
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,960
I'm sorry.

459
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
I'm sorry.

460
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,960
Miss Mo,

461
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
see the real you.

462
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,960
I'm sorry

463
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,960
for saying goodbye in this way.

464
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,960
The al bento drug

465
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
is called Dingyan pills.

466
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
It can protect your youth.

467
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
You need to take it yourself.

468
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
There are also these charm pills

469
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
that can make you lose weight.

470
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,960
I hope it's beneficial to your business.

471
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,400
Please continue your work.

472
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,840
I'm sorry.

473
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,680
Miss Wang,

474
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,920
please forget me.

475
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,960
Young Master Han.

476
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,320
Young Master Han, please wait.

477
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,720
It finally started.

478
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,240
Qin Guo, why are you here?

479
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Young Master Han,

480
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,680
you don't know that

481
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,320
the rich and poor in the mansion

482
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
say that you can't stay in the capital anymore.

483
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,800
But I know it's not like that.

484
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
I've seen it.

485
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,800
Master loves you so much.

486
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
He's so kind.

487
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
He's so kind.

488
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
He's so kind.

489
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
He's so kind.

490
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,400
But you're so loyal.

491
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,680
You cured Young Master Fei's illness so quickly.

492
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,040
You're so generous.

493
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,440
You're a hundred times better than others.

494
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,360
I know you're not a commoner.

495
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,000
I know you left.

496
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,120
I specially asked my mother-in-law

497
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,400
to make some local specialties for you.

498
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,120
And the best wine.

499
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,960
You can eat it later.

500
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,400
Come on.

501
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
Master,

502
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,160
you must come back.

503
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,720
I'll take care of this business for you.

504
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
You must come back and inherit it.

505
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,120
Get up.

506
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,560
Who do you think I am?

507
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
Who is that?

508
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Young Master Fei.

509
00:38:52,200 --> 00:39:17,680
I have такed

510
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Whether it's a scheme of the Ghost Realm or a strong will to fight for the enemy,

511
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
it's all a trap.

512
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Only the mountain pass has been sealed for a long time.

513
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,800
This trip out of the palace has really been a long time.

514
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
It's been so many years.

515
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
This Jiayuan City is still the same.

516
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
I don't know where Qu Huan has gone.

517
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
I have to find him before I return to the Wild Wind Valley.

518
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Where did you steal his armor?

519
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
How do you usually work?

520
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
You are so clumsy.

521
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
You people are really not very good.

522
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Officer,

523
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Sir,

524
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,800
you really came to the right place to eat at our four-bottomed restaurant.

525
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Our wine dishes, even the big masters in the capital,

526
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
are all praiseworthy.

527
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Let me introduce to you.

528
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,800
We have lamb soup, steamed bear's paw, steamed deer's tail,

529
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
roasted duck, roasted chicken, roasted goose,

530
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
braised duck with chicken,

531
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
braised pork with chicken,

532
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
fried pork with pork,

533
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
and sausage with meat.

534
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
I'm not here to eat.

535
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
I understand.

536
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Then you are here to ask about things.

537
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,800
You just ask.

538
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
This thing,

539
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
is there anything that my grandson doesn't know?

540
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
Ask, ask.

541
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,800
This Jiayuan City is nothing like what my grandson doesn't know.

542
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
It's still the same as before.

543
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,800
I heard that Mo Manor was occupied by the Five-colored Gate.

544
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,800
Jiayuan City has long been without the Mo family.

545
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
After my grandfather died,

546
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
he was under the control of the coal mine.

547
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,800
He even offended the Five-colored Gate, which was quite friendly before.

548
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
He was killed overnight.

549
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
That's a tragedy.

550
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,800
Later, the Five-colored Gate was moved to a new house.

551
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
They said that they had surrendered the nobles of the capital.

552
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Is there anyone from the Mo family?

553
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
No.

554
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
The people from the Mo family and the Mo family

555
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,800
were all killed by these bandits.

556
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,800
The funeral was done secretly by our neighbors.

557
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,800
The dead are the greatest.

558
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
They are in charge of justice.

559
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
Xiao'er.

560
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
Coming.

561
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
Sir, please sit down.

562
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Please sit down.

563
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Please enjoy.

564
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
Sir.

565
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,800
This room looks quite old.

566
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
What do you think?

567
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
I almost forgot.

568
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,800
I picked it up when I went to Mo Manor to train.

569
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
I also asked the manager of Chaofeng.

570
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
He said that it's nothing special.

571
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Just treat it as a phoenix hanging here.

572
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
It needs your.)

573
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
Master, let me tell you going back and forth

574
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
with us isn't that easy.

575
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,800
It's just that it's been peppered not seeing you.

576
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,800
It's been 50 years.

577
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,800
I don't know if you can give me this thing as a souvenir.

578
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,200
Sir, you can't do that.

579
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,800
Back then, Second Dog and the brothers were often taken care of by Lady Mo and Miss Mo.

580
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,200
Moreover, it's not something valuable.

581
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,800
You're also very close to Mo Manor.

582
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,400
Li Yingxiang gave it to you. How can she still take your money?

583
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
If you really want to think about it,

584
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,000
why don't you take care of my business?

585
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,800
I'll go get you some good dishes.

586
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,400
Please wait. Please wait.

587
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Sir, I prepared two special dishes for you.

588
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Sir.

589
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,400
This is...

590
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,000
This talisman has the effect of purifying the evil.

591
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,800
There is no end to it.

592
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,400
I'll take it.

593
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,000
I'll take it.

594
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,800
I'll take it.

595
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,600
I'll take it.

596
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,400
I'll take it.

597
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
I'll take it.

598
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,200
I'll take it.

599
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,600
There is no end to it.

600
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,000
Good people have their own blessings.

601
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,600
Remember.

602
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,800
Remember.

603
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,800
Remember. Remember.

604
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,200
No wonder you look familiar.

605
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,800
I want to ask you something.

606
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,400
These past decades, the face hasn't changed.

607
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,000
You really have met a new person.

608
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,800
From now on, this four-story building

609
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,200
will be called the Jade Fairy Tower.

610
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,800
From now on, I'll call it Jade Fairy Tower. Remember.

611
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,200
I've met a new person.

612
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,600
Boss.

613
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:54,200
From now on, I'll call it Jade Fairy Tower.

614
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,500
Don't leave.

615
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:13,560
Jin Mi Yan,

616
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,400
the incident in vitala qui amy

617
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,100
is because of him

618
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,600
I should be looking for him.

619
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,100
You go don't have to explain.

620
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,500
It's a disguise I haven't seen him yet.

621
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,500
I can't forget the past,

622
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,500
but I still miss you.

623
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,500
You always say that the past is like a leaf

624
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,500
looking back at you, it's absurd.

625
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,500
The sound of the flute, loneliness, and the books

626
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:59,500
bring back the memories.

627
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,500
The past is like a thread.

628
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,500
The wind rises and blows again.

629
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:16,500
The world changes and the past is like a face.

630
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:22,500
Looking back, I have already forgotten the past.

631
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:29,500
It's yesterday, it's tomorrow.

632
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,500
The three days of the blue sea are not like the past.

633
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:42,500
Time will also erase all the promises in the world.

634
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Only this year has crossed thousands of years.

635
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:58,500
In the moment of life and death.

636
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:09,500
In the moment of life and death.

637
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:17,500
The past is like a leaf.

638
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,500
The wind rises and blows again.

639
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,500
The world changes and the past is like a face.
