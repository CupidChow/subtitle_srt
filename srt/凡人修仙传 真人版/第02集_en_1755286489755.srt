"A Mortal's Heart" - Wang Zhengliang

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,440
â™«  Pursuing the wind and moon, I set out on a long journey  â™«

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,080
â™«  The road ahead is uncertain, words are insignificant  â™«

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,120
â™«  Iâ€™ve tasted joys and sorrows  â™«

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,420
â™«  I conceal my abilities, and make careful plans  â™«

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,140
â™«  A mortalâ€™s heart with a few concerns  â™«

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,120
â™«  Accompanying me around the kingdom  â™«

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,900
â™«  I take the opportunity to reverse the desperate situation  â™«

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,480
â™«  Longing for a bosom friend in this mortal world  â™«

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,900
â™«  Iâ€™ve yet to figure out what immortality is  â™«

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,800
â™«  That eternity is also a fleeting moment  â™«

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,320
â™«  Donâ€™t mock me for being ordinary  â™«

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,503
â™«  Alone, I fight the disasters; the world is in a turmoil  â™«

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,280
â™«  Donâ€™t scorn me for being ordinary  â™«

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,580
â™«  Keep a kind heart, be decisive and kill if need be  â™«

16
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,680
â™«  There are hidden joys and sorrows in fate  â™«

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,000
â™«  Between life and death, I strive to save a desperate situation  â™«

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,200
â™«  Faith carries me through the long and endless night  â™«

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,773
â™«  I will return with an enlightened heart  â™«

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,000
â™«  Extraordinary after final training, I enter the vast three realms  â™«

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,570
â™«  And achieved nirvana in the cycle of reincarnation  â™«

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,900
Episode 2

23
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,250
Don't you find it strange?

24
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,570
We've been living with Master all this while,

25
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,310
and we were unaware that he knew martial arts.

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,970
Everyone has secrets.

27
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,280
We also didn't tell him about the green vial.

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,090
He treats you like his son.

29
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,060
Why are you suspicious of him?

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,930
I've been practicing the Elephant Armor Technique for a long time.

31
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,630
I was punched and in pain. I've never complained.

32
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,070
That's different. He killed someone.

33
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:11,330
Wu Yan was in the Wild Wolves Gang.

34
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,330
He betrayed the Seven Mystics Sect. He deserved to be killed.

35
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,930
Besides, Master did it to save you.

36
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,500
That's even more weird.

37
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,670
Am I that important?

38
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,790
Of course, you're important. Master kept the best for you.

39
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,520
He taught you medical skills and how to read. He can't be harming you.

40
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,370
It's raining. Go back to sleep.

41
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,840
Zhang Tie. Zhang Tie!

42
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,490
Did I overthink it?

43
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,780
Are you really leaving the mountain?

44
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,060
Your slow cultivation progress is related to the effectiveness of the herbs.

45
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,086
I thought for a long time and decided to find better herbs for you.

46
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,222
Are you sure you're well enough to do this?

47
00:03:15,222 --> 00:03:17,314
Why don't I go with you?

48
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:18,380
No. No need!

49
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,970
Zhang Tie, stay here and take care of Han Li and his cultivation.

50
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,088
You'll be punished if he doesn't make any progress once I'm back.

51
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,890
Go back. No need to see me off. I'm leaving.

52
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,495
For the next year or so,

53
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:46,330
Physician Mo often left for two to three months at a time to search for herbs.

54
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,510
Everything seems to go back to the way it was.

55
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,950
Senior Brother Li.

56
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,450
I'm Han Li. Senior Brother Li, your illness...

57
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,700
Your illness is very strange.

58
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,380
I can only seal your acupoints with needles for the time being.

59
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,500
Did you consume any medicine previously?

60
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,730
The medicine is...

61
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,660
Is this it?

62
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,100
This pill is made from equal portions of Orchids, Scorpion's Tail Flowers,

63
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,725
Blue Ant's Eggs, and about thirty other rare herbs.

64
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:25,886
It is red with a strange foul odor.

65
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:28,530
Once you consume it, even your bones will be in pain.

66
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,140
Thus, it's called the Bone Marrow Extraction Pill.

67
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,090
It can unleash your potential and increase your power

68
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,580
but the biggest issue is that it will shorten your life

69
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,730
and comes with detrimental side effects.

70
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:42,973
I advise you to stop taking these pills.

71
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:46,929
If you continue, you'll have at most ten years left to live.

72
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,040
Give me a reason to spare your life.

73
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,060
I saved your life.

74
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,050
Is this not a reason?

75
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,415
Truthfully, I thought about whether I would be silenced after saving you.

76
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:47,260
I didn't expect you to turn on me that soon.

77
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,900
I swear I won't tell anyone about this.

78
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,340
Your promise means nothing.

79
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:59,940
You should know I'm Physician Mo's final disciple.

80
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,580
That old man has many disciples.

81
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,140
It doesn't matter whether you're the final disciple.

82
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,530
It does.

83
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:07,480
I study medical skills from him.

84
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,290
I can help you with your illness, too.

85
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,120
That pill has serious side effects.

86
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,560
When you've a relapse, the pain is excruciating. You'll wish you were dead.

87
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,710
I might not be able to save you...

88
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,900
but I can find a solution to alleviate your suffering.

89
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,240
What's the solution?

90
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,410
With your blade on my neck, I can't think properly.

91
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,290
I can't recall anything.

92
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,190
Junior Brother Han, I apologize for my conduct.

93
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,020
You saved my life today and even swore to keep a secret for me.

94
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,590
Take it that I owe you a favor.

95
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,770
I will concoct the medicine in three days.

96
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,830
We'll meet here.

97
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,380
It's a deal.

98
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,170
It's a promise.

99
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,340
I almost got myself killed.

100
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,830
I won't intervene that readily again.

101
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:28,292
But Li Feiyu said Master has many disciples.

102
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:31,012
Why haven't I seen anyone else here?

103
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,240
Zhang Tie.

104
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,250
- You're back.
- I...

105
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,560
Why are you sweating so much?

106
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,020
I rushed back to eat.

107
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,750
- The food is ready.
- What are we having today?

108
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,600
Water dropwort broth and black rice. As usual.

109
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,970
You're awake.

110
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,291
Do you know that you were sitting here for a day and a night?

111
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,100
When I left to gather wood yesterday morning, you were sitting here.

112
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,380
When I came back for lunch, you were still here.

113
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,520
I slept and woke up. You were still here.

114
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,220
You were like a statue.

115
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,960
If I hadn't checked your breathing,

116
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,370
I would have thought you were dead.

117
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,570
That long?

118
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,190
I reheated the food several times.

119
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,352
I don't lie.

120
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,130
Time flies.

121
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,802
I merely had a dream.

122
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,170
I think Master is back.

123
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm going to check.

124
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,440
A day and a night without eating.

125
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,080
Why don't I feel hungry?

126
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:28,144
Is it because of the chant?

127
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,900
They say only immortals don't get hungry.

128
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,620
Han Li! Come!

129
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,860
Han Li!

130
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,300
Come here, quick!

131
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,750
Han Li! Master is dying!

132
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,450
Quick.

133
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,740
I don't know medical skills.

134
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,690
Master... Master is dying!

135
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,760
Master! Master!

136
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,770
Hurry up!

137
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,710
Han Li! Quick! Quick! Quick!

138
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,470
Get water!

139
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,820
Master.

140
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,291
Caihuai, is that you?

141
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,542
Master, it's me.

142
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,620
I'm Han Li.

143
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,140
You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

144
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,123
- I...
- You only need to take medicine to get well.

145
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,500
- I...
- Master.

146
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,860
- Han Li.
- I'm here.

147
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,030
- Han Li.
- I'm here. I'm here.

148
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,840
Master, you're hurting me.

149
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,140
Oh my god.

150
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,620
You've reached Level Three.

151
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,220
I didn't know that.

152
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,500
When I was training, I seemed to be entranced

153
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,140
and had a dream.

154
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,740
In the dream, there was a vortex on my stomach

155
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,260
that could absorb spiritual auras from my surroundings.

156
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,860
Is this Level Three?

157
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,690
Silly child, it wasn't a dream.

158
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,750
Zhang Tie!

159
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,500
Go to the herb cabinet.

160
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,100
Third row, second column from the left.

161
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,050
There's a white vial inside a small box.

162
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,720
Bring it to me.

163
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,340
I'm going now!

164
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,550
That was not a dream. It wasn't a dream.

165
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,960
Child, this day has finally come.

166
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm so happy.

167
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,030
That's meditation.

168
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,300
That's the inner eye.

169
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,810
Heaven didn't disappoint me.

170
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,510
This day has finally...

171
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,570
Great.

172
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,610
Bone Marrow Extraction Pill?

173
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,335
Even Li Feiyu knows its detrimental side effects.

174
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:50,665
Surely Master knows, too.

175
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,170
Master.

176
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,720
My disciple.

177
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,270
My beloved disciple.

178
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,620
Han Li.

179
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,960
Heaven didn't disappoint me.

180
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,100
It didn't let me down.

181
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,431
The greed in his eyes is unsettling.

182
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:36,716
It's like he's not looking at a living person

183
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:38,996
but at an object instead.

184
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,810
Junior Brother Han, you are punctual.

185
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,410
You said it was the hour of Wu* three days later.
(11 a.m. to 1 p.m.)

186
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,030
It is precisely the hour of Wu now.

187
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,340
This will last for a month.

188
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,830
Why so little?

189
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,770
I have run out of herbs.

190
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,890
I need to gather the rest.

191
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,930
One month then, so be it.

192
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,810
Thank you, Junior Brother Han.

193
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,900
What is the meaning of this?

194
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,620
This medicine uses rhinoceros horns as the guide.

195
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,380
I won't count the other costs.

196
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,340
Just give me two taels.

197
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,300
Can I pay you next month?

198
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,860
If you don't have money,

199
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,450
you can give me something else.

200
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,942
Your blade seems nice.

201
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:41,302
Not this blade.

202
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:43,620
What about a favor, then?

203
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,340
A favor again.

204
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,100
If you need help, look for me.

205
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,920
I'll help you.

206
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,550
Why are you taking these pills?

207
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,810
If you want a stable foothold in the martial arts community,

208
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,620
you need leverage.

209
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,170
I used to think that life was tough and short.

210
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,720
I fight for the present and not for a legacy.

211
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,550
The pills can give me what I want.

212
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,220
So what if I lose a few years of life?

213
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,690
But now, I feel that...

214
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,630
Let's not talk about this.

215
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,740
I'm taking the medicine.

216
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,510
See you next month.

217
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,130
Fight for the present and not for a legacy.

218
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,607
What is Master fighting for then?

219
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,890
Master!

220
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,450
The pot is here.

221
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,320
Master, I spent the whole afternoon looking for this pot.

222
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,930
They even told me to take my time to return it.

223
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,550
Just return it to them once we're done.

224
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,620
Master, I'll cook your favorite tofu.

225
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,350
Sure.

226
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,500
It's rare for Zhang Tie to be so filial.

227
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,080
Why don't the three of us...

228
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,790
have a drink together?

229
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,320
Sure.

230
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,620
Master, take care of your health.

231
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,790
Just one sip. It won't kill me.

232
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,710
Let me pour for Master first.

233
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,140
And then, for Han Li.

234
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,980
I'll drink, too.

235
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,410
Zhang Tie and I propose a toast to Master with this cup of wine.

236
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,750
May your good fortune be boundless like the East Sea.

237
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,880
May you live as long as the South Mountain to one hundred years old.

238
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,640
One hundred years old?

239
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,700
I'll just live day by day.

240
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,250
Master.

241
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,120
Come.

242
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,660
Master, let me propose a toast to you.

243
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,810
It's my fourth year here in the valley.

244
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,360
You taught me the Elephant Armor Technique and many skills.

245
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,450
You even let me return the flour for my family.

246
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,050
I... I'm not good with words.

247
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,850
Let this toast speak for itself.

248
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,180
Why do I feel dizzy?

249
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:38,890
Master, don't laugh at him.

250
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,820
Help him go back.

251
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,540
I'm sick of pretending to coddle him like a child.

252
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,540
Let's go. Master, I'll be back soon.

253
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,180
Where's Master?

254
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,810
Master.

255
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,800
When you wake up tomorrow morning and don't see me,

256
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,511
leave the mountain at once.

257
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:20,201
Do not return.

258
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,320
Zhang Tie.

259
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,710
Zhang Tie.

260
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,780
Master.

261
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:29,500
Today, you will read my pulse.

262
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,900
Your pulse is disorderly,

263
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,940
as if there are two vital energies circulating in your body.

264
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,730
Wherever they flow, they damage your Meridian system.

265
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,470
If I may comment, based on your pulse,

266
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,032
it feels...

267
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:16,560
My days are numbered unless I find a cure.

268
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:29,760
I know better than you how fragile my health is.

269
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,290
Come, my child.

270
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:41,261
We drank wine on this special occasion today.

271
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:45,251
I'm happy that you've made progress again.

272
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,392
Hence, I would like...

273
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:54,798
to be honest with you regarding something.

274
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,060
Time waits for no one.

275
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,850
Black hair can turn into white in an instant.

276
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,910
Guess how old I am.

277
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,130
Around 60 or 70 years old.

278
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,540
37 years old after the new year.

279
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,300
Don't believe me?

280
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,860
If you don't, you can ask

281
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,730
your Third Uncle, the outer disciple of the Seven Mystics Sect.

282
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,490
He must have heard of the Immortal Hands in the medical world,

283
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,700
Mo Juren of Lanzhou.

284
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,250
I am Mo Juren.

285
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,460
Back then, I was as young as you.

286
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,630
There were no ailments in the kingdom that

287
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,730
I couldn't treat, and no poisons that I couldn't remove.

288
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,810
A pity that I can save everyone in the kingdom...

289
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,420
but I can't save myself.

290
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,320
I was harmed by evil people.

291
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,230
I relied on my medical skills to save myself...

292
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:57,330
but this broken body can never recover again!

293
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,970
Master, stop taking these Bone Marrow Extraction Pills!

294
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,540
Although they make you feel better immediately,

295
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,590
but they can never cure your injuries.

296
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,372
If you continue taking them, you...

297
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:28,790
I know, I know, I do.

298
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,350
The pills can only let me last for one more year

299
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,650
but Heaven has eyes.

300
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,680
It let me find a solution to recover.

301
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,830
What solution?

302
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,550
It's you.

303
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,750
Me?

304
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,560
You're the only one who can save me now.

305
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,640
I've raised you for so long.

306
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,220
It's time for you to return the kindness!

307
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,670
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

308
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,630
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

309
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,450
Calm down.

310
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,760
Han Li,

311
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,620
you kept asking me

312
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,600
what the chant is used for.

313
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,280
I'll give you the answer now.

314
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,870
Because of my illness, I need someone who has reached Level Four

315
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,210
and use his vital energy to stimulate my hidden acupoints.

316
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,400
That will cure my illness.

317
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:44,330
Not only will it remove my poison, but it can also restore my youth.

318
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,430
So that's why you chose me.

319
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,310
Isn't that so?

320
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,970
I didn't choose you.

321
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,340
That chant chose you.

322
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,780
Only the destined ones can cultivate with that chant.

323
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,450
Even I couldn't do that.

324
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,780
Before you came, I had countless disciples.

325
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,390
None of them was as fortunate as you.

326
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:20,600
If you hadn't shown up, I would have accepted my demise.

327
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,490
Everyone dies eventually.

328
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,340
But with you here,

329
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,830
no matter what, I must grab this life-saving straw.

330
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,380
Anyone else would have done the same.

331
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,350
So, as long as you cure my illness, I can

332
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,660
give everything in this valley to you.

333
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,620
What's wrong? What's wrong?

334
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,590
Everything was fine when you took me as your master.

335
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,730
You're regretting now?

336
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:59,450
I will not lie or betray you.

337
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,810
But why...

338
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,360
didn't you mention this to me earlier?

339
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,640
You read a lot of books for many years.

340
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,300
Let me teach you a few more phrases.

341
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,450
"Hide your skills and intelligence in clumsiness."

342
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,640
"Use obscurity to do good deeds overtly."

343
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,000
"Stay pure in this world of darkness."

344
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,970
"Treat concession as a way to advance."

345
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:35,080
This is how I operate in life.

346
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,880
If I tell you certain things clearly and upfront,

347
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,000
you wouldn't have stayed here loyally like you have now.

348
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,730
What if I fail to reach Level Four?

349
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:21,627
You should know it's difficult to use this chant to cultivate.

350
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:26,997
It took me two years to reach Level Three from Level Two.

351
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,830
It's obvious I'm stagnating and can't proceed further.

352
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,580
Reaching Level Four in a year is harder than being an immortal.

353
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,250
Enough.

354
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,300
Do you think we're negotiating now?

355
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,100
Continue using the chant to cultivate as usual.

356
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,610
I'll find those precious herbs for you.

357
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,470
Don't mention this again.

358
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:56,570
Like what I said, you must reach Level Four within a year.

359
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,736
"Hide your skills and intelligence in clumsiness."

360
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:44,930
"Use obscurity to do good deeds overtly."

361
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,620
"Stay pure in this world of darkness."

362
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,860
"Treat concession as a way to advance."

363
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,940
This is how I operate in life.

364
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,931
Zhang Tie.

365
00:29:57,931 --> 00:30:00,311
- Wake up.
- The dumpling is delicious.

366
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:05,264
Brat, that's all you ever think of.

367
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:18,000
I finally have the full picture today.

368
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,932
I'm thinking...

369
00:30:19,932 --> 00:30:23,932
after I reach Level Four next year,

370
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:25,931
I'll cure Master's illness.

371
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:30,071
We'll leave Shenshou Valley and open a medical clinic.

372
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,290
In the future, we'll live...

373
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,680
a comfortable life.

374
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,130
Isn't that so?

375
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,060
He has grown wary.

376
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,400
It wasn't easy for me to coax him last night.

377
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,640
It's over if he runs away.

378
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:55,450
I'm going to control his body now.

379
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,290
No!

380
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,400
Why not?

381
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,960
He's still not strong enough for you to control him.

382
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,240
Do you want to be like me?

383
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,499
Formless?

384
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:11,690
You don't have time to find another disciple

385
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,510
who can practice the Eternal Spring Technique!

386
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,400
Do we wait again?

387
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:22,090
You should be able to feel that...

388
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,970
my body can't persist any longer.

389
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,100
You can't persist any longer?

390
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,700
Even if you can't persist, you must!

391
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:34,780
I am an Immortal Disciple.

392
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:42,040
Do you expect me to die with a mortal like you?

393
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,150
So, we wait again...

394
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:48,680
for a year maximum.

395
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,520
Whether he reaches Level Four or not, I'll take action!

396
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,730
Who's there?

397
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,320
Zhang Tie.

398
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,290
Zhang Tie!

399
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,320
Master.

400
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,140
Come in.

401
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,250
Master, where is Zhang Tie?

402
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,330
Zhang Tie?

403
00:34:43,432 --> 00:34:45,913
Didn't he tell you that he left the mountain?

404
00:34:45,913 --> 00:34:47,823
Left the mountain?

405
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,070
He asked for ten taels from me

406
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,310
and said that he would leave the mountain for a while.

407
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,390
Impossible. He always lets me know where he goes.

408
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,750
I just confessed everything to you.

409
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,430
Why would I still lie to you?

410
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,220
Zhang Tie never leaves without a word.

411
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,612
Even if he has really left the mountain,

412
00:35:09,612 --> 00:35:12,730
you would know where he went.

413
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,590
If you won't tell me, I'll find him on my own.

414
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,650
As expected from a Level Three cultivator.

415
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,920
You could sense my actions.

416
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,640
Seems like my herbs didn't go to waste.

417
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,950
I only wanted to read your pulse.

418
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,780
Come, my dear disciple.

419
00:35:55,898 --> 00:35:59,760
I only want to talk to you.

420
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,740
All right?

421
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,780
You have been in this valley for a while.

422
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,269
Do you miss home?

423
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:24,720
You once told me that you missed Xiaomei from Qingniu Town.

424
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:29,790
Master, you don't need to beat around the bush.

425
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:35,010
You only need to say, "Han Li, I need your help."

426
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,380
That's all.

427
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,820
Although I'm not a great person but I know how to be grateful.

428
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,720
Why are you still forcing me like this?

429
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:52,690
I know you're smart, careful, and hard to control.

430
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,070
A pity that you care too much about bonds.

431
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,660
And that is our biggest weakness.

432
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,460
It's why I don't want you to see Zhang Tie.

433
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,710
Like what I said,

434
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:14,210
if you can save my life, I'll ensure you have a life of riches.

435
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,990
Let's make a wager.

436
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,510
Let's see if I die first,

437
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:29,270
or you. Or everything that you cherish.

438
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,590
Fine.

439
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,060
I'll reach Level Four in a year and help you to remove your poison.

440
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,420
Tell me where Zhang Tie is.

441
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,946
Also, the herbs that you brought back are running out.

442
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:49,000
I need more.

443
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,860
Just focus on your cultivation. I'll leave the mountain to get the herbs.

444
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,380
Wait.

445
00:38:00,627 --> 00:38:03,027
Consume this.

446
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,240
You're not going to ask what this is?

447
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,490
Is there a need to ask?

448
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,370
Remember what you promised me today about next year.

449
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,254
As what I expected, whatever bond between us

450
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:05,605
disappeared after that day.

451
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:07,505
It can never go back to the way it was.

452
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,660
Physician Mo has now abandoned all his scruples.

453
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,165
He often leaves the valley to gather herbs.

454
00:39:15,165 --> 00:39:19,805
But whenever he returns, he looks weaker than before.

455
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,380
How did it become like this?

456
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,490
Or perhaps, it has always been like this.

457
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,450
Those carefree years in the past seemed like an illusion.

458
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,030
I've tried many ways

459
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,510
but I failed to remove the poison given by him.

460
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,220
It seems like I'll just have to attain Level Four.

461
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,240
But this is a difficult task.

462
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:51,050
Zhang Tie, I will find you wherever you are.

463
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:56,980
Anyway, there weren't movements in the green vial for quite some time.

464
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:18,840
Is this the condensation from absorbing yesterday's moonlight?

465
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,290
Can I drink this?

466
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,420
It's bad. It's Physician Mo's bird.

467
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,220
I must cultivate.

468
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,360
Don't look at me.

469
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,050
Leave.

470
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,320
Where did the rabbit come from?

471
00:42:39,467 --> 00:42:41,587
Why isn't that bird leaving?

472
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,601
It... It exploded?

473
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:24,461
That rabbit.

474
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,780
What's in the vial?

475
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,180
Poison?

476
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,980
They grew so quickly.

477
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,000
Is it because of that bowl of liquid?

478
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,400
If the diluted solution has this effect,

479
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,540
let's try the undiluted solution.

480
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,230
This... This is...

481
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,140
A normal ginseng plant grew several hundred years old in an instant.

482
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:57,780
This liquid must be related to the changes from those nights.

483
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,960
Animals can't drink this

484
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,260
but it can be used on herbs to speed up their growth.

485
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,150
But there isn't much liquid,

486
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:16,550
it needs to absorb the moonlight at night.

487
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:27,180
Perhaps I can dilute it with water like my previous experiment.

488
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,400
Furthermore, I need to find somewhere remote

489
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,740
to grow many herbs, refine many pills, and consume them in great quantity.

490
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,860
This is the crux of overturning my situation.

491
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:13,100
Did you see him?

492
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,430
Is he cultivating?

493
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,180
Excellent.

494
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:29,200
Seems like he has accepted his fate.

495
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,830
Growing these spiritual herbs and plants to about three hundred years old should be enough.

496
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,700
If I concoct the pills based on the formulas in the book,

497
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,590
I'll have ample supplies for consumption.

498
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,800
These should be enough.

499
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Yellow Dragon Pill can strengthen my power.

500
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,960
Golden Marrow Pill can transform mortal bones into immortal bones.

501
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,450
If I take them together, their effect will be amazing.

502
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,490
This is bad.

503
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:04,900
If this carries on,

504
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,950
my Meridian system will be overwhelmed by these herbs.

505
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:09,310
I must quickly circulate my vital energy to make a breakthrough.

506
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:44,629
Is this Level Four?

507
00:51:44,629 --> 00:51:49,960
I can now understand the greatness of this chant.

508
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,660
I can sense the breaths of things around me.

509
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:54,544
No.

510
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:57,674
Sensing them is not enough.

511
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:31,994
Not enough.

512
00:52:31,994 --> 00:52:33,905
Still not enough.

513
00:52:33,905 --> 00:52:37,762
Perception alone is not enough to resist Physician Mo.

514
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:39,702
I need to be stronger.

515
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,440
I kept you waiting for a long time, Junior Brother Han.

516
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,660
Senior Brother Li, you're swift.

517
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,010
But you still arrived first.

518
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,710
This Violent Python Power is too brutal.

519
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,660
It doesn't suit me.

520
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,050
Do you have any smaller, gentler, and more subtle techniques?

521
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:14,735
I do.

522
00:53:14,735 --> 00:53:17,566
Junior Brother Han, tell me honestly.

523
00:53:17,566 --> 00:53:19,449
Did you offend someone?

524
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:21,660
Tell me if someone wants to harm you.

525
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,980
I won't let them bully you.

526
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:27,860
You can't help me forever.

527
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,165
You study medical skills.

528
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:35,016
Didn't your master teach you how to handle villains? You should...

529
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:37,056
use poisons.

530
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,775
You're right.

531
00:53:40,775 --> 00:53:42,595
This is also a strategy,

532
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:47,000
but one can never have too many strategies against enemies.

533
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,410
Speak.

534
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,320
What do you want to learn?

535
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,190
I want to be agile, use hidden weapons,

536
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:05,260
and have a way to defeat enemies without relying on real energy.

537
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:08,150
For example, Smokescreen Step.

538
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,800
Smokescreen Step?

539
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,190
You want to learn my secret technique?

540
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:16,210
Will you teach me or not?

541
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:20,230
Just because I can use it with ease doesn't mean it's easy.

542
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:24,070
It took me five years to master it.

543
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:30,240
I don't have much time,

544
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,080
but I still want to learn from Senior Brother Li.

545
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,510
Seems like I need to demonstrate a few moves

546
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:39,630
to check if you'll give up.

547
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,420
Watch carefully.

548
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,590
At this point,

549
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:15,920
I'm not that gullible to believe that when I reach Level Four,

550
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,590
Physician Mo will spare my life after treating him.

551
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,150
At the crucial moment,

552
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,690
I should protect myself.

559
00:57:09,097 --> 00:57:12,594
â™«  And are hard to forget  â™«

560
00:57:12,594 --> 00:57:17,360
â™«  Why not just reminisce about them?  â™«

561
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:24,000
â™«  Itâ€™s said that the past is like smoke  â™«

562
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,800
â™«  Looking back, itâ€™s so absurd that I canâ€™t bear to talk about it  â™«

563
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,360
â™«  The noisy mortal world, those lonely scrolls  â™«

564
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,700
â™«  Swept away by the passing years  â™«

565
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,960

569
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,040
â™«  Like the horizon  â™«

570
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:56,040
â™«  It comes into view again  â™«

571
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,480
â™«  Looking back from the mountain peak  â™«

572
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,380

574
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:09,900
â™«  Or tomorrow?  â™«

575
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,900

576
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,540

578
