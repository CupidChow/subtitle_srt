Episode 16

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Did you see it?

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They are all in that hole.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Even if I dig it today,

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I have to dig it out.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Young Master,

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the mine's cave is round and round.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The fork in it is a little bit crooked.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Those are the strange things.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Focus!

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's complicated and hard to find.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Wait, Young Master.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's hard to find if you don't dig it.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Young Master,

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I mean,

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
just a few rats

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
can't get any air.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They don't need to be...

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Rats?

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Master.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You are quite useful.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Rats.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So, should we

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
use the method of

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
dealing with rats?

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Right?

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Brothers,

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't think the devil is that great.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If we get into the mountain,

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
they will take us down.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes, unless they move the mountain.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If they can,

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
they can blow up the mountain.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,960
The

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
road시

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
it's hot...

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Young Master, you need to know.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If you use the road시,

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
we can't go out of the mine.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Our Aunt would get angry, too.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,760
Go.

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,480
Hurry.

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
Run to the cave.

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:40,800
Go.

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,280
Hurry.

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,160
Hurry.

52
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,800
Hurry.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This demon is crazy.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He threw the Han's tally into his own cave.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,240
Once the mine is destroyed,

56
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
no one can find us.

57
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
We just have to wait for the earthquake to pass.

58
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
You're right.

59
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
When we get out,

60
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
I'll treat you to a drink.

61
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,400
Brother Li,

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
please.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Go.

64
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Who's here?

65
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,440
Show yourself.

66
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh no.

67
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,840
Why did we meet them again?

68
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Han Li is here.

69
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,400
Is it Brother Lv and Brother Xuan?

70
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
It's us.

71
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Han Shengyi,

72
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,000
hurry to the front.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We have to get out of here.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You two,

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
it's great

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
that you're fine.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You're really something, Han Shengyi.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What did I say?

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Han Shengyi will definitely

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
have a way to save his life.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Han Shengyi,

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
have you seen other disciples?

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm the one who

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
escaped from the earthquake.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But the Yellow Wind Valley

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
has a thousand-level skill.

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
When we're in danger,

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
we can position ourselves

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and guard against each other.

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Senior Chen

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
is also very powerful.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
She has many high-level magical weapons.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm looking for her.

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll go now.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Han Shengyi, wait.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I've heard about

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the thousand-level skill of the Yellow Wind Valley.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But I've never seen it.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a fate

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
to meet you here today.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why don't you

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
come with me?

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's good to have a care.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You're right.

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I think

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
we should find a way

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to get out of here first.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Find the exit

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and then go to find Senior Chen together.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's safer

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
if we're all together.

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What do you think?

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Good.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Han Li

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
is really

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
unworthy of those two seniors.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Han Shengyi,

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
please.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Once we find the exit,

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
they'll definitely turn up.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We have to find a way

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
to get out of here first.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm not going to shoot anymore.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Give me another one.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll go now.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll go now.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll go now.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll go now.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You...

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You didn't find it?

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I was teaching him just now.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I said,

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
look for it.

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Think about it.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No.

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This...

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Did you see a guy from Huangfeng Valley

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
who's so tall?

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm going now.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's so tall on the ground.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He's a normal guy.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Did you see him?

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You didn't see him?

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's go.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Young Master,

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,080
the top of the mountain is made of

148
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,000
the stone of the Qiangxu Sect.

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Why is it from Huangfeng Valley?

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I know.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We didn't find him.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's all inside.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We found a snack store.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Young Master.

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Young Master.

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I've done a great job.

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Young Master.

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I know you're looking for a scolding.

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're looking for a body

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
named Li, right?

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He's not here.

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
How do you know?

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How could someone like him

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
be a match for a fool like him?

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You know him well.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It doesn't matter.

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I have a better news.

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's all inside.

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's all inside.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's the place where the stone of the Qiangxu Sect

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
is hidden.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Why do you have a stone?

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's the style of my father-in-law.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Every hidden treasure

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
is strange.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Young Master, you're wise.

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's good.

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Just move away.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't keep it.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Just take it as your wife's dowry.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
She asked you to let me stay in the back

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
to search the battlefield.

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You know I'm not here.

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You even made me look like this.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You're too cruel.

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What's wrong, Junior Brother Han?

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Nothing.

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I was too careless.

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't worry, Junior Brother Han.

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll protect you.

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You'll be safe.

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's go.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's go and have a look.

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Together?

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm not going.

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm not going.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm not going.

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm not going.

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm not going.

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm not going.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Go and have a look.

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes.

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,040
Luoni.

206
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
It's the Lucy of the Folk House.

207
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,920
Why are we here?

208
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,760
Casey.

209
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,160
Hey there.

210
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,780
Move!

211
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,300
This is danger.

212
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,240
Steady feet.

213
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,400
Those two are next to me.

214
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,680
We need to be careful.

215
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
What is this?

216
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Dead beast.

217
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
White jade pearl.

218
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
How can there be such a thing?

219
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
This beast is huge.

220
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
The action is not slow.

221
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
This evil beast protects me fast.

222
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Can't you escape?

223
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Let's fight together.

224
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Take this action.

225
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Don't hide.

226
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
It seems not that simple.

227
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
It's mutated.

228
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,920
It's actually a blood jade beast.

229
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
What should we do?

230
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
It's a big deal.

231
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
I'll take care of it.

232
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
I'll take care of it.

233
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
I'll take care of it.

234
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
I'll take care of it.

235
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
I'll take care of it.

236
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
I'll take care of it.

237
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
I'll take care of it.

238
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
I'll take care of it.

239
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
I'll take care of it.

240
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
I'll take care of it.

241
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
I'll take care of it.

242
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
I'll take care of it.

243
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
I'll take care of it.

244
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
I'll take care of it.

245
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
I'll take care of it.

246
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
I'll take care of it.

247
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
I'll take care of it.

248
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
I'll take care of it.

249
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,920
I'll take care of it.

250
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
I'll take care of it.

251
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
I'll take care of it.

252
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
I'll take care of it.

253
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
I'll take care of it.

254
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
I'll take care of it.

255
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I'll take care of it.

256
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
I'll take care of it.

257
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
I'll take care of it.

258
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
I'll take care of it.

259
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
I'll take care of it.

260
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
I'll take care of it.

261
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
I'll take care of it.

262
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
I'll take care of it.

263
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
I'll take care of it.

264
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
I'll take care of it.

265
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
I'll take care of it.

266
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
I'll take care of it.

267
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
I'll take care of it.

268
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
I'll take care of it.

269
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
I'll take care of it.

270
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
I'll take care of it.

271
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
I'll take care of it.

272
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
I'll take care of it.

273
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
I'll take care of it.

274
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
I'll take care of it.

275
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
I'll take care of it.

276
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,920
I'll take care of it.

277
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
I'll take care of it.

278
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
I'll take care of it.

279
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:30,740
Why would you turn your

280
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,860
bros to weaker beings?

281
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,860
I'll kill him.

282
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
Little brother,

283
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,660
you trap this bastard first.

284
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,860
I'll use the talisman to kill him.

285
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,860
The base is quite thick.

286
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,460
There's actually a talisman.

287
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,260
It seems that they're not all the same.

288
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,860
There's something wrong with them.

289
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,260
What's wrong?

290
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,260
Someone's coming.

291
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,260
It seems we'reние

292
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:53,740
dangerous

293
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,340
Ahí

294
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,660
Away

295
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:00,900
nehme

296
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,140
away

297
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,420
Take

298
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:01,820
this

299
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,860
Xun Yue, it's you.

300
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:30,460
ab텐

301
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,460
Come out, Junior Brother.

302
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
I saw you.

303
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,060
You didn't want to trap that spider, did you?

304
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,140
She attacked, you killed her.

305
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,060
I just did a little trick.

306
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,460
It's not a big deal.

307
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,260
You robbed the temporary warehouse here before you died?

308
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,260
I just think that you're not simple.

309
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,860
You're not like that stupid idiot who only thinks about snacks.

310
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,860
You only want to kill us to take the money.

311
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:20,860
But how can those dirty things compare with the real treasure here?

312
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,860
What do you mean?

313
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:31,860
Junior Brother Han, don't you want to know what's over there?

314
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:38,860
Don't you want to know what's beyond the Southern Continent?

315
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,860
I don't want to know.

316
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,860
Someone said the same thing to me before.

317
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
And then?

318
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,860
Did that person go out?

319
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,860
She's dead.

320
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,860
I thought Junior Brother Han and I were the same kind of people.

321
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,860
Then please continue to play with this bastard.

322
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,860
Don't worry.

323
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,860
Don't worry.

324
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,860
I'll clean up for you.

325
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,860
Oh, no.

326
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Where did the students go?

327
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,860
I have to find this guy.

328
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,860
I found it.

329
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,860
I found it.

330
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,860
This is the Qingming Mirror of our Yanyue Sect.

331
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,860
Where did you come from?

332
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,860
I'm here.

333
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
I'm here.

334
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,860
I'm here.

335
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,860
I'm here.

336
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
I'm here.

337
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,860
I'm here.

338
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
I'm here.

339
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,860
I'm here.

340
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,860
I'm here.

341
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
I'm here.

342
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,860
I'm here.

343
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,860
Where did you come from?

344
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
It's useless, Junior Brother Han.

345
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,860
Hurry up.

346
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,860
Hurry up.

347
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,860
There's a puppet.

348
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,860
You still know?

349
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,860
You're so scheming.

350
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,860
I said, Brother Zhu,

351
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,860
let's discuss it.

352
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,860
He's a little too strong.

353
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,860
Go.

354
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,860
Hold him.

355
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,860
The blood is retreating.

356
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
It seems that he can't hold on for long.

357
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,860
It's not bad.

358
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,860
They're all good things.

359
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,860
And the snacks they stole

360
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,860
can't be wasted.

361
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,860
I'm here.

362
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,860
I'm here.

363
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,860
I'm here.

364
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,860
This is the Spider Wheel.

365
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,860
Don't worry.

366
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,860
I'll take good care of them in the future.

367
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,860
This is what Xuan Yue said.

368
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,860
Can you go to the transmission array outside?

369
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,860
Don't you want to know

370
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
what's out there

371
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,860
in the southern continent?

372
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,860
The outside world.

373
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,860
Is this array

374
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,860
used to send far away?

375
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
Unfortunately, it's damaged.

376
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,860
It's not safe.

377
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
Unfortunately, it's damaged.

378
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,860
What's this?

379
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,860
Is it a bullet?

380
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,860
The Order of Nuo Yi?

381
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,860
With this,

382
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,860
maybe we can find a way to repair the array.

383
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,860
So much greed,

384
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,860
scheming and dreams.

385
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,860
In the end,

386
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,860
it's just a dream.

387
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,860
Turned into a dream.

388
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,860
This transmission array

389
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,860
is a surprise for Kuang Dong.

390
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,860
Although I don't know

391
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,860
what will affect me in the future,

392
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
I think

393
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
it will be a very important piece.

394
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,860
At least, I can get some information

395
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
from it.

396
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,860
I'll go to the transmission array.

397
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,860
I'll go to the transmission array.

398
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,860
But now,

399
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,860
this secret

400
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,860
can't be known to anyone.

401
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
Mark it.

402
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,860
When we find someone

403
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,860
who can repair the array in the future,

404
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,860
we'll come back here.

405
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
Right now.

406
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,860
You are Xiyi,

407
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,860
not a dog.

408
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
You look like Xiyi.

409
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,780
Brother Han, are you there?

410
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,820
sister Chen

411
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,900
sister

412
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,700
Where are you

413
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,260
This is the pill that Gu Ben Pei gave you.

414
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,260
Take it to your room.

415
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,420
I should have listened to you earlier.

416
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,180
I'm sorry.

417
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,820
I shouldn't have let you down.

418
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,780
I'm sorry.

419
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,860
I'm sorry.

420
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,860
I'm sorry.

421
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,860
I'm sorry.

422
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,860
I'm sorry.

423
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,860
I'm sorry.

424
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,860
I'm sorry.

425
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,300
Maybe later on.

426
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,580
You're still alive.

427
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,540
That's good.

428
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,820
We're located at the same address.

429
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,860
We can't just leave her here.

430
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,860
Senior, you're awake

431
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,860
Put me down first

432
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,860
Are there any survivors?

433
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,860
No one else is here

434
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,860
Xuan Yue and Lv Tian Meng

435
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
They didn't show up until the end

436
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,860
I guess

437
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,860
they sneaked into the stockade in advance

438
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,860
and escaped

439
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,860
They escaped from the formation

440
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,860
Even if they were still alive

441
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
they wouldn't show up

442
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,860
I'm sorry

443
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,860
He thought so

444
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,860
and gave me an explanation

445
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,860
In this world

446
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,860
no one knows that

447
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,860
those two bad guys have disappeared

448
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,860
Junior Han

449
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,860
Wipe it

450
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,860
Did he remember

451
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,860
what happened before?

452
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,860
Junior Han

453
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,860
About Senior Lu

454
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,860
you should have some idea about me

455
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,860
I'm the eldest daughter of Chen family

456
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,860
I can't decide

457
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,860
I just don't want to lose to others

458
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,860
Now

459
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,860
Forget it

460
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,860
I won't mention it

461
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,860
It's good

462
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,860
It seems that he didn't remember it completely

463
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,860
Although

464
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,860
it's been a long time

465
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,860
Lu killed someone

466
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,860
first

467
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,860
it's not a bad thing

468
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,860
to kill your accomplice

469
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,860
I always think you're amazing

470
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,860
You used your body

471
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,860
to feed the spirits and your ability

472
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,860
and you've learned a lot

473
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,860
You must have suffered a lot

474
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,860
Senior

475
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,860
Why do you mention it?

476
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,860
I just think I envy you

477
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,860
I envy your freedom

478
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,860
I envy your strength

479
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,860
to keep going

480
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,860
Of course

481
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,860
I'm a cultivator

482
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,860
I may make you think

483
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,860
I'm not blessed

484
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,860
and I don't respect your efforts

485
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
But

486
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,860
What am I talking about?

487
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,860
Junior Han

488
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,860
You don't think I'm a strange person, do you?

489
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,860
Lu

490
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,860
tried to bully me

491
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,860
Senior

492
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,860
helped me stop him many times

493
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,860
Han Li knows

494
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,860
Senior is different from him

495
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,860
That's good

496
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,860
I thought you hated me

497
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,860
How could I?

498
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,860
Junior, why did you

499
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,860
do that?

500
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,860
Is it because of your family?

501
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,860
It's related to my family

502
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,860
but not much

503
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
Why?

504
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,860
If I have to say

505
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,860
it's because of some cakes

506
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,860
Cakes?

507
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,860
Cakes?

508
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,860
Do you still like cakes?

509
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,860
It's my first time hearing

510
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,860
someone cultivates because they like cakes

511
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,860
You're so interesting

512
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,860
You're hurt

513
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,860
Come on

514
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,860
I have some naughty brothers

515
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,860
Every time I get hurt

516
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,860
I, the elder sister, will help them

517
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,860
Do you have a sister?

518
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,860
I have a younger sister

519
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,860
She loves cakes more than me

520
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,860
Does it still hurt?

521
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,860
Thank you for your concern

522
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,860
Let's go

523
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,860
There's no trace of the demon

524
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
around here

525
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,860
It's safe now

526
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,860
We'll be back in time

527
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,860
when we're in the middle of the night

528
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,860
We can go back to the control area

529
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,860
We don't meet often

530
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,860
but every time I see you

531
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,860
your eyes are so firm

532
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,860
It seems that your heart never wavers

533
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,860
I think

534
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,860
you're a strong person

535
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,860
I also want to be strong

536
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,860
like you

537
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,860
but I don't even have a chance

538
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,860
to choose

539
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,860
I thought I could accept

540
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,860
everything my family arranged for me

541
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,860
but after what happened to Lu Mingyuan

542
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,860
I can't

543
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,860
I can't

544
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,860
I'm afraid

545
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,860
I'm afraid that I can't

546
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,860
be controlled by others

547
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,860
So you're going to the front line

548
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,860
I don't know if this decision is right or wrong

549
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,860
but I want to try it myself

550
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,860
Right or wrong

551
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,860
is not important

552
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,860
Then what's important?

553
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,860
I

554
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,860
It's me

555
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,860
It's important

556
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
I am me

557
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,860
Right or wrong

558
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,860
is not in others' mouth

559
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,860
but in my heart

560
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,860
I'm hungry

561
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,860
Junior Han

562
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,860
Do you want to eat?

563
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,860
Can I eat?

564
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,860
It smells good

565
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,860
Yes

566
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,860
Junior Han, you've been lucky

567
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,860
and it's thanks to your warning

568
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,860
But

569
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,860
what's your secret

570
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,660
and escaped from the mine.

571
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:06,980
I remember

572
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,700
you have some puppets.

573
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,460
You know everything.

574
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,460
Why do you ask?

575
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,380
How about

576
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,820
we go together

577
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,340
and work together?

578
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,660
No way.

579
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,700
If you want,

580
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,980
I don't mind.

581
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,460
But I think

582
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,860
you haven't recovered yet.

583
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,300
Take the pill

584
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,300
and take a break.

585
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,900
Okay.

586
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,220
Not so much.

587
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,020
Wu Peng.

588
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,660
I have

589
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,220
a lot of pills.

590
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:23,060
This is

591
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,580
fresh Microcluster-Igny.

592
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,100
of Forest of Nectar?

593
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,480
Ok.

594
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
He'll be safe this way.

595
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:49,820
During this time,

596
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,620
열애 polished a severe miscalculation.

597
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,500
We need to find a place

598
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,460
where he'll recover his balance

599
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,460
and strengthen his state divide

600
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,880
to deal with the corporate war.

601
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,820
I'm afraid that

602
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,500
exploring Huang Trung Gu

603
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,780
Let's go to the Golden Valley.

604
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,580
Forget the past,

605
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,580
it's yesterday,

606
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,580
it's tomorrow.

607
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,580
The sea of blue sky is different from the past.

608
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:52,580
Time will also change everything in the world.

609
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,580
Only this year,

610
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:02,580
it has been crossed a thousand years.

611
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:08,580
In the moment of forever.

612
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:19,580
In the moment of forever.
