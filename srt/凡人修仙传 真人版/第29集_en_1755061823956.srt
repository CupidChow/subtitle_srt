00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 13

2
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,640
The brakes of Yellow Wind Valley

3
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,400
have led to today's stormy night.

4
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,360
These traces of war

5
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,240
may have disappeared.

6
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,600
No matter wherelikraction would be,

7
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
I'll go to ask around

8
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,280
What's on my mind?

9
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,280
I only have this one

10
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
You don't know?

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
Senior sister

12
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
I'll go to ask around

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
When senior brother Huaian just entered the sect

14
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
He and I often come here to see the snow mountain

15
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
He misses the old days the most

16
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
When he came back

17
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
He must be happy

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
We had an appointment

19
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
We came to see the snow mountain together

20
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I didn't expect

21
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Now I send him a letter in this way

22
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I miss another friend who can drink with me

23
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
The most important person in the Yanyue Sect is his favorite mother

24
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
What's your plan after this?

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
I heard that the people of Huangfenggu went to the Nine-Globes Alliance

26
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
I'm just a nun now

27
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I don't care about the Taoism or Huangfenggu

28
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
I have nothing to do with these old things

29
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
But I promised senior brother Huaian before

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
He promised me to go to the Nine-Globes Alliance

31
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I promised him

32
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I promised senior brother Huaian before

33
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
I have to take care of his disciples

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Especially his most important disciple

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Now he is missing

36
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Is he the silly boy named Han?

37
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Han Li

38
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I've seen him before

39
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Yes

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
He looks ordinary

41
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
But he has such a little trick

42
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
So I can notice him

43
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I think so

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Although this boy is average

45
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I think he is different from others

46
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
And he is lucky

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Xun went to the Nine-Globes Alliance with him

48
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
He will miss him after he comes back

49
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
I'm worried about him

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm worried about him

51
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
I see

52
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
He is so ungrateful

53
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
It's just a matter between the little girls

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Now it's useless to talk about it

55
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
I just hope he can be like usual

56
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
And have some way to save his life

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Since it's senior brother Li's wish

58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I will help senior sister to find him

59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
It's no trouble for junior sister

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Besides, I planned to arrange everything here

61
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
And go to find them

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
You are welcome

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Now the Nine-Globes Alliance is going to be in peace with the Demon Realm

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I have nothing to do

65
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
In this case, thank you

66
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I have to go now

67
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Senior sister Huaian, don't worry

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
We will find them

69
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Come

70
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Eat this

71
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
The wind rises and the sword blows

72
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Like the sky changes and like the face

73
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Looking back at the mountain top

74
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
I have forgotten the world

75
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,600
It's yesterday, it's tomorrow

76
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,600
The sea of the past is still the same as the past

77
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
The time has passed and the dream has come to an end

78
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Junior brother Han, it's me

79
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Junior brother, you are awake

80
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,600
The time has passed and the dream has come to an end

81
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
The time has passed and the dream has come to an end

82
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Be careful

83
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Senior brother Su, senior sister Yong

84
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Why are you here?

85
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
I won't say it now

86
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I have some water from outside

87
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
You drink some first

88
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Who is this big man?

89
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
He keeps watching you

90
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Two days and two nights

91
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
You are not a man

92
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I am a brother

93
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
I have some pills, you can take some

94
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Didn't you go to the Golden Valley?

95
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
No

96
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,600
It is finally hailed by the two weapons

97
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Yes

98
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
It was challenging before the battle

99
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,640
Lin Shoushan and Tian Quebao

100
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,840
these traitors

101
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,040
I will make them pay for it one day

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,080
You are still injured

103
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,640
What are you waiting for?

104
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,240
Besides, the Yellow Wind Valley is falling

105
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,280
The Demon is searching for it

106
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,600
We have to find a way to survive

107
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,080
The Yellow Wind Valley is falling

108
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,280
OK

109
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,600
Where are master and master's?

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,560
When I escaped

111
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,040
they fought with the traitors

112
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,140
Any news of them?

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,880
We just got some level of information

114
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,200
etic

115
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,000
To give the Red Wind Valley a zobit

116
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,880
Ladies over there

117
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
and destroy the elixir.

118
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,520
It's already in effect.

119
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,800
How could this happen?

120
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:03,920
Yea right.

121
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,960
Master...

122
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,800
When I...

123
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,360
went to see Master Hongfu,

124
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,360
I probably

125
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,240
would have disregard my own knowledge.

126
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,280
Master always gets what he wants in his mind

127
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,080
All we,

128
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,560
this time,

129
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,320
is decorative

130
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,080
John

131
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,760
John

132
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,220
John

133
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,080
Are you good at chess?

134
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,440
I know

135
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,060
But my Chinese is so bad

136
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm not dead

137
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,000
But if I were

138
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,360
I would...

139
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,960
If I were dead

140
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,620
Maybe that's undeniable

141
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,580
you can tell me

142
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:17,820
It's just a piece of burden

143
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,140
who's in danger

144
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,280
have you started delicate가지ing

145
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,300
wait

146
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,740
Chief

147
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,900
Chief

148
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,460
Chief

149
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,300
Please

150
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,300
Chief

151
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,880
Please

152
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,760
I need her more than you do

153
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,080
I embroidered it for Ji Chen Gong

154
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,400
that year

155
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,640
Master has always been by your side

156
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
like a baby

157
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,640
I can choose

158
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
I think now

159
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,160
how do we live

160
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,960
onsey in the blink of an eye

161
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,080
that you see

162
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,320
and the blood

163
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,640
that I paid for

164
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,040
can live officially

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
That's what I thought

166
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
before we became friends

167
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,400
That's not what I remember

168
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,360
this is what I serenaded with Str Dieu

169
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,480
for Dani

170
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,840
The last thing Master did before his death

171
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,880
was erasing my Heavenly Qi.

172
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,860
Come to think of it,

173
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,180
those Folk rectus

174
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,800
always detected everything in us

175
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,140
until then.

176
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,780
Even when Master didn't say anything,

177
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,620
I still understood it all.

178
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,300
If anything goes wrong,

179
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,580
Could it be

180
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:12,500
that we were betrayed by the

181
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,940
disciples of the Yellow Wind Valley?

182
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,820
It's just that I pity those disciples of the Yellow Wind Valley.

183
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,500
I didn't even know

184
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,220
that I became the bargaining chip of the trade.

185
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,260
Maybe

186
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,380
this is the rule of the world.

187
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,060
But we can't change it

188
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,060
with the current situation.

189
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,540
And I

190
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,220
don't want to be the pawn on the board anymore.

191
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,420
It's time

192
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,140
to change the way we live.

193
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,020
As long as we live,

194
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,380
there will be hope.

195
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,140
I don't want to be the pawn on the board anymore.

196
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,500
Junior,

197
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,860
I don't want to go to the meeting

198
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,020
after hearing you say that.

199
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,180
Wei Niang, what about you?

200
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,060
How about we go to Uncle Hong Bu

201
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,180
and see what he plans?

202
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,460
Junior,

203
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,420
you've gone to the自由 temple.

204
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,820
Even if the Yellow Wind Valley is gone,

205
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,740
we're still here.

206
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,700
But if we have a chance in the future,

207
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,460
we must see each other again.

208
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,700
Senior, Senior,

209
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,860
let's say goodbye.

210
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:21,740
Junior.

211
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,300
Junior.

212
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,300
Take care.

213
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,340
Take care.

214
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,500
Senior, Senior,

215
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,340
let's say goodbye.

216
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,340
Junior, Senior,

217
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,140
let's say goodbye.

218
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
Senior, Senior,

219
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
let's say goodbye.

220
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
Senior, Senior,

221
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,140
let's say goodbye.

222
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,140
Senior, Senior,

223
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,140
let's say goodbye.

224
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,140
Senior, Senior,

225
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,140
let's say goodbye.

226
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,140
Senior, Senior,

227
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,140
let's say goodbye.

228
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,140
Senior, Senior,

229
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,140
let's say goodbye.

230
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,140
Senior, Senior,

231
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,140
let's say goodbye.

232
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,140
Senior, Senior,

233
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,140
let's say goodbye.

234
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,140
Senior, Senior,

235
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,140
let's say goodbye.

236
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,140
Senior, Senior,

237
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,140
let's say goodbye.

238
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,140
Senior, Senior,

239
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,140
let's say goodbye.

240
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,140
Senior, Senior,

241
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,140
let's say goodbye.

242
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,140
Senior, Senior,

243
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,140
let's say goodbye.

244
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
Senior, Senior,

245
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,020
let's say goodbye.

246
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,020
Senior, Senior,

247
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,020
let's say goodbye.

248
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,460
Senior, Senior,

249
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,460
let's say goodbye.

250
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,420
Senior, Senior,

251
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,860
let's say goodbye.

252
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,860
Senior, Senior,

253
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,900
let's say goodbye.

254
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,220
Senior, Senior,

255
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,300
let's say goodbye.

256
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,340
It's hard to resurrection with him.

257
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,580
Even there's a regret,

258
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,780
it'll remain unique for us.

259
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,900
too late

260
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,120
The masters told me to

261
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,560
explore the scenery outside

262
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:09,380
dar these 될

263
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:20,580
They came too late

264
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,460
I often get sprayed with a box of wine,

265
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,340
and the young lady is thus angry already.

266
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,820
Miss Rong Ying,

267
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,500
Rong Ying

268
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,180
is so rough,

269
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:50,220
I don't believe in her

270
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,980
to solve all the problems.

271
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,260
The other one

272
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,380
is all my books on formation.

273
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,820
And some

274
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,460
rare formation books on the market.

275
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,580
I hope you can take these two things.

276
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,380
I don't know anything about martial arts.

277
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,540
What do you want me to do?

278
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,620
I know I have no time.

279
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,140
I want you to promise me

280
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,900
that my husband

281
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,060
was hunted down by the Fu family.

282
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,860
He died

283
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,140
after being badly injured.

284
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,460
I want you to

285
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,620
avenge the Fu family

286
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,260
for my husband.

287
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,700
The Fu family has been stealing the Yuanwu State for a long time.

288
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,900
They are robbing and killing people.

289
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,820
To them,

290
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,580
it's like a family crime.

291
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,660
I know

292
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,700
it's an excessive request.

293
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,420
But there's nothing else.

294
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,300
Let's talk about it later.

295
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
Sc gegenキ

296
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,260
If so,

297
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,980
I will give you a promise.

298
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,100
When I can afford it,

299
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,340
I will defend you

300
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,140
with any help necessary.

301
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,540
Xi,

302
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,660
please take my advice.

303
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:49,500
Ru Pir gebeakin

304
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,420
Ruirin.

305
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,740
Her hemof aquarium

306
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
I've searched many places

307
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,680
and found some

308
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,680
of the elixirs

309
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,460
Although I can't make it

310
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,900
I can make it

311
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,420
to make it less painful

312
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,580
It's not that serious

313
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
I'll be here

314
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,700
for a few days

315
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,400
to open the elixir for you

316
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,200
Thank you, Mr. Han

317
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,400
I'll ask you

318
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,700
to stay here for a few days

319
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,160
After Ruyi

320
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,700
completes the transfer

321
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,200
I'll give it to you

322
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,500
Thank you

323
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Master

324
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Although I still don't understand

325
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,900
I don't regret

326
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,900
agreeing to his request

327
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,900
But all of this

328
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,900
will be

329
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,900
when I get the elixir

330
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,900
I'll be weak

331
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,900
and lose my strength

332
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
I'll only be

333
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,900
a dead man

334
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
Mr. Han

335
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
You and your husband

336
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
don't know

337
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
that it's hard to repair

338
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
the ancient magic array

339
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
and no longer remember the magic

340
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,900
It's the essence

341
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
of the magic array

342
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
that needs to be exhausted

343
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
You don't need to blame yourself

344
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
Now you know

345
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,900
that you have no more time

346
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,900
It's a good thing

347
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
that you can train yourself

348
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,900
Finally

349
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
you can use my power

350
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,900
to make it work

351
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,900
I'm so happy

352
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,900
to see you

353
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,900
Finally

354
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
I can use my death

355
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,900
to make you proud

356
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
It's worth it

357
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,900
This room

358
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
was built by my husband

359
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
It's my home

360
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
I just want to trouble you

361
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,900
to bury me

362
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,900
next to your tomb

363
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
after I die

364
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Mr. Han

365
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
The ancient array

366
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,900
is really amazing

367
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,900
With the power of a little girl

368
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
you can only make it work

369
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,900
with your effort

370
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,900
You can put it on the stone board

371
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,900
and fill it with the missing material

372
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,900
and then use the big slave's jade

373
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
to start the array

374
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,900
It's a long story

375
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,900
and it's easy to understand

376
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,900
But the array is old

377
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,900
and the information is limited

378
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,900
We can't find the destination

379
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,900
for it

380
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
But I believe

381
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
with your energy

382
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,900
it can make it work

383
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
I'm so happy

384
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,900
to be born and die

385
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,900
I have enough money

386
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,900
I hope you can be safe

387
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,900
and don't forget your promise

388
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
I will do my best

389
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
I will do my best

390
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,900
The array is not too bad

391
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
It seems that Chen Songzhen

392
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,900
is not found

393
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,900
I hate to die

394
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,900
Is it Nan Gong?

395
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
Why is he here?

396
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,900
I'm so scared

397
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,900
I'm scared

398
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
I'm scared

399
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,900
I'm scared

400
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
I'm scared

401
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
I'm scared

402
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,900
I'm scared

403
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
I'm scared

404
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,900
I'm scared

405
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
I'm scared

406
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,900
I'm scared

407
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
I'm scared

408
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,900
I'm scared

409
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,900
I'm scared

410
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,900
I'm scared

411
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
I'm scared

412
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,900
I'm scared

413
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,900
I'm scared

414
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,900
I'm scared

415
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,900
I'm scared

416
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,900
I'm scared

417
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,900
I'm scared

418
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,900
I'm scared

419
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
I'm scared

420
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
I'm scared

421
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,900
I'm scared

422
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,900
I'm scared

423
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,900
I'm scared

424
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,900
I'm scared

425
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,900
I'm scared

426
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,900
I'm scared

427
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,900
I'm scared

428
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,900
I'm scared

429
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
I'm scared

430
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,900
I'm scared

431
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,900
I'm scared

432
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
I'm scared

433
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,900
I'm scared

434
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
I'm scared

435
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,900
I'm scared

436
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
I'm scared

437
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
I'm scared

438
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
I'm scared

439
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
I'm scared

440
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
I'm scared

441
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,900
I'm scared

442
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
I'm scared

443
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
I'm scared

444
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,900
I'm scared

445
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
I'm scared

446
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,900
I'm scared

447
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,900
I'm scared

I'm scared

I'm scared

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,900
I'm scared

451
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,900
I'm scared

452
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,900
I'm scared

453
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,900
I'm scared

454
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,900
I'm scared

455
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
I'm scared

456
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,900
I'm scared

457
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,900
I'm scared

458
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,900
I'm scared

459
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
I'm scared

460
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
I'm scared

461
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
I'm scared

462
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,900
I'm scared

463
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
I'm scared

464
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
I'm scared

465
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,900
I'm scared

466
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,900
I'm scared

467
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
I'm scared

468
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
I'm scared

469
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
I'm scared

470
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,900
I'm scared

471
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,900
I'm scared

472
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,900
I'm scared

473
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,900
I'm scared

474
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
I'm scared

475
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
I'm scared

476
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,900
I'm scared

477
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
I'm scared

478
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
I'm scared

479
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
I'm scared

480
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
I'm scared

481
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,900
I'm scared

482
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
I'm scared

483
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,900
I'm scared

484
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,900
Nanguang Senior from the movie

485
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,900
You're badly injured

486
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,900
and you're still able to survive

487
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,900
You're indeed a master of the Moon Sect

488
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,900
It's him again

489
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,900
This is a man who never leaves

490
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,900
I think

491
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,900
the incident of countless prisoners being kidnapped

492
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,900
was also caused by you

493
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,020
Little

494
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,900
You're so desperate

495
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,900
Are you really going to die?

496
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,900
Senior, you're being too serious

497
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
If this were to be put in the ordinary days

498
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,900
I wouldn't dare

499
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,900
But you came today

500
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,900
You're the father of the Ghost Realm Sect

501
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,900
Is there something important?

502
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,900
Why don't you come to my sect and have a cup of tea?

503
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
You let me

504
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
get closer to the owner

505
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
It's all because of the boy who was looking for Hanlin

506
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,900
Damn it

507
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
Why did he go to Yanjia Fort?

508
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,900
No interest

509
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
No mood

510
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,900
No time

511
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,900
If you don't want to die, get lost

512
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,900
It's a pity that you're injured

513
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,900
Old fellow

514
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,900
Didn't you two say you would be loyal to me again?

515
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,900
If you're not loyal to me

516
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,900
Then go show some sincerity

517
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,900
He's looking for death

518
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
The old man

519
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,900
went through the forest in front

520
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
to the mountain behind

521
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
to cut his way

522
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,900
Damn it

523
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
He was already in the branch

524
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,900
but he dared to do it now

525
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
Forget it

526
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,900
Let's go

527
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,900
ambush here

528
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
Yes

529
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,900
It's him

530
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,900
He seems to be injured

531
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Dong Xuan'er

532
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,900
Why is he here?

533
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,900
Did Dong Xuan'er invest in the devil?

534
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,900
And this ghostly young master

535
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,900
who is not distracted by the soul

536
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,900
I didn't expect to be a good monk

537
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,900
and learn some little tricks

538
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,900
I'm afraid I can't be a good monk

539
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,900
I'm afraid I can't be a good monk

540
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,900
I'm afraid I can't be a good monk

541
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
I'm afraid I can't be a good monk

542
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
You even learned some

543
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
small escape techniques

544
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
Senior

545
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,900
You don't fight and run away

546
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
Don't you feel ashamed?

547
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
I'm not as good as you

548
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,900
Qingcheng is a little bit shameless

549
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,900
What are you two waiting for?

550
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,900
Sect Leader

551
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,900
I'm Dong Xuan'er

552
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
a disciple of the Red Talisman of the Yellow Wind Valley

553
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
Greetings, Senior

554
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
Dong Shizhi

555
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,900
Why are you with these demon and demon?

556
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,900
It's a long story

557
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,900
Please come with us

558
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,900
As long as we solve this misunderstanding

559
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,900
Now your sect is negotiating with the six sects

560
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,900
Xuan'er can ensure your safety

561
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,900
The so-called negotiation

562
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,900
is just a wish of some people

563
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,900
The righteous and evil are not two sides

564
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
The devil is for his own personal interests

565
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,900
and disrupt the world

566
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,900
I don't like to fight

567
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,900
But I have to avenge the hatred of my friends

568
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
Let's end it here today

569
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,900
Senior

570
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,900
Your magic weapon has been damaged

571
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
Although this sword move is powerful

572
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
it also likes real yuan

573
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,900
Senior, look

574
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,900
Can we kill so many people?

575
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,900
Yes

576
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
Don't come over

577
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,900
It's him

578
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,900
Why is he here?

579
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,900
Wait a moment

580
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,900
I'll kill you

581
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,900
Don't move

582
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
This man is good

583
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,900
He sneaked into my team without saying anything

584
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,900
Senior

585
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,900
He is far away from me

586
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,900
It's inconvenient to meet

587
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,900
Please deal with him

588
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,900
Since it's him

589
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
How can he be here?

590
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,900
I can't let him know that I'm here

591
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,900
It's so embarrassing

592
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
Move away

593
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,900
Don't hurt me

594
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,900
You, let go of my young master

595
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
Listen to me

596
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
Don't move

597
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,900
Shut up

598
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
No, Xuan'er

599
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,900
In the past, you met the seven sects

600
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,900
You were so desperate

601
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
and never took action

602
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,900
But why are you so impulsive today?

603
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,900
Are you trying to let him take the throne?

604
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,900
Wang Chen, don't talk nonsense

605
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,900
It's lucky that the young master is so smart

606
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,900
He was fooled by Xiaojian

607
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,900
I'll kill you

608
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,900
Let's split up

609
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,900
He is cunning and hard to deal with

610
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
Their target is you

611
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
Please leave first

612
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
I'll take this junior

613
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,900
They dare not do anything

614
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,900
Enough

615
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
Enough

616
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,900
Whether you are good or bad

617
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
Just catch them and you'll know

618
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,900
Senior

619
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,900
And that friend

620
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
who doesn't want to show his face

621
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,900
You guys

622
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,900
give up

623
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,900
Zhu Jiqi is not good at fighting

624
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
Do you have a way to escape?

625
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,900
Sorry

626
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,900
Take it

627
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
I'll wait for you

628
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,900
Don't wear a tail

629
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,900
Damn it

630
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,900
The duck flew away

631
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,900
Search everywhere

632
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,900
Yes

633
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,900
Han Li

634
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
It's you, right?

635
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,900
You hurt me

636
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,900
Can you put it down?

637
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,900
Sorry

638
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
It's really you

639
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,900
You

640
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,900
After escaping from Yanjia Castle

641
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,900
You didn't know to report to the police

642
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,900
Don't you know that

643
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,900
I and master are worried about you?

644
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,900
Please forgive me

645
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,900
for what I did

646
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,900
You are so polite

647
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,900
I heard you were kidnapped

648
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,900
It seems

649
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,900
you joined the Hehuan Sect

650
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,900
The ancestor of the Hehuan Sect is my father

651
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,900
My master is actually my mother

652
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
Mother had a relationship with him

653
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
But at that time, he hid his identity

654
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,900
When mother knew the truth

655
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,900
she was already involved in it

656
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,900
and me

657
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,900
So I was reluctant to chase you

658
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
when I first saw you

659
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
The charm on you

660
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,900
is also the inheritance of that person, right?

661
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,900
Master Yunlu took me as his disciple

662
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
and forced me to erase

663
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,900
the inheritance of the magic of the Yellow Wind Valley

664
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,900
But since I changed his magic

665
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,900
I have made great progress

666
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,900
If one reason

667
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,900
can cultivate you without considering the cost

668
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,900
it is difficult for ordinary people

669
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
to refuse

670
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Do you understand?

671
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,900
But you are not the same as them

672
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,900
and you will not

673
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,900
really be a part of them

674
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,900
But I heard that

675
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
after my magic is done

676
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,900
even stars will change

677
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,900
At that time, I

678
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,900
I may not even remember your appearance

679
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,900
The life of a cultivator is longer than that of a mortal

680
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,900
In the future

681
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,900
you may meet many people

682
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,900
and forget many people

683
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,900
It doesn't matter

684
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,900
What matters is

685
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
you have to remember who you are

686
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
Okay

687
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,900
I am Han Li

688
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,900
I don't know what you call me

689
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
I am Dong Xuan'er

690
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
We will know each other in the future

691
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,900
Junior Han

692
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,900
You are here too

693
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,900
Master

694
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,900
Father

695
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,900
I am sorry

696
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,900
I think

697
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,900
I still can't forget this person

698
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,900
Senior Han

699
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,900
You can leave me here

700
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,900
I am sorry

701
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,900
I am sorry

702
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,900
I am sorry

703
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,900
Okay

704
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,900
Okay, you can go

705
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,900
I have my own opinion about father

706
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,900
I can give you and that senior

707
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,900
some time to delay

708
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,900
You must not be caught by Wang Chan

709
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,900
I don't know what you did to him

710
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,900
when you were in Yanjia Bao

711
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,900
Let him miss you so much

712
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,900
Junior Luo

713
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,900
Take care

714
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,900
Take care

715
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,900
Senior Han

716
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,900
Goodbye

717
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,900
Mother

718
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,900
Uncle Li

719
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,900
and everyone in Huangfeng Valley

720
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,900
Don't worry

721
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
I, Dong Xuan'er

722
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,900
will definitely walk my own way

723
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,900
I will not be controlled by anyone

724
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,900
Goodbye

725
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,900
100 miles west

726
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,900
should be this place

727
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,900
100 miles west

728
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,900
100 miles west

729
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,900
should be this place

730
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,900
100 miles west

731
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,900
should be this place

732
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,900
100 miles west

733
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
should be this place

734
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
100 miles west

735
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,900
should be this place

736
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,900
100 miles west

737
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,900
should be this place

738
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,900
100 miles west

739
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,900
should be this place

740
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,900
100 miles west

741
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,900
should be this place

742
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
100 miles west

743
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,900
should be this place

744
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,900
100 miles west

745
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,900
should be this place

746
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,900
100 miles west

747
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,900
should be this place

748
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,900
100 miles west

749
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,900
should be this place

750
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,900
100 miles west

751
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,900
should be this place

752
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,900
100 miles west

753
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
should be this place

754
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,900
100 miles west

755
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,900
should be this place

756
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,900
should be this place

757
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
should be

758
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,900
should be this place

759
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,900
should be

760
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,900
this place

761
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,900
should be this place

762
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,900
should be

763
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,900
in this place

764
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,900
this place

765
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,900
Mr. الم Ocean

766
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:34,700
The wind rises and blows

767
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:41,820
The world changes

768
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,260
Looking back at the past

769
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,100
I have forgotten the past

770
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:55,700
Yesterday is tomorrow

771
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:01,500
The sea of ​​mortals is no longer the same as before

772
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:08,620
Time will also erase all the promises of time

773
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:18,500
Only this year has crossed a thousand years

774
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:25,300
In the moment of eternity

775
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:35,660
In the moment of eternity
