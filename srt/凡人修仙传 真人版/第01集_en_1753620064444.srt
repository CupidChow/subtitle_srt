00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The hunting begins.

What's the use of level 6?

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Not bad.

14
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There's a story.

15
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There are no years in the mountains.

16
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There are a thousand years in the world.

17
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
My story

18
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
has to start from 200 years ago.

19
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Brother, wake up.

20
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Stop making trouble.

21
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I want you to go back.

22
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Trouble?

23
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Where did you get the noodles?

24
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I got it from my uncle.

25
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If you tell me,

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
no one will believe you.

27
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The reason I entered the cultivation world

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
is a cake

29
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and three bowls of noodles.

30
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Come on.

31
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The family of Han

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
is so rude.

33
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They are all men.

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Thanks to my uncle.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Only my uncle

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
became a disciple

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
of the family

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and became a nobleman.

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You and Uncle Zhang

40
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
gave your son a big name.

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
For a young man like me,

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
entering the Qixuan Sect

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
is the only way to change the family's fate.

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Han Li?

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes, Han Li.

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This fat guy

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
is Zhang Tie.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He is my best friend

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
in the village.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Have some cake.

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I have some cake.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You have some cake.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You have some cake.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
My dad borrowed three bowls of noodles

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
from your uncle.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
My dad doesn't let me eat it now.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The rules in the village

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
are that

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
before going out

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and doing big things,

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
you must eat white noodles and cakes.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Even if it's

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
borrowed noodles.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If our son gets it,

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
our family will pay for it.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But you must pay for

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the things borrowed from others.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is also a rule.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I was thinking

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
to pay for those three bowls of noodles,

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
for those people in front of me,

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I must get into the Qixuan Sect.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's Li Bei's Li Bei.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's Li Bei's Li Bei.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Our Han Li

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
is the top Li.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Han Li.

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh, right.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I have a big name.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm not Er Leng.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
My name is Han Li.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The top Li.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The top Li.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Han Li.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The top Li.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This year's entrance exam is climbing.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The first seven people

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
will go to the top of the mountain.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The rest will go home.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Stop.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Enough.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The first seven people have already decided.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You guys who came up later

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
are all down.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Go back.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's snowing.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why did you change the noodles at home?

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No, Senior.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No, Senior.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Senior.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Who told you to eat so much?

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you know?

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If you eat two pieces of cake less,

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
you won't be able to get to the ninth place.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I...

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Then I'll be the eighth.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Ninth.

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Tie Wang.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He's pretending.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What's wrong?

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He's sick. He's not pretending.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Tie Wang, are you okay?

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Where does it hurt?

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Dr. Mo.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Tie Wang.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You and him

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
didn't eat pancakes before climbing the mountain.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We ate three pieces.

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You drank cold wind and climbed the mountain.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You want to die?

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Are you okay?

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You're lucky.

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Dr. Mo is our

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Seven-Style Sect Leader Wang's

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
savior and great doctor.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hurry up and thank him.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Thank you, Dr. Mo.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Thank you for saving me.

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Thank you, Dr. Mo.

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Dr. Mo

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
is still here to pick out

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the disciples of the Seven-Style Sect.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're asking for it tomorrow.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What do you think of them?

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's just leave it here.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Come with me.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The Seven-Style Sect Leader Wang

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This place is so beautiful.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This place is called the God Hand Valley.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is the Seven-Style Sect Leader Wang

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
who specially gave it to me.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I saved his life back then.

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Second Young Master,

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
this will be our home from now on.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It depends on your luck.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The Seven-Style Sect Leader Wang

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you recognize

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
the characters on the wall?

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't.

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You don't know the characters?

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Then what do you know?

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We know the land, Master.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't call me Master.

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I haven't agreed

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
to accept you as my disciples.

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Can you two stay?

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We'll see how you two perform next time.

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Sit down.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Silly boy.

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How can there be

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
such a cheap thing in the world?

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is called a tripod.

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If you want to stay with me,

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
you have to be careful.

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What's that smell?

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Is it a bath bomb?

169
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm tired.

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I feel like I'm going to pass out.

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What's this?

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
How...

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Zhang Tian, wake up.

174
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Wake up.

175
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're awake.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Zhang Tian, wake up.

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Wake up.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,280
You're still young.

179
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,760
You're quite quick to wake up.

180
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,280
What are you laughing at in the water?

181
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,880
The fresh grass and dew.

182
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,120
It's smelly.

183
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,800
You can smell it.

184
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,200
Is it still smelly?

185
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,920
The smell of the mortal

186
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,280
is not the sweat on your body.

187
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,680
It's the smell of the mortal.

188
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,800
The smell of the mortal?

189
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,800
The smell of the mortal is the smell of the mortal.

190
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,320
The mortal eats five grains of grains.

191
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,920
The sun, moon, and moon are all the same.

192
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,040
But you're eating the earth and the sky.

193
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,360
It's so smelly.

194
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,480
Don't you feel

195
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,280
any difference on your body?

196
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,280
Do you feel refreshed?

197
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,360
Erlong.

198
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,720
I really feel the fragrance on my body.

199
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,200
I'm not dizzy anymore.

200
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,000
It seems to be a lot of pain.

201
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,640
Are you not green now?

202
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,640
Dad.

203
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
This way, we'll be driven away.

204
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Don't take it in.

205
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
You're our great benefactor.

206
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,800
We'll be obedient and never make you angry.

207
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Don't be afraid.

208
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
I'm scaring you.

209
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,800
As long as you figure out who's the boss in this valley.

210
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,800
I have only three rules.

211
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
First,

212
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,800
everything in this valley must be taken into consideration.

213
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Second,

214
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,800
don't get in touch with those idiots outside.

215
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Third,

216
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
it's also the most important one.

217
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I'll teach you a trick.

218
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,800
You need to practice it.

219
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Don't be afraid.

220
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
If you can't do it,

221
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
you need to leave the mountain.

222
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
You'll waste my time.

223
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
I remember.

224
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
You're fast.

225
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Okay.

226
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,800
I'll go see how you do it.

227
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,800
We three eat six dishes.

228
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Dr. Mu.

229
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
I'm not hungry.

230
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
I'll see how you do it.

231
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
How can that be good?

232
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
You must be the one who's eating first.

233
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
I'm not hungry.

234
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
I'll see how you do it.

235
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
How can that be good?

236
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
You must be the one who's eating first.

237
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
I'm not the one who's eating first.

238
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Sit down.

239
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Eat.

240
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Eat.

241
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
From tomorrow on,

242
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
you two will be my servants.

243
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,800
I won't let you guys be my servants anymore.

244
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
What kind of porridge is this?

245
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
It's really tasty.

246
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,320
No, it's spring roots.

247
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,360
What's spring roots?

248
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,240
It's the root of the tree.

249
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,920
The roots of the tree are the root of the tree.

250
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,880
It's good for hair and skin.

251
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,760
After picking it out,

252
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,640
it's half-cooked.

253
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,400
After half-cooked,

254
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,360
it's cut into fine pieces.

255
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,440
It's hard to cut it into five corners.

256
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,640
It's dry.

257
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,360
Pour some sesame oil on it.

258
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,760
Then you can make it into a stuffing.

259
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,040
I thought

260
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
you ate the root of the tree

261
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,080
when you were pregnant.

262
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,160
You said you ate it for the sake of the fatherland.

263
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,200
I said you ate it for the sake of cultivation.

264
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,680
Cultivation?

265
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,520
Go to rest after you eat.

266
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,520
Don't forget to

267
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,280
dance and bathe in the incense tomorrow morning.

268
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,160
Learn to speak.

269
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
What's that?

270
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,640
Bathing in the incense?

271
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,920
You still have the leisure to wash and cook for them?

272
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,320
Go to the mouth of the tree

273
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,960
and see if there are any roots.

274
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,920
You're a fish again.

275
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,400
Okay. Okay. Okay.

276
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,160
Okay.

277
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,440
Go. Go. Go.

278
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,400
Go. Go. Go.

279
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,160
A Concept Father

280
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,240
Dr. Mo.

281
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,320
It's raining.

282
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,920
The sun has transferred the sun's rays.

283
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,480
We just bathe in the syringe.

284
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,800
Come.

285
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,180
If you can

286
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,460
cultivate the first layer of speech

287
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,040
within three months,

288
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,880
If you can make the first layer,

289
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,880
you can officially call me Master.

290
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,120
Just like the other disciples of the Xixuan Sect,

291
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,360
I'll give you the same monthly salary.

292
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
We have money.

293
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,880
I spent half a week

294
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,080
to get this message.

295
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,040
If you dare to spread it,

296
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,760
I won't forgive you.

297
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,680
Do you know that?

298
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,920
I won't spread it.

299
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,720
I definitely won't.

300
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,800
Fifteen times.

301
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,840
I'll just recite a sentence.

302
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,200
You recite a sentence for me.

303
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
We must be quick.

304
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,680
We must be quick.

305
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,480
I'm so anxious.

306
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,600
Quick.

307
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,960
Quick.

308
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,920
I'm really anxious.

309
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,840
Hands.

310
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,280
Hands.

311
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,320
Mirror.

312
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,560
Mirror.

313
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,080
Poison.

314
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,760
Poison.

315
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,600
That's poison.

316
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,720
Poison.

317
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,680
Everything is sick.

318
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Sick.

319
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,320
No one can control it.

320
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,920
No one can control it.

321
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,040
When the world is in chaos,

322
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
the world is in chaos.

323
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,600
The world is in chaos.

324
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,800
How many lives are lost?

325
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
The world is in chaos.

326
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
The past is the result of the competition.

327
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,280
The world that has been turned upside down

328
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,840
has always been the same.

329
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,960
You said you can't.

330
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,600
The world is in chaos.

331
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,200
The mortal is born.

332
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,480
The door of the light is the door.

333
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,120
The second is the way of the fire.

334
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,400
Why is it so complicated?

335
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,360
The unchanging is the sword that the lady has.

336
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,800
The sword is the star.

337
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,200
The wind is the star.

338
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,720
The mountains and rivers are not afraid.

339
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,160
The world is in chaos.

340
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,000
The world is in chaos.

341
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,480
The mortal is born.

342
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,000
The mortal is born.

343
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,760
The door of the light is the door.

344
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,280
The mortal is born.

345
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,000
The door of the light is the door.

346
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Master.

347
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,640
If the road is narrow,

348
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,040
the path is difficult.

349
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,560
The path is difficult.

350
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,000
Take off your belt.

351
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,960
Take off your belt.

352
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,400
Show me your face.

353
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,920
Hu Yong.

354
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,320
It's your turn.

355
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,200
Why does this hand

356
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,800
look like an ice cube?

357
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,360
It looks like a dead person.

358
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,840
Only need to hurry.

359
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,920
I've been confined in the capital.

360
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,360
Everything is in place.

361
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,960
I'm already locked up.

362
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,160
Only need to hurry.

363
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,800
I've been confined in the capital.

364
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,440
Everything is in place.

365
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,960
I'm already locked up.

366
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,960
It hurts.

367
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,120
It hurts.

368
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,680
It hurts.

369
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,800
Calm down.

370
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,840
Calm down.

371
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,040
Great.

372
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Finally, I met someone

373
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
who is not as big as Yun Mu.

374
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,040
Great.

375
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,680
From now on,

376
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,640
you have to work hard like now.

377
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,440
From now on,

378
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,240
you are my disciple.

379
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,440
I'm your disciple now.

380
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,440
Can I still learn medicine

381
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,840
and calligraphy?

382
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Whatever you want,

383
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,040
I can give it to you.

384
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,240
I'll give you the best.

385
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,040
Master,

386
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,640
Zhang Tie is also very sad

387
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,840
when he practices calligraphy.

388
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,240
He is just like Yun Mu.

389
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,840
It's useless.

390
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,040
He wakes up earlier than me every day

391
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,840
and sleeps later than me.

392
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,040
He hasn't been able to relax

393
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,640
when he practices calligraphy.

394
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,440
You should give him a chance.

395
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,040
He can't.

396
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,840
Yun Mu can't even

397
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,440
practice for several lifetimes.

398
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,440
He is not a good person.

399
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,240
He is not a good person.

400
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,240
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Dr. Mo,

403
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,840
don't let me go.

404
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,040
I can suffer.

405
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,240
I can work.

406
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,240
I can work in the field.

407
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,440
I can wash your feet.

408
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,640
I can...

409
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,440
I can make pancakes.

410
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
I beg you, Dr. Mo.

411
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Don't let me go.

412
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,240
Master,

413
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,440
if you can't keep Zhang Tie,

414
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,240
I'll go with him.

415
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,840
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm sorry.

417
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,840
Let me see

418
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,840
what other uses you have.

419
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,640
Take care of yourself.

420
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,440
I can let you

421
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,000
I...

422
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,720
Can you do that?

423
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,600
As long as you don't kick me out,

424
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,600
I'm not afraid of suffering.

425
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,560
Very good.

426
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,000
Very good.

427
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,400
How about this?

428
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,360
You two stay with me.

429
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,720
Let me teach you a good lesson.

430
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,120
Master Ji.

431
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,720
No, no, no.

432
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,920
Get up. Get up.

433
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,200
Listen.

434
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,040
Focus on your mouthwork in the future.

435
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,960
You...

436
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,040
Keep an eye on him for me.

437
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,280
Don't be careless.

438
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,160
Go.

439
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,040
Great.

440
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,440
We can finally stay.

441
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,280
We're in the God's Hand Valley.

442
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,640
We're in the God's Hand Valley.

443
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,160
Haoyue.

444
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,760
Haoyue.

445
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,700
Haoyue,

446
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,240
So many years.

447
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,760
Youlin and the illustrations

448
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,600
finally meet with us.

449
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Old man.

450
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,520
Enough, enough, enough.

451
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,620
Don't say it.

452
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,120
I want to teach him a lesson.

453
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,240
No, no, no.

454
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,280
You better come to my house.

455
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,000
Don't use these assure items.

456
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,560
I have a village

457
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,640
It smells good

458
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,480
Master, we are back

459
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,120
Master, what are you doing?

460
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,160
Take off your clothes

461
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,120
Who said you

462
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,600
Hai Li, take off your clothes

463
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
Come on, Dali

464
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,640
Pour water with me

465
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,520
Coming, master

466
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,400
What do you think of this?

467
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,720
This is the medicine I specially made

468
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,640
This is the real medicine

469
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,400
It takes two hours to fill it up

470
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,840
Look, two hours

471
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Now we digs some water

472
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,620
How are you feeling?

473
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,560
Do you feel delicious?

474
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,260
Just a little

475
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,360
A little?

476
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,680
My food is run out

477
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,800
Come on, Kong

478
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
I'm not afraid of you.

479
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Hurry up.

480
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
I'm thinking about this place,

481
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
I'm afraid that my baby will lose me.

482
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Zhang Tian.

483
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Slowly, slowly, slowly stir it.

484
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Be careful.

485
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Sorry, master.

486
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Right.

487
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Two hours.

488
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Use the microwave to teach you how to stir it slowly.

489
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Zhang Tian, help me look at it.

490
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Keep this water temperature.

491
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Can't be high or low.

492
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
It's too hot.

493
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Keep stirring.

494
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
What's wrong with you?

495
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
I can't stand it. It's hot.

496
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Master.

497
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Han Li, Han Li is not feeling well.

498
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
What's wrong?

499
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Master, please take it out.

500
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Han Li, Han Li.

501
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Come on, don't move.

502
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Hold on, hold on.

503
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Please.

504
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
How is it?

505
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
How do you feel?

506
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
It's hot.

507
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
It's hot.

508
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Very very hot.

509
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
That's right.

510
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
I'll teach you how to stir it slowly.

511
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Zhang Tian, keep an eye on it.

512
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Tell him.

513
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Use the microwave to stir it slowly.

514
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Shut up.

515
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Shut up.

516
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Master.

517
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Use the microwave to stir it slowly.

518
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Use the microwave to stir it slowly.

519
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Use the microwave to stir it slowly.

520
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Test...

521
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Test what?

522
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Test the phase.

523
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Test the phase.

524
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Everything has shifts.

525
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Everything has shifts.

526
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Everything has shifts.

527
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
To ensure the momentaryких.

528
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
To ensure the momentary toilet.

529
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Test the phase.

530
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Come down, come down.

531
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Don't touch me.

532
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
To ensure the momentary toilet.

533
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
To ensure the momentary toilet.

534
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Test the phase.

535
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Test the phase.

536
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Everything shifts.

537
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,000
So I'm here.

538
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,000
I'll come take a look.

539
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,800
Master, what's wrong with Master's joints?

540
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,720
rasna, wake up!

541
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,120
Erlongzi, Erlongzi.

542
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,680
Master.

543
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,520
No, no, no.

544
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,320
What's wrong with him?

545
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,520
Master.

546
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,360
Come on.

547
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,440
Master.

548
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,720
Erlongzi, you're awake.

549
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,320
Erlongzi, you scared me to death.

550
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
I thought you were dead, Erlongzi.

551
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,960
Shut your mouth.

552
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Master.

553
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,200
What's wrong with me?

554
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,840
You've become the first level.

555
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,360
You're really a good boy.

556
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,520
Good boy.

557
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,480
Come on.

558
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,800
Zhang Li.

559
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,200
I'll give you a massage.

560
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,560
Don't worry.

561
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,440
I'll find you some more.

562
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,760
I'll be back.

563
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,160
And...

564
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,480
I'll buy you a new one.

565
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,200
I'll buy you a new one.

566
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,800
I'll buy you a new one.

567
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,880
I'll buy you a new one.

568
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,840
I'll buy you a new one.

569
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,440
I'll buy you a new one.

570
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,440
I'll buy you a new one.

571
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,160
I'll buy you a new one.

572
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,440
I'll buy you a new one.

573
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
I'll buy you a new one.

574
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,440
I didn't realize

575
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,840
it's been a year since I came to Shenzhou.

576
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,520
Zhang Tie has done a lot

577
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,360
to stay here.

578
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,560
He practiced fencing

579
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,840
and trained for thousands of times.

580
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,120
He has endured it all.

581
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,000
Master doesn't allow me to make medicine.

582
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,880
He also leaves the work

583
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,520
to Zhang Tie.

584
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,720
When we go down the mountain,

585
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,880
I'll treat him better.

586
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,920
As for me,

587
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,200
besides taking medicine and practicing fencing,

588
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,000
I don't know what's the use

589
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,040
of using those expensive medicine

590
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,120
that can't be named.

591
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,920
But

592
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,000
Master taught us to read and write.

593
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,120
He helped us to be a good student.

594
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,800
So that's what heaven is like.

595
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,840
During this time,

596
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,680
I and Zhang Tie have been sending

597
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,880
the monthly benefits home.

598
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,880
And I also made

599
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
a birthday gift for Xiaomei.

600
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,920
By the way,

601
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,760
I've also paid off

602
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,280
the money I borrowed from you.

603
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,920
From now on,

604
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
you don't have to borrow from me anymore.

605
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,760
I'll buy you

606
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,600
steamed buns and pancakes.

607
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,840
Although Master doesn't allow me to work,

608
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,600
as soon as I have time,

609
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,120
I'll go to the nearby forest

610
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,560
to pick herbs and other things.

611
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,440
It's also for

612
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,320
preparing for him to learn medicine in the future.

613
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,320
What's wrong with him?

614
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,160
What's that sound?

615
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,040
What's that?

616
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,760
It's a green thing.

617
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,560
It's still green.

618
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,320
It's pretty.

619
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
What's inside?

620
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,800
Open it and see.

621
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,960
Open it.

622
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,560
Here.

623
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,040
What?

624
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,760
Chop it.

625
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,400
Give me the knife.

626
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,560
Let me see.

627
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Let me see.

628
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,440
This little bottle is a little weird.

629
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,600
Can't even open the knife.

630
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,680
It's useful.

631
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,440
It's useful.

632
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,600
Okay.

633
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,080
Master,

634
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,240
time to eat.

635
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,200
Master.

636
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,080
Master.

637
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,000
Han Li, time to eat.

638
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,080
Han Li.

639
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,120
Coming.

640
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,440
It's all made according to your recipe.

641
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,920
There are ducks, fish, and braised pork.

642
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,960
Okay.

643
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,680
Come on.

644
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,000
Sit down.

645
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,320
Come on.

646
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,160
Bring the braised pork here.

647
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,160
Come on.

648
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,960
Han Li, eat.

649
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,760
Duck.

650
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,960
Han Li.

651
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,600
Han Li.

652
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,640
What are you doing here?

653
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
Go back.

654
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,720
What?

655
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,080
What's wrong?

656
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,800
You fool.

657
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,240
What do you hate most about cultivators?

658
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,080
You hate

659
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,240
these dirty things.

660
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,960
That kid

661
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
is

662
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,080
on the second floor.

663
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,680
Second floor?

664
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,280
He's here.

665
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,520
Holy god.

666
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,080
Monkey King,

667
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,080
they are totally different

668
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,400
now.

669
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,200
Luoyan Sect

670
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Over the past year

671
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,540
my゚é

672
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,940
is studying beyond the第二 class

673
00:36:51,260 --> 00:37:05,440
Master has committed to teach me

674
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,380
every month

675
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,960
I wonder how everyone is doing in the village.

676
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Father, mother, little sister, I am doing well here.

677
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,960
You don't need to worry.

678
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,960
Other than taking care of our food and drink,

679
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,540
Zhang Tieba spent all his time on the

680
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,960
armor-piercing bow that Master taught him.

681
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,960
He didn't notice the bronze and metal drums.

682
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,960
He became a family member after getting injured.

683
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,960
I used the medical skills I learned to cure his wounds.

684
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,960
At last, I was able to help him relieve some of his pain.

685
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,960
After I got to the second level,

686
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,960
I found that I was looking further and heard more clearly.

687
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,960
My brain was also a little more flexible.

688
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,960
It seems that this mouth is really a little more mysterious.

689
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Back then, the jade pendant that led us to the door

690
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
was also a part of a job.

691
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Senior Brother Ji also became the vice-president of the Foreigners' Hall

692
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,960
and dealt with the evil bandits and the Wild Wolf Gang.

693
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
I once envied him a lot.

694
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
I wanted to be like him,

695
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,960
learn martial arts and become a swordsman.

696
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Time flies and hatred is also a grudge.

697
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Unfortunately, there is no if in everything.

698
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,960
I can only accept the fact that I am a warrior.

699
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,960
I can only rest for a day.

700
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
I am a demon.

701
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
I am not sure if I can be free from it.

702
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,960
It seems that I have already eliminated that kind of thoughts.

703
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
You...

704
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
I...

705
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
I...

706
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
I am telling you, the Wild Wolf Gang,

707
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,960
do not try to enter my Qixuan Sect again.

708
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
Otherwise,

709
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
this is the end.

710
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Let's go.

711
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,960
Master, look at this jade pendant. It is so big.

712
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
If you boil it with waste water,

713
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
mix it with the mixed water of the river,

714
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,960
and make it into a tofu,

715
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
it will be a good food.

716
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,960
The grass and wood are edible, my child.

717
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,960
In this world, salt, stone, sand, soil,

718
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
and the morning dew and evening sunset,

719
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,960
all of these can be eaten.

720
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,960
Recently, I have been thinking about

721
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
the mouth-wits that you gave me.

722
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Tell me about them.

723
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,960
You need to be patient and be careful not to get poisoned.

724
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
Perhaps it is because

725
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,960
everything in this world is not perfect.

726
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
It is because of this imperfection

727
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,960
that people are in a state of emptiness.

728
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,960
As long as you accept this emptiness,

729
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,960
you will get the peace in your heart.

730
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Master, you are wrong.

731
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,960
You need to learn to pick herbs from now on.

732
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,960
All the books are not allowed to be read.

733
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Why?

734
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,960
The cultivation is too slow these few months.

735
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
You need to focus on cultivation.

736
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Everything else is not related to you.

737
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,960
I am sorry.

738
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
I am sorry.

739
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
It is all your fault.

740
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Why did you let him read the books?

741
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
He has his own ideas now.

742
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,960
How can we control him?

743
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
Shut up.

744
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,960
If I use medical skills to control him,

745
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,960
he will be able to

746
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,960
cultivate well.

747
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
You are a man of the past.

748
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,960
You know the tricks of the rascals.

749
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,960
If you are idle,

750
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
you are a child of the watchman.

751
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,960
Master.

752
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
He took the books away.

753
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
He changed them into medicine.

754
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,960
Why is he so angry?

755
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,960
It is like he has changed into a different person.

756
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
You need to be careful.

757
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,960
You can't let your inner thoughts be overshadowed.

758
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,960
Master.

759
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,960
I just want you to understand that

760
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,960
no matter what happening,

761
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,960
you must always stay with our team.

762
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:30,960
No matter what届

763
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,560
I've never experienced such a situation.

764
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,240
I always feel

765
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,760
something bad is going to happen.

766
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,840
What's this?

767
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,320
Why is this little green bottle

768
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,320
lit up?

769
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,920
This thing can absorb moonlight?

770
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,200
Oh.

771
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,080
It seems that my assumption is correct.

772
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,040
The closed door and window

773
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,040
prevents the bottle from attracting light.

774
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,880
Only in a wide place

775
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,960
can the bottle absorb light better.

776
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,720
The light group formed will be larger.

777
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,280
Although I don't know

778
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,640
where these light particles come from,

779
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,240
what's the use of the bottle

780
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,040
absorbing light?

781
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,920
But this distance to open the mystery

782
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,920
should be a big step.

783
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,280
But why can't it be opened?

784
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Why are you so late?

785
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,200
Didn't we agree to meet for three classes?

786
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,760
It's a night of flying and flying.

787
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,320
It's good to run out.

788
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,800
The people of the Wolf Gang

789
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,160
and the disciples of Qixuan Sect.

790
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,880
Have you got the news of that fire?

791
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,640
Of course.

792
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,440
This is a birthday gift

793
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,480
for the Qianwang Mansion.

794
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,040
He colluded with the Wolf Gang

795
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,360
to betray Qixuan Sect.

796
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,080
I have to report it to them.

797
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,360
We'll set off in three days.

798
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,280
How much can we get this time?

799
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,880
Who?

800
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,720
Go back first.

801
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,400
Don't let anyone see you with me.

802
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,400
I'll go.

803
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,640
You're good at martial arts.

804
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,520
Master.

805
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,000
You're good at martial arts in the country.

806
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,400
Why are you

807
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,880
fighting with them?

808
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,480
Master.

809
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,480
I couldn't stand it last night.

810
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,680
I went to practice martial arts in the forest.

811
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,720
I overheard

812
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,440
that he colluded with the people of the Wolf Gang

813
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,720
to betray Qixuan Sect.

814
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,640
What?

815
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,520
What are you talking about?

816
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,560
The common people

817
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,120
are fighting.

818
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,120
What's the matter with you?

819
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,440
Do you know that your life

820
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,200
is more valuable than the whole Qixuan Sect?

821
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,760
Can you still be so precious?

822
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
I won't let anyone

823
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,640
hurt you.

824
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,480
He's really a spy.

825
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,840
You didn't hear me, did you?

826
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,520
Go to practice martial arts.

827
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,280
Please fix the third floor for me.

828
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,440
꺄

829
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,040
♥

830
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,440
Because of the many circuitive things

831
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,760
locked up in the dark,

832
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,800
a Mesontasta

833
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,560
came to Earth

834
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,880
where it was put into the past.

835
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,520
When he was about to die

836
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,440
on that day,

837
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,240
he blacked out,

838
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:21,960
had two tops fallen off,

839
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,440
his life,

840
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,080
and the other two with 28 years old,

841
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,360
are two three four.

842
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,240
Something wrong right now.

843
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,060
Justin,

844
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:31,880
is this true?

845
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,020
Was the local resident

846
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,640
on the run?

847
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,320
Honestly.

848
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,080
I was just...

849
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,700
They ran out of it.

850
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,000
What happened?

851
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,240
Today,

852
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,600
all the guards

853
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,660
galloped to

854
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,040
that discharge point.

855
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,120
��

856
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,340
When you said that you will ambush me,

857
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:20,480
15th55 5th

858
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,080
Master is a master of hidden skills.

859
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,280
Why doesn't he show himself in front of us?

860
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,600
Is he hiding it on purpose?

861
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,520
Or...

862
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,200
You are so restless.

863
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,320
How can you still practice?

864
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,320
You are too slack lately.

865
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,440
The rain is heavy, so I went to bed early.

866
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,840
When the sky clears, I will go down the mountain to find you medicine.

867
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:01,960
Remember.

868
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,320
I will always be watching over you.

869
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:53,320
The snow falls on the water.

870
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,320
I am going to miss you.

871
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,320
The scenery is beautiful.

872
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
I can't forget you.

873
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,320
I just want to miss you.

874
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,320
You always say that the past is like a leaf.

875
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,320
Looking back, it's absurd.

876
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,320
The lonely books in the bustling city

877
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:29,320
have destroyed the hope of the six years.

878
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,320
The past is like a sword.

879
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:39,320
The old wind rises and blows again.

880
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:46,320
The four days have changed.

881
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:53,320
Looking back, I have forgotten the past.

882
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,320
It's yesterday.

883
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,320
It's tomorrow.

884
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:06,320
The three days in the sea are not like the past.

885
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:13,320
The time will also erase all the promises in the world.

886
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:23,320
Only this longing has crossed a thousand years.

887
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:29,320
In the moment of life and death.

888
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:39,320
In the moment of eternity.
