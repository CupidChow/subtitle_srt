00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 05

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Legend of Chusen

4
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't blame me for being rude.

5
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I've fought with those four masters

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
of the main skill, the Blood Stone.

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
They are not good at it.

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Especially their Demon Slayer's secret technique.

9
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It can strengthen your cultivation

10
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and improve your level.

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But this skill is not without weak points.

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
First, the Demon Slayer

13
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
needs to be in the Blood Realm first.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It can be used for good food and wine.

15
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Second, after the Demon Slayer,

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
it will be shot by the Blood Qi

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and lose its rationality.

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It needs to be used for its ability.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
These two points can be used for good use.

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Please remember.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We will try our best to hold off

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
those four Blood Stones.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please let the two masters

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
plan the situation.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you find something wrong,

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
don't fight.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Come to us immediately.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Be smart.

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The master is in seclusion.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He lost the soul-stuff in the palace.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't be like the mortal

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
who has lost his way.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You can't even wake him up.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
These three bastards

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
think they are something.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
How dare they let me open the door?

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They even said they would be the scapegoats.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They are obviously traitors.

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will tell them

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
when the master is out of the palace.

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
My bad.

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Fuck.

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What kind of bucks Joel

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
this useless climbs?

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He just imagined it himself.

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The result is low safety for him.

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He is now being trained.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Bystanders are really nearby.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's take care of them first.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't wake the覺得 in.

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:46,500
The

52
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
Did you take up about the Th gefallen Village?

53
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,200
The whole Crafted Tradition is important here.

54
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,000
We can't hold it anymore.

55
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,080
Thanks, Chen brothers.

56
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,760
Let's get rid of those low-ups here first.

57
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,880
Brothers of Arche Farming,

58
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,760
let's chase after them

59
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,800
and sell ourselves.

60
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,640
Sure.

61
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,520
It's okay.

62
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Boss may rest assured.

63
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,080
Entry Ranking!

64
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,800
Arivate five

65
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,440
Yes.

66
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,160
He got yourself killed.

67
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,660
不能在俺们面前打胖子

68
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,540
Your brothers,

69
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,020
just kill.

70
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:20,620
I've lost all my� baptist

71
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,820
lighter

72
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,420
Тогда

73
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:45,080
What about the

74
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,720
Star alkalis

75
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,700
no

76
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,260
Energy

77
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,260
I won't let you go even if I die!

78
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
This is interesting.

79
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,260
This monster belongs to me.

80
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
Don't fight with me!

81
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,260
Hey, I'm talking to you!

82
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,260
You want to kill me?

83
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,260
I'll kill him!

84
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
Go!

85
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,260
This is too cruel! We can't win!

86
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,260
Let's fight another one!

87
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,260
Let's go!

88
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,260
I'll avenge you!

89
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,260
I'm fine.

90
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Stop the monster!

91
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,260
Go!

92
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,260
Go!

93
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,260
Go away!

94
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,260
Go away!

95
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,260
Heaven's speed!

96
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,260
You're really a man!

97
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,260
I'll help you!

98
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,260
Go away!

99
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,260
Go away!

100
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,260
You recover once.

101
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,260
I'll kill you!

102
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,260
Very good!

103
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,260
Be angry!

104
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,260
This secret technique is very effective.

105
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,260
If we lose this chance,

106
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,260
we'll be dead.

107
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,260
There are two more blood stones.

108
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
Watch out!

109
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,260
Go!

110
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,260
Brother Song,

111
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,260
I'll leave the big piece to you.

112
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,260
Okay.

113
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,260
Brother.

114
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,260
It's very strong poison.

115
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Come on.

116
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,260
Come on.

117
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,260
I didn't expect to see you here again.

118
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,260
Han Daoyou,

119
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,260
how are you?

120
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,260
It seems you entered the Yellow Wind Valley with the Immortal's Order.

121
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,260
And you're in the middle of the level.

122
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
So,

123
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
you're lying to me in Tainan.

124
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,260
I was killed by you.

125
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,260
It's been like this for a long time.

126
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,260
God made me alive

127
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,260
to wait for you to die!

128
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,260
Stop talking!

129
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Wan Xiaoshan is very sick.

130
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,260
Let's finish it today.

131
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,420
Come.

132
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,140
publication ofacing

133
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,860
Please be careful.

134
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,900
Even if you kill him anyway,

135
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:50,400
I'll still be theissements to

136
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,360
Liao Sha容易受不了

137
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,800
Still capable of imagine

138
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
You have some knowledge.

139
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
The Song family of Hanzhou

140
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
is a martial art master.

141
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Look at you.

142
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Were you also a suicide case before?

143
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Yes.

144
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
The Empress was born with a good fortune.

145
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
But her world is still not over.

146
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Behind her are the new sects

147
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
and the world's families.

148
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
You are the first to

149
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
be united.

150
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Who is the one who died?

151
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
You are a half-man, half-monster.

152
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
What qualifications do you have?

153
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
You are a mortal. You are not cruel.

154
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:52,800
You are a

155
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
The world's strongest martial arts

156
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:36,800
are Wu Fei, Lan, Da, Sha, Ge, Jin, Yin, Si.

157
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
The same goes for the sword skills.

158
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
The sword is long and strong.

159
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
A rough warrior like you

160
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
is a waste of the power of killing demons.

161
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
You are a monster.

162
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Wu Fei, attack.

163
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
I got it.

164
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Be careful.

165
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Brother.

166
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Brother.

167
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
I'm sorry.

168
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
I'm sorry.

169
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Your smell

170
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
is very beautiful.

171
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Brother.

172
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Brother.

173
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Brother.

174
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Your useless companions

175
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
are less.

176
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Brother Han Chi, fight quickly.

177
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Protect me.

178
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
This...

179
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
This is from Pinggu.

180
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Die.

181
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
I want to personally

182
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
kill you.

183
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
He used the original blood to trigger the treasure.

184
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Brother Liu is too hard.

185
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
You are quite a fighter.

186
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Tell me, what's your name?

187
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
If I'm in a good mood,

188
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I'll give you a title.

189
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Lan Zhou, Xiao Xi, Bai Ren Jiang, Tian Luo.

190
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Brother.

191
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
I'm sorry.

192
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
I'm sorry.

193
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
I'm sorry.

194
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
I'm sorry.

195
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Don't move.

196
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
This bastard

197
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,420
Blind plants are fี่ned away

198
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,420
Defeat them with me

199
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,140
Lets

200
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,660
paragliding

201
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,420
Time

202
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
No end

203
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,100
Square

204
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,460
Stir

205
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,100
Right answer

206
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,320
Senior brothers,fix youself

207
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,040
Senior brothers,you all have worked hard

208
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
Step back

209
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:46,500
make an northern-style turtle

210
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,880
I just want to see the sun and the sea

211
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,180
Carelessly drift amongst the endless ages

212
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,260
The fairyland can make it

213
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,660
Their52 attirins packed the caught harps

214
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,620
And the dream calls out

215
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,700
The highest skies live in peace

216
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,700
creo

217
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,980
Comparison

218
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Did you die?

219
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,480
It's great my side

220
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,120
Shark

221
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,880
Go

222
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:21,760
What I'm concerned about is not how I expect peace and symmetry.

223
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,860
Chu Ji is a weak career demon,

224
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,740
but the power of Zhong Qi is far less than usual.

225
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,940
So he is valuable.

226
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,640
But he destroyed the brigade of Chu Wu,

227
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,300
which is a wastage.

228
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,500
Junior Brother Han, let's just call this a draw.

229
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Third Brother is the fifth!

230
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,300
It's all settled.

231
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,000
Senior Brother has not touched the sword yet. His martial arts skills are really thin.

232
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,900
I admire you.

233
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,900
Junior Brother Han is too much.

234
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,300
You must not let Wei Niang know about what happened today.

235
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
Don't let her worry.

236
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,700
Brother, I didn't mean to do that.

237
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,300
How am I going to explain it to her?

238
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,300
What should we do now?

239
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,700
The sword is not yet removed.

240
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,300
We still don't know if something worse will happen.

241
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,500
We can't leave it here.

242
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,900
Brother, I'm sorry.

243
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,500
I'm sorry, Junior Brother.

244
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,900
Senior Brother Liu, Senior Brother Song, Senior Brother Han.

245
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,900
I'll tell my cousin about my brother later.

246
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,900
But, please cover my eyes for me.

247
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,100
So that she won't be distracted.

248
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,100
Of course. I'm sorry.

249
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,100
Brother, I'll take you home.

250
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,700
I'm sorry.

251
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,100
Let's go in and take a look.

252
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,100
You think it's missing, right?

253
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,700
I'm afraid this is their old nest.

254
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,300
Here.

255
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,900
Taiwan

256
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Naming List

257
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,700
Zhang Qian

258
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,900
Zheng Tian, – Zhou Yan

259
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,300
Zhu Shan Min

260
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,300
Zhang Wei

261
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,300
Feng Wan, – Han Geqiao

262
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,900
Zhang Shui Sheng

263
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,800
These names

264
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,100
should be the men from the HRC.

265
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,500
Meng Yuan

266
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,300
The source is...

267
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,300
Murong Zhu.

268
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,140
Shen Qian Xun.

269
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,700
Xue Chi?

270
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,340
Third Brother.

271
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:34,980
Third Brother.

272
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,500
What's wrong?

273
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,620
Do you remember what happened back then?

274
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,940
No matter how many blood brothers and demons we hurt,

275
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,340
we always have new enemies.

276
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,380
We can't stand them.

277
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,740
You...

278
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,140
You're just too harsh on yourself.

279
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,980
What happened back then is over.

280
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,940
We're no longer the little kids

281
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,740
who are in the basement.

282
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
We have a spiritual root

283
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,740
and become Zhu Ji Xiu.

284
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,820
It's been so many years.

285
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,100
I still call you Senior Brother.

286
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,900
I'm more in love with you.

287
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,540
Actually, with your self-willedness,

288
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,340
you've already found me.

289
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,860
It's just that you've been working hard

290
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,740
and making breakthroughs every time.

291
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,020
Actually, it's to prevent me from creating new demons.

292
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,340
Right?

293
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,020
You think you won't know

294
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,420
if you don't say it?

295
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,180
Don't say that.

296
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,220
When you're cultivating,

297
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,900
who can still give in to others?

298
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,420
Besides,

299
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,020
I don't have that much heart.

300
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,100
Don't comfort me.

301
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,300
Back then, I was poisoned by that evil monk.

302
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,020
I hurt my roots.

303
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,940
I'm afraid I've been a burden to you.

304
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,780
But your position with Madam Wei is very good.

305
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,540
Don't let your own path be misled.

306
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,180
You...

307
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,180
Why are you

308
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,740
so innocent?

309
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,420
You're so boring.

310
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,740
I'll go find Junior Brother Han.

311
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,500
Thank you, Junior Brother Han.

312
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,620
What's going on?

313
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,780
There's no exit.

314
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,620
Brother Jing!

315
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,500
Madam Wei! Madam Wei!

316
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,060
How did you get here?

317
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,060
We were mistaken for something else

318
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,060
and found a trap.

319
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,940
We met this King on the way

320
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,620
and went through the secret passage.

321
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:50,980
I didn't expect

322
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,980
that the Black Fiend Sect

323
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,100
is quite a place

324
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,100
and has many holes everywhere.

325
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,180
I pay my respects to all the immortals.

326
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,700
Thank you for your help.

327
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,900
Don't stand on ceremony.

328
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,980
I'm the one who created the demons

329
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,740
and I'm the one who created the demons.

330
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,100
This place is set up by the Lost Souls Formation.

331
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,780
The mortals are all soul-soul-soul.

332
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,780
How do you keep yourself awake?

333
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,260
Have you ever

334
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,620
encountered any soldiers on this journey?

335
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,020
I really don't know

336
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,220
what you're talking about.

337
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,020
I just met these two immortals

338
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,020
and woke you up.

339
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,500
They also gave me a pill.

340
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,820
Immortal,

341
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,580
all the concubines and officials

342
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,780
of the King

343
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,580
are all dead.

344
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,980
Brother Han,

345
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,740
I did give him a pill just now.

346
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,500
I didn't chase after soldiers on this journey.

347
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,140
Brother Han,

348
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,020
the enemy hasn't been captured yet.

349
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,020
Let's hurry to the world to find clues.

350
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,660
You're the one who caused the trouble.

351
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,100
You can come with us

352
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,940
to ensure your safety.

353
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,340
Thank you for your help.

354
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,100
Madam,

355
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,940
please keep looking for

356
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,900
the hidden places of Chen Shimei and you.

357
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,940
Don't worry, Brother Jing.

358
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,060
Let's go.

359
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:30,940
Brother,

360
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,380
there might be a trap.

361
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,020
Where is this place?

362
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,020
Where is this place?

363
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,020
I've never been here before.

364
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,260
Ocean King's Mansion

365
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,020
I'm disapointed that I'm here.

366
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,100
I must leave since you are here.

367
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,480
Something !

368
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,820
The seventh one!

369
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:06,160
Evil macrouc

370
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
Chen Rong!

371
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,520
Why did he attack the weakest Chen Rong first?

372
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,160
It's time to get back to where we started.

373
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,360
Is this the Black Spirit Martial Soul Pill?

374
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,840
Why are there only four of them?

375
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,880
Don't let them get away!

376
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Hurry up!

377
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Where did the demon join?

378
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,160
Since this man is the main Republican Brother,

379
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,760
why is he using such a dangerous tactic

380
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,360
and seems to mind nothing of his safety?

381
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,560
Are perhaps...

382
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,440
Is I Thousands,

383
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,840
perhaps he's doing that to myself.

384
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,520
Purple Fairy Cake.

385
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,520
What's wrong with the five-star elixir?

386
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Thank you.

387
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,520
You brought me the five-star elixir of Xue Ning.

388
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,520
It's good to say that.

389
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,520
I'm so happy.

390
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,520
One, two, three, four.

391
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,520
The last one.

392
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,520
The iron cage is gold.

393
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,520
The Qinwen is wood.

394
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,520
The ice-cold guy is water.

395
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,520
The five-star elixir is earth.

396
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
This person is supposed to be fire.

397
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
Not good.

398
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
This person is not the Black Shark Sect Leader.

399
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
But the last blood stone.

400
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,520
Where is the real Black Shark Sect Leader?

401
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Brother Jing.

402
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
Brother Jing.

403
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Be careful.

404
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
Don't rush.

405
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Otherwise, he will die.

406
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
Brother Jing.

407
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
I'm so sorry.

408
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,520
I'm sorry to bother you today.

409
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
It's okay, brother.

410
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
You are my brother.

411
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,520
I'm sorry.

412
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,520
I'm sorry.

413
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,520
I'm sorry.

414
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,520
I'm sorry.

415
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,520
Yours is mine.

416
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
You two.

417
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,520
Don't be so cruel.

418
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,520
It's disgusting.

419
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,520
Brother Jing.

420
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,520
Don't talk.

421
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
Hurry up and heal your wound.

422
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
You're right.

423
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,520
He is going to die soon.

424
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,520
You guys just stop.

425
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
Madam.

426
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,520
Do you think I will let you die?

427
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,520
Brother Jing.

428
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
You just wait and see.

429
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
I want you to have me.

430
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
Do you really want me to be killed?

431
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,520
Do you know the Never taught tools?

432
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
Right?

433
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
You don't know how to do this jalas?

434
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,520
Over there.

435
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,520
Young Master.

436
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
You know Shao Ming?

437
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,520
I used to be a bullfighter.

438
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,520
I will never forget your kindness.

439
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,520
