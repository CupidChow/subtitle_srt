The Long Ballad

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How dare you break the forbidden rule?

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm here to deliver medicine for Yan'er.

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is a secret medicine of the Ghost Realm.

6
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It can seal the spiritual power.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It won't be gone in a short time.

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Father, do you want to try it?

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The Long Ballad

10
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The Long Ballad

11
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I heard that you were watching a woman from the Yellow Wind Valley.

12
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Father, you must have misunderstood me.

13
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I have Yan'er.

14
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I have no other hope in this life.

15
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But the woman from the Yellow Wind Valley is useful to me.

16
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I need to investigate her.

17
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Father, don't worry.

18
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No one knows my real identity.

19
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If so,

20
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
tonight,

21
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
let's put aside the plans for the people of Xicheng District.

22
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Father,

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
are you soft-hearted?

24
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What a joke!

25
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There are so many cultivators in the city.

26
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I just don't want you to make any mistakes

27
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
before tomorrow's ceremony.

28
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Fine.

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll do as father said.

30
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The Ghost Realm

31
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The plague is going to pass.

32
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You must take this medicine.

33
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Thank you, Miss Mo.

34
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Here you are.

35
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you.

36
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Take it.

37
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Thank you.

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Take it when you take the medicine.

39
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay. Thank you.

40
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Boss.

41
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Miss Mo.

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Miss Mo.

43
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I have twenty snacks here.

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
According to what you said last time,

45
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
is it enough to exchange two wangyue grass with you?

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Miss Mo,

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
it's really a coincidence that you came.

48
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You also know that

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
there are many foreign cultivators in the city.

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The wangyue grass is a rare product.

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Twenty snacks

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
are the price of three months ago.

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How about this?

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't want wangyue grass.

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Can I exchange a few seeds with you with this?

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Actually,

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
it's not that troublesome.

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The wangyue grass in Xicheng District

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
is not suitable for planting.

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Miss Mo,

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
you never thought that

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
one day

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
you would come to plant it.

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Thank you.

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't think it's necessary.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Miss Mo.

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Listen to me, Miss Mo.

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I still have something to say.

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
As long as you marry me,

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
all kinds of wangyue grass will be yours.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Miss Mo.

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Listen to me.

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm the biggest drug dealer in the Yanjia Bo.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You don't deserve to be my servant.

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You don't deserve to be my servant.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Miss Mo.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You don't deserve to be my servant.

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Listen to me.

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You don't deserve to be my servant.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Listen to me.

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Brother Han.

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Miss Mo.

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Brother Han.

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The wind blows past the wolf's den.

85
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The smoke flies into the south.

86
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The sun rises and sets.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Who is the song for?

88
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
A bottle of warm wine.

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The wind blows against the clouds.

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Like a dream, the stars and the moon.

91
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
A thousand miles away when I die.

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Unknown but familiar.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
How far is the naho that I may get.

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm tired after one more way.

95
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Himalayan w clash an頭, some brave and less.

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This song cannot我不负這光年.

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The light and the dark thenR die away.

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Like a cliff separate from night.

99
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,920
After many years of separation,

100
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,800
Miss Mo still doesn't like to talk like before.

101
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,360
It's been ten years.

102
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
How is Brother Han doing in these ten years?

103
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,840
I'm fine.

104
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,480
I just didn't expect to meet you here.

105
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,440
How are your parents?

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,280
They are all gone.

107
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,320
Three years ago,

108
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,120
the Wu family came to the capital's high-ranking family.

109
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,440
They suddenly got the news.

110
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,720
You know it.

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
They have been in the Mu family's house for a long time.

112
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,040
The whole family of the Mo family was killed overnight.

113
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,840
Now I'm the only one left.

114
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,200
But actually,

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,720
my mother had already known it.

116
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,200
But no one expected

117
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,600
they would come so soon.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,320
And they are so cruel.

119
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,000
Wu Sangwen.

120
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,160
Where is Xue Huan?

121
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,640
Didn't he protect you?

122
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,280
A few months before the incident in the Mu family,

123
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,560
he suddenly got lost and ran into the mountains.

124
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,000
I couldn't catch up with him.

125
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,040
Comrade Handorn,

126
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
is this your safely.

127
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,200
Your Highness.

128
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,480
You died a long time ago.

129
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,680
Then why do you still eat chicken liver group今日?

130
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,760
Your Highness,

131
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,320
I think you should eat it.

132
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,360
I think we can recommend some food place.

133
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,720
Please come in and have a try.

134
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
I'm here now.

135
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,720
With this clinic,

136
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,320
although I'm the only one here,

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm living

138
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,560
quite well.

139
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,920
The tea is cold.

140
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,840
Brother Han, drink this.

141
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,440
It's freshly brewed new tea.

142
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,880
Why did you

143
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,400
disturb the cultivator?

144
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
Brother Han,

145
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,400
you don't have to worry about me.

146
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,000
I can take care of myself.

147
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
I'm fine.

148
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm fine.

149
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I'm fine.

150
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
I'm fine.

151
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Okay.

152
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,600
If you need anything,

153
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
just tell me.

154
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
You're welcome.

155
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
I'm fine.

156
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Brother Han,

157
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,320
why don't you sit down and rest?

158
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,000
I have a prescription to finish.

159
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,080
I'll do it.

160
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,960
Could you take a rest for a while?

161
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,120
Give it to me.

162
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,360
I'll take it.

163
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,320
The people are in a hurry.

164
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
They can't raise their heads.

165
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,280
This is really a kind of relief for me.

166
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,400
Now I can understand why Han Li doesn't want to be seen.

167
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,840
It's so nice not to be disturbed.

168
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,480
Why is the beauty falling on me?

169
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,120
Even a mortal can be free.

170
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,320
But I have no heart to harm people.

171
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,440
But I always provoke and make trouble.

172
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,960
I'm not free.

173
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,840
I just got here yesterday.

174
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,880
I heard that there are some evil things in the downtown area.

175
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,960
Miss Mo, have you heard about it?

176
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,760
Evil things?

177
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:24,980
Like some mortals and the

178
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,260
The Beggar's Virtue

179
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,180
SisterOOOOOOOO was here.

180
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,100
So nice, why are you alone?

181
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,420
Sister, don't be surprised.

182
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,020
We are not bad people.

183
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,900
We just don't want you to be sad alone.

184
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,380
Junior, why don't you try this?

185
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,860
It can relieve your worries after drinking it.

186
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,820
Junior, have you never heard of

187
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,900
the one who can relieve your worries is Du Kang?

188
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,660
We are not trying to persuade you to drink.

189
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,260
We just don't want you to be sad alone.

190
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,140
I don't treat you as bad people.

191
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,860
We just don't want you to drink the moon in the cup.

192
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,620
Junior, why do you worry about the moon?

193
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,980
The moon is the water of the whole world.

194
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,180
The moon is the light of the whole world.

195
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,220
The moon is the light of the whole world.

196
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,860
As long as the cup is full of wine...

197
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:39,700
Well...

198
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,820
The moon is right there.

199
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,220
Good poem.

200
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,020
No praise.

201
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,220
It's so beautiful.

202
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:47,980
Cheers.

203
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,260
Come on.

204
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,100
It's so spicy.

205
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,420
That's right.

206
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,020
Again.

207
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,340
Good wine.

208
00:16:59,340 --> 00:16:59,740
Okay.

209
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,900
Junior, good wine.

210
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,340
Fill it up.

211
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,820
Brother Han.

212
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
You must be a great cultivator now.

213
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,300
I just started to live here.

214
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,420
Anyway,

215
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,140
I can keep my own strength.

216
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,620
So beautiful.

217
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,460
Come on.

218
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,460
Come on.

219
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,860
So beautiful.

220
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:47,940
Come on.

221
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,540
I'm Dong Xuan from Huangfeng Valley.

222
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,180
May I know your names?

223
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,540
I'm Wu Youzi from Qingxu Sect.

224
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,860
I'm Ba Chushui from Ju Jian Sect.

225
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,860
You two are here for the wedding, too?

226
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,540
Yes.

227
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,660
We're here to catch the evil spirit.

228
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,220
But it doesn't matter.

229
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,460
Come on.

230
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,620
Junior, have another one.

231
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,620
Here you are.

232
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,020
That's right. It's not important.

233
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,660
Great.

234
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,100
Excellent.

235
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,260
How about you?

236
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,500
Another one?

237
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,740
Great.

238
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,580
Excellent.

239
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,580
So handsome.

240
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
So handsome.

241
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,340
I've never seen him so happy.

242
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,820
In this strange place,

243
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,700
he met Hong Yan so quickly.

244
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,740
Let's meet him later.

245
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,140
Then,

246
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,660
we won't bother you.

247
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,540
Let's go to see fireworks.

248
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,860
Du Kang left it for you.

249
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,780
Thank you, Senior.

250
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,420
Let's go.

251
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:11,900
Let's go.

252
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,220
Let's go.

253
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,780
Let's go.

254
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,420
Let's go.

255
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,020
Let's go.

256
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,220
Is there a cultivator?

257
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,580
The world is yesterday,

258
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,580
it's tomorrow.

259
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:58,580
The sea of stars is different from the past.

260
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:05,580
Time will also erase all the wishes in the world.

261
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Only this year has passed for thousands of years.

262
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:23,580
In the moment that has never been used.

263
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,980
Over there.

264
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,580
Come here.

265
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,380
You all hit my sister's tree.

266
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,700
Look at me.

267
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,900
Look at me.

268
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,700
I'm Dong Xuan from the Yellow Wind Valley.

269
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,900
You all hit my sister's tree.

270
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,220
Look at me.

271
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,420
Look at me.

272
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,900
No.

273
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,020
She's going to have an accident.

274
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,820
Miss Mo,

275
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,820
you go home first.

276
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,820
I have something to do.

277
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,820
I can't stay here for long.

278
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,620
Keep this.

279
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,020
If there is any normal cultivation that is not good for you,

280
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,620
you can throw it away.

281
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,220
These are the seeds of the spirit grass

282
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,820
and the pills that are good for the mortal.

283
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,220
You can eat it yourself.

284
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,620
You can also sell it after practicing.

285
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
But don't sell it too much.

286
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,020
It's too cheap.

287
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,020
It's all good medicine.

288
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,420
If you have anything,

289
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,220
go to the inn and write me a letter.

290
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,020
Can I see you again?

291
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,420
I'll watch you go home.

292
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,220
Go back.

293
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,020
Okay.

294
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
Go back.

295
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,620
So beautiful.

296
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,220
Little girl,

297
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,820
you can rest assured to go with me.

298
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,620
I won't treat you badly.

299
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,820
Who are you, my dear?

300
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,620
I'm Dong Xuan, the ancient emperor of the Yellow Wind Valley.

301
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,420
Of course I know you are the ancient emperor of the Yellow Wind Valley.

302
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,620
You know me?

303
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
I even know your father,

304
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,820
mother, grandfather, grandmother.

305
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,420
I can memorize your family history.

306
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,420
I know.

307
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,220
Did you fall into my charm?

308
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,020
Yes.

309
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,020
You're so charming.

310
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,820
Trying to escape your charm,

311
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,220
your nephew is coming to find you.

312
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,020
I've never seen you like this before.

313
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,420
What are you doing?

314
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,220
Who will go home?

315
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,020
Whoever wins will go with whoever.

316
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,660
How about it?

317
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,780
Okay.

318
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,420
Come on.

319
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,380
Hit me.

320
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,220
Hit me.

321
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,260
What a strange skill.

322
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,740
Why can't she use the real face?

323
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,060
She must be pretending.

324
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,940
I tried so much

325
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,540
to get here.

326
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,700
You won't be the winner.

327
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,820
You're all gonna be of inaccuracy.

328
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,420
That's too good.

329
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,420
Amazing.

330
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,220
But who brought it back?

331
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,220
Interesting.

332
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,260
Brazilian genki.

333
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,260
I'll go with you.

334
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,660
You all hit my sister.

335
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,500
I'm the queen of the wind.

336
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,820
You can't stand my sister.

337
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,540
You're so滑.

338
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,740
I need speed.

339
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,780
Oh no,

340
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,340
if master sees his face,

341
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,140
I have to strike first to be responsible.

342
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,820
Where am I?

343
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,100
Drink the medicine

344
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,100
What is that?

345
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
Don't look at me

346
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
Drink it

347
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,060
Sister

348
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,060
I told you not to use your charm

349
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,060
That person just turned against you

350
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,060
and let you hurt me

351
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,060
You need to recover in a few days

352
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
Don't do this

353
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,520
3 pages of theek

354
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
Why always look at me?

355
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,100
Look at you

356
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
He is the person who kidnapped you

357
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,660
Today, I felt all night

358
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,660
Teen E inspiration

359
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,380
Yeah

360
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,380
I have a bad feeling

361
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,980
We'll go back as soon as it's over.

362
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,980
From now on, you must listen to me.

363
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,980
We'll discuss it according to the three rules later.

364
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,980
Okay then.

365
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,980
Senior, where are you going?

366
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,980
I mean, can you stay a little longer tonight?

367
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
I'll stay here tonight.

368
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,380
Okay.

369
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,380
Then, about today's matter,

370
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,380
you won't tell my teacher, right?

371
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,980
I never thought of taking the initiative to provoke anyone.

372
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,180
Why is it always my fault?

373
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,180
I'm sorry.

374
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
Enough.

375
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,780
I know you didn't mean to use your charm.

376
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,780
I'll keep this secret and not tell anyone.

377
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,780
It's a deal.

378
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,780
You...

379
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,780
It's a deal.

380
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,380
Senior Tan, I'm hungry.

381
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,780
Sleep.

382
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,980
What if I'm hungry?

383
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,380
You won't be hungry if you fall asleep.

384
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,380
Then, I want to...

385
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,580
You're so boring.

386
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,780
I'm so bored.

387
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,780
I'm so bored.

388
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,780
Senior Han, are you cold sitting there?

389
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,080
Have some lunch.

390
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,080
Don't worry.

391
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,780
Help me take the drink.

392
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,780
I'll go get it right away.

393
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,980
Hey.

394
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,580
What are you looking at? Where did you come from?

395
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,980
From the order of Ref hide of the tribe of Xuan Yu.

396
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,980
Don't bother. Go to another place.

397
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,980
Please.

398
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,980
Why did you come here in advance?

399
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,980
Isn't there two days left before we hand over the seal?

400
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,980
The tribe has been rushing us these days.

401
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,980
You should...

402
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,980
be more lenient.

403
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,980
What you said...

404
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,980
is the best thing...

405
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,980
that we, the Yin Yue tribe, have ever done.

406
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,980
Please sit down and have some tea.

407
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,980
Brother.

408
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,980
What happened to the mine recently?

409
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,980
Why are there so many people here?

410
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,980
The young master of the Yan family is getting married.

411
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,980
The young master is getting married.

412
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,980
We should send more people to help him.

413
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,980
I heard that...

414
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,980
the groom is so lucky.

415
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,980
Such a big mine...

416
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,980
will be his in the future.

417
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,980
He's so lucky.

418
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,980
Then, which sect is this groom from?

419
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,980
He's so lucky...

420
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,980
to marry the precious daughter of the Yan family's young master.

421
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,980
I heard that he's from the Yi Country.

422
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,980
The Yi Country?

423
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,980
Which country?

424
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,980
What's the name?

425
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,980
Brother, don't ask.

426
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,980
Let's not talk about the upper level.

427
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,980
Come on, have some tea.

428
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,980
Why is there a big earthquake?

429
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,980
Brother, please sit down. I'll be right back.

430
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
It hurts. Be gentle.

431
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
Let me tell you the truth.

432
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
How can there be such a big earthquake...

433
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,980
at the wedding tomorrow?

434
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,980
It hurts.

435
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,980
Brother, don't ask.

436
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,980
For the sake of our friendship for so many years,

437
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,980
listen to me.

438
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,980
Go.

439
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,980
It won't be easy to come here again.

440
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,980
My plan has to be made in advance.

441
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,980
Okay.

442
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,980
Grand Master.

443
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
What's wrong?

444
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,980
Jiang and the Chouqi Kingdom have been eliminated.

445
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,980
The entire Wang clan has been taken away.

446
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,980
It was the Ghost Realm who did it.

447
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,980
Inform the elders of the sects to discuss this matter.

448
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,980
The location is set at Huangfeng Valley.

449
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,980
Inform Xun Yue...

450
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,980
to tell me about the situation at the border of Yue Country.

451
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,980
Yes, Grand Master.

452
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,980
Go.

453
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,980
Is the war really about to start?

454
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,980
Brother Han, Sister Dong, good morning.

455
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,980
Good morning, two seniors.

456
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,980
Good morning.

457
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,980
I wonder what you found last night.

458
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,980
Last night, the fireworks were beautiful.

459
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,980
The wine was great.

460
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,980
Yes.

461
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,980
When the wedding is over, we'll get back to work.

462
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,980
Yes.

463
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,980
Brother Han, let's do it together.

464
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,980
Okay.

465
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,980
Together.

466
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,980
Together.

467
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,980
What are we doing together?

468
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,980
Secret.

469
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
I'm telling you.

470
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
We can't do this today.

471
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
Brother Han.

472
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,980
I heard you said someone was peeping at me.

473
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,980
Did you find that person?

474
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,980
I haven't found it yet.

475
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
But you still have to follow me.

476
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,980
Don't run away.

477
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,980
Brother Han, look.

478
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
It's so lively up ahead.

479
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,980
Let's go up and have a look.

480
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,980
It's strange.

481
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,980
Why does it smell so bad?

482
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980
It's because I'm not used to it.

483
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,980
I'm afraid I'll get sick.

484
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,980
I'm afraid I'll get sick.

485
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,980
I'm afraid I'll get sick.

486
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,980
I'm afraid I'll get sick.

487
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,980
I'm afraid I'll get sick.

488
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,980
I'm afraid I'll get sick.

489
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,980
I'm afraid I'll get sick.

490
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,980
I'm afraid I'll get sick.

491
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,980
Brother Han.

492
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
Let's go.

493
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,980
Let's go.

494
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,980
Let's go.

495
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,980
Let's go.

496
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,980
Let's go.

497
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
What are you doing?

498
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,980
Let's go.

499
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,980
I'm going to make a fire.

500
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,980
It's so cold.

501
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,980
I'm a little cold.

502
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,980
It's so cold.

503
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,980
It's so cold.

504
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,620
Yes.

505
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,420
Let's stand in front and shoot.

506
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:24,900
Follow me.

507
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:51,460
Xie Yanxing

508
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:59,180
Einsatzb wells

509
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,620
We didn't see the Governor of the Yan family.

510
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,340
Yes.

511
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,340
Why are the elders not here?

512
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,340
Yan Ruyan looks weird.

513
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,340
He looks weird.

514
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,340
The person who did it was him.

515
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,340
Why him?

516
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,340
How could the head of Yan family choose this kind of person as his son-in-law?

517
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,340
Don't choose him.

518
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
This wedding is a bit weird.

519
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,340
Follow me.

520
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,340
Welcome to my and Yan's wedding.

521
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,340
Let's start the feast.

522
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,340
Yan Ruyan

523
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,340
My spirit energy is gone.

524
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,340
Oh no, my cultivation is suppressed.

525
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,340
Why is it so bad?

526
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,340
Brother Han, my cultivation is suppressed.

527
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,340
My cultivation is suppressed.

528
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,340
Run.

529
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,340
Run.

530
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,340
This is the blood-draining king of the Ghostly Sect.

531
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,340
Run.

532
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,340
Run.

533
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,340
I'll accept your wedding gifts.

534
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,340
You seven sects are not allowed to be together.

535
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,340
Yan Ruyan

536
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,340
Yan Ruyan

537
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,340
Yan Ruyan

538
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,340
Yan Ruyan

539
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,340
You seven sects have always been in the right place.

540
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,340
You like to help others the most.

541
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:35,340
Then use your cultivation to save the future owner of Yan's family.

542
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,340
Since I'm forced to this place,

543
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,340
don't blame me for being too cruel.

544
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,340
Run.

545
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,340
Run.

546
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,340
Yan's family is gone.

547
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,340
No way out.

548
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,340
Don't tell me these people have not died.

549
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,340
They just changed into cultivation.

550
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,340
Yan Ruyan

551
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,340
Yan Ruyan

552
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,340
Yan Ruyan

553
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,340
Yan Ruyan

554
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,340
Yan Ruyan

555
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,340
Yan Ruyan

556
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,340
Yan Ruyan

557
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,340
Yan Ruyan

558
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,340
Yan Ruyan

559
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,340
Yan Ruyan

560
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,540
and changed their cultivation

561
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,660
to be with Yan'er.

562
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,860
They can have the chance now.

563
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,620
They should thank me.

564
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,700
No.

565
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,260
They should thank

566
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,180
Father-in-law.

567
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,300
We have set up

568
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,500
a life-and-death trap.

569
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,620
We will save Yan'er.

570
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,580
I will never let you go.

571
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,300
Now Yan'er is mine.

572
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,060
I'm more anxious than Father-in-law.

573
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,660
Yan'er, why are you still awake?

574
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,180
I've used so much spiritual power.

575
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,140
She still can't recover.

576
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,660
I didn't expect

577
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,380
my wife to be so greedy.

578
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,260
Mother.

579
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,940
Father-in-law, don't worry.

580
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,500
There were a few

581
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,660
dead fish just now.

582
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,940
I'll go and catch them

583
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,620
and give them to Madam.
