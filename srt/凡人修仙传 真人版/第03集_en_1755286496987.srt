"A Mortal's Heart" - Wang Zhengliang

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,480
â™«  Pursuing the wind and moon, I set out on a long journey  â™«

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,120
â™«  The road ahead is uncertain, words are insignificant  â™«

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,160
â™«  Iâ€™ve tasted joys and sorrows  â™«

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,480
â™«  I conceal my abilities, and make careful plans  â™«

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,140
â™«  A mortalâ€™s heart with a few concerns  â™«

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,580
â™«  Accompanying me around the kingdom  â™«

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,960
â™«  I take the opportunity to reverse the desperate situation  â™«

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,480
â™«  Longing for a bosom friend in this mortal world  â™«

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,860
â™«  Iâ€™ve yet to figure out what immortality is  â™«

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,921
â™«  That eternity is also a fleeting moment  â™«

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,280
â™«  Donâ€™t mock me for being ordinary  â™«

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,180
â™«  Alone, I fight the disasters; the world is in a turmoil  â™«

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
â™«  Donâ€™t scorn me for being ordinary  â™«

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,440
â™«  Keep a kind heart, be decisive and kill if need be  â™«

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,660
â™«  There are hidden joys and sorrows in fate  â™«

17
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,000
â™«  Between life and death, I strive to save a desperate situation  â™«

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,080
â™«  Faith carries me through the long and endless night  â™«

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,415
â™«  I will return with an enlightened heart  â™«

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,960
â™«  Extraordinary after final training, I enter the vast three realms

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,470
â™«  And achieved nirvana in the cycle of reincarnation  â™«

22
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,892
Episode 3

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,490
He's back.

24
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,550
And he brought someone with him.

25
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,980
Who's that person with the mask?

26
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,910
What's the progress of your chant?

27
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,840
You're asking too early. It's not time yet.

28
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,460
The world is so vast. No matter where I go,

29
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,010
I always worry about you.

30
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,130
Physician Mo's face is looking more lifeless.

31
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,800
Show me your hand.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,370
Since you lied to me first, I see no reason to tell you the truth.

33
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,260
The power of Level Five can let me control the strength and weakness of my vital energy.

34
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,980
If I control it at Level Three, he won't notice my progress.

35
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,950
I told you not to play tricks in front of me.

36
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,950
How will you punish me?

37
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,350
Not bad. I indeed chose the right person.

38
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,740
You can remain calm now.

39
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,310
But don't worry, you'll be fine.

40
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,130
Your deadline for a year is not up yet.

41
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,430
But it's already been so long.

42
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,560
Why is your cultivation still stuck at Level Three?

43
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,359
I did my best.

44
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,080
Do you know what I previously let you consume?

45
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,770
Consume this.

46
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,650
That medicine is called the Corpse Worm Pill.

47
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,420
Perhaps, it's not a medicine.

48
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,960
It's a worm's egg concocted with a secret method.

49
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,700
Once swallowed, it hides in your body.

50
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,930
But don't worry.

51
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,810
You'll be completely safe for now.

52
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,080
As long as, within a year,

53
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,260
you take my antidote regularly,

54
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,300
that egg will dissolve on its own without leaving any side effects.

55
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,680
Otherwise...

56
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,740
it'll absorb nutrients inside your body, hatch,

57
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,900
and start eating every last one of your organs,

58
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,400
until you die slowly in unspeakable pain.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,380
Besides, a few days ago, I went to Qingniu Town.

60
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,470
I saw your family from a distance. They're doing fine

61
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,990
and eating big pancakes.

62
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,570
As your younger sister, she's grown into a young lady.

63
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,740
She's quite a beauty.

64
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,610
I swear!

65
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,020
In three months, I'll reach Level Four.

66
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,260
This is more like it.

67
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,420
All right then.

68
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,420
I'll stay here in the valley for three months.

69
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,590
I'm not going anywhere else.

70
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:31,000
I went through a lot of effort to find these pills for you.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,970
It'll greatly help your cultivation.

72
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,020
Do whatever you want during these three months.

73
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,300
Rest assured, I won't keep watch on you again.

74
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,800
But... if you still haven't achieved it by then,

75
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,610
our lives will expire after these three months.

76
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,620
Only three months left.

77
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,750
I must make the most of it.

78
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,380
That brat even learned to make poison!

79
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,620
I didn't teach him this.

80
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,260
This rotten brat is so ruthless

81
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,270
and ungrateful to the core.

82
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,580
I've only just started cultivating.

83
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,000
I can't rely on normal tactics to defeat someone like Physician Mo.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,050
Li Feiyu found a tactic for me. It's called the Secret Manual of the Blinking Sword Technique.

85
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,110
He said it suits someone like me without any foundation.

86
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,810
Instead of a sword technique, it's more like a technique for assassination.

87
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,800
It's about using your surroundings, setting traps,

88
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,430
manipulating lights and shadows to mislead your enemy,

89
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,980
so you can land a fatal strike.

90
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,700
I've finally reached Level Six.

91
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,290
All my five senses have grown sharper.

92
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,680
From the gurgle of distant streams

93
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,185
to the flutter of nearby insect's wings,

94
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:32,885
I can sense them with perfect clarity.

95
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,170
I give up!

96
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,800
Teaching a disciple is really exhausting work!

97
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,770
How do you get faster by the day?

98
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,080
You're just a good master.

99
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,080
Take this.

100
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:24,295
It matches your Blinking Sword Technique perfectly.

101
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,600
Thank you.

102
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,510
I'm heading back now.

103
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,800
Han Li.

104
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,440
I don't know what you've been through lately.

105
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,952
But no matter what happens, don't face it alone.

106
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,402
Send a message by pigeon if you must.

107
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,280
Take care.

108
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,380
The three months' deadline is up.

109
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,204
Physician Mo, I'm coming for you.

110
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,499
I've prepared whatever I can for today.

111
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,829
I won't be afraid again.

112
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,370
You're punctual.

113
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,990
Where's the antidote?

114
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,220
Have you reached Level Four?

115
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,910
Where's the antidote?

116
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,900
When people fight to survive,

117
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,280
they will unleash their unimaginable abilities.

118
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,430
Take this.

119
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,700
I have one more question.

120
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,290
Speak.

121
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,160
Did Zhang Tie

122
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,870
really go home?

123
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,880
Of course.

124
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,650
You're lying!

125
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,170
I made a pact with him.

126
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,820
If we didn't amount to anything, we'd never go home!

127
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,570
See?

128
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,140
You only believed half of what I told you.

129
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,660
You acted cautious, but you're laughably naÃ¯ve.

130
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,340
You already knew the answer,

131
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,130
why even ask?

132
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,142
You wanted me to cultivate to Level Four to remove your poison and cure you.

133
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,020
In fact, that was a lie.

134
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,650
Whatever you want to know,

135
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,180
I will tell you.

136
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,490
It's chilly out here.

137
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,280
Come, let's talk inside.

138
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,080
Come.

139
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,130
Heaven is on my side.

140
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,850
You've really reached Level Four!

141
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:01,556
I'm not going to die!

142
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:04,740
I'm only 37 years old.

143
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,700
I've barely started living!

144
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,340
Strange, isn't it?

145
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,050
I look so old at the age of 37.

146
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,620
Anyone who sees me would think I'm almost 80 and on death's door.

147
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,760
If not for the strange poison in my body that I've struggled to suppress it,

148
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,030
why would I go through all this trouble?

149
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,380
Come here.

150
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,030
Han Li.

151
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,600
Today marks the end of our master and disciple bond.

152
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,340
Show me what you've got.

153
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,570
Let me see what you've prepared.

154
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,170
In less than three months,

155
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,860
you've achieved a lot.

156
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,840
You really keep surprising me

157
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:16,410
but my reputation wasn't built on medical skills alone.

158
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,180
Do you think you can defeat me?

159
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:09,370
My ultimate technique, the Demon's Silver Palm,

160
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:17,530
returns to the martial art community today.

161
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,340
Be good. Calm down, my dear disciple.

162
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:36,507
It'll all be over soon.

163
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,930
Rotten brat,

164
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,900
you even have a hidden trick?

165
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,690
You poisoned me.

166
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,620
You've the guts.

167
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,240
"Hide your skills with and intelligence in clumsiness."

168
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,950
You taught me that.

169
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,520
Armored Puppet!

170
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,480
"Hide cleverness with clumsiness."

171
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,080
That's what I taught you.

172
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,240
Iron Slave.

173
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,070
Stop struggling.

174
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,140
I created this puppet.

175
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,770
He only listens to me.

176
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,160
Relax, Han Li.

177
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,890
We were master and disciple, after all.

178
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,160
I won't let you suffer too much.

179
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,730
Did you also harm Zhang Tie?

180
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,620
Take a guess.

181
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,550
He regarded you as father, and you still harmed him?

182
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,610
I had no choice, too.

183
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,610
He didn't have a spiritual root.

184
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,010
He couldn't practice the Eternal Spring Technique.

185
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:46,220
He was useless to me.

186
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:50,894
Mo Juren!

187
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,060
Stop wasting time talking to him.

188
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,510
Do it now!

189
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,600
What's the rush?

190
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,180
At this point,

191
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,030
as long as your Seven Ghosts Devouring-soul Curse works

192
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,380
he can't escape.

193
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,450
Who are you talking to?

194
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,470
Whose voice is that?

195
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,820
Don't be afraid.

196
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,920
Don't resist.

197
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:15,290
Just enjoy this grand feast I've spent years preparing.

198
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,430
I can hardly wait for the thrill of rebirth.

199
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:29,370
The Soul-devouring Seven Ghosts!

200
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,560
Who are you?

201
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,330
Take a look.

202
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,960
This is what I used to look like.

203
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,200
Don't be afraid.

204
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,880
It won't hurt that much.

205
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,200
Relax.

206
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,030
Everything will end in a while.

207
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,480
Hurry, use the Immobilizing Talisman!

208
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,080
Don't let him bite his tongue!

209
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,680
Hurry up!

210
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,720
Or everything that you've done will be in vain!

211
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,350
Everything of yours will belong to us!

212
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,240
Give me your body.

213
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,720
Give it all to your master.

214
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,590
Give it to me.

215
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,960
- Give it to me!
- Give it to me!

216
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,510
Mine... It's mine!

217
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,350
Give up everything you have. Hand it over!

218
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,510
Hand it over!

219
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,850
Give it all to your master!

220
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,750
Hand it over! Hand it over!

221
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,880
Hand it over! You're mine!

222
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,640
You belong to me! Give it to me!

223
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,550
- Give it to me!
- Give it to me!

224
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,550
Hand it over! Hand it over!

225
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,830
- Give it to me!
- Give it to me!

226
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,270
- Hand it over!
- No!

227
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,680
This is my body!

228
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,190
All of you, get out!

229
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,380
How did he break free?

230
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,000
Didn't you say I could possess him with your curse?

231
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,790
The curse I gave you could only hold the power of Level Four.

232
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,400
As for him, he has reached Level Four.

233
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,620
So, you want us to struggle and wear each other down,

234
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,750
so that you could swoop in and take over?

235
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,180
What do you think?

236
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,750
You cunning evil person.

237
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,880
I won't let you take him.

238
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,550
He's my disciple!

239
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,550
Enough talking.

240
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,500
Let's settle this with skill!

241
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,860
Level Six?

242
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,010
He tricked us.

243
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,600
He has reached Level Six!

244
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:34,670
Han Li, Han Li... Looks like...

245
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,900
I've really underestimated you.

246
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,099
"Use obscurity to do good deeds overtly."

247
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:41,880
That's what you taught me too.

248
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,290
You truly are my worthy disciple.

249
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,330
Now that it has come to this,

250
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,810
do you still have anything to say?

251
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,280
I don't.

252
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,670
I've nothing else to say.

253
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,625
That man just now was Yu Zitong.

254
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:20,386
Once you're out, don't believe a word he says.

255
00:29:20,386 --> 00:29:22,587
Kill him immediately.

256
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:25,340
A primordial spirit fears poison the most.

257
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,970
Use what you used on me.

258
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,720
That's enough.

259
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,420
Also, he fears the light.

260
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,610
Goodbye,

261
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,230
Master.

262
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,860
What about you?

263
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,030
Do you have anything else to say?

264
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,620
My name is Yu Zitong.

265
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,190
I'm from an aristocrat family of cultivators.

266
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:41,250
A cultivator, and from an aristocrat family?

267
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,160
I understand.

268
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,350
If you help me to find another body so that I can start over again,

269
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,930
in return, I'll recommend you to my aristocrat family.

270
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,410
Don't believe a word he says.

271
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,640
Kill him immediately.

272
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,380
A primordial spirit fears poison the most.

273
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,011
Use what you used on me.

274
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,590
In the world of cultivation, everything becomes easier

275
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,540
with a strong clan behind you.

276
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,520
How about it?

277
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,900
You said the same thing to Physician Mo, didn't you?

278
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,800
That lowly mortal, is he fit to be mentioned in our discussion?

279
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,485
That's right, too.

280
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,515
But he entrusted me with something for you.

281
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,010
Get lost!

282
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,880
Come out.

283
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,620
Come out!

284
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,570
Also,

285
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,600
he fears the light.

286
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,860
Let me out!

287
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,800
What are you doing?

288
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,830
Let me out!

289
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,390
Let me out now!

290
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,445
Whatever happened between you and Physician Mo,

291
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:41,960
I couldn't care less.

292
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,780
I just want to stay alive.

293
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:49,530
I don't harm others and I won't let others harm me!

294
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:23,260
Without Physician Mo's command, he indeed can't move.

295
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,210
You should like this place.

296
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,580
No one will bother you

297
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:16,010
because no one knows you're no longer alive.

298
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:23,800
Master, rest here in peace.

299
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:42,440
Old man, you won't even spare me after you're dead.

300
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,597
Disciple Han Li, if you're reading this letter,

301
00:35:58,597 --> 00:36:02,800
it means I've lost, and you've won.

302
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,680
Congratulations.

303
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,300
I was helpless and resorted to this out of desperation.

304
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,480
It was fate.

305
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,670
It was destiny.

306
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,480
Now that I'm dead,

307
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,230
there's no point talking about who's right or wrong.

308
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,740
It'd just be laughable.

309
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,480
As for the poison in you from the Demon's Silver Palm,

310
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,000
I've left you some antidote.

311
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,990
It'll keep it suppressed for a few months.

312
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,670
But to fully cure it,

313
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:35,010
you'll need my family heirloom, the Sunwarmed Jade.

314
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,960
Han Li, I've never owed anyone an explanation.

315
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,915
Fate decides victory or defeat.

316
00:36:42,915 --> 00:36:47,450
However, my wife and daughter have nothing to do with this.

317
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,620
I trust you'll know what to do.

318
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:58,130
You kept asking me the whereabouts of Zhang Tie.

319
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:02,930
Sadly, in this world, there's no Zhang Tie left.

320
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:07,840
I never meant to kill him but he uncovered my secret.

321
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,660
Thus, I had no choice but to use his body to forge

322
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,510
a soulless and mindless puppet.

323
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,360
I named him Iron Slave.

324
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,090
This person's mind was completely wiped out.

325
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,880
It moves at the sound of a bell.

326
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,600
Bind it with your blood, and it obeys your will.

327
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:39,380
â™«  Shards of dreams inside a dream  â™«

328
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:46,040
â™«  The slanting moon falls into the water  â™«

329
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,580
â™«  Iâ€™ve been wandering for many years  â™«

330
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,020
â™«  The sceneries surface again  â™«

331
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,360
â™«  And are hard to forget  â™«

332
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,300
â™« easier to remember than to let go â™«

333
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,780
â™« We say the past is smoke and haze... â™«

334
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,565
Blockhead, we should leave

335
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,630
Tie.

336
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,700
I have some, too.

337
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,975
My father made these for me after borrowing three bowls of flour from Uncle Niu.

338
00:38:15,975 --> 00:38:18,320
Blockhead, why don't you wear it?

339
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,040
It looks better on you. You can alternate them.

340
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,180
â™«  And obscured the views. Things change over the passage of time  â™«

341
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:32,900
All souls in this world eventually end like a song.

342
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:35,911
From now on,

343
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,200
you'll be called Qu Hun.
(Song of a Soul)

344
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,352
â™«  Looking back from the mountain peak  â™«

345
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:45,200
â™«  Iâ€™ve lost track of time  â™«

346
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,610
â™«  Was it yesterday?  â™«

347
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:52,820
â™«  Or tomorrow?  â™«

348
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:56,280
â™«  The world has changed a lot  â™«

349
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,720
â™«  And no longer as before  â™«

350
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,540
â™«  Time will also  â™«

351
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:05,755
â™«  Obliterate every word that was spoken in this world  â™«

352
00:39:05,755 --> 00:39:09,520
â™«  Only this longing remains  â™«

353
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,800
â™«  Spanning thousands of years  â™«

354
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:23,776
â™«  In a fleeting moment called eternity  â™«

355
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,141
Physician Mo left behind many secret manuals.

356
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:31,892
The outside world is dangerous and evil.

357
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:35,497
I need to learn a few more skills before I leave here.

358
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,490
Eternal Spring Technique. So, that's the name of the chant.

359
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,210
Why is there only half of it?

360
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,800
Moving objects with the mind is called the Object Control Technique.

361
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,830
Heaven's Eye Technique is a kind of spell that reveals the depth of one's cultivation power. T

362
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,000
Back then, Yu Zitong must have used this technique

363
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,010
to instantly recognize that I had reached Level Six.

364
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:25,330
But among them, the hardest to master must be the Fireball Technique.

365
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:30,820
But if I master this, the power is amazing.

366
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,340
81 strikes of the mountain bell.

367
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,840
The Wild Wolves Gang could even attack the Seven Mystics Sect?

368
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,300
Qu Hun, let's go.

369
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,490
Seven Mystics Sect have suppressed us for many years.

370
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:28,520
I'm here today to settle the score!

371
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,740
Kill!

372
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,810
Kill them all!

373
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,570
Sect Leader Wang, do you want to fight till the end?

374
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,530
Sect Leader Jia,

375
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,700
I won't let you destroy the foundation of Seven Mystics Sect.

376
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:26,180
If I trigger the mechanism, the mountain will collapse!

377
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:33,660
If you don't want us to fight till the end, why not hear me out?

378
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,880
Sect Leader Wang,

379
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,220
what do you have in mind?

380
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,480
Stop the mechanism, and we'll talk!

381
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,360
Qu Hun, hurry!

382
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:06,030
I'm coming.

383
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,530
Move back.

384
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,336
Han Li!

385
00:44:17,336 --> 00:44:18,900
My good buddy!

386
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,580
I knew you will show up when the sect is in trouble.

387
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,010
They have invaded.

388
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,880
Let's go and protect the Sect Leader now!

389
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,060
I, Wang Juechu, the Sect Leader

390
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,810
agree with Jia Tianlong to settle this by a blood duel.

391
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,960
Ten men on each side

392
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,110
will fight till death.

393
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,550
Li Zhanling of the Seven Mystics Sect!

394
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,790
Liu Chong of the Seven Mystics Sect!

395
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,130
Count me in!

396
00:44:51,132 --> 00:44:53,570
Li Feiyu of Outer Blade Hall is here!

397
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,900
Who has the guts to fight me till death?

398
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:01,110
I really didn't want to get involved but I can't just watch him walk into death.

399
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:08,491
I won't sign the blood pact but I'll fight along with you.

400
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:10,902
You're a physician. Why would you fight?

401
00:45:10,902 --> 00:45:13,130
- Step back!
- All of you, step back!

402
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,820
I'll handle this!

403
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,880
Martial Uncle Lu is here! We'll definitely win!

404
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,230
Martial Uncle Lu, kill them!

405
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:39,330
Jia Tianlong, are you making fun of me?

406
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:47,490
Even a lion goes full force when it's fighting a rabbit.

407
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,920
Forgive the offense!

408
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,940
A cultivator?

409
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,440
His level is lower than mine.

410
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,110
We have the help of a cultivator.

411
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:11,290
Didn't expect that, right?

412
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,230
- Martial Uncle!
- Excellent!

413
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,840
Excellent!

414
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,010
Demon!

415
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,230
How dare you act so wildly!

416
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,260
You ant! Are you seeking death?!

417
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,990
Know your ability!

418
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,480
All of you will die today!

419
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:17,620
Why won't this precious thing obey me?

420
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,570
A cultivator!

421
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,890
Han Li...

422
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,530
Leave it to me.

423
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,250
Senior Brother Li.

424
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,550
This thing is not bad.

425
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,820
I'll keep it.

426
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,900
You!

427
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,110
Which family are you from?

428
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,410
Which family do you belong to?

429
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,290
I'm from the Ye family of Qinling,

430
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,460
just passing through on my way to Tainan Valley.

431
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,700
I didn't mean to be your enemy.

432
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,860
Since you're here, I'll back off.

433
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,740
What nonsense is this?

434
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,820
The Ye family from Qinling?

435
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,520
I've heard of them.

436
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:28,140
So why did you interfere?

437
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,610
I... I merely took up his offer.

438
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,540
I made an exception. I didn't mean to offend you!

439
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,410
An exception?

440
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:39,610
As cultivators, we really shouldn't meddle in mortal's affairs.

441
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,760
But... I also had no choice.

442
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:49,980
Since you've admitted your mistake, take back your Flying Sword Talisman.

443
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,610
I'll accept your kindness.

444
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:54,110
And you might want to stay away from these mortal ants,

445
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,550
or you'll be tainted by their bad luck.

446
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:08,890
- Great!
- Great!

447
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,050
What kind of treasure is this?

448
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,810
Even the Fireball Technique can't burn it.

449
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,120
- Great!
- Great!

450
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,780
Sect Leader Jia, where are you going?

451
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,565
Immortal Master, let's talk this through.

452
00:49:39,565 --> 00:49:41,740
I don't have any feud with you.

453
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:46,580
If you're willing to spare my life, I'll gladly reward you handsomely!

454
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:53,400
You kill people like mustard seeds.
(Kills without taking their lives seriously)

455
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,750
Have you never thought this day would come?

456
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,820
Never mind about the rest. However,

457
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,510
I won't spare your life.

458
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,640
Will you take your own life

459
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,710
or shall I do it for you?

460
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,030
Brothers of the Wild Wolves Gang!

461
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:14,940
Kill!

462
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,991
Kill him!

463
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:21,812
- Charge!
- Kill him!

464
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,030
I'm dead either way...

465
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:31,540
Sect Leader!

466
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,740
Immortal Master, you saved Seven Mystics Sect from danger today.

467
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,700
I'm extremely grateful.

468
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,830
I wonder how we can reward you.

469
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,420
I'll give you the position of Deputy Sect Master and one thousand taels of silver.

470
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,700
All the elders and disciples will obey your orders.

471
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:08,060
But the sect can only be handed over to you upon my death.

472
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,035
What do you think?

473
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,800
Why don't you first dismiss those who are lying in ambush?

474
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:40,590
They were probably instructed by Elder Zhang.

475
00:51:42,037 --> 00:51:46,410
Immortal Master, I didn't mean to disrespect you.

476
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,410
As a sect leader, there are things I can't control.

477
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:54,090
You'll understand when you establish your own sect one day.

478
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,340
Don't worry, Sect Leader.

479
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,380
I won't stay for long in Seven Mystics Sect.

480
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:05,070
I'll leave here for a distant place and will never return.

481
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:09,220
But before I leave, I would like to make a deal

482
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,080
that benefits us.

483
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,770
Of course. No problem.

484
00:52:18,274 --> 00:52:20,794
You haven't even heard my terms yet.

485
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,740
Immortal Master, please speak.

486
00:52:25,388 --> 00:52:27,324
Take Li Feiyu as your final disciple.

487
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:31,940
Also, appoint him as the head of Outer Blade Hall.

488
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,230
Fine.

489
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,850
Anything else?

490
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,450
He likes Elder Zhang's third daughter, Zhang Xiu Er

491
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,960
but Elder Zhang dislikes him because he's from a poor family.

492
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,880
I'll talk to him. It's not a big deal.

493
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,570
Anything else?

494
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,780
I have a third uncle

495
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,999
who's an outer disciple.

496
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:55,960
He brought me to the Seven Mystics Sect.

497
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,810
- If anything happens to him, I hope you'll take care of him.
- Of course.

498
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,360
No problem at all.

499
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,570
I won't leave without gratitude.

500
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,970
This is a rare and precious Nourishing Essence Pill.

501
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:13,110
Keep it.

502
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:16,290
It will save your life at a critical moment.

503
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,230
Whatever you've said,

504
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:25,720
I accept them all.

505
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,290
Farewell.

506
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,160
â™« That day I first saw you â™«

507
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,000
â™« We held close, hearts full of joy â™«

508
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,080
â™« We made a promise to reunite â™«

509
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,280
â™« And walked into the unknown â™«

510
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,040
â™« But now that we've met again... â™«

511
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,030
I've always been a loner.

512
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:59,590
Never thought I'd find a true friend like you.

513
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,010
I may not be good at much,

514
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,230
but I've never feared a fight!

515
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,640
Since we're brothers now,

516
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:10,620
if anyone ever dares to mess with you,

517
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:15,180
just give them my name, Li Fei Yu!

518
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,780
- Someday, my name will echo across the Tiannan Continent!
- Deal!

519
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:24,620
Li Feiyu!

520
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:30,281
â™« There's still hardship ahead â™«

521
00:54:30,281 --> 00:54:32,906
â™« Even as cold winds blow... â™«

522
00:54:32,906 --> 00:54:36,176
Farewell, Master Han!

523
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,960
â™« We're just fleeting mortals â™«

524
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,005
â™« Time slipped by before we knew â™«

525
00:54:46,005 --> 00:54:50,206
â™« Yet we burn that spark of light â™«

526
00:54:50,206 --> 00:54:54,333
â™« Into this starry sky â™«

527
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:58,594
â™« Starlight fades into the Milky Way â™«

528
00:54:58,594 --> 00:55:04,554
â™« While the mayfly dies in the whirlpool... â™«

529
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:07,000
This time, I really am leaving.

530
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,260
Han Li!

531
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,300
I caught a fish!

532
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,700
What a big one!

533
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,130
Come on! Let's get a fire going!

534
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,641
â™« But my heart has never rested â™«

â™« Through all the joy and sorrow â™«

537
00:55:31,941 --> 00:55:36,140
â™« How do I choose the way? â™«

538
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:41,269
â™« Now we part, so far apart... â™«

539
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:42,860
Six years have passed.

540
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,665
Everything's changed.

541
00:55:44,665 --> 00:55:46,435
No one's left.

542
00:55:48,702 --> 00:55:52,052
Remember what I told you.

543
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:57,340
Staying alive is what matters most.

544
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:02,571
If you can't win, just run.

545
00:56:02,571 --> 00:56:04,551
Got that?

546
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:10,580
Don't forget you started as a mortal.

547
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:14,130
Even if you become immortal,

548
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,110
act like a human being.

549
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:26,060
Just imagine how you'll mess
with those cocky immortals,

550
00:56:27,143 --> 00:56:30,773
I can't help but laugh out loud.

551
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,705
Sure.

552
00:56:34,705 --> 00:56:36,120
Just rest in peace.

553
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,888
â™« The ones before once told me â™«

554
00:56:39,888 --> 00:56:43,840
â™« There's still hardship ahead â™«

555
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,880
â™« Even as cold winds blow... â™«

556
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,190
Why should only immortals soar through the skies,

557
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:55,840
while we mortals stay trapped
like frogs in a well?

558
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:01,320
Han Li, there's so much beauty in this world.

559
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:06,980
Go see it in my place.

560

â™« Starlight fades into the Milky Way... â™«

561
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:21,760
Goodbye, Physician Mo,
Zhang Tie, and Shenshou Valley.

â™« Each step of fate's game unclear â™«

563
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:33,028
â™« Who can guess the ending? â™«

564
00:57:33,028 --> 00:57:37,229
â™« But my heart has never rested â™«

565
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:41,454
â™« Ever chasing, still searching on â™«

566
00:57:41,454 --> 00:57:45,534
â™« Through all the joy and sorrow â™«

567
00:57:45,534 --> 00:57:50,774
â™« How do I choose the way... â™«

568
00:57:50,774 --> 00:57:52,539
I'm off.

569
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:55,860
The pills I left you are enough to last ten years.

570
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,920
you'll become a great hero.

571
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:01,780
Don't worry about me.

572
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,780
Take care of yourself too.

573
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,120
I believe the day will come

574
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,120
when your name echoes across the Tiannan Continent.

575
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,266
Han Li!

576
00:58:12,266 --> 00:58:14,200
Han Li, remember this:

577
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:19,480
Before the name Li Fei Yu shakes the Tiannan Continent, I won't die.

578
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,510
And you're not allowed to die either.
