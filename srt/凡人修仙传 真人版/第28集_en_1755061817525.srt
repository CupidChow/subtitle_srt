00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Pufferfish Episode 2

2
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,880
Now!

3
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,040
Dear fingerprints,

4
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,920
when every drop of your shape nears the ground,

5
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,140
it represents an waking up from the prophecy.

6
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,120
Repeat for me firearms!

7
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,120
Hang in there.

8
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,680
Soon,

9
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,420
they See,

10
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,220
They will find us masters.

11
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,720
They will be gone soon.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,720
Every power grows stronger.

13
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,600
Every strength grows stronger.

14
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,000
Also,

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
've you seen a person

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,920
who leaves him behind?

17
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,400
No.

18
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,120
I've seen a person

19
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,940
who gr subsidy his own family.

20
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,440
However,

21
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,480
clearly he still has someone

22
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,240
who recovered.

23
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,940
But surely it's necessary

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,440
Shut up.

25
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,600
Stop.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,760
Apologize to friends.

27
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,900
Mr Jun, he did it solely to get me.

28
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:27,840
When I was

29
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,440
That man came just now.

30
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,040
You're a smart man.

31
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,640
No need to ask.

32
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
I'm leaving.

33
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,040
Huaien.

34
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,840
Do you remember

35
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,240
when you first came here,

36
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,640
I taught you the first lesson?

37
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,440
I remember.

38
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,640
The highest level of cultivation

39
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,440
is to forget the past,

40
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,640
to destroy the will of the people,

41
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,440
to be willing to give up everything,

42
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
and to...

43
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,240
I remember all of them.

44
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,640
I also remember

45
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,240
what my ancestors once said.

46
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,440
If you can't even understand your thoughts,

47
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,840
why would you cultivate a god?

48
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,640
That's right.

49
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,640
I've said so much.

50
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,640
You didn't even listen to a word.

51
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,440
If you really did,

52
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,240
why would you be beaten up?

53
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,840
My ancestors were right.

54
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,040
It's just paying a little price

55
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,240
to pass on the tradition to the next generation.

56
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,840
Now,

57
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,640
this is the best way.

58
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Do you have a better idea?

59
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
No.

60
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,640
This plan is really simple and simple.

61
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,640
It's a brilliant plan.

62
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,640
I can't do it.

63
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,640
You're a man of your word.

64
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,240
Do you think I can't

65
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,640
understand your sarcasm?

66
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Old Master.

67
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,040
I just want to ask

68
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,440
if you really want to do it,

69
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,840
and if my senior Hong Fu

70
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,440
and my disciple Han Li

71
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,040
know about it?

72
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
This dream...

73
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,040
Then I'll ask my senior Hong Fu

74
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,440
and see if he agrees.

75
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,840
You killed him?

76
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,440
You sold him to the old devil of Yunlu?

77
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,640
That old devil

78
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,240
poisoned the forest

79
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,640
and destroyed the Yellow Wind Valley.

80
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
If he has the world,

81
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,440
he will only die.

82
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,640
This is a exchange,

83
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,640
not a sale.

84
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,640
Thank you, Old Master.

85
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,440
The main force is the central force.

86
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,240
Don't attack the first force.

87
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,840
Why is it so unlucky?

88
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,640
We only meet the elite.

89
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,840
But the most troublesome

90
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,640
are the two leaders.

91
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,440
The Yellow Wind Valley Hong Fu is here.

92
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,840
Who is here?

93
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,240
What's my relationship with him?

94
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,840
I'm not his friend.

95
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
I'm his friend.

96
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,240
I'm his friend.

97
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,840
I'm his friend.

98
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,240
I'm his friend.

99
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,040
What a pretty young lady I am.

100
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,240
She's so old.

101
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,440
She doesn't look good,

102
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,440
right?

103
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,440
She's not in good shape.

104
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,440
I wonder what the old man wants from her.

105
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,240
You're unreasonable.

106
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
You beat me up when you meet me.

107
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,640
This is not a good habit.

108
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,240
Two Jiedan Xiu.

109
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,440
I'm from the Ghost Valley.

110
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,040
Others call me Kulou.

111
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,840
But you're in a hurry.

112
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,840
Where are you going?

113
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,040
You smell like Fu Yunzi.

114
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,440
You mean the old man?

115
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,040
He's a good opponent.

116
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,440
Like this?

117
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,040
What's this?

118
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,840
Fu Yunzi's candle.

119
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,040
Give it back to Taoist.

120
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
For Taoist,

121
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,640
the Ghost Valley has something.

122
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,640
I can forgive you

123
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,640
for what you did.

124
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,640
But I'm taking these disciples away.

125
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,840
Please don't stop me.

126
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,240
You're so stupid.

127
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,040
Don't you know we're here for you?

128
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,440
You're just a couple.

129
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,640
You're the real master.

130
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,240
Master.

131
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,840
Master Yunlu is here.

132
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,440
Please take him away.

133
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,040
These disciples are fighting against each other.

134
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,240
I can't let them leave.

135
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,240
If so,

136
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,840
then let's fight.

137
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,040
We'll fight and fight.

138
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,440
We'll go to the place marked by the sign.

139
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,840
Master.

140
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,040
Go.

141
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,040
This is not a fight you can get involved in.

142
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Go.

143
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,840
Xu Huan, go.

144
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,440
You want to run?

145
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Go.

146
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Go.

147
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,440
Your opponent is me.

148
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,440
That's it?

149
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,240
I hope Han Li and the others can escape.

150
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,840
We're almost at the meeting point.

151
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,640
We can't let them escape.

152
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,240
We can't let them escape.

153
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,840
We can't let them escape.

154
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,440
We can't let them escape.

155
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,840
We can't let them escape.

156
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,440
We can't let them escape.

157
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
It'll be safe when we get there.

158
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,440
Han Shidi.

159
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,840
Something's wrong.

160
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,040
Be careful.

161
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,840
Be careful.

162
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,840
Where are the people who are here to meet the disciples?

163
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,240
There won't be any people here.

164
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,440
Follow me.

165
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,640
It's him.

166
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,840
Isn't this Li Feiyu?

167
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
No.

168
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,040
You're not Li Feiyu.

169
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,440
You're...

170
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,240
Han Li.

171
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,240
No wonder I couldn't find you.

172
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,240
How did he know I was here?

173
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,640
Not bad.

174
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,440
You're quite capable.

175
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,240
It's more fun to kill like this.

176
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,240
customized?

177
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,040
Absolutely...

178
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,800
Feng?

179
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,280
Mr.醉

180
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,160
Sir

181
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Fancy your talent

182
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,380
What a nice soul you have

183
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
I finally want to see you

184
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,860
Please go to call him

185
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,480
He told me to get together here

186
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,280
Stay here and fight with", the devil

187
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,960
I'm surprised

188
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040
We met an ambush in the city.

189
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
I understand.

190
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
It's hard for you too.

191
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
Here.

192
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Take this.

193
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Here are some materials and snacks.

194
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,040
If you meet your brothers and sisters,

195
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
give them to me.

196
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
And this.

197
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
You keep this.

198
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,040
This is some of my writing.

199
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,040
I'll read it when you're in a rush.

200
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Thank you for your teaching.

201
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,040
But I can't take this.

202
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
I'd like to ask you to give it to your brothers and sisters

203
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
after you come back safely.

204
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
What are you thinking?

205
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
It's just some money.

206
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Enough.

207
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:52,300
Next is the battle between the

208
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Master.

209
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,300
Master.

210
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,300
Do you have to go?

211
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300
What?

212
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,300
Where?

213
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
The devil in the steel floor

214
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
didn't mean to kill you.

215
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,300
He just wanted his people

216
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
to be like a hunter.

217
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
He just wanted to be careful.

218
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,300
This kid.

219
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,300
He can't hide anything from you.

220
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Come on.

221
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Get up.

222
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
An Li.

223
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
Although you just joined the family,

224
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,300
you're smart,

225
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
cautious,

226
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
and you know how to live a life.

227
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
Maybe your future

228
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
will be better than mine.

229
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
I know.

230
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
It's a dangerous journey.

231
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,300
You'll die a long time.

232
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
But I have to go.

233
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,300
You've lived for a long time.

234
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,300
You'll feel that

235
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,300
there are many things in this world

236
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
that are more important than your own life.

237
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,300
For example,

238
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,300
some people.

239
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,300
Give me your hand.

240
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,300
I'll help you to erase this sign.

241
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,300
This is what Huangfeng Valley owes you.

242
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Enough.

243
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Leave Yueguang quickly.

244
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
There are many beautiful scenery outside.

245
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,300
You can go and see for me.

246
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,300
I'll go with you.

247
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,300
I'll go with you.

248
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,300
I'll go with you.

249
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Go.

250
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
I'll go.

251
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
You're not dead?

252
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,300
Where is this?

253
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
What a crazy woman.

254
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
She's following you all day.

255
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,300
She'll die in her hands.

256
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,300
I'm not dead.

257
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
I'm alive.

258
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
I'm alive.

259
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,300
I'm alive.

260
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
I'm alive.

261
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,300
I'm alive.

262
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
I'm alive.

263
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,300
I'm alive.

264
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,300
I'm alive.

265
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,300
I'm alive.

266
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,300
I'm alive.

267
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
I'm alive.

268
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,300
I'm alive.

269
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,300
I'm alive.

270
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
What did you say?

271
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
I didn't say anything.

272
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,300
I just vomited.

273
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
I said congratulations to Young Master.

274
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,300
You can leave the Jiedan Xiu clan and go back in your body.

275
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
You must protect me.

276
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
What else do you have in mind?

277
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,300
What else can I have in mind?

278
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
I have a lot in mind.

279
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,300
But the big idea is that you take it.

280
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
You only take it from me.

281
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Go to Huangfeng Valley and meet with the old group first.

282
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,300
Han Liying.

283
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
I'll kill you myself sooner or later.

284
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,300
What's the fun?

285
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
You are indeed the first female cultivator of Huangfeng Valley.

286
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
Your power is really extraordinary.

287
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,300
It seems that I have to do my best.

288
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
First, kill that woman.

289
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Then kill those kids.

290
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
Just keep your face.

291
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,300
It doesn't matter if you cut your hands or feet.

292
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Just as you said.

293
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
You are already very powerful.

294
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,300
It's a pity that it's over.

295
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Senior, I'm coming.

296
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
I'm late for this money.

297
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Hurry up.

298
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Eat the elixir.

299
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
Hurry up and change your clothes.

300
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
This is a high-end product given by Lord Wang.

301
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Yes.

302
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
2000 pieces of snacks.

303
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,300
It's like eating money.

304
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
I told Han Li and the others to leave first.

305
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
I don't know if they are now...

306
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
I've already seen him.

307
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Don't worry.

308
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,300
That kid won't die for the time being.

309
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Where are the other disciples?

310
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Did they all leave the valley?

311
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,300
The ancestors should have taken them away.

312
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,300
That person and the ancestors left.

313
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Jiang Guomian.

314
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
They discussed all of this.

315
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
Including the elixir on us.

316
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
It's also part of the plan.

317
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,300
So that's how it is.

318
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
This is really his style.

319
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,300
But I'm the only one.

320
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,300
To exchange for the entire Huangfeng Valley.

321
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
This business is not a loss.

322
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,300
Senior Sister.

323
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Look at this.

324
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,300
Doesn't it look like when we first entered the sect.

325
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,300
We went to Qingxun Sect to steal the spiritual grass.

326
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,300
They also sent a lot of people to catch us.

327
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
They made us so excited.

328
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
Don't say that I really remember.

329
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Also, Junior Lei, Wang Yu and the others.

330
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
We...

331
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,300
We turned over a pot of elixir that Fu Yingzi just made.

332
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Fu Yingzi is really a good person.

333
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,300
Fu Yingzi cried for a long time because of this.

334
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
He cried all his life.

335
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
This old man.

336
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
This was given by that demon just now.

337
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,300
I guess Fu Yingzi still hopes that you will keep it.

338
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,300
This old man has been causing trouble for a lifetime.

339
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
But I guess this favor

340
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
can't be returned.

341
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300
The battle between the two mountains.

342
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
The Huangfeng Valley is over.

343
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
You can't run anymore.

344
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
You're going to bite me?

345
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Senior Sister.

346
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Do you think you will still be able to draw and write like before?

347
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,300
This demon is not enough for me to kill.

348
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,300
Junior Brother,

349
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,300
you must not tell Senior Sister.

350
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,300
It's just a pity that the Huangfeng Valley is gone.

351
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
As long as we are still here,

352
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
the Huangfeng Valley will be here.

353
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,300
These people are too noisy.

354
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,300
Let Li Huayuan lead the way for Senior Sister.

355
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,300
Let's go home.

356
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,300
Let's go.

357
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,300
Let's go.

358
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Congratulations, Elder.

359
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,300
You finally destroyed the Huangfeng Valley.

360
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,300
My Baiyaoyuan.

361
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,300
This is not your Baiyaoyuan anymore.

362
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,300
There are some dead things underneath.

363
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,300
Moreover, you have already entered the tribe.

364
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,300
You should have put these things down earlier.

365
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,300
If the spirit of the dead is in the soil,

366
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,300
and conquers a piece of the soil,

367
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,300
what's the point of it for the Hehuan tribe?

368
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,300
I have already followed your wishes.

369
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,300
I can only let them go.

370
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,300
Leave this place to Wangchan to deal with it.

371
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,300
Wangchan definitely won't be as good as the mission.

372
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,300
That's right.

373
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,300
Did you catch the seven sects' remaining evil?

374
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,300
Replying to Elder, that kid is too lucky.

375
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:43,300
I really didn't expect that he would be saved by a Jidan from the Huangfeng Valley.

376
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,300
He could escape from such a death.

377
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Could it be that his fate is not decided yet?

378
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:00,300
Could it be that I really have to do it?

379
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:05,300
Elder, this... I can't let you go.

380
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:10,300
On the way to cultivation, you always have to find some magic stones for yourself.

381
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
That kid,

382
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,300
you should keep it.

383
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,300
Elder, don't worry.

384
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,300
He definitely won't be able to escape.

385
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,300
I hope Hanli can be safe and sound.

386
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,300
I hope you won't be killed by them.

387
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,300
Looks like he really has become your new demon.

388
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,300
He will seriously hinder your cultivation.

389
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,300
Father, please don't kill him.

390
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,300
Let him fight against Wangchan.

391
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,300
Elder.

392
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,300
Wife!

393
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,300
Wife!

394
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,300
Elder is here.

395
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,300
You are definitely going to die.

396
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,300
Elder, this is the Jidan that saved that kid.

397
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,300
Teacher.

398
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,300
Uncle.

399
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,300
Come back with me.

400
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,300
Junior, you go first.

401
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:19,300
This is the end of the world. It's just a death.

402
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,300
The Qingbo Cave of the Yellow Wind Valley is here.

403
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Please let the Yunu Patriarch come.

404
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,300
I don't know how to show my power.

405
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,300
The Yellow Wind Valley has been destroyed.

406
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,300
I have an appointment with the Spirit Lake.

407
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,300
The Yellow River flows.

408
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
The others retreat.

409
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,300
I won't retreat.

410
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,300
I won't retreat.

411
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,300
You are a Yuyun Xiu.

412
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,300
You dare not fight me?

413
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,300
Yunu Patriarch.

414
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Junior.

415
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,300
We can make a bet.

416
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,300
If I can force you to take the move,

417
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,300
even if I win,

418
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,300
you have to promise me to let Senior go.

419
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Junior, don't be silly.

420
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,300
You are not his opponent.

421
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300
It's my turn.

422
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Go.

423
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,300
Junior!

424
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,300
Junior!

425
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
Junior!

426
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Junior!

427
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
Junior!

428
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,300
No.

429
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,560
After so many years,

430
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,560
you still are still firm and heartless.

431
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,560
You don't want to change your mind?

432
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,060
After so many years,

433
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,680
you still think you're still the same.

434
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,100
You think everything in this world is yours.

435
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,140
That's right. You're right.

436
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,140
People like you,

437
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,140
for your own benefit,

438
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,140
you destroy people's families, kill people's relatives and friends,

439
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,140
and even talk to yourself here.

440
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,140
You're shameless!

441
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,140
Uncle, stop it.

442
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,140
Uncle Li, don't.

443
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,140
Don't hit him anymore.

444
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,140
Master,

445
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,140
Mother will be fine.

446
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,140
Stop it.

447
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,140
Stop being so stubborn. It's too late.

448
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,140
Xiao'er,

449
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,140
actually,

450
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,140
you look good in your old clothes.

451
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,140
Uncle.

452
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,140
In the past,

453
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,140
there was an old man

454
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,140
who taught me a lesson on the first day I entered the house.

455
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,140
He said that in this world,

456
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,140
the weak must be humble and obedient.

457
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:14,140
Only the strong can achieve their goals.

458
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:19,140
No matter it's status, power,

459
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
or strength,

460
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,140
even if it's someone else's life,

461
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,140
as long as you want it, you can take it.

462
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,140
This is the law and the law of the world.

463
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,140
If you want to live long,

464
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,140
you must understand this.

465
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,140
But if this world is all like this,

466
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:50,140
what's the point?

467
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,140
What?

468
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,140
The third one,

469
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,140
he's trying to improve his cultivation.

470
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,140
Are you crazy?

471
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,140
For the Yellow Wind Valley,

472
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,140
I'll give you another one.

473
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,140
Old man.

474
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,140
Old man.

475
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,140
I'm finally going to make you pay.

476
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,140
I won.

477
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,140
I won.

478
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,140
I won.

479
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,140
I won.

480
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,140
I won.

481
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,140
I won.

482
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,140
I won.

483
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,140
I won.

484
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,140
I won.

485
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,140
I won.

486
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,140
I won.

487
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
I won.

488
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,140
Junior.

489
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,140
Junior.

490
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
We won.

491
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,140
We can go home now.

492
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,140
Junior.

493
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,140
I'm Hongfu.

494
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,140
You must call me Senior Sister from now on.

495
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,140
Greetings, Senior Sister.

496
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,140
That day,

497
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,140
I held the whole world in my arms.

498
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
Junior.

499
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,140
Senior.

500
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,140
Senior.

501
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
Senior.

502
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,140
Senior.

503
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,140
I'm here.

504
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,140
Master.

505
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,140
Master.

506
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,140
Mother.

507
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,140
Senior is not here.

508
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,140
Come with us.

509
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Xun'er.

510
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,140
You've grown up.

511
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,140
From now on,

512
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,140
you go by yourself.

513
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,140
Mother.

514
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,140
Mother.

515
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Hua Yue.

516
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,140
We're going home.

517
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,140
Mother.

518
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,140
Hua Yue.

519
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,140
Hua Yue.

520
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,140
Hua Yue.

521
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,140
Take me home.

522
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,140
You're really leaving?

523
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,140
Huang Ronggu is no longer here.

524
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,140
Don't.

525
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,140
Don't.

526
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,140
Don't.

527
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,140
Don't, Father.

528
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,140
I'm sorry.

529
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,140
I'm sorry.

530
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,140
I'm sorry.

531
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,140
Hua Yue.

532
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,140
Hua Yue.

533
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,140
Did I

534
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,140
do something wrong?

535
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,140
I'm sorry.

536
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,140
I'm sorry.

537
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,140
I'm sorry.

538
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,140
I'm sorry.

539
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,140
I'm sorry.

540
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,140
I'm sorry.

541
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,140
I'm sorry.

542
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,140
I'm sorry.

543
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,140
I'm sorry.

544
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,140
I'm sorry.

545
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,140
I'm sorry.

546
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,140
I'm sorry.

547
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,140
I'm sorry.

548
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,140
I'm sorry.

549
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:01,140
This heart has never been heard

550
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,140
Standing still,

551
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,140
so busy

552
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,140
The so-called

553
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,140
mutual understanding

554
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:13,140
Should I make a choice?

555
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,140
This song is full of hope

556
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:22,140
We'll go our separate ways

557
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,140
Go away.

558
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,140
Because of death and fire,

559
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,140
I have nothing to do with it.

560
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,140
If you're not afraid,

561
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,140
then come to see me.

562
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,140
If you're not afraid,

563
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,140
then come to see me.

564
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,140
If you're not afraid,

565
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,140
then come to see me.

566
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,140
Master,

567
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,140
the news of the battle is coming.

568
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,140
The Yellow Wind Valley is surrounded by the evil.

569
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,140
How is the situation of the mountain king?

570
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,140
Lin Hu's ancestor

571
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,140
I'm going to the Imperial Garden to die in battle.

572
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,140
The Red Talisman Master is leaving.

573
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,140
Call a group of people and horses for me.

574
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,140
I'm going to the Imperial Palace to take a look.

575
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,140
Yes.

576
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,140
What's wrong?

577
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,140
The Sect Leader ordered yesterday

578
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,140
to capture the enemy

579
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,140
and make a great contribution.

580
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,140
But now, the old injury hasn't healed.

581
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,140
He told me to tell you

582
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,140
not to bother yourself with these things.

583
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,140
Senior Sister, he's determined

584
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,140
to make peace with the Demon Sect.

585
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,140
Don't be afraid.

586
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,140
How are the people from the Imperial Palace

587
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,140
and the disciples of the Lian Qi Qi?

588
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,140
Do they have their own way?

589
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,140
They left this time

590
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,140
in several groups.

591
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,140
One of them was replaced by the Red Talisman Master.

592
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,140
On the way, they were attacked by the Demon Sect.

593
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,140
Almost all of them were killed.

594
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,140
All of them were killed?

595
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,140
Can you really be sure?

596
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,140
These are all rumors.

597
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,140
I'm not sure either.

598
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,140
Do I really have to give you a glass of wine?

599
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,140
Pass on my order.

600
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,140
From now on, the entire Ye Yuan Sect

601
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,140
will help the disciples of the Huangfeng Valley

602
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,140
who are in trouble.

603
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,140
Next, I will be forced to cultivate.

604
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,140
Without my permission,

605
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,140
no one is allowed to come to me.

606
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,140
If this kid dies like this,

607
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,140
it will be too easy for him.

608
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,140
I have to go.

609
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,140
Damn it.

610
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,140
He deserves to be a sect leader.

611
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,140
He just got hurt

612
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,140
by the Red Talisman Master.

613
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,140
The Red Talisman Master

614
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,140
is here.

615
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,780
The red

616
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,140
is the lonely tree

617
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,140
that has withered for six years.

618
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,140
The leaves

619
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,140
are the green leaves

620
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,140
that have withered for six years.

621
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,140
The wind

622
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,140
is blowing

623
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,140
and the sword is fluttering.

624
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,140
The four sides

625
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,140
are like the eyes of a bird.

626
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,140
The four sides

627
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,140
are like the eyes of a bird.

628
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,140
The hands

629
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,140
are at the top

630
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,140
and have forgotten the time.

631
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,140
It's yesterday.

632
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,140
It's tomorrow.

633
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,140
It's yesterday.

634
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,140
It's tomorrow.

635
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,140
The three days of the sun

636
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,140
are not as good as the past.

637
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,140
The time

638
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,140
will also change.

639
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,140
All the promises

640
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,140
in the world

641
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,140
are just

642
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,140
these four years.

643
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,140
The four years

644
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,140
have passed

645
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,140
for thousands of years.

646
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,140
In the moment

647
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,140
that is called eternity.

648
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,140
In the moment

649
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,140
that is called eternity.
