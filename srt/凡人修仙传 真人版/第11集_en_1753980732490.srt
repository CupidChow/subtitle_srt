1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
The world is mine

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,040
You pass through the abyss

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,520
The longing for the city

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,000
Love is not cruel and dangerous

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,480
That eternity is also a moment

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,160
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,400
Don't laugh at me

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,600
The war alone is difficult, the world is full of love

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,120
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,360
I am ordinary

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,880
With a heart of good

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,720
The sofa is too short

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,960
Fate is dark and sad

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,200
Life and death are full of madness

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Youth and death are full

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,440
Come back and make the wish come true

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,040
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,280
The loyalty is not returned

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,080
Look forward to the coming spring

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,880
doctors

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,160
November

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,140
D쉬q

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,200
O Os Stupid

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,000
Doctor o

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,520
This is a Eric

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,000
Lets try it

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Doctor o

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Wait

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,880
Maybe you could give him a chance to Resist.

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,120
Then another one is willing to die.

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,880
How will you two die?

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,200
Yuani,

33
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,480
don't fight it off!

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:19,680
I uniformed with the

35
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,200
One.

36
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,480
Two.

37
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,920
Three.

38
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,200
Four.

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,520
Five.

40
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,000
Six.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,080
Seven.

42
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,160
Eight.

43
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,280
Nine.

44
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,320
Ten.

45
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,560
Eleven.

46
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,920
Twelve.

47
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,360
Eleven.

48
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Twelve.

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Thirteen.

50
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Twelve.

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Fifteen.

52
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Twelve.

53
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Twelve.

54
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Fifteen.

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Twelve.

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Twelve.

57
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Twelve.

58
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Twelve.

59
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Twelve.

60
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Twelve.

61
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Where is the person who did it?

62
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Let's talk about it later.

63
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,360
The wind moon is the wild wind moon of Tianxue Castle.

64
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Since you know it's me,

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
why don't you run away?

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
I'm scared.

67
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
I'm scared.

68
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm scared.

69
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Kid, I gave you a chance.

70
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Why don't you run away?

71
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,360
There's only one time to back up the enemy.

72
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
If I run away,

73
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
I'll be scared like her.

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,360
It's rare to meet a funny one.

75
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Then I'll play with you.

76
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm scared.

77
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
I'm scared.

78
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
I'm scared.

79
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
I'm scared.

80
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
I'm scared.

81
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm scared.

82
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
I'm scared.

83
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
I'm scared.

84
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
I'm scared.

85
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
I'm scared.

86
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
I'm scared.

87
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
I'm scared.

88
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
I'm scared.

89
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm scared.

90
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
I'm scared.

91
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
I'm scared.

92
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
I'm scared.

93
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
I'm scared.

94
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
I'm scared.

95
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
I'm scared.

96
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
I'm scared.

97
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
I'm scared.

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
I'm scared.

99
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
I'm scared.

100
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
I'm scared.

101
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
I'm scared.

102
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
I'm scared.

103
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
I'm scared.

104
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
I'm scared.

105
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
I'm scared.

106
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
I'm scared.

107
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
I'm scared.

108
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
I'm scared.

109
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm scared.

110
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
I'm scared.

111
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
I'm scared.

112
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm scared.

113
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
I'm scared.

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
I'm scared.

115
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm scared.

116
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
I'm scared.

117
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
I'm scared.

118
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
I'm scared.

119
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
I'm scared.

120
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
I'm scared.

121
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
I'm scared.

122
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
I'm scared.

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
I'm scared.

124
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
I'm scared.

125
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
I'm scared.

126
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
I'm scared.

127
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm scared.

128
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
I'm scared.

129
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
I'm scared.

130
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
I'm scared.

131
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
I'm scared.

132
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
I'm scared.

133
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
I'm scared.

134
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
I'm scared.

135
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
I'm scared.

136
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,360
I'm scared.

137
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
I'm scared.

138
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
I can't get out.

139
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,360
They found me.

140
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Many symbol houses,

141
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:08,160
and highlight the

142
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
opponents ,

143
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,380
and provide like a

144
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
leader.

145
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
him to meu tome

146
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,720
What is burning so badly.

147
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,120
What a pity that yellow umbrella.

148
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,480
What's this?

149
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,280
Forget it.

150
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,600
Let's keep it for now.

151
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
We'll study it when we get back.

152
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,340
Why is the

153
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,720
ability word empty?

154
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,680
Wow,

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
there's nothing in this room.

156
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,360
It's necessary.

157
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
It's not as quiet as I thought it was.

158
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,080
It's like a purple lotus.

159
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,680
Really?

160
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,280
There's another one over there.

161
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,680
Brothers, look!

162
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,880
There's a purple lotus here!

163
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,080
You're even greeting me?

164
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,480
You really don't treat her like an outsider?

165
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,680
This kind of remote place is really right.

166
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Although the forest grass here is rare,

167
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,480
no one is stealing it from me.

168
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,680
Look.

169
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,480
This is enough.

170
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,680
After we go back,

171
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,080
we'll take some to deliver the food.

172
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
The rest, we'll keep for ourselves.

173
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
But,

174
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,680
it's already been two days.

175
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,680
We must hurry and find that funeral medicine.

176
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,080
Purple lotus?

177
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Han Li!

178
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,080
Senior Sister Chen?

179
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
You're hurt.

180
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,480
Why is the Qingjiao Qi with you?

181
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,680
This is something from Lu Ming Yuan.

182
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
It's troublesome.

183
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
It was still seen.

184
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Senior Sister, you misunderstood.

185
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,480
My weapon is similar to the Qingjiao Qi.

186
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Misunderstanding?

187
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
Impossible.

188
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
It's impossible.

189
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
It's impossible.

190
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
It's impossible.

191
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
It's impossible.

192
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Impossible.

193
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,080
You saved me that day, right?

194
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,480
But you took my eggs.

195
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,480
So you don't dare to admit it, right?

196
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,280
You're poisoned now.

197
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,680
You might have seen some strange illusions.

198
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,080
I have a antidote here.

199
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,480
Senior Sister, take it quickly.

200
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
Or else,

201
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,480
you might not be able to survive and leave the forbidden area.

202
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,680
I'll wait until you're done with the antidote.

203
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,280
If there's anything else you want to ask,

204
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
I promise I'll answer it.

205
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
This antidote is really quite effective.

206
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,880
So can you say it now?

207
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,680
Even if you don't say it,

208
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,480
I know.

209
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,680
I know.

210
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
I'm sorry.

214
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
I'm sorry.

215
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:25,840
This

219
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
I'm tired. I'll rest for a while.

220
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Keep an eye on me.

221
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Don't worry.

222
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Senior Brother.

223
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,080
What's wrong?

224
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Huo'er.

225
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,080
Where's my jade water?

226
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
Who took the skill of blink?

227
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Go after them.

228
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Brother Han.

229
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,080
Who is it?

230
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Who's there?

231
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,280
I clearly saw her jump down.

232
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,280
Yunxiu.

233
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Old Seven.

234
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
Where is she?

235
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,080
I clearly saw her run this way.

236
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,680
How did she disappear?

237
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
That's strange.

238
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,080
Where could this kid have gone?

239
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,880
There's a path over there.

240
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Let's go and take a look.

241
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,080
Okay.

242
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,480
The hidden high-level magic weapon is really good.

243
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,680
Miss Han, thank you.

244
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
Why are you here?

245
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
It's all my fault.

246
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,280
I was just in the forbidden area.

247
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,680
The Chouwu Belt and map were stolen.

248
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,880
I don't know what to do.

249
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,480
I just have to find a place to hide.

250
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,080
This pill can restore your vitality.

251
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,480
Here, take it.

252
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
Thank you, Brother Han.

253
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
Actually,

254
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,280
when I first came in, I was afraid that it would kill me.

255
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
But if I can't find the Lianyang Flower,

256
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,080
my brother's illness...

257
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
I really can't think of any way.

258
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,280
Aren't those two from Mount Lingshuo your peers?

259
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,480
No, I don't know them.

260
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,480
You don't know them?

261
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,880
Didn't you come together?

262
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,880
When I was in Mount Lingshuo,

263
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,680
I've never seen them.

264
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,480
Brother Han, don't worry about me.

265
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,480
I have this hidden magic weapon.

266
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,080
I can definitely last for five days.

267
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,680
Go and find what you want.

268
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,080
It's too late.

269
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,480
You want to find Lianyang Flower?

270
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,480
You want to find Lianyang Flower, right?

271
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,080
Yes.

272
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,680
I came to the forbidden area to find Lianyang Flower.

273
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,280
I'll take you there.

274
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,080
That's great.

275
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,880
Thank you, Brother Han.

276
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
It's okay. We're on the way.

277
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Where can we find Lianyang Flower?

278
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,680
There's no Lianyang Flower on my map.

279
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,480
But it's said that most of the spirits in the forbidden area

280
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
can be found outside the center of the Mountain of Mars.

281
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,080
It's not a big deal.

282
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,680
Brother Han,

283
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
I'm sorry.

296
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
I'm sorry.

297
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
I'm sorry.

301
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
I'm sorry.

302
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
I'm sorry.

303
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I'm sorry.

305
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
I'm so sorry.

306
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
So sorry.

308
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
I'm so sorry.

309
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
So sorry.

310
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
I'm sorry.

311
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
So sorry.

312
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
So sorry.

313
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,280
I'm so sorry.

314
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,480
I'm so sorry.

315
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
I'm so sorry.

316
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,880
I'm sorry.

317
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,080
I'm so sorry.

318
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,280
You're right, Herong.

319
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
Brother Han.

320
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,280
The Flying Horse looks strange.

321
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,120
Looks like it's not братa interesting.

322
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,680
Yeah.

323
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,480
There's only one brother in the Lingshou Mountain

324
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
who has raised this kind of beast.

325
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,640
His name is Zhong Wu.

326
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,400
Zhong Wu?

327
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,840
If he knows

328
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,280
that we killed his spirit,

329
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,600
he won't let us off.

330
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,400
How about

331
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,760
we go around the road?

332
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,840
We don't have much time.

333
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,360
You two are so brave.

334
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,640
You killed my spirit.

335
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,160
How dare you come in and chat with me?

336
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,680
Zhong Wu,

337
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,680
just let us pass.

338
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,760
The spirits here

339
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,240
are all your fault.

340
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,560
It's useless to say that.

341
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,120
Come here if you have the ability.

342
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,920
Let's have a drawing.

343
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,400
Wait.

344
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,240
These shoes are

345
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,680
from Ta Yun Xue?

346
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
You mean the shoes of Feng Yue?

347
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,880
You mean the shoes of Feng Yue?

348
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,000
Yes.

349
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,760
Isn't it from Feng Yue?

350
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
He gave it to you with a bad smell?

351
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,920
What did he wear?

352
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,560
You know him.

353
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,280
But you don't know that

354
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,640
he wouldn't give the shoes to you.

355
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,040
You mean you killed the crazy Feng Yue

356
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,800
and stole his shoes?

357
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,760
What do you think?

358
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,360
I think

359
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,760
you have a good spirit.

360
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,880
Wait.

361
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,800
I haven't finished yet.

362
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Go back first.

363
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,400
Go back.

364
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,560
I haven't finished yet.

365
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,120
I think

366
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,720
what Junior Sister said is reasonable.

367
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,200
It's fate that we meet each other.

368
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,240
After the game,

369
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,120
can we

370
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,320
help each other?

371
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,840
Tell me.

372
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,240
The map.

373
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,320
The maps of the seven sects

374
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,480
are unique.

375
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,480
I have one.

376
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,560
There is a map of the forest.

377
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,520
You can consider

378
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
exchanging with me with the Yellow Wind Valley.

379
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,720
It's worth it.

380
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,160
The map of the forest?

381
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Miss Han has it too.

382
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,760
I don't need to see yours.

383
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,520
You have it?

384
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,360
I forgot.

385
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,200
I have it.

386
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
You have it?

387
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,200
How do I know it's real?

388
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,440
No.

389
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,480
I can lie to you.

390
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,080
How about this?

391
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,280
I'll add another one.

392
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,000
The one with the swan's nest.

393
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,920
One, two, one.

394
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,400
I'm good at making up.

395
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,680
I won't make so many

396
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,720
and not the same ones.

397
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,800
Right?

398
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,400
I agree.

399
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:17,920
How about this?

400
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
I'll count three numbers.

401
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,920
We exchange them at the same time.

402
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,280
Three, two, one.

403
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Two, one.

404
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,320
Didn't we agree on it?

405
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,200
Do you have faith?

406
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,320
They escaped again.

407
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,000
Brother Yu.

408
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,800
Where do you think they're going?

409
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,400
Who knows?

410
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,000
This guy is too fast.

411
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,720
It's you.

412
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Who do you think it is?

413
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,440
You two.

414
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,800
I'm the one who's going to kill you.

415
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,920
I'm the one who's going to kill you.

416
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,760
Where's my Snow Lotus?

417
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,160
Your job is done.

418
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,320
What else?

419
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,840
Except for the Snow Lotus,

420
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,880
we have the elite disciples

421
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,320
of the Seven Sects in our mission.

422
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,800
You two haven't forgotten, have you?

423
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,360
We two

424
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,200
are the lucky ones

425
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
of many people.

426
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,000
What about you?

427
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,920
I'm obviously

428
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,480
one of the people of Lin Shoushan.

429
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,880
It's not convenient to move my hands.

430
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
I'll depend on you.

431
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,200
I met

432
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,680
one man and one woman.

433
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,280
The woman is from Lin Shoushan.

434
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,560
The man is from Huangfeng Valley.

435
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,160
I saw them

436
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,760
talking about many spiritual things.

437
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,640
Speaking of this,

438
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,240
do you two have any ideas?

439
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,800
I'll give you another idea.

440
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,000
Can you

441
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,760
give them...

442
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,920
the spiritual grass?

443
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
And the three of us?

444
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,000
Do you understand?

445
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
What's the purpose of this?

446
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,120
To be tall and tall.

447
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,680
To be ordinary and unparalleled.

448
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,280
Unparalleled?

449
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,840
Where are they now?

450
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
That woman

451
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,760
is going to treat her brother.

452
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,720
So they are mostly

453
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,160
in the Liyang Cave

454
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,480
to find spiritual grass.

455
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,800
You must

456
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,320
ambush them before they do.

457
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,320
Their cultivation is very poor.

458
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,120
It's worse than what you think.

459
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,120
I can only help you here.

460
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,400
Everyone.

461
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,680
The disciples are dying

462
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,920
so fast that they're about to leave.

463
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,240
Didn't you notice?

464
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,360
The forbidden area has been changed

465
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,680
to a fake one.

466
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,160
The disciples will do their best

467
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,360
to take the spiritual grass.

468
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,160
The level of suicide

469
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
will be much higher than before.

470
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,200
Old Tao,

471
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,160
you're right.

472
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,360
We must be careful.

473
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,360
We must be careful.

474
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
We must be careful.

475
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
We must be careful.

476
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
We must be careful.

477
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
We must be careful.

478
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
We must be careful.

479
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
We must be careful.

480
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Old Tao.

481
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,280
We were all

482
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,600
like this before.

483
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
Don't worry.

484
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,240
Don't worry.

485
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
It's so dark.

486
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,160
I can't see anything.

487
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,320
If there is no

488
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,280
star and sign

489
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
guiding this place,

490
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
we will be lost.

491
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
What should we do?

492
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
It's the Yueyang Pearl.

493
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
Three days have passed.

494
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Yueyang Pearl

495
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,560
is the mysterious object

496
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,040
that is used to deal with the forbidden area.

497
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,920
With its help,

498
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,320
we won't go in any direction.

499
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
We found it.

500
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
It's in that direction.

501
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Yueyang Pearl

502
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
is so big.

503
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Run!

504
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,000
Let's see where you run to.

505
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Run!

506
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Don't you want the Yueyang Pearl?

507
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,520
I don't want you to get it!

508
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
No!

509
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,520
Yueyang Pearl!

510
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
Yueyang Pearl!

511
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
Why is it gone?

512
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
It's so dark.

513
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
The magic

514
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
is not the right way.

515
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,520
They are not from the Lin Shou Mountain.

516
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
Who are they?

517
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
Don't cry.

518
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
There is one more.

519
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Thank you.

520
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Brother,

521
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
I don't want to eat this cake.

522
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
I'll give it to you.

523
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
It's dangerous here.

524
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
Let's go.

525
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Brother Han,

526
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,520
how can I thank you?

527
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,520
When you go out,

528
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,520
give me some cakes.

529
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Cakes?

530
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
I don't want to eat it.

531
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
It's not far.

532
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Let's go.

533
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
We found

534
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
Purple River Flower

535
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,520
According to the map, this place should be here.

536
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Why is there no trace of the Zongying?

537
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,520
Could it be that the people who came here before stepped on the light?

538
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
There isn't much time left.

539
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Let's see if there are any immature and young seedlings here.

540
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,520
The sacred stone can't be pierced through.

541
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
Let's go.

542
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Let's hide.

543
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,520
This should be the stone temple in the record.

544
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,520
This place has the ability to isolate the sacred stone.

545
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
Everyone must be careful.

546
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,520
I will do my best.

547
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,520
Yu'er, Qing'er, you two stay and continue to look for the blood flower.

548
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,520
This concerns Yanru Yan's life

549
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,520
and the relationship between the Yu'an's family treasure.

550
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Don't be reckless.

551
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
Yes, teacher.

552
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,520
The others, follow me.

553
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,520
The blood flower can't be pierced through.

554
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,520
There is only one path along the way.

555
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,520
If we are surrounded here, we won't be able to escape.

556
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,520
No, we can't risk it.

557
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,520
Let's go look for it elsewhere.

558
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
Oh no, someone is here.

559
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
I'm scared.

560
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,520
I'm scared.

561
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,520
It's dead.

562
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,520
This is...

563
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
It's...

564
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Teacher, I heard that the black-leafed wolf in the underground palace is a monster.

565
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
Is it not safe?

566
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Don't panic.

567
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
Everything is according to plan.

568
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,520
I will take care of everything.

569
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Teacher, is there a blood flower here?

570
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
It's her.

571
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
It's here.

572
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,520
Everyone, listen to my order.

573
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Block this place immediately.

574
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,520
Be careful of the surroundings.

575
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,520
Take the formation.

576
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,520
Yes, teacher.

577
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
There is a blood flower.

578
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
We must use the knife to shoot it.

579
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Teacher, I'm scared.

580
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
I'm scared.

581
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,520
Teacher, I'm scared.

582
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
I'm scared.

583
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
I'm scared.

584
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
I'm scared.

585
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
I'm scared.

586
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
I'm scared.

587
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
I'm scared.

588
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
I'm scared.

589
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
I'm scared.

590
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,520
I'm scared.

591
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,520
I'm scared.

592
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
I'm scared.

593
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
I'm scared.

594
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
I'm scared.

595
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
I'm scared.

596
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
I'm scared.

597
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,520
I'm scared.

598
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
I'm scared.

599
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
I'm scared.

600
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
I'm scared.

601
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm scared.

602
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
I'm scared.

603
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,520
I'm scared.

604
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
I'm scared.

605
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,520
I'm scared.

606
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,520
I'm scared.

607
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
I'm scared.

608
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,520
I'm scared.

609
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,520
I'm scared.

610
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,520
I'm scared.

611
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
I'm scared.

612
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,520
I'm scared.

613
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,520
I'm scared.

614
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,520
I'm scared.

615
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
I'm scared.

616
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,520
I'm scared.

617
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
I'm scared.

618
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,520
I'm scared.

619
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,520
I'm scared.

620
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
I'm scared.

621
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,520
I'm scared.

622
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
I'm scared.

623
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,520
I'm scared.

624
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,520
I'm scared.

625
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
I'm scared.

626
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,520
Is it a black spiritual treasure?

627
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,520
Why is it different from the one in Tuo Yan's room?

628
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:24,720
Kim

629
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,620
Game is crowded

630
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,520
Each time has its own kind of problems

631
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
The seven sects are all useless.

632
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:46,360
I can't change my

633
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
pass.

634
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
Bring me 60 years of experience.

635
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,360
Yes.

636
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
The evil one's outer armor is hard.

637
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
The ordinary magic is not effective on him.

638
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
I order.

639
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
I order.

640
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
I order.

641
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
I order.

642
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
I order.

643
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
I order.

644
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360
I order.

645
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
I order.

646
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
I order.

647
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
I order.

648
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,360
I order.

649
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
I order.

650
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
I order.

651
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
I order.

652
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,360
squeak

653
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,620
squeak

654
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,120
squeak

655
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,360
자iversity

656
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,940
Family

657
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,040
This should be great

658
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,780
Keep shaking

659
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,860
itEPetto

660
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,320
can't

661
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,240
reset

662
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,040
Don't be scared

663
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,440
no

664
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,900
The charm of this scare

665
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,920
they should

666
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,580
like

667
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,320
No

668
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,240
They have no

669
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,740
radiance

670
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,740
It's really powerful.

671
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,740
It doesn't look that hard to deal with.

672
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,740
Grand Master, what beast is this?

673
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,740
No.

674
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,740
This isn't Black Threaded King.

675
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,740
It's a black rubber.

676
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,740
It's a black rubber.

677
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,740
It's a black rubber.

678
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,740
It's a black rubber.

679
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,740
It's a black rubber.

680
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,740
It's a black rubber.

681
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,740
It's a black rubber.

682
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,740
It's level two now.

683
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,740
Level two beast?

684
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,740
It's like the mid-level of the main game.

685
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,740
Are you going to give up the Heavenly Fiend Valley?

686
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,740
No need to panic.

687
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,740
Wang Yu!

688
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,740
Go!

689
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,740
You're not his opponents.

690
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,740
Master, the road is blocked!

691
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,740
The road is blocked?

692
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,740
I can't run away from this wall.

693
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,740
Go!

694
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,740
Wild beast!

695
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,740
Just one person?

696
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,740
Can you beat him?

697
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,740
If you don't come out, you won't be able to escape.

698
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,740
If I go out, I'll die.

699
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,740
No one can live if you hide.

700
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,740
Hurry up!

701
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,740
Hurry up!

702
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,740
Run!

703
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,740
Hurry up!

704
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,740
You're a good move.

705
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,740
You didn't come out even after hiding for so long.

706
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,740
I'm afraid you'll kill others to get the treasure.

707
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,740
You're so young and thoughtful.

708
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,740
Aren't you afraid you won't be able to make friends in the future?

709
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,740
If I'm not thoughtful enough,

710
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,740
I don't know how many times I've died on this road.

711
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,740
What's the future?

712
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,740
I don't have much resources.

713
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,740
This stone pillar won't hold him for long.

714
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,740
What are you doing?

715
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,740
Hurry up and use it!

716
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,740
I do have another treasure.

717
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,740
What are you waiting for?

718
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,740
Hurry up!

719
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,740
Senior, I don't have time to steal the treasure.

720
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,740
You have to help me get rid of it.

721
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,740
I'll do my best, but you have to lure him away first.

722
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,740
Are you ready?

723
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,740
Do you see how I'm ready?

724
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,740
Why don't you do it?

725
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,740
I'm ready.

726
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,740
I'm ready.

727
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,740
I'm ready.

728
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,740
I'm ready.

729
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,740
I'm ready.

730
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,740
Now you feel like you're being cornered and shut off by others.

731
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,740
You're right.

732
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,740
There's season 2.

733
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,740
YoYo English Channel YouTube

734
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,740
Hurry up.

735
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,740
Golden dot is at the bottom of our treasure.

736
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,740
It definitely won't come.

737
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,740
Even though

738
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,740
there is a little bit of motion when we're iotng,

739
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,740
it's not all green.

740
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,740
Ready?

741
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,740
Give me a warning.

742
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,740
This is my last resort.

743
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,740
Hurry up!

744
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,740
The evil beast, get down!

745
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,740
This evil beast's power is amazing.

746
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,740
I can't hold on anymore.

747
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,740
Hurry up!

748
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,740
I'm already very fast.

749
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,740
Hurry up!

750
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,740
Hurry up!

751
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,740
Hurry up!

752
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,740
Hurry up!

753
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,740
Hurry up!

754
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:08,740
Looking back, it's absurd.

755
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,740
The sound of the flute, the loneliness, the books and books.

756
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:17,740
The regretful thoughts, the hope and the words.

757
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,740
The past, the present.

758
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:28,740
The wind rises and blows.

759
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:34,740
The changes in the four sides are like the eyes.

760
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:41,740
Looking back, I've already forgotten the time.

761
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:48,740
It's yesterday, it's tomorrow.

762
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,740
The three days of the sea of sun don't repeat the past.

763
00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:01,740
The time will also erase all the promises in time.

764
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:07,740
Only this moment,

765
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:17,740
in the moment of eternity.
