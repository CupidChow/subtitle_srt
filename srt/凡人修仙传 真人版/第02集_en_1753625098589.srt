Episode 15

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't you think it's weird?

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We've been together for so long.

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We never knew he could do martial arts.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Everyone has secrets.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Besides, we didn't tell him about that little green screen.

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Does he really treat you as his own son?

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're still suspicious of him.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I've been practicing the Fist of the Deity for so long.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I've been beaten up and beaten up so many times.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What can I say?

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Is that the same?

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He killed someone!

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Wu Yan is from the Wild Wolf Gang.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He's a traitor from the Qixuan Sect.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He should be killed.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And Master did it to save you.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's even weirder.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Am I that important?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Of course you're important.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Master gave you the best.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He taught you to learn to read and write.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It can't be that he's hurting you.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's raining.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sleep.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Zhang Tian.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Zhang Tian.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Did I think too much?

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Are you really going to think about it?

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Your cultivation hasn't improved.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It does have a lot to do with the effects of the medicine.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So I've been thinking for a long time.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I've decided to find good medicine for you.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But your body can't eat.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How about I go with you?

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No, no, no.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Zhang Tian, stay at home.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Take care of Hanli's cultivation.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When I come back, if there's no progress,

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll give you good fruits.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Go back.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't walk.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Go.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
More than a year after that,

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Doctor Mo often went down the mountain to find medicine.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's been two or three months since he left.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Everything seems to be back to the same calm.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Senior Li.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm Hanli.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Senior Li, your illness...

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Your illness is very strange.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I can only seal your acupoint temporarily with the silver needle.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Have you eaten any medicine before?

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I...

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I've been...

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I've been...

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I've been...

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I've been...

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I've been...

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I've been...

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I've been...

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've been...

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I've been...

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I've been...

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've been...

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I've been...

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,880
Nirvana

71
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,300
As athose 30 rare qu Letter Ni

72
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
It's this.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,880
Once you take it, it will cause pain in your bone,

74
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,560
causing your tongue to be numb.

75
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,240
This medicine can stimulate the frontal energy

76
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,400
and improve your power.

77
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,200
But the biggest problem is that

78
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,560
it will kill you

79
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,680
and it will have a huge side effect.

80
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,840
I suggest you stop taking this medicine.

81
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,920
If you keep taking it,

82
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,680
you will only live for ten years.

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,720
Give me a reason not to kill you.

84
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,920
I saved your life.

85
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,800
Isn't that a reason?

86
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,000
To be honest,

87
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,960
I thought about it before I saved you.

88
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,880
I might be killed by you.

89
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,040
But I didn't expect

90
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,920
you to turn around so quickly.

91
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,440
I swear

92
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,480
I won't tell anyone about this.

93
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,960
Swear is like farting.

94
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,320
Swear is like farting.

95
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,320
Senior, you must know

96
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,320
I'm a disciple of Dr. Mo.

97
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,440
He has many disciples.

98
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,880
It doesn't matter if he closes the door or not.

99
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,680
It does.

100
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,080
I learned medicine from him.

101
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,080
I can help you

102
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,240
with your illness.

103
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,360
This medicine is very effective.

104
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,360
It will cause pain in your bone.

105
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
It's better to die than to live.

106
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,840
Even if I can't save your life,

107
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,840
I can help you feel better.

108
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,480
Is it true?

109
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,320
All your teachers

110
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:50,200
are survey leaders with Robber's

111
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,800
isolated ability.

112
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,560
You saved my life today

113
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,560
and swore to keep my life.

114
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,400
I owe you a favor.

115
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,080
I'll put the demon together in three days

116
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,840
and meet you here.

117
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
It's a deal.

118
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,040
I won't break my promise.

119
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,520
I almost got into the mountain

120
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,840
and won't do anything again.

121
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,520
But as Li Fei Yu said,

122
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,560
Master has many disciples.

123
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,960
Why haven't I met anyone else here?

124
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,560
Zhang Jian.

125
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,800
You're back.

126
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,320
I...

127
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,520
Why are you sweating?

128
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,480
I'm not in a hurry to eat.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,880
It's good that you're done.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,280
What are you cooking today?

131
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,400
Water, steel, gold and rice.

132
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,520
They're all the same.

133
00:09:49,600 --> 00:10:16,880
Esta

134
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Who are you?

135
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,220
All of you need to read this bGSD British Greezz dim USDB Excel agreement.

136
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,200
You've been here design for a day and a night.

137
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,080
Do you know that?

138
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,540
You've been here when I went out to chop firewood.

139
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,480
You're also here when I came back for dinner.

140
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,700
I've slept an entire day, and you're still here?

141
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,380
You won't move at all.

142
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:34,920
If I didn't sc 재�rop

143
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,660
Your nose would've died.

144
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,640
That long?

145
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,380
I kept getting this food featured for several times.

146
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,160
No, no, I'm not lying.

147
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,800
I don't want to go

148
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,280
then

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,560
So fast

150
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,560
I don't feel hungry at all.

151
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,400
Is it the merit of the mouth?

152
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,320
They say the immortal won't feel hungry.

153
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Hanlin!

154
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,680
Hanlin, hurry up!

155
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,800
Hanlin!

156
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Hurry up!

157
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,280
Hanlin!

158
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,920
Master is dying!

159
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Hurry up!

160
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,880
I don't know how to use the art.

161
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,520
Master!

162
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,080
Master is dying!

163
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
Master!

164
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,360
Master!

165
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,120
Master!

166
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Hurry up!

167
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,680
Hanlin, hurry up!

168
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,560
Go get some water!

169
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,920
Master!

170
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,160
Cai Huan, is that you?

171
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,480
Master, it's me.

172
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,520
I'm Hanlin.

173
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,400
It's okay.

174
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,120
It's okay.

175
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,760
I...

176
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,280
You'll be fine after you take the medicine.

177
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,040
I...

178
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,560
Master.

179
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,240
Hanlin.

180
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm here.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,760
I'm here.

182
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,680
I'm here.

183
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,280
I'm here.

184
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,120
Master, you caught me.

185
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,320
Oh my god.

186
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,480
We're on the third floor of the map.

187
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,080
I don't know.

188
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,480
When I was cultivating,

189
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,360
I was just lost.

190
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,560
I had a dream.

191
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,960
In my dream,

192
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,440
I had a black nest in my belly.

193
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,440
I could absorb the spirit energy.

194
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
This is the third floor.

195
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,320
What?

196
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,560
It's not a dream.

197
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,600
Zhang Tian!

198
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,240
Go!

199
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,360
On your right,

200
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,200
on your left,

201
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,960
on the third floor,

202
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,960
there's a small box

203
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,960
and a small white vase.

204
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,000
Go get it!

205
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,360
I'll go.

206
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,840
It's not a dream.

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,080
It's not a dream.

208
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:36,160
Finally,

209
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,680
I'm so happy.

210
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,240
That's called invitation.

211
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,240
That's called Mitte..

212
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,000
Your father's ill gone.

213
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,040
Even Li Feiyu knows

214
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,680
the evil power of the Chousui Bay.

215
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,800
Master has a chance to save you.

216
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,280
Master.

217
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,920
My good disciple.

218
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,640
My good disciple.

219
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
My good disciple.

220
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
My good disciple.

221
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm tired.

222
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,120
God doesn't help me.

223
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,200
He doesn't help me.

224
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Master's eyes

225
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,720
are full of an uneasy desire.

226
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,240
It's like

227
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,000
he's not looking at a living person,

228
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,080
but at something.

229
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,000
Master.

230
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,840
I'm gradually losing five sensei.

231
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,440
Don't talk too much.

232
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,800
You understand?

233
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:58,800
One day in a lifetime,

234
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,640
if I become a Spectre,

235
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:09,840
One day in a lifetime,

236
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,360
one day and so on.

237
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,000
Thank you, Brother Han.

238
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,880
What do you mean?

239
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,120
This medicine is made of the West Bull's Feet.

240
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,840
You can pay me two taels

241
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,560
for the other expenses.

242
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,400
What about next month?

243
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Senior Brother Li is free.

244
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,360
You can use other things to pay me.

245
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,280
I think

246
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,680
your knife is good.

247
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
This one is not good.

248
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,880
Then I can only use my kindness to pay you back.

249
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
You are so kind.

250
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,800
Then you can come to me anytime.

251
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,880
I'll cut two tears for you.

252
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,640
Why do you want to eat this bamboo shoot?

253
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,600
I want to stand firm in this world.

254
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,160
I need some means.

255
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,960
I used to think life is short.

256
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,040
I don't fight for years, I only fight for joy.

257
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,080
What I want

258
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,160
is not important.

259
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,720
But now I feel...

260
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,320
I won't say more.

261
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,760
I'll take this medicine.

262
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,600
See you next month.

263
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,760
You don't fight for years, you only fight for joy.

264
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,800
What do you want to fight for?

265
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,840
Let go of me.

266
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,380
I am afraid you can't save yourself.

267
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,140
Singapore,

268
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,140
don't fight for anything.

269
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,480
Jerry,

270
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,680
are we at home?

271
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,280
No.

272
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,360
No hands behaviors come out of us,

273
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,660
we should protect our life.

274
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
Look at our lives.

275
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,700
There are too little others.

276
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,500
In the future,

277
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,140
always the world,

278
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,220
Three of us,

279
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,100
drink a few bottles.

280
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,500
Okay.

281
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,380
Master,

282
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
take care of yourself.

283
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,980
Just one sip, I can't die.

284
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,820
Pour it on Master first.

285
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,180
Then pour it on Hanli.

286
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,220
Zhang Tie, drink one.

287
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,780
Co MacBook,

288
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:37,980
için торo!

289
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,140
Durian and Zhang Tie,

290
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,300
let's toast Master!

291
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,180
May Master serve our Dongha

292
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,860
and help yourself to his demolition!

293
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,940
Get rich soon.

294
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,100
Please get rich soon!

295
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,540
Do you even need to do that every single day?

296
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:01,900
Master,

297
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,540
Master,

298
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,740
Zhang Di has been in the Shenzhou Valley for four years.

299
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:25,780
You taught me the

300
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:38,980
Master, I'm sorry.

301
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,880
Just let him go back.

302
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,380
I don't want to pretend to be a mother and raise him like a child.

303
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,580
Master, come back soon.

304
00:18:47,580 --> 00:19:13,880
I'm hungry.

305
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,780
If you don't see me when you get up tomorrow morning,

306
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:25,680
you can go down the mountain immediately and don't come back.

307
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,180
Zhang Di.

308
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,880
Zhang Di.

309
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:23,380
Imigrant Beggar

310
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,500
From today,

311
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:50,460
I'll have you

312
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:09,460
Master's pulse is

313
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,940
nothing short of a doctor's trouble.

314
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,460
His pulse comes back to normal

315
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:23,260
every

316
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:29,660
I should know how cruel the body is better than you.

317
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,460
Come on, kid.

318
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,260
Today, you keep drinking.

319
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,260
I'm happy for you.

320
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:51,260
So I have something to say.

321
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,260
I'll be honest with you.

322
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,260
You don't treat people well.

323
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,260
Do you know how old I am?

324
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,260
About 60 to 70.

325
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,860
30 is a strange number.

326
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,260
I don't believe it.

327
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:56,260
You can ask the third uncle of the disciple of Qixuan Sect.

328
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:06,460
He must have heard of the

329
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,460
I am the woodman.

330
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,460
I was as young as you.

331
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
At that time, there was no disease I couldn't cure.

332
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,460
No poison I couldn't cure.

333
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,460
But I can save the world.

334
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:35,460
But I can save the world.

335
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,460
I can't save myself.

336
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,460
I was harmed by the evil.

337
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,460
I can't save my life with this medical skill.

338
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,460
I can't cure the body of this cruel woman.

339
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,460
You can't cure me.

340
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,460
I don't know what to do.

341
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,460
You can't cure me.

342
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,460
I have to go.

343
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,460
I have to go.

344
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,460
I have to go.

345
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,460
This medicine can support me for a year.

346
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,460
But god has a will.

347
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,460
He let me find a way to recover.

348
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,460
What way?

349
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,460
You.

350
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,460
Me?

351
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,460
Now only you can save me.

352
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,460
I've been raising you for so long.

353
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,460
It's time for you to be a good man.

354
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,460
Don't be excited.

355
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,460
Don't be excited.

356
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,460
Lan Li.

357
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:19,460
You've been asking me what's the use of a mouth.

358
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,460
I'll come to you right now.

359
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,460
I need someone to train the mouth to the fourth level.

360
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:36,460
I need someone to train the mouth to the fourth level.

361
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,460
Not only can I cure the body,

362
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,460
I can also be a child.

363
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,460
So you chose me.

364
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,460
What?

365
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,460
I didn't choose you.

366
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,460
The mouth chose you.

367
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,460
The mouth needs a lot of chance to train the mouth.

368
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,460
I can't even be trained.

369
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,460
Before you, I chose dozens of children.

370
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,460
None of them had the luck to have you.

371
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:20,460
Without you, I'd have to die.

372
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,460
Everyone would die.

373
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,460
But with you,

374
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,460
I'd have to catch the grass that saved my life.

375
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,460
It's the same for everyone.

376
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,460
So, as long as you cure me,

377
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,460
I can give you everything in the valley.

378
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,460
What? What? What?

379
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
What's wrong?

380
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
You were so good when you were a teacher.

381
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,460
You're regretting it now?

382
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,460
I won't lie to you or betray you.

383
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,460
But...

384
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Why haven't you mentioned it before?

385
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,460
You haven't been studying for years.

386
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,460
I'm teaching you 16 words.

387
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,460
The bridge is a table.

388
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,460
The name is clear.

389
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,460
The feeling is clear.

390
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,460
The body is a body.

391
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,460
This is my way of doing things.

392
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,460
There are some things

393
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,460
that I can explain to you clearly.

394
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:47,460
But you still have to stay until today.

395
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,460
You can't fix the fourth floor.

396
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,460
You should know how hard it is to fix the mouth.

397
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,460
From the second floor to the third floor,

398
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,460
it took me two years.

399
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,460
Now it's obviously not working.

400
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,460
It's harder to fix the fourth floor in a year.

401
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,460
Enough.

402
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,460
I'm discussing it with you.

403
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,460
Keep practicing your mouth.

404
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,460
I'll find you some precious herbs.

405
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,460
Don't mention it again.

406
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,460
Or that sentence,

407
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,460
you have to fix the fourth floor in a year.

408
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,460
The fourth floor.

409
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,460
The fourth floor.

410
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,460
The fourth floor.

411
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,460
The fourth floor.

412
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,460
The fourth floor.

413
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,460
The fourth floor.

414
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,460
The fourth floor.

415
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,460
The fourth floor.

416
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
The fourth floor.

417
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,460
The fourth floor.

418
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,460
The fourth floor.

419
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,460
The fourth floor.

420
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,460
The fourth floor.

421
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,460
The fourth floor.

422
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
It's just like waves,

423
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,460
leaving us with our own lives.

424
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,460
Do you remember who was in it?

425
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,460
Fiery風 reminded us that

426
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,460
kitabemuth had occurred to us.

427
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,460
It was our mortal moo of witchcraft.

428
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,460
I remember

429
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,460
while we were living in it.

430
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,460
A Stillborn W Anatomy

431
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,460
to war with all the travel었

432
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,580
Don't feel sad

433
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,020
If you can't help it,

434
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,000
you take her first.

435
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,360
All is clear today.

436
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,100
I think

437
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,240
on some occasions

438
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,780
Is through AssistanceSee.

439
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,680
The change of good master

440
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:34,600
we rely on taking

441
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,900
go down the mountains and offices.

442
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,580
I...

443
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,580
You're drunk, right?

444
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,580
He's already got a backup.

445
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,580
It wasn't easy to get him last night.

446
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,580
If he runs away, it's over.

447
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,580
I'm going to...

448
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,580
get him.

449
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,580
I can't.

450
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,580
Why not?

451
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,580
His cultivation is not enough.

452
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,580
You're a bandit.

453
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,580
Do you want to die like me?

454
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,580
You're a bandit.

455
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
You're a bandit.

456
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,580
Do you want to die like me?

457
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,580
You don't have time to find a disciple

458
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,580
who can rest in Changchun Palace like him.

459
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,580
I have to wait.

460
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,580
You should feel it too.

461
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,580
My body is about to be unable to hold on.

462
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,580
Unable to hold on?

463
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,580
It's still possible even if you can't hold on.

464
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,580
I'm a disciple of the Immortal School.

465
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:40,580
Are you asking me to die with you?

466
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,580
I have to wait.

467
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,580
At most, for a year,

468
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,580
I'll do it no matter if he's able to cultivate to the fourth level.

469
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,580
Go.

470
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
Go.

471
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,580
Go.

472
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,580
Go.

473
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,580
Zhang Jian.

474
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,580
Zhang Jian.

475
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,580
Master.

476
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,580
Come in.

477
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,580
Master, where's Zhang Tie?

478
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,580
Zhang Tie?

479
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,580
Did they tell you that he's going down the mountain?

480
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,580
Going down the mountain?

481
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,580
He asked me for ten taels of silver

482
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,580
and said he wanted to go down the mountain.

483
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,580
Impossible.

484
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,580
He'll tell me wherever he goes.

485
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,580
I just told you the truth.

486
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,580
Why would I lie to you again?

487
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,580
Zhang Tie won't leave without saying goodbye.

488
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,580
Even if he goes down the mountain,

489
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,580
you must know his whereabouts.

490
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,580
If you don't say it,

491
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,580
I'll go down the mountain to find him.

492
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,580
You're indeed the third level.

493
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,580
You can actually see my actions.

494
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,580
It seems that my medicine is not wasted.

495
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,580
I just want to help you sell your body.

496
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,580
I'll go.

497
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,580
Come, good disciple.

498
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,580
I just want to talk to you.

499
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,580
Come.

500
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,580
Come, these past years,

501
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,580
do you miss home?

502
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,580
You once mentioned to me

503
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,580
that you miss the little girl in Qingliu Town.

504
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,580
Master, actually you don't have to

505
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,580
make such a big deal.

506
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,580
You just need to say,

507
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,580
Han Li, I need you to help me.

508
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,580
That's enough.

509
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,580
Although I'm not a big character,

510
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,580
I know how to revenge.

511
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,580
Why do you still force me?

512
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,580
I know you're smart,

513
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,580
secretive,

514
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,580
and hard to control.

515
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,580
But you have too many basics.

516
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,580
And this basic is the biggest weakness of us.

517
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,580
I don't let you build Zhangtie,

518
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,580
because of this.

519
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,580
Or that sentence,

520
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,580
if you can really save my life,

521
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,580
I'll keep you rich and prosperous.

522
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,580
Let's see.

523
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,580
Let's see if I go to the earth first,

524
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,580
or you,

525
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,580
or your real dream.

526
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,580
Okay.

527
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,580
After a year, I'll go to the fourth grass,

528
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,580
to help you clear the soil.

529
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,580
You tell me Zhangtie's whereabouts.

530
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,580
And,

531
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,580
you don't have much medicinal grass.

532
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,580
I'll clear more soil.

533
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,580
You just focus on cultivating.

534
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,580
I'll go to the earth to help you.

535
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,580
Wait.

536
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,580
Eat this.

537
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,580
You're not gewoon because of what?

538
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,580
Why should I?

539
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,580
Tomorrow, today,

540
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,580
I hope you remember the promise you made today.

541
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,180
You don't care about your life.

542
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,460
Why do you ask?

543
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,180
I hope you can remember

544
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,340
your promise today.

545
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,180
As I expected,

546
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,380
all the love

547
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,820
are all because of that day.

548
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,500
They are not the same.

549
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,260
Now,

550
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,980
Doctor Mo has given up all the worries.

551
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,100
He often goes out to collect herbs.

552
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,460
But every time he comes back,

553
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,780
his vital energy is reduced a little.

554
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,620
Why did it become like this?

555
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,300
Or,

556
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,660
the truth is always like this.

557
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,420
The previous years,

558
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,380
the previous intention

559
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,140
is fake.

560
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,780
I tried many ways

561
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,380
to cure the poison he gave me.

562
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:36,940
It seems that I can only

563
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,540
get to the fourth level.

564
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:39,980
But,

565
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,300
how easy is it?

566
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,260
Zhang Tian,

567
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,060
no matter where you are,

568
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,100
I will find you.

569
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,100
It seems that this little green bottle

570
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,100
hasn't moved for a while.

571
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,740
The faraway land is still in control.

572
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:22,780
This is

573
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,980
the horn that traveled the riding blamed last night.

574
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,220
Really.

575
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,980
But this deal is...

576
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,900
Is it drinkable?

577
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,320
Left, right.

578
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,580
Cultivating, cultivating.

579
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,140
Stop looking, leave now.

580
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,300
Why didn't you answer me?

581
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,740
I...

582
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,020
Where's the rabbit?

583
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,260
Why isn't it leaving now?

584
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,520
さく zone

585
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,240
famous

586
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,680
unforgettable

587
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,060
emerge

588
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,040
Jenna

589
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,820
is that you

590
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,500
What's in the bottle?

591
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,980
Is this poison?

592
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,980
Why is it growing so fast?

593
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,100
Is it this bowl of water?

594
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,520
You're just small,

595
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,520
go을l it be useless.

596
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,980
The familiar one

597
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:19,980
has dead…)

598
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,980
let's check it next.

599
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,740
You can go.

600
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,940
Theirl I'm thinking about them.

601
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,540
They...

602
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,220
It's...

603
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,240
There you are,niazi

604
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,640
Danko

605
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,820
The age of another gilt

606
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,740
has changed

607
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,540
stores

608
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,900
Un economies

609
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,000
The wlia

610
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,360
is related to

611
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,480
the access for trains

612
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,900
Animals and buildings are no match

613
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,100
But the night is limited.

614
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,660
I have to absorb the moonlight at night.

615
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,780
From now on,

616
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,300
I'll use water to absorb it

617
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,900
like I did last time.

618
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,700
And I'll find a place where there's no one.

619
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,460
I'll make a lot of paper,

620
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,020
make a lot of pills,

621
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,860
and take a lot of medicine.

622
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,940
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

623
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,860
The night is limited.

624
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,580
I have to absorb the moonlight at night.

625
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,500
I'll make a lot of paper,

626
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,060
make a lot of pills,

627
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,860
and take a lot of medicine.

628
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,020
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

629
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,860
I'll make a lot of paper,

630
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,340
make a lot of pills,

631
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,980
and take a lot of medicine.

632
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,140
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

633
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,780
I'll make a lot of paper,

634
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,260
make a lot of pills,

635
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,980
and take a lot of medicine.

636
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,100
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

637
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,220
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

638
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,820
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

639
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,300
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

640
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,700
Did you see him?

641
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,220
He's practicing martial arts.

642
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,100
That's good.

643
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,100
It seems that he's going to die.

644
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,900
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

645
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,900
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

646
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,900

I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

666
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,580
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

669
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,580
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

670
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,580
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

671
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,580
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

672
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,580
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

673
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,580
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

674
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,580
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

675
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,580
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

676
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,580
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

677
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,580
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

678
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,580
I'm afraid this is the key to my comeback.

679
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,920
In the vast forest,

680
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,260
there's something on the mountain.

681
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,780
I don't know why.

682
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,580
Would Conquer Heaven be under my control?

683
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,580
I shouldn't be here alone.

684
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,980
What should I do with the rest of the people?

685
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,220
Do you still remember these heroes?

686
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,080
I think that's enough.

687
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,120
World commandosPoint Wohlis

688
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,020
should inculcate Invisibility Star and Fruitigen

689
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:28,240
and let us have the Bujie and Sparrow Comp 입i

690
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:02,860
No.

691
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,420
If this goes on,

692
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,420
we'll be exposed to the poison tonight.

693
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,260
We must move the body as soon as possible.

694
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,660
Is this the fourth floor?

695
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,620
Only when we reach the fourth floor

696
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,020
can we experience

697
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,580
the wonderful place of the Unknown.

698
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,380
We can sense the breath of everything in the world.

699
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,420
No.

700
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,260
It's not enough to just sense it.

701
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:16,660
["Guan digging"]

702
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,580
It's not enough.

703
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,140
is still not enough.

704
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,100
I can't even fight against Doctor Mo

705
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,980
with my sense of duty.

706
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,100
I must be stronger.

707
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,300
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

708
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,380
Senior, you're so fast.

709
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,020
You should have arrived earlier.

710
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,620
This is too fierce.

711
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,500
It's not suitable for me.

712
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,420
Do you have a little

713
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,940
more gentle and subtle martial arts?

714
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,100
I do.

715
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:15,500
Junior Han,

716
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,180
tell me honestly.

717
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,020
Did you offend someone?

718
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,860
If someone wants to hurt you,

719
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,660
tell me.

720
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,060
I won't let him bully you.

721
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,780
You can't help anyone for the rest of your life.

722
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,940
You're a doctor.

723
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,260
Your master never taught you

724
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,060
how to deal with bad people.

725
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,940
You should use poison.

726
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:39,740
You're right.

727
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,500
This is a way.

728
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,540
But there are always

729
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,780
many ways to deal with the enemy.

730
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:49,700
Tell me.

731
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,100
What do you want to practice?

732
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,420
The technique of the chopsticks.

733
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,500
The secret technique.

734
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,260
And the best way

735
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,420
to defeat the enemy without using the real weapon.

736
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,020
For example,

737
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,220
the Luoyan cloth.

738
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,660
Luoyan cloth?

739
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,700
So you want to learn my best skill.

740
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,380
Just tell me if you want to teach me.

741
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,500
Don't think that I'm good at it.

742
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,220
Just think that this skill is very simple.

743
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,820
I spent five years

744
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,180
to force him to know it.

745
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,380
I don't have much time.

746
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,380
But I still want to learn your skill.

747
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,900
It seems that you won't give up

748
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,620
if I don't teach you a few moves.

749
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:35,900
