1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,520
♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫

2
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,120
♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,193
♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫

4
00:00:29,193 --> 00:00:32,520
♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,160
♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,080
♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,000
♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,960
♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,920
♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,289
♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫

12
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,573
♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,240
♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,600
♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,720
♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,000
♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,160
♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,175
♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,968
♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫

20
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:33,580
♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫

21
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,270
How did scum like him
end up in Yellow Maple Valley?

22
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,240
And yet the Foundation Pill
has fallen into his hands.

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,235
He deserves to die.

24
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:51,984
But his cultivation is higher than mine.

25
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:53,600
I doubt I stand a chance against him.

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,350
This is a Joyful Union Pill,

27
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,290
refined with lust poison
extracted from a Level 2 demon beast.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,540
Here.

29
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,960
I'm curious to see what becomes of you

30
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,130
after swallowing this.

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,840
Hey, you've been lurking long enough.

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,780
Time to show yourself.

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,030
It's you.

34
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,200
I've been waiting for the chance to eliminate you.

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
And now, you come straight to me.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,530
I'll have to fight him.

37
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,480
Turns out you're not just a thief,

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,570
but a pervert as well.

39
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,060
Come!

40
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,060
Wind Barrier!

41
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,630
It's useless.

42
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,520
This banner is powered by a mid-grade gem.

43
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,240
Its spiritual power never runs out.

44
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,150
Your artifact isn't fully refined.

45
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,150
It's no better than an ordinary weapon.

46
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,060
Still want to fight me?

47
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,780
Swift Travel Talisman!

48
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,800
No wonder it costs 50 gems a sheet.

49
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,310
The speed boost is incredible.

50
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,930
Thanks for the tip.

51
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,020
So all I have to do
is wield it like a normal weapon.

52
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,680
Wait, this is mine.

53
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,240
Even the box is the same.

54
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,480
So Ye sold it to him.

55
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,489
The Foundation Pill

56
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,639
has finally been returned to its rightful owner.

57
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,210
I'll take this one

58
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,580
as compensation.

59
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,820
Senior Chen.

60
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,780
Senior, please behave yourself!

61
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,000
Your clothes... Your clothes are loose!

62
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,120
Your clothes are loose!

63
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,190
Please compose yourself!

64
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,340
Now!

65
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,120
That scoundrel drugged you.

66
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,140
Come back to your senses!

67
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,970
Senior!

68
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,950
Even if I stepped in to do the right thing,

69
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,360
killing a fellow disciple
is still a serious offense.

70
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,940
I'm not the kind of person
who'd silence someone through murder.

71
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,070
So, Senior Chen,
you'll have to take an Oblivion Pill.

72
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:02,090
Once you swallow it, you'll forget everything
that happened today,

73
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,650
including my presence.

74
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,940
Ni Chang, any news about Ru Yan?

75
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,630
I heard from the Yan clan

76
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,310
that she still hasn't woken up.

77
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,750
But they're looking for the Blood
Spirit Flower in the Bloody Trial Ground.

78
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,970
If they find it, she might still have a chance.

79
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,830
The Trial Ground is dangerous,

80
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,510
and we also have sect duties.

81
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,000
We can't have our disciples make a detour
just for that flower.

82
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,070
Indeed.

83
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,680
With Ru Yan's talent,

84
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,340
she should've been the one leading the trial team.

85
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,040
But now that she has fallen ill,

86
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,730
everything is out of order.

87
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,610
Ni Chang, I might have a solution.

88
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,040
Absolutely not.

89
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,310
The Seven Sects have clearly stated that
only Qi Refining Stage disciples

90
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,950
may enter the Bloody Trial Ground.

91
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,120
Breaking that rule...

92
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,600
Have you forgotten?

93
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,360
My Maiden Cycle Art allows me

94
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,920
to suppress my cultivation.

95
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,000
If I lower it to the Qi Refining Stage,

96
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,070
then I'm technically
still a Qi Refining Stage disciple.

97
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,120
No one can say otherwise.

98
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,270
Are you seriously risking everything

99
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,310
for a single Blood Spirit Flower?

100
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,720
You'd cripple your cultivation
down to the Qi Refining stage?

101
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,390
You must be mad.

102
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,270
Even if you're willing, I'd never stand for it.

103
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,430
Ru Yan is the Yan clan's only heir.

104
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,310
Ever since what happened to her
at Moonshadow Sect,

105
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,550
we owe her everything.

106
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,000
Besides, I'm rather fond of her.

107
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,600
And the Yan Clan Stronghold

108
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,080
has defended the border of Yue Kingdom

109
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,440
for nearly a hundred years,

110
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,960
holding off the demonic sects for the Seven Sects.

111
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm certain I can retrieve the Blood Spirit Flower

112
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,270
and save Yan Ru Yan's life if I enter the grounds.

113
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,670
The item we seek is of utmost importance.

114
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,150
Only I can ensure it's brought back safely.

115
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,240
Besides, my cultivation will recover soon enough.

116
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,650
It's decided.

117
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,380
This secret must be kept at all costs.

118
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,170
Young Master.

119
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,860
Your Blood Spirit Spell has improved a lot.

120
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,852
I told you to look into the list of those

121
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:02,480
heading to the Bloody Trial Ground
from Spirit Beast Mountain.

122
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,810
Where's the list?

123
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,200
Many have signed up,

124
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,640
but we're supposed to be selecting
only the obedient ones, right?

125
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,750
Are we choosing based on obedience,

126
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,080
or the quality of their gifts?

127
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,480
Young Master, what are you implying?

128
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,000
Take Yan Lei for example.

129
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,960
He's come seven or eight times.

130
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,270
I only accepted his gift the very first time.

131
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,030
I thought you might appreciate it.

132
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,480
But rest assured.

133
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,720
Even if we had taken his offerings,

134
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,120
he still wouldn't be allowed in.

135
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,220
After all, he's from the Yan Clan Stronghold.

136
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,290
The Yan Clan Stronghold?

137
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,960
My Lord,

138
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,818
the disciples from each sect attending
the Bloody Trial have already been decided.

139
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,030
Even if ours send gifts,
it might not change anything.

140
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,300
But the Moonshadow Sect said...

141
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,120
They would help us get the Blood Spirit Flower.

142
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,200
They told us to wait for good news.

143
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,240
This happened under their watch.

144
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,410
Of course, they should help.

145
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,720
That may be true... But...
But everything in this world

146
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,900
is a matter of exchange.

147
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,790
Elder Liu,

148
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,390
make another trip to Moonshadow Sect

149
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,670
and give this letter to their sect leader.

150
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,240
As long as they give their all

151
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,870
to find the Blood Spirit Flower and save Yan,

152
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,440
the Yan Clan Stronghold's quarry will be theirs.

153
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,030
My Lord, you mustn't do this!

154
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,790
The quarry's profits
are the lifeblood of the Yan Clan Stronghold.

155
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,870
How can we hand it over just like that?

156
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,120
She is my only daughter.

157
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,510
I would give my life to save her.

158
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,900
What is a gem business compared to that?

159
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,020
Who's there?

160
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,380
Core Formation cultivators.

161
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,450
But all of them are Early Core Stage.

162
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,960
And yet a Mid Foundation Establishment
Stage cultivator can command them.

163
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,510
It's just a trip to the Bloody Trial Ground.

164
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,900
Lord Yan, is this really necessary?

165
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,720
Who are you?

166
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,840
I am Wang Chan, the Young Master

167
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,220
of the Ghost Spirit Sect.

168
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,630
You're Wang Tian Gu's son?

169
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,750
That's me.

170
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,910
Word is you're desperate to get your disciples

171
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,670
into the Bloody Trial.

172
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,810
I assume you're after something important.

173
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,360
Since the Seven Sects are unwilling to help,

174
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,260
why not turn to the Six Sects?

175
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,360
The Seven Sects always claim
to walk the righteous path,

176
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,000
yet they monopolize the Bloody Trial Ground.

177
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,790
Asking them for help is harder

178
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,740
than climbing to the heavens.

179
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,640
You are the Lord of the Yan Clan Stronghold.

180
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,793
Isn't this far too humiliating

181
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:26,883
for someone of your stature?

182
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,910
What are you trying to say?

183
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,270
I can arrange for someone
to enter the Bloody Trial Ground

184
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,200
and retrieve what you are after.

185
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,810
No matter what it is,

186
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,500
I can help you.

187
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,670
Have you forgotten that centuries ago,

188
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,840
the Yan Clan Stronghold and Ghost Spirit Sect
were one and the same?

189
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,980
You should go back.

190
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,150
You should also remember,

191
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,030
only those who are willing to help you

192
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,880
are truly your friends.

193
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,231
Enough. Leave.

194
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,440
How's the investigation going?

195
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,030
Yan Yun Shan is desperately
dispatching people to the Bloody Trial Ground,

196
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,720
not for a Foundation Pill,
but for his ailing daughter.

197
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,510
Her daughter?

198
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,720
Her name is Yan Ru Yan.

199
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,960
She was born with a heavenly spirit root,

200
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,530
something that only appears once in centuries.

201
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,550
A heavenly spirit root?

202
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,840
That explains why the Yan Clan Stronghold
will stop at nothing to protect her.

203
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,550
However, her old illness has returned,

204
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,000
and she teeters on the brink of death.

205
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,080
The only thing that can save her

206
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,030
is the Blood Spirit Flower,
which only grows inside the Trial Ground.

207
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,570
That explains things.

208
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,600
I see.

209
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,720
So if we control the Blood Spirit Flower,

210
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,670
we can control the Yan Clan Stronghold.

211
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,480
And if we control the Yan Clan Stronghold,

212
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,290
we gain the upper hand in the coming war.

213
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,870
Interesting.

214
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,650
Looks like Zhong Wu has work to do again.

215
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,690
The heavenly spirit root,

216
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,170
I've finally found you.

217
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,740
She won't remember what happened that day, right?

218
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,260
The weather is good today.

219
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,900
You can even see the snowy peaks.

220
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,260
The Grandmaster is here.

221
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,620
Grandmaster.

222
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,390
Take a good look.

223
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,320
This is the Soul-Burning Spell.

224
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,500
Each of you will be randomly teleported
to a location inside the Trial Ground.

225
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,360
Where you land depends entirely on luck.

226
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,120
What we can do as a sect is plant

227
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,960
our Soul-Burning Spell on your bodies.

228
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,790
Within a certain range,

229
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,810
you'll be able to sense the location
of your fellow disciples.

230
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,910
Every sect is secretly competing in this trial.

231
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,480
The number of spirit herbs collected will affect

232
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,150
our sect's standing for the next 60 years.

233
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,720
The Moonshadow Sect is abusing their influence

234
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,150
and altering the Trial Ground's seal times
as they like.

235
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,220
We must not let them walk all over us.

236
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,170
We'll show them who
the true force among the Seven Sects is!

237
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,120
Got it!

238
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,480
- Understood!
- Got it!

239
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,980
Got it.

240
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,980
Move out!

241
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,700
♫ Chasing wind ♫

242
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,140
♫ I set out afar ♫

243
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,060
♫ The road ahead lost ♫

244
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,600
♫ My voice unheard ♫

245
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,580
♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫

246
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,020
♫ Laying low ♫

247
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,980
♫ I plan every move ♫

248
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,940
♫ With a mortal heart

249
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,860
♫ And lingering ties ♫

250
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,030
♫ I'm roaming far and wide... ♫

251
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,610
You've gained weight.

252
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,340
♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫

253
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,460
- Move out!
- Let's go!

254
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,500
♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫

255
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,790
♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫

256
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,260
Off we go!

257
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,740
♫ As chaos shakes the world ♫

258
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,500
♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫

259
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,140
♫ Kind at heart ♫

260
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,941
♫ Ruthless when I must be ♫

261
00:19:57,941 --> 00:20:00,200
♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫

262
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,503
♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫

263
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,600
♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫

264
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,040
♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫

265
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,020
♫ Forged by trial ♫

266
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,420
♫ I rise through three realms ♫

267
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,420
♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫

268
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,420
♫ Drunken steps,
high song over ocean and mountaintop ♫

269
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,800
♫ The celestial gourd bears dew
the Golden Core takes shape ♫

270
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,400
♫ Deep in the night,
the crane soars through autumn's clear sky ♫

271
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,305
♫ Across endless western winds
cuts a lone sword, cold and true ♫

272
00:20:37,305 --> 00:20:41,378
♫ A lone sword, cold and true ♫

273
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,160
Steady now!

274
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,180
We're almost there.

275
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,640
Everyone, the Young Master has ordered

276
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,880
that we are not to let the Yan Clan Stronghold
obtain the Blood Spirit Flower.

277
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,680
If you encounter
elite disciples of the Seven Sects,

278
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,640
do everything to kill or injure them.

279
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,420
Don't reveal your identity.

280
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,500
That's a given.

281
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,780
This is the Bloody Trial Ground.

282
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,020
It's so quiet.

283
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,260
The Trial Ground is now open.

284
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,810
Where am I?

285
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,812
-  I should hide...
- Help!

286
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:17,520
- And observe the situation.
- Help!

287
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,440
Skyfort Castle disciples?

288
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,680
Clear Void Sect!

289
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,400
Fellow disciples?

290
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,240
Senior Li! Senior Ren!

291
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,030
Over here!

292
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,270
Quickly! Let's get out of here!

293
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,980
Any Yellow Maple Valley disciples?

294
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,480
Qiao Qian, time is tight.

295
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,980
We should get going.

296
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,780
Let's go.

297
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,310
I can't let them find out
the secret of the Green Vial.

298
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,660
I should act alone from here on.

299
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,890
Senior Xiang.

300
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,370
Let the hunt begin!

301
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,050
The spiritual aura has indeed become thinner.

302
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,660
Grandmaster.

303
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,350
The Spirit Fusion Talisman actually worked.

304
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,960
This talisman links the spiritual aura
of its users.

305
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,550
Even though the teleportation is random,

306
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,960
there's at least a 50% chance

307
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,850
we would land near each other.

308
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,750
We landed here of all places.

309
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,890
The odds are in our favor.

310
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,400
I was right.

311
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,310
The closer you get
to the outer edge of the Trial Ground,

312
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,440
the younger the spirit herbs.

313
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,030
This means fewer rivals for me.

314
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,680
I'll gather some seedlings and seeds,

315
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,370
then rely on the Green Vial
to hasten their maturation.

316
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,290
Pardon me.

317
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,370
The Gilded Five-Petal Flame.

318
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,370
Someone's already dead.

319
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,130
I'll have to be careful not to end up like him.

320
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,310
The northeast edge of Wulong Pool

321
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,800
lies in a secluded corner,

322
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,510
its terrain shaped around a deep pool
plunging dozens of feet down.

323
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,750
According to the map, the Violet Monkey Blossom

324
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,700
should grow somewhere near here.

325
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,180
The miasma is dense here.

326
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,160
Coldwisp Herbs.

327
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,420
They're valuable ingredients
for concocting poisons.

328
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:30,015
Who's there?

329
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,180
Show yourself.

330
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,180
You've already been exposed.

331
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,290
Did my Stealth Talisman fail?

332
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,270
Come out!

333
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,090
I saw you lot!

334
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,850
What a bluff.

335
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,130
My precious.

336
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,090
Frost Toads.

337
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,310
Senior Yu, your Beast Taming Powder is incredible.

338
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,350
Just a small bottle
and the Frost Toads became completely obedient.

339
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,680
Another elite of the Seven Sects taken down.

340
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,574
These little creatures
have certainly earned their keep.

341
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:51,550
Frost Toads are docile by nature.

342
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:55,850
They almost never attack unless provoked.

343
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,940
Qi, collect the Coldwisp Herbs.

344
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,480
There's no need to risk my life for some herbs.

345
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,090
I'll let them have it.

346
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,720
My goodness.

347
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,090
I didn't expect to find you guys here.

348
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,270
Keep your guard up.

349
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,940
There could be an ambush.

350
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,480
He was cautious,
yet he still lost his life so easily.

351
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,550
Those two came here to kill.

352
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,750
What exactly are they after?

353
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,840
Why won't they leave?

354
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,960
Forget it.

355
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,240
-  If they won't go, I will.
- The Coldwisp Herbs...

356
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,480
May be highly poisonous,

357
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,200
but they're surprisingly beautiful.

358
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,610
Indeed.

359
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,400
Let's take his mystic pouch too.

360
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,570
All right.

361
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,510
Strange.

362
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,180
It was just here.

363
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,700
Is there someone else lurking nearby?

364
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,400
I didn't find any spirit herbs,

365
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,460
but I did get several mystic pouches.

366
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,220
Now where should I go?

367
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,510
I don't see any Violet Monkey Blossoms here.

368
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,130
Seems the map the sect provided
isn't entirely reliable.

369
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,850
Senior Xiang, the path is slippery. Go slow.

370
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,830
I've simply been here more times and know the way.

371
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,880
I'll be counting on you talented young cultivators

372
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,400
if we encounter spirit beasts.

373
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,720
Leave it to us.

374
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,000
This Trial Ground
is practically a death labyrinth.

375
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,830
Knowing the lay of the land is half the battle.

376
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,550
You're the old steed who knows the way.

377
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,920
With the three of us united,
success is all but guaranteed.

378
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,440
Why is he traveling
with disciples from another sect?

379
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,850
Han, I didn't expect to run into you here.

380
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,610
Han.

381
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,570
What do you say?

382
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,790
Care to join us?

383
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,220
We can look out for one another.

384
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,550
You may not know this,

385
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:54,510
but each sect's map for the Bloody Trial Ground

386
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,750
marks different priorities.

387
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,440
That's why sharing information and cooperating

388
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,980
with other sects is the smart move.

389
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,480
Thank you for your kind offer.

390
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,920
But I'm weak

391
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,070
and this is my first time in the Trial Ground.

392
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,830
I only plan to gather some spirit herbs
to complete my task.

393
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,420
I wouldn't want to burden the three of you.

394
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,680
No worries.

395
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,270
No worries.

396
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,740
Still, you didn't have to be so hasty
to refuse us.

397
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,500
Or are you perhaps after something important?

398
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,510
If this guy doesn't know what's good for him,

399
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,240
you shouldn't waste your breath on him.

400
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,960
That's right, Xiang.

401
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,180
Let him fend for himself.

402
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,590
I shall leave now. Please excuse me.

403
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,350
Farewell.

404
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,400
No choice.

405
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,220
I'll head in another direction.

406
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,720
It's as if Senior Xiang
has turned into a completely different person

407
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,890
once we entered the Trial Ground.

408
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,940
Hey, gambling addict.

409
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,090
I'm talking to you!

410
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,320
Why didn't you answer?

411
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,620
What do you want?

412
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,110
How about we place a bet?

413
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,400
What bet?
No bets.

414
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,110
This trial will shape the future
of the Seven Great Sects for the next 60,

415
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,010
maybe even 100 years, no?

416
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,150
I'm right, aren't I?

417
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,240
So, let's bet
on which sect gathers the most spirit herbs.

418
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,308
Whoever collects the most wins.
How about that?

419
00:36:09,308 --> 00:36:11,150
All right.

420
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,920
But your rules aren't foolproof.

421
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,670
What if it's a tie?

422
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,110
- Then what?
- Good point.

423
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,892
Let me think.

424
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:21,840
How about this? We bet on
whether the number of disciples

425
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,400
who make it out alive is odd or even.

426
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,580
Shoo. Leave me alone.

427
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,000
Han, you in?

428
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,550
I'm not betting with you.

429
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,670
He's no fun.

430
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,850
Sheesh.

431
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,410
Come on.

432
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,670
Here's my offer.

433
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,760
I'll wager two Bloodvein Drake Core Pills

434
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,180
against your two pieces of iron concentrate.

435
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,850
That's a fair deal, right?

436
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,700
Bloodvein Drake Core Pills?

437
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,550
What do you say?

438
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,740
Fine. Two pieces it is.

439
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,000
We're only betting on spirit herbs, nothing else.

440
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,140
Whoever gathers the most wins.

441
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,180
Go back.

442
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,780
The bet's on.

443
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,970
That guy's dead.

444
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,850
That guy's dead too.

445
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,875
It's only day one,

446
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:00,885
yet their murderous intent
has already been unleashed.

447
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,490
Invisible and razor-sharp.

448
00:38:41,341 --> 00:38:44,100
A perfect weapon for ambushes indeed.

449
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,180
Who goes there?

450
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,320
It's that young man from Tainan Bazaar.

451
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,220
Should we capture him and interrogate him?

452
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,960
I had to suppress my cultivation
to the Qi Refining Stage

453
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,190
just to enter the Trial Ground.

454
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,670
I'm already in a troublesome position.

455
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,190
Let's focus on the mission.

456
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,110
We don't want to invite more trouble.

457
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,180
We should regroup with our other disciples first.

458
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,000
Give these disciples a proper burial.

459
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,580
- Yes, Grandmaster.
- Yes.

460
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,140
This should be a safe spot.

461
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,760
The first day is already over,

462
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,660
but I still haven't found what I came here for.

463
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,030
To all disciples of the Seven Sects,

464
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:16,440
congratulations
on surviving the first daylight cycle.

465
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,400
Remember, the night in the Bloody Trial Ground

466
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,070
is far deadlier than the day.

467
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,800
Death may come from the skies above.

468
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,700
It'd be wise to find a safe place to hide.

469
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,030
Senior Xiang knows this Trial Ground well,

470
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,840
yet he still hasn't reached the Foundation Stage
after three attempts.

471
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,630
I can't share his fate.

472
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,060
I never want to set foot in this place again.

473
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,360
This rain chills me to the bone.

474
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,000
There's something cursed about it.

475
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,850
I have to circulate my energy to dispel the cold.

476
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,710
It's only the first day

477
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,840
and already so many have fallen.

478
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,588
Seems this year's competition is fiercer
than we anticipated.

479
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,780
The Soul-Burning Spell is reacting.

480
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,000
Don't kill me!

481
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,320
Don't kill me!

482
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,880
Senior, save me!

483
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,920
This is quite a predicament.

484
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,760
Senior!

485
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,330
Help won't come.

486
