The Long Ballad

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,000
Master.

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Who are you?

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How dare you?

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's go.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If we don't go now, we'll be in trouble.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes.

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll let you go today.

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How could such a terrible thing happen in the middle of the repair?

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Could it be the hands of the evil?

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This guy is really lucky.

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It seems that he's saved.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Could it be the hands of the high-level repairman?

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's really dangerous this time.

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It seems that the road to repair is difficult.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you want to live longer,

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
you have to find a good sect.

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's strange.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Where is the body of the paperless paper?

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why is it gone?

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The Long Ballad

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The Long Ballad

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let me tell you, brother Hai.

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In the cultivating world of the Night Kingdom,

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
there is no one who doesn't know about it.

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I just want to know what to ask.

28
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I learned a lot from you yesterday.

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The world's cultivating is a family.

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Isn't it good to do a free and free cultivation all your life?

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This time, the Yellow Wind Valley will be out of the red dust.

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't care about the world anymore.

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Before you leave,

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
go home and have a look.

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Third Uncle is here.

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's go to the school entrance exam.

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Dad, Uncle Six, Aunt De, and Gou Shan,

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
these three bowls of noodles.

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And let me pull out the green onion.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
In a blink of an eye,

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Xiaomei is at the age of being a monk.

42
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Dad, Mom.

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Brother, can you pass the exam?

44
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Come on.

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Brother Hai, let's go.

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Brother Hai will pass the exam.

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Brother Hai will pass the exam.

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Brother Hai said he would pass the exam.

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I bet he will pass the exam.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Grandpa, brother, Xiaomei.

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's great to see you before I go far away.

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll send a piece of Yun Duo to my family.

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a safe return.

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll go to the school entrance exam.

55
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll go to the school entrance exam.

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll go to the school entrance exam.

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll go to the school entrance exam.

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll give the reply in a blink of an eye.

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What's useful about it?

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Ying Ruyan.

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What happened to you?

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Ying Ruyan.

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,600
The mountain gate of Huangfeng Valley should be around here.

64
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Where is it?

65
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Come back!

66
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Come back!

67
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Come back!

68
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Come back!

69
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Come back!

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
A whole sky of yellow leaves.

71
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Could this be Huangfeng Valley?

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Huangfeng Valley

73
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Come back!

74
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Huangfeng Valley

75
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Huangfeng Valley

76
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What is this?

77
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Huangfeng Valley

78
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hu Yunzi

79
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you still recognize this card?

80
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You smelly old man

81
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Didn't you just have a new disciple today?

82
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If you don't go and have a look,

83
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you still have the time to play mahjong here?

84
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Of course I want to have a look.

85
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But you know the rules of Huangfeng Valley.

86
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The new disciple who has been here for several years,

87
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
you don't have to open some doors.

88
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You don't have to live up to the atmosphere in the valley.

89
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes, yes, yes.

90
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So you came here today.

91
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The first game will start soon.

92
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Good, good, good.

93
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Come on.

94
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The left is the single.

95
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The right is the double.

96
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Buy a pair of hands.

97
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:10,160
One of the hundred-year-old

98
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Sixteen

99
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Sixteen is a pair, right?

100
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Sixteen is not a pair.

101
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's a pair.

102
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Come on.

103
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Good.

104
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What are you doing?

105
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is a bet.

106
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There are winners and losers.

107
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yes.

108
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You are betting on the lottery, right?

109
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Very good.

110
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Brother Huayuan, you guys.

111
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's all for today.

112
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Goodbye.

113
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Who is the loser?

114
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Master, there is a big news.

115
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What's the time?

116
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There is a boy who eats the sacred order in the valley.

117
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Sacred order?

118
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I haven't seen this thing for 400 or 500 years.

119
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes.

120
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't see it often.

121
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Really.

122
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This

123
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Wait a minute.

124
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
How many people were there just now?

125
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Sixteen.

126
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Sixteen.

127
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Then add this.

128
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Sixteen plus one.

129
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
How many?

130
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Eighteen.

131
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Fu Yunzi.

132
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I've seen a loser.

133
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I've never seen you so lazy.

134
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Isn't it eighteen?

135
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Seventeen.

136
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Seventeen.

137
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Give it to me.

138
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hurry up.

139
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Grab it.

140
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Hurry up.

141
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Who is this?

142
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Where is this person?

143
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This sacred order is too timely.

144
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I remember you.

145
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Give it to you.

146
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Wait a minute.

147
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Where is the person?

148
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
At the bottom of the valley.

149
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
This is it.

150
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
This is it.

151
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Really?

152
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's really not easy to see.

153
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Great.

154
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Uncle.

155
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What good things did you bring today?

156
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Snow Mountain Ice Lotus.

157
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
With the hundred-year-old scarlet leaf you brought.

158
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's cool and warm.

159
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It nourishes the spirit roots.

160
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Great.

161
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What did you bring, Wu Shizhi?

162
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The masters and masters brought it.

163
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's too precious.

164
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I can't take it.

165
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
This is a good thing.

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,240
Nine-day

167
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,000
Please.

168
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What do you want to say?

169
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Ming.

170
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Have a good tea.

171
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Ming.

172
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Ming.

173
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Look at mine.

174
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's mine.

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Prepare a good tea.

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Please.

177
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Drink it.

178
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The tea is coming.

179
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Drink it.

180
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Why don't you get burned to death?

181
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You old talent.

182
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Who said I brought tea?

183
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Look.

184
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I brought something.

185
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Hundred-year-old scale.

186
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This is not good.

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Good taste.

188
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Senior.

189
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I brought it especially for you.

190
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Everyone.

191
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Today, our Huangfeng Valley

192
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
is welcoming

193
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
a rare guest who has not been here for a hundred years.

194
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Come.

195
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Let me see.

196
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What?

197
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I am the disciple of the Huangfeng Valley.

198
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Song Meng.

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
This is my sixth brother.

200
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
No.

201
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
This is my seventh sister.

202
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Where did he get the immortal order?

203
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No.

204
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What's your name?

205
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
My name is Han Li.

206
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Why is he here?

207
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
He's the one who took the immortal order.

208
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It can't be him.

209
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This guy.

210
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Impossible.

211
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
How can a tail-like root

212
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
have the immortal order?

213
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It is said that

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
with the immortal order,

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
you can directly get the main elixir.

216
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Why?

217
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Because their ancestors have made great contributions.

218
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't think this guy's ancestors

219
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
have made great contributions.

220
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
A mortal

221
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
also wants to get in and practice.

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Their ancestors have made great contributions?

223
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Our precious resources

224
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
of the cultivating family

225
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
are used on the descendants.

226
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Even I

227
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
have the right to get the main elixir

228
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
by working hard on the stage.

229
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Why would this guy

230
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
do that?

231
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Alright.

232
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Since we're here to practice,

233
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
we should practice well.

234
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't forget about others.

235
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I understand.

236
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're right.

237
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We're here to practice immortality.

238
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I think someone

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,620
is here to be a

240
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,000
You don't have to care about the opinions of these new disciples.

241
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Five-leafed-spirit root

242
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
has taken four.

243
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's not bad.

244
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's not bad at all.

245
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah.

246
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's a five-leafed-spirit root.

247
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah.

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Which family

249
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
has used the immortal order

250
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
on these waste materials?

251
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But I don't remember

252
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
the second or third rule of the rule.

253
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Whoever fails to get the main elixir

254
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
will not ask for the source

255
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
no matter what the quality is.

256
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Indeed.

257
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I remember that according to the rules,

258
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
he should get a main elixir.

259
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What?

260
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
A main elixir for him?

261
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's a waste.

262
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What about my disciples?

263
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Fang Fengguo said

264
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
we should earn a lot from him.

265
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
How can we give him a main elixir?

266
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
We should give him a main elixir.

267
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
We can't break the rules

268
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
because of a main elixir.

269
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah.

270
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If it's spread,

271
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
other six sects will laugh at us.

272
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah.

273
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You're right.

274
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No matter what the quality is,

275
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
we should ask him to join us.

276
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We should give him a main elixir.

277
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But...

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But what?

279
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The amount of the main elixir

280
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
is distributed in advance every year.

281
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
This year,

282
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
we only prepared one for the first place

283
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
of the Tainan Society.

284
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If we give him the main elixir,

285
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
the first place will be gone.

286
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Then it's gone.

287
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I mean,

288
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
you can use the spiritual stone to make up for it.

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
He's the first place anyway.

290
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
He'll get his main elixir next year.

291
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's settled.

292
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's settled.

293
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's settled.

294
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Junior Wu,

295
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
go welcome him.

296
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yes, Senior.

297
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Senior, please.

298
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You brat.

299
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I've paid back

300
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
the debt of the gambling game.

301
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Let's go.

302
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Have some tea.

303
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Come on.

304
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The tea smells good.

305
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Sect Leader,

306
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
where's my tea?

307
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Please.

308
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're late. You didn't serve the tea.

309
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The tea is not bad.

310
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's delicious.

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Really?

312
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Really.

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Senior Wu.

314
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Senior Wu.

315
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You're the one who took the sacred elixir?

316
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes.

317
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
My name is Han Li.

318
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The sacred elixir is rare.

319
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I've never seen it.

320
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
How did you get it?

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
My ancestors passed it down.

322
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Which family are you from?

323
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Or do you have any predecessors

324
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
who are in the Seven Sects?

325
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm from the Fan clan.

326
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm not from the Shi family.

327
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's okay.

328
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The sacred elixir is rare.

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's also a good thing

330
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
that you got it.

331
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
My surname is Wu.

332
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
From now on,

333
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
you can call me Senior Wu.

334
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Welcome to the Yellow Wind Valley.

335
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm here.

336
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Now

337
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm a disciple

338
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
of the Yellow Wind Valley.

339
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:21,880
the

340
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,180
Uncle, go ahead

341
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,620
go ahead

342
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,100
White horse

343
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,280
White horse

344
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,860
Uncle, be careful

345
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,460
That's all we need

346
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,100
Thats all you need

347
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,620
Uncle, be careful

348
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,020
The valley asked me to move to a better place in the back hill.

349
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,820
Move.

350
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,660
Otherwise, I'll wait for your main plan to succeed.

351
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,420
Yes, Master.

352
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,900
Then we can start our own animal farm.

353
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,620
There are so many snacks in the valley.

354
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,540
How can I earn these snacks?

355
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,060
You can go to the Baikitang to earn snacks.

356
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,500
What are the tasks?

357
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,340
Like taking care of the spirits and animals in the valley.

358
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,780
Or go to the mine to supervise the mining of snacks.

359
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,340
Or go to the shipyard to teach the disciples' skills.

360
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,620
The tasks are different.

361
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,620
The number of snacks is also different.

362
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,300
The one who plays Baikitang is Master Ye.

363
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,060
He is a little weird.

364
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,420
You can give up your skills.

365
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,140
This is the forestry network.

366
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,460
You can come here when you have enough snacks.

367
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:49,980
Yes.

368
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,180
Ye.

369
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,060
It's early in the morning. What are you doing?

370
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,860
I brought new disciples to you to get the ancient goods.

371
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,100
I just got it. Why do I get it again?

372
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,860
Greetings, Master Ye.

373
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,620
You are the immortal order, right?

374
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,940
Even you heard it.

375
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,940
These young people don't learn things hard.

376
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,860
They are all immortal in their own ways.

377
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,820
You are not good at it.

378
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,700
You are lucky.

379
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,540
I have a lot of dark souls.

380
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,780
When am I going to leave?

381
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,220
Do you think I will leave mình tienen?

382
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,140
Wait here.

383
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,140
Don't move.

384
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,140
Put it here.

385
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,740
This is the token of the Yellow Wind Valley.

386
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,940
Draw a spiritual power to inject it and activate it.

387
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,540
It will be yours from now on.

388
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,340
It can inject the spiritual power.

389
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,940
I'll give you a book of basic martial arts.

390
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,140
A set of daily experience tools.

391
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,540
A set of cold moon knives from the Liyang County.

392
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,340
A sword from the Huangsu Mountain in the ancient times.

393
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,940
Take the task and earn the spiritual power.

394
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,340
Change the equipment and spend the spiritual power.

395
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,740
I'll keep them all.

396
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,340
Come to me when you have the spiritual power.

397
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,740
Thank you, Uncle Ye.

398
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,340
Here!

399
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,940
Dur 미 Jegong.

400
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,140
How do you like it?

401
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,040
The disciples of the Yellow Roc Valley

402
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,340
have never worn attire, right?

403
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,340
Yes.

404
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,140
From my childhood,

405
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,840
I was the first

406
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,940
to see clothes without embroidery in it.

407
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,820
Here.

408
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,640
These are all

409
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,140
the things in the valley.

410
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,120
If it doesn't go up to the top in time,

411
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,660
I will buy you only a few.

412
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,840
I rule that

413
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,720
a court official fee

414
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,280
from His Ryoma

415
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,480
can count as a primitive الأ Naаз Bueno before the deadline.

416
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,080
It is yours

417
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,280
Just keep it.

418
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,920
Listen,

419
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,980
bone marrow Gemini

420
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,460
was demanded by many.

421
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,040
If necessary,

422
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,840
I'll be in charge of your young disciples' basic skills.

423
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,480
If you have any problems in the future,

424
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
you can come to me anytime.

425
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,400
I'll definitely never forget your instructions

426
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,600
when I succeed in my training.

427
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,280
Don't think about the training first.

428
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,920
But no matter if you succeed in your training,

429
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,120
you must keep this bamboo-bun.

430
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,920
Thank you, Master.

431
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,120
Hurry and go back to your room.

432
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,040
Even if you give me a bamboo-bun,

433
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,160
I, the Weiling Root, will never be able to plant a chicken.

434
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,920
That's what Uncle Wu said earlier.

435
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,520
Make him look at you.

436
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,120
What about Bolsonaro?

437
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,520
His sister and brother asked him

438
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,720
to cultivate the skills

439
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,920
to help take one of these ancient Japanese will need.

440
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,480
They didn't need a bamboo-bum or a chicken.

441
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,120
Let's have a duel first.

442
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,320
Yourras

443
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,400
No need

444
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,720
God protect me

445
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,300
From let a blind man light a lamp

446
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
The snow is so white.

447
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,920
Isn't this the Immortal Order?

448
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Immortal Order?

449
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
My name is Han Li.

450
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,520
Han Li is so famous for his Immortal Order.

451
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,920
Why don't you change your name to

452
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,120
Immortal Order?

453
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,320
You two stop talking.

454
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,720
Master Hong Hu.

455
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Choose a leaf that you like.

456
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,320
You can try it later.

457
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,120
The Great Yellow Wind Valley is so big.

458
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,320
With your footwork,

459
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,120
I'm afraid you can't walk for ten days.

460
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,120
People who can't fly

461
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,520
can't leave the Yellow Wind Valley.

462
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Most of you

463
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
in the Yellow Wind Valley

464
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,320
have only flown in dreams.

465
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,720
Those who are timid

466
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,920
dare not even dare to dream.

467
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,120
People like you

468
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,720
can't fly at all.

469
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,120
The so-called cultivation

470
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,920
first needs to break the limits of the heart.

471
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,320
Kunpeng can fly.

472
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,720
People can also fly.

473
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
If you can achieve the justice of the world

474
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,920
and the change of the six qi,

475
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,720
you can easily fly.

476
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Master.

477
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,120
As long as you believe that you can fly,

478
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,720
you can really fly.

479
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,520
Then, aren't we cultivators

480
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,520
a way to achieve our dreams?

481
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,920
Whether we can be a horse,

482
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
whether we can be a horse, or not,

483
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,520
it doesn't mean that you can be a horse.

484
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,920
If others can't,

485
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,120
it doesn't mean that you can't be a horse.

486
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,320
If you are not afraid of humiliation,

487
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,720
you can move as you wish.

488
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,120
This is the essence of cultivators' pursuit.

489
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,520
Okay.

490
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,920
I've finished telling you the principles.

491
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,320
After flying over that mountain,

492
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,720
you can say that you are in the Yellow Wind Valley.

493
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,320
Is there any other question?

494
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Master Kunpeng,

495
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
you just said that you can fly over the mountain.

496
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,920
You didn't say that you have to use this leaf, right?

497
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,720
Whatever.

498
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,320
I'll wait for you over the mountain.

499
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,920
Who uses this rotten leaf?

500
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,920
Let's go.

501
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,320
Let's go.

502
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:49,920
Come on.

503
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Let's go.

504
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,120
No.

505
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,120
To be honest with you,

506
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,120
I don't know what the great acts of man are.

507
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,920
You're correct.

508
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,320
If the bags of cannons were.

509
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
You'd tell me about it.

510
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,120
You're going to fly.

511
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,520
Why is it broken?

512
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:46,920
Firefly

513
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,480
is waiting for this moment

514
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,560
I shall give you fight for each other with no mistake.

515
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Only meet and be Gentleemans.

516
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,400
I shall always remember you always,

517
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,680
outsider.

518
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,400
That's just my duo.

519
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,360
I'll fulfill the rules by my own.

520
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,800
I shall give you

521
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,800
I'm sure I can fly if I have Kunpeng in my heart.

522
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
It's too late.

523
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Where is Kunpeng?

524
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
It's clearly Kun Chong.

525
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
How is it?

526
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
When did you learn this kind of magic?

527
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
The four moons in the world are close to each other.

528
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
The peach blossoms in the mountains are blooming.

529
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
It's a little interesting.

530
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Don't let Xuan'er see you use this trick.

531
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
If she sees these flowers and grass,

532
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
she will have no time to practice.

533
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Yes, yes, yes.

534
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Wait a minute.

535
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
Okay, okay, okay.

536
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
No need.

537
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Don't use this trick in the future.

538
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Senior sister.

539
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Why do you think this little kid's ability is so bad?

540
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
It's the worst one I've ever seen.

541
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
You can't say that.

542
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
That holy spirit is so good.

543
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
That holy spirit.

544
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Such a good opportunity.

545
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,800
There's no way it's not good enough.

546
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,800
It's a pity that the egg is gone.

547
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,800
But he can't say he has no advantages.

548
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Maybe he knows he's mediocre.

549
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,800
So his attitude and willfulness are all good.

550
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Life is a life, grass and wood are a life.

551
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
According to his self-esteem,

552
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,800
I'm afraid he won't be able to use that egg when he's old.

553
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
What are you doing?

554
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Good wind is strong.

555
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Is it a swallow or a red tiger?

556
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Wind is strong.

557
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Wind.

558
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,800
The wind blows the air away.

559
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
The wind blows the air away.

560
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
The man's eyes are closed.

561
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
The scene is so cruel.

562
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
The wind blows the air away.

563
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
The man's eyes are closed.

564
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
A star.

565
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
A star.

566
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
A few thoughts.

567
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Take me around the world.

568
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,800
A few wishes.

569
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,800
A few wishes.

570
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,800
The sea is not yet clear and the river is not yet clear.

571
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,800
That eternity is also a moment.

572
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
I laugh at ordinary things.

573
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
The lonely battle is difficult.

574
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
The world is in a mess.

575
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
I have ordinary tacit understanding.

576
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
I have a heart of gold and two mountains.

577
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
The sofa is broken.

578
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
I'm not able to get my face back.

579
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,800
I'm a good man in the three realms.

580
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
I'm going to be destroyed in the end.

581
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,800
From today on,

582
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,800
you will officially become disciples of Huangfeng Valley.

583
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
As the leader,

584
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
I have only one request for you.

585
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,800
You should practice hard and don't cause any trouble.

586
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Your purpose here is to practice.

587
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,800
The first level of cultivation is to practice the main skill.

588
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
After the main skill,

589
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
no need, thank you.

590
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,800
you can absorb the essence of the sun, moon, and the sky.

591
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,800
You won't lose your bones and your body.

592
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,800
So even if you are still practicing,

593
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,800
you should start to avoid your bones.

594
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
I importantly care about yuстран,

595
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
do you understand?

596
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
No more fat ağz.

597
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,800
I can only army with twists.

598
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
You want to get rid of the alguien I grow up?

599
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Master.

600
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Can you imagine what I've become?

601
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,840
This power is still beyond the

602
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,800
class of the Three Personal connections.

603
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
Even if you wanted to Love of the Abyss,

604
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
the fortress still has to be homogeneous.

605
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
You are asking for my help?

606
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,320
I can spare you

607
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,040
if you want to eat.

608
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,360
But you can't even bear a piece of cake.

609
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,040
How can you cultivate yourself?

610
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,680
Who said I can't eat if I eat?

611
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,120
My family told me

612
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,760
that a chief of the Jidan Bureau

613
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,960
loves to eat.

614
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,120
He even carries a bowl of rice noodles.

615
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,560
What's wrong with eating a cake?

616
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,120
I'm starving.

617
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,400
You can't eat good food.

618
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,400
How can the chief of the Jidan Bureau

619
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,520
be so bad?

620
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,560
That's right.

621
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,080
Don't listen to him.

622
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,800
Nonsense.

623
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,760
Is there such a greedy Jidan Bureau?

624
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,920
The order of the ancestors was set by the ancestors.

625
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,280
It can't be changed.

626
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,040
You've been practicing hard.

627
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,520
With your Yiling root,

628
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,200
maybe the valley will give you

629
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
another bamboo chicken.

630
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Again?

631
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,040
This time,

632
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,200
these 300 snacks

633
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,800
are your compensation.

634
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,360
Chief,

635
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,120
I'm the best in the martial arts competition.

636
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,040
According to the rules,

637
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,640
I should be given a bamboo chicken.

638
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Who told you to meet the order of the ancestors?

639
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,880
This bamboo chicken

640
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,040
must be given to him first.

641
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,520
This is the iron law in the door.

642
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,880
It can't be changed.

643
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,280
Chief, I don't agree.

644
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,240
Enough.

645
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,280
Just admit your bad luck.

646
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,120
Chief, don't you understand?

647
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,520
The bamboo chicken must be given to the order of the ancestors first.

648
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,640
You and Chen's maid

649
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,320
have already engaged.

650
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,000
Chen's family has a lot of bamboo chicken eggs.

651
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,200
Why?

652
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,840
Can't you be more serious?

653
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
If you want to blame,

654
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,160
blame the order of the ancestors.

655
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,760
Tomorrow he's going to teach me.

656
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,080
Nothing broken to that day.

657
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,280
Make a good example to her.

658
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,840
As she was stubborn,

659
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,600
she changed her way of thinking so strongly.

660
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,120
She's going to teach you how to repugnance.

661
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,000
My favored maidservant.

662
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,400
My Respected Master.

663
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,320
Help me to provide the main garden.

664
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,280
I recipe.

665
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,200
Isn't this called a tactless omegえcheering?

666
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,280
I want to learn the skill of face.

667
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Face?

668
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Wei Linggen,

669
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,280
why do you want to learn the skill of face?

670
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
What skill?

671
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
The skill of face.

672
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
It's a private skill.

673
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Use your spirit energy

674
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
to separate yourself from the outside world.

675
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
If you practice well,

676
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,280
you can hide your behavior and breath

677
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
from being discovered by others.

678
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Everyone, take a look.

679
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
I see.

680
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
I see.

681
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Everyone, take a look.

682
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
What's this?

683
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,280
I think I've seen this before.

684
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
I've seen this before.

685
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
I've seen this before.

686
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
Come on.

687
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
Okay.

688
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
Try it.

689
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,540
The

690
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Master of the World.

691
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,280
Where are you?

692
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
Master of the World.

693
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
In this class,

694
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
we will learn the skill of face.

695
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,280
Who can make up for the result?

696
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,280
This heart has never been frozen.

697
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Standing in the rain, how to walk?

698
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Try it.

699
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:48,680
The so-called

700
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:24,080
So-called

701
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,680
How are you?

702
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,680
He has won.

703
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,680
He decides the result.

704
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,680
So,

705
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,040
while we've

706
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,680
tried so much,

707
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,960
do you

708
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
flatten yourself?

709
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,680
Yeah.

710
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,520
He makes some very good

711
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,520
I can't forget your kindness

712
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,520
I'd rather regret it

713
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,520
It's said that the past is like a leaf

714
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,520
Looking back at the absurd, unbearable

715
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,520
The lonely books in the bustling city

716
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,520
The old books are ruined

717
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,520
The past is like a leaf

718
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,520
The past is like a leaf

719
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,520
The wind rises and blows

720
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,520
The words are like a lotus

721
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,520
Looking back at the mountain top

722
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,520
I've forgotten the past

723
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:18,520
It's yesterday, it's tomorrow

724
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,520
The three seas and three heavens are not like the past

725
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:31,520
Time will also change everything in the world

726
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Only these four years have passed thousands of years

727
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,520
In the moment of the eternal

728
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:58,520
In the moment of the eternal

729
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:11,520
In the moment of the eternal
