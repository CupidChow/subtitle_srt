3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,465
â™« Chasing wind, I set out afar â™«

4
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:27,115
â™« The road ahead lost, my voice unheard â™«

5
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:29,120
â™« I've tasted joy and sorrow â™«

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,515
â™« Laying low, I plan every move â™«

7
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:36,160
â™« With a mortal heart and lingering ties â™«

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,920
â™« I'm roaming far and wide â™«

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,984
â™« A twist of fate in desperate times â™«

10
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:46,420
â™« A bond that outlives the dust of life â™«

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,960
â™« Still chasing what immortality means â™«

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,090
â™« Even eternity flashes by in a blink â™«

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,240
â™« Don't mock my ordinary life â™«

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,550
â™« I fight alone as chaos shakes the world â™«

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,256
â™« Don't scorn my humble roots â™«

16
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:13,520
â™« Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be â™«

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,640
â™« Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath â™«

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,800
â™« I hold the tide between life and death â™«

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,080
â™« Faith carries me through endless dark â™«

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,553
â™« And I return with a heart refined â™«

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,960
â™« Forged by trial, I rise through three realms â™«

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,580
â™« Reborn in the wheel of fate â™«

23
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,970
&nbsp;

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,270
Oblivion Pill.

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,480
It makes you forget the past
without even realizing it.

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,990
Hence the name.

27
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,250
This stuff's great.

28
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,520
It may come in handy someday.

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,420
Better write it down.

30
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,150
The Chuangong Pavilion charges by the hour.

31
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,710
Copying like this is just wasting your gems.

32
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,770
Elder Xu, is there a better way?

33
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,640
I may be unworthy,
but I'd like to learn this technique!

34
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,000
That's how you lose your rice bowl.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,180
- Name your price!
- Ten gems!

36
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,700
Ten gems for each copy.

37
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,990
Didn't expect Lushan Hall to have rules like that.

38
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,960
Then please, Elder Xu, prepare some good recipes.

39
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,180
I'll copy them all at once.

40
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,290
That's easy.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,910
Look at these ones.

42
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,020
How about them?

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,930
This is not useful.

44
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,800
This one?

45
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,580
No.

46
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,100
Lushan Hall can't be
full of junk like this, right?

47
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,180
Everyone asks that their first time here.

48
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,470
But they don't realize without a good furnace,

49
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:49,347
even the best recipes are useless.

50
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,530
So you mean I have to buy a furnace from you

51
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,810
before I can see the real recipes?

52
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,750
Smart kid.

53
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,614
If you buy my alchemy furnace,

54
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:10,610
these recipes come free with it.

55
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,040
200 gems.

56
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,370
Lowest price, 180.

57
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,100
The furnace is in the Dihuo House.

58
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,830
And the recipes?

59
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,240
Buy my furnace, I'll throw in the recipes.

60
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:43,760
A man of his word never goes back on it!

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,290
The recipes.

62
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,360
The recipes!

63
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,870
The Foundation Pill?

64
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,190
That's the Foundation Pill recipe!

65
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,510
Then I can make it myself!

66
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,430
Using the Green Vial to ripen the herbs,

67
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,390
then I can make as many pills as I want!

68
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,590
No one can take them from me!

69
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,950
To refine the Foundation Pill,

70
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,830
you'll need:

71
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,160
Jade Marrow Mushroom, Violet Monkey Blossom,

72
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,840
and Celestial Essence Fruit.

73
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,870
What even are those?

74
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,200
Never heard of any of them!

75
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:20,344
Where am I supposed to find them?

76
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,900
This is the Dihuo House.

77
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,290
And this is the 180-gem furnace.

78
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,910
Let's start with a simple recipe.

79
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,480
Oblivion Pill.

80
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,340
You're up.

81
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,920
It worked on the first try!

82
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,936
No wonder it costs 180 gems!

83
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:31,696
Let's try the Yellow Dragon Pill next.

84
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,570
The purity's way better too.

85
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,360
I set up a hidden field within the Herbs Garden.

86
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,680
I use the Green Vial to grow herbs and test new combinations.

87
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,510
I've made a good number of useful pills.

88
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,060
But, for the Foundation Pill,

89
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,220
I still haven't found the key ingredients.

90
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,430
Every time before the Bloody Trial Ground open,

91
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:29,560
the Seven Sects always pick a location to hold a joint summit.

92
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,040
This concerns

93
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,160
the future of every sect.

94
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,000
So, every time the Trial Ground opens,

95
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,720
- The Bloody Trial Ground?
- It directly affects

96
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,510
each sect's future strength.

97
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,560
Oh right, I also heard something.

98
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,310
They say any disciple who enters the Trial Ground

99
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,870
gets a Foundation Pill.

100
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,880
Is that true?

101
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,290
No.

102
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,750
Knew it.

103
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,480
But, that rumor isn't too far off.

104
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,440
Do you know why the Trial Ground

105
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,980
is also called Seven Sects' Herb Vault?

106
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,750
Because the place is rich in rare spiritual herbs.

107
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,360
Only there, in all of Yue Kingdom,

108
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,000
can you find ingredients for the Foundation Pill.

109
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,850
No wonder those herbs aren't seen in the market.

110
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,240
So each trial, disciples from our sect fight to get in, right?

111
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,870
Not exactly.

112
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,360
Getting in isn't the hard part.

113
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,000
But getting out is the real challenge.

114
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,910
The Trial Ground is a deadly place.

115
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,790
Do you know what the survival rate was

116
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,810
for those who went in?

117
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,670
Less than half!

118
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,690
That dangerous?

119
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,590
You there, are you interested in the Bloody Trial Ground too?

120
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,950
Huh?

121
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,600
Han, what are you eating?

122
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,060
A fruit.

123
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,350
Got any more?

124
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,080
Yeah. Just one left.

125
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,080
Thanks, Han.

126
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,300
Thanks, Han!

127
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,730
Senior, who was that just now?

128
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,320
You don't know him?

129
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,140
That's Senior Xiang Zhi Li.

130
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,320
He's the oldest Qi Refining cultivator here.

131
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,700
He's entered the Bloody Trial Ground multiple times and made it back alive.

132
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,750
But he hasn't reached
the Foundation Establishment Stage.

133
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,830
Kind of strange, really.

134
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,350
That old guy's a total fool, just laughing to himself all day.

135
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,000
The sect sure has it all planned out.

136
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,850
They need pills so they send us Qi Refining disciples to trade our lives for them.

137
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,270
Don't you think that old man's
just trying to scare us?

138
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,870
He's old, yet hasn't reached
the Foundation Establishment Stage.

139
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,770
Bet he's dying to get into the Trial Ground for a shot at the Foundation Pill.

140
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,890
He wants in, but afraid we'll take his spot.

141
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,060
So he's trying to scare us off.

142
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,340
But what if he's telling the truth?

143
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,400
Airship approaching!

144
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,620
Elders, thanks for coming all this way.

145
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,920
I greet you with respect!

146
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,550
I've prepared tea and fruit in the Qianji Library.

147
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,170
Please, come with me.

148
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,850
Mentor, everything is ready.

149
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,600
You may go now.

150
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,980
Yes.

151
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,510
Come on, eat up.

152
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,000
Try this.

153
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,670
Try one of these pastries.

154
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,780
- This one's good.
- Smells amazing!

155
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,910
Tastes good.

156
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,320
Better than last time.

157
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,840
Stop eating!

158
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,170
We haven't even had enough yet.

159
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,550
The Bloody Trial Ground is about to open.

160
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,520
Per tradition, the Solunar Purification Pearl,
held by Yellow Maple Valley,

161
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,100
now be passed to the next sect,
the Moonshadow Sect.

162
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,450
Hong Fu, please wait.

163
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,941
Before we transfer the pearl, there's something I'd like to discuss with the elders.

164
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,120
Isn't this a Foundation Pill?

165
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,620
But the quality's a bit poor.

166
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,360
Mine's slightly better.

167
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,020
These two Foundation Pills must've been made
in different batches.

168
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,530
That's right.

169
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,100
The one Fu Yun Zi has was made with herbs gathered from the Trial Ground twenty years ago.

170
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,620
And mine?

171
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,050
Yours was made with recent herbs
from the Trial Ground.

172
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,080
They're both Foundation Pills, but the quality difference is clear.

173
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,670
I believe you all have noticed it as well.

174
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,120
The quantity and quality of spiritual herbs

175
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,340
in the Trial Ground aren't what they used to be.

176
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,720
Therefore, on behalf of Moonshadow Sect,

177
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,970
I propose that after this trial, we enter an early seal period,

178
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,510
and seal the Trial Ground for 60 years.

179
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,320
- What?
- 60 years?

180
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,450
- That's way too long!
- Exactly!

181
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,490
Li!

182
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,030
It's really you!

183
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,700
Miss Han!

184
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,570
After we parted at Tainan Valley, I thought I'd never see you again.

185
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,120
I didn't expect you'd join Yellow Maple Valley.

186
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,350
I should be thanking you
for that book you gave me.

187
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,800
Miss Han, are you here
for Seven Sects' Summit too?

188
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,120
Oh right. Just ahead, there are
snacks for Qi Refining disciples.

189
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,890
Go give them a try.

190
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,550
Those over there are all about to reach
the Foundation Establishment Stage.

191
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,510
Just sitting near them makes me nervous.

192
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,530
I'll pass.

193
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,610
Thank you, Li.

194
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,050
Miss Han, are you going
into the Bloody Trial Ground too?

195
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,550
My brother's old illness flared up.

196
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,750
He's been unconscious.

197
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,320
Only the Solarflame Blossom from the Trial Ground
can save him.

198
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,420
Can't your elders cure him?

199
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,980
That's why I have to find the Solarflame
Blossom myself to cure my brother.

200
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,770
Even if I die trying.

201
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,360
You're so nice to your brother.

202
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
I have a younger sister too.

203
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,220
When I left home, she was about this tall.

204
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,000
The herbs in the Trial Ground are incredibly rare.

205
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,290
Even with one opening every five years, we barely gather enough for Foundation Pills.

206
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,030
And now it's 60 years between?

207
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,790
How should we make up the shortfall?

208
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,440
- Exactly!
- That's right!

209
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,840
- Yeah!
- Your Moonshadow Sect is rich and powerful.

210
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,360
Of course you've stocked up on Foundation Pills.

211
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,030
But the rest of us?

212
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,510
Our disciples are still waiting in line.

213
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,050
- Exactly!
- What are we supposed to do?

214
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,430
Foundation Pills matter

215
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,970
But every time the Trial Ground open,

216
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,510
nearly half the Qi Refining disciples end up dead.

217
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:47,550
Do their lives mean nothing to you elders?

218
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,450
Heaven's way never changes, not for sages, not for tyrants.

219
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,510
Does your compassion outweigh the way of Heaven?

220
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,970
You're putting a mere Foundation Pill
on par with the way of Heaven?

221
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,100
- That's a bit much.
-

222
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,160
Seems like your Yellow Maple Valley is siding with Moonshadow Sect.

223
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,960
Rare treasures in this world
are limited by nature.

224
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,240
Some spirit herbs take a hundred, even a thousand years to mature.

225
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,270
But in recent years, disciple
numbers have skyrocketed,

226
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,550
while herbs only get scarcer with every pick.

227
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,830
Exactly.

228
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,200
At this rate, we're just killing the golden goose.

229
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,720
Besides, I heard the Six Demonic
Sects are starting to stir again.

230
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,720
We should be minimizing losses,
or what if they strike?

231
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,920
Demonic sects?

232
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,200
It's been centuries, and every year someone claims they're back.

233
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,620
But aside from us old-timers,
who's ever actually seen them?

234
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,220
True!

235
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,100
Young Master.

236
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,272
Young Master.

237
00:19:56,272 --> 00:20:00,060
When... when are we setting out?

238
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,860
Always in a rush, huh?

239
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,310
The Seven Sects of Yue Kingdom are a chaotic mess.

240
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,010
If we just charge in blindly, how many men are we going to lose?

241
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,070
Young Master, forgive me.

242
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,170
But your aunt marched into Jiang Kingdom
half a month ago.

243
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,340
If she gets ahead of you, I'm afraid your position

244
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,760
will only get more awkward.

245
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,420
That's true.

246
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,410
My aunt is pretty aggressive.

247
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,450
But I prefer finesse.

248
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,000
And I'll use this chance to show my father

249
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,690
who the next leader
of Ghost Spirit Sect should be.

250
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,730
So then... what's the plan?

251
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,720
No sudden moves.

252
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,730
No sudden moves?

253
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,490
Young Master, you're not going to Yue Kingdom?

254
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,010
Of course I am.

255
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,410
The three of us are enough.

256
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,750
Just the three of us?

257
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,060
No need for a full army?

258
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,770
Besides, the Bloody Trial Ground is about to open.

259
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:04,710
Time for those blockheads from the Seven Sects
to get busy.

260
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,560
And another thing: once you two get there, keep your mouths shut.

261
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,640
They don't talk the way you do.

262
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,490
Yes, Young Master.

263
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,170
Yes, Young Master.

264
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,090
That's true.

265
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,550
You've all been around the sects for years.

266
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,960
Don't you know full well
how the Seven Sects are doing?

267
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,620
How do they compare to five years ago?

268
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,160
Or 60 years ago?

269
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,920
It's because our strength is fading

270
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,060
that we need the Trial Ground
to gather more herbs,

271
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,350
so our Qi Refining disciples can grow stronger
and level up.

272
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,480
- Exactly!
- That's right.

273
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,690
We can't just avoid the Trial Ground out of fear.

274
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,510
Won't that be throwing the baby out
with the bathwater?

275
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,780
- Exactly!
- It's just not worth it!

276
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,920
Anyway, we don't agree.

277
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,530
Why's everyone so stubborn?

278
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,510
- I'm fine either way.
- You sure?

279
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,210
Before, it was a gamble every five years.

280
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,900
Now it's one shot every 60.

281
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,010
I just wonder can some folks
afford to wait that long?

282
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,000
Hey, you talking about me?

283
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,560
Hong Fu, please activate the Solunar Purification Pearl.

284
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,900
Hong Fu, if you would.

285
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,790
What's that?

286
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,240
The Solunar Purification Pearl!

287
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,200
Looks like something's up with the elders.

288
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,780
I'll go check it out.

289
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,310
Miss Han.

290
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,420
Come back safe from the Trial Ground.

291
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,460
See you!

292
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,720
What's the Solunar Purification Pearl?

293
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,510
Fellow Elders, have you noticed
anything different about the pearl?

294
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,550
It's dimmer.

295
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,030
It's not as bright as it used to be.

296
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,920
That's right.

297
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,400
The Solunar Purification Pearl
was crafted by our sect's ancestors

298
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,880
to dispel the mists within the Trial Ground.

299
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,310
It glows with the essence of sun and moon.

300
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,640
But what you may not know

301
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,720
when the heavens shift, the pearl is affected too.

302
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,640
Sun and moon should shine steady through the ages.

303
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
But with the Trial Ground opening too often,

304
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,830
the spiritual energy is drying up,

305
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,070
and the pearl has lost its glow.

306
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,290
Doesn't that prove my point?

307
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,610
Now you understand?

308
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,020
Come on, let's talk this through.

309
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,110
The Trial Ground is so dangerous.

310
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,750
Maybe I should wait for the next round

311
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,850
when I'm better prepared.

312
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,880
Did you hear that?

313
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,240
From now on,

314
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,590
the Trial Ground will open once every 60 years.

315
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,400
Getting a Foundation Pill just got a lot harder.

316
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,440
Yeah.

317
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,070
If you don't reach
the Foundation Establishment Stage,

318
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,920
your lifespan tops out at around 200 years.

319
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,240
Wait another 60, we'll be old by then.

320
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,880
Why not take this chance?

321
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,240
Let's ask my cousin.

322
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,640
If she goes, we go.

323
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,270
No need to ask. If that Lu guy's
going, you know she'll follow.

324
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,700
But the rules have changed this time.

325
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,790
There'll be way more disciples than usual.

326
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,680
We've got to be extra careful.

327
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,979
Losing your life over this just won't be worth it.

328
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:44,000
Alright.

329
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,240
Let's go. Everyone's lining up to sign in.

330
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,460
Let's move!

331
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,940
Once it closes again,
it won't reopen for 60 years!

332
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,880
Senior Xiang, didn't they say
those signing up for the Trial Ground

333
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,460
should gather here?

334
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,740
Are we having the wrong spot?

335
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,530
Who are you all waiting for?

336
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,220
I'm right here.

337
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,420
Grandmaster!

338
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,680
Greetings, Grandmaster!

339
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,610
Quite a turnout.

340
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,020
Are you all ready to throw your lives away?

341
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,960
I'm not trying to scare you,

342
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,480
but out of thousands in our sect,

343
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,520
do you know how many have reached
the Foundation Establishment Stage?

344
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:53,264
Barely a hundred.

345
00:25:53,264 --> 00:25:54,720
And do you know why?

346
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,940
Because Foundation Pills are rare.

347
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,590
That's only part of it.

348
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:04,310
Listen, Qi Refining and Foundation
Establishment may be just one stage apart.

349
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:09,110
However, the gap between them
is like night and day.

350
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,030
That's why so many people, just like you,

351
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,440
all want to enter the Trial Ground,

352
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,790
hoping to get lucky.

353
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,550
And the result?

354
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,070
They die for nothing.

355
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,920
Forget reaching Foundation Establishment,

356
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,420
just surviving is a long shot.

357
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,160
So, if you haven't come with the resolve to die,

358
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,830
I suggest you leave now

359
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,270
before your cultivation journey ends here.

360
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,400
Of course, if you've heard me out

361
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,030
and still want to go, step forward.

362
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,890
Let's see who's got guts.

363
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,130
- Let's go.
- Wait... Hurry up!

364
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,110
You 13 guys here have heard the Trial Ground

365
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,780
won't open again for 60 years, right?

366
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,240
Not bad. Smart thinking.

367
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,310
Our Yellow Maple Valley has 15 spots this time.

368
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,160
Two are still open.

369
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,920
Me!

370
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,220
Count me in!

371
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,480
Can you handle it at your age?

372
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,400
I just can't wait another 60 years!

373
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,030
Fair enough.

374
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,550
That leaves one spot.

375
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,680
Alright then.

376
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,920
I'll count to three.

377
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,260
One...

378
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,330
Jumped early, huh?

379
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,030
You're only at Tier 11 of Qi Refining.

380
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,510
You want to die out there?

381
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,440
Grandmaster, I may lack talent,

382
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,790
but I don't have 60 years to spare.

383
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,570
Please grant me this chance.

384
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,640
Not bad.

385
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,920
Bold kid.

386
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,220
I like it.

387
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,350
Shame about the talent though.

388
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:24,760
Alright, the rest of you go home.

389
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,590
Grandmaster! I want to go too!

390
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,830
- Grandmaster!
- What were you waiting for earlier?

391
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,480
Get back for now.

392
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,440
If you still want to go,
wait for the next batch 60 years later.

393
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,160
I'll be 120 in 60 years, Grandmaster!

394
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,400
Please, give us one more chance!

395
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,920
There's still training and testing ahead.

396
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,680
If someone drops out, you may get called in.

397
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,030
Alright, enough. Head back.

398
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,020
- Go on, now.
- We're so lucky.

399
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,700
Getting picked today took some luck!

400
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,530
Everything starts with courage.

401
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,750
Congratulations.

402
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,050
You've passed the first round of my test.

403
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,510
Thank you, Grandmaster!

404
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,030
The Bloody Trial
is more than just a treasure hunt.

405
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,240
This is a mission that affects
our sect's standing among the Seven Sects.

406
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,660
It can shape our future power.

407
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,110
To make sure you all come back alive,

408
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,720
I'll be training you thoroughly.

409
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,680
This trip is extremely dangerous.

410
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,550
If you're having second thoughts,

411
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,200
now's the time to back out,

412
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,020
before you lose your life in there.

413
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,880
Inside, the weather's brutal
and wildly unpredictable,

414
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,070
with rugged terrain.

415
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,675
Many don't even survive day one,

416
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:39,890
brought down by nature itself.

417
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,270
You'll need to memorize these herbs:

418
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,890
Jade Marrow Mushroom,

419
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,420
Violet Monkey Blossom,

420
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,640
and Celestial Essence Fruit.

421
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,310
These are key herbs for the Foundation Pill.

422
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,480
The Trial Ground is crawling with demon beasts.

423
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,160
If you want those herbs,

424
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,350
you'll have to get past them first.

425
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:07,880
If you can't, you'll be their dinner.

426
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,480
The disciples in the Trial Ground

427
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,920
fall into three general categories.

428
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:16,200
First, the weak ones, like some of you here.

429
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,830
Some are forced to come,

430
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,880
others are just gambling on luck.

431
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,080
These disciples
usually don't survive the first day.

432
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,830
Second, those with decent cultivation

433
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,680
but not true experts.

434
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,790
Some of them cut corners.

435
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,480
They skip herb gathering and try

436
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,890
to kill others for loot.

437
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,350
But by day three, the cleverest among them

438
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:46,680
start vanishing in the Trial Ground,
without a trace.

439
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,720
That's when the third group shows up.

440
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,790
Grandmaster, what about the third group?

441
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:56,350
They're the ones who know how to bide their time

442
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,880
and hide their power.

443
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,350
When they finally strike,

444
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,920
they each reveal their true strength.

445
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,000
Grandmaster!

446
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,200
With all that said, which group survives the most?

447
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,270
Naturally, the third, the real powerhouses.

448
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,920
Wrong.

449
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,400
It's the first group.

450
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,780
The... the first group?

451
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,270
Standing out makes you a target.

452
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,400
Everyone entering the Trial Ground

453
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,750
has some kind of skill.

454
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,240
But without caution, even the strongest

455
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,030
end up dead and gone.

456
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,160
And the weakest?

457
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,640
They accept their limits early on.

458
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,790
And that often help them make it out alive.

459
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,940
"Hide cleverness with clumsiness."

460
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,340
We won't be cowards - "Do good with discretion."

461
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,160
- In the Trial Ground!
-  Never thought

462
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,260
-  everything Physician Mo taught me...
- Let's grab the most spirit herbs!

463
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,920
-  Would still hold up in the cultivation world.
- Let's beat Moonshadow Sect!

464
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,590
Let's beat Moonshadow Sect!

465
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,640
We'll crush Saber-Shearing Sect!

466
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,680
- Crush them!
- Crush them!

467
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,800
We're outpacing Spirit Beast Mountain!

468
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,160
- We'll wipe out Giant Sword Sect!
- We'll wipe out Giant Sword Sect!

469
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,440
Alright, that's enough.

470
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,240
I love the enthusiasm.

471
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,830
But I'll say it again:

472
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,850
what matters most is coming back alive.

473
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,500
Yes, Grandmaster.

474
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,400
The Solunar Purification Pearl

475
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,960
was crafted by our ancestors

476
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,960
specifically for navigating the Trial Ground.

477
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,200
It emits radiant light and suppresses
all manner of toxic mist.

478
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,240
In the Bloody Trial, there's an artifact

479
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
called the Solunar Purification Pearl.

480
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,030
It shines like sun and moon.

481
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,960
It worked so well in the Trial Ground

482
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,220
that the other six sects protested.

483
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,640
Our sect had to surrender it.

484
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,270
It became shared property of all Seven Sects.

485
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,730
After each Bloody Trial,
the sect holding the pearl

486
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,400
must pass it to the next.

487
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,890
This year, it's returned to our hands.

488
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,240
The Seven Sects agreed:

489
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,780
the pearl can only be activated on the fourth day.

490
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,310
So, Grandmaster, does that mean it'll be easier

491
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,850
to collect herbs on day four?

492
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,720
Quite the opposite.

493
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,110
Until the Solunar Purification Pearl appears,

494
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,440
you'll be relatively safe.

495
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,940
Once it's out, you better start hiding.

496
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,510
Why's that?

497
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,700
Because its appearance
signals the start of killing.

498
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,350
Think about it.

499
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,000
If you've spent three days

500
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,280
and still haven't found a single herb,

501
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,720
what will you do with limited time left?

502
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,370
Kill for treasure.

503
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,350
Now, I must pass the pearl to one of you.

504
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,780
Yan Ru Yan.

505
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,880
I won't let you down, Master.

506
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,750
How's your health lately?

507
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,000
Any more fainting spells?

508
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,240
Thanks for your concern, Master.

509
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,590
I've been much better.

510
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,160
Since joining the sect,

511
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,590
my old heart condition hasn't returned.

512
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,200
Even so, don't let your guard down.

513
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,790
I've studied the ancient texts.

514
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,590
To fully cure you,

515
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,880
you'll need a Dark Spirit Root cultivator

516
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,920
to balance your yin and yang.

517
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,480
Thanks for the care, Master.

518
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,480
But right now, cultivation is my only focus.

519
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,520
I'm not ready to think about marriage.

520
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,160
You had me stay behind.
I assume you've got a task for me.

521
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,640
You'll lead the team into the Trial Ground,

522
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,550
and guard the pearl.

523
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,640
There's one more task, something important.

524
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,050
What is it?

525
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,480
There'll be battles for sure during this Trial.

526
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,850
I'd better to prepare some solid artifacts.

527
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,880
I am Wang Yu,

528
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,420
shopkeeper of Treasure House.

529
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:55,270
My name is Li Fei Yu, a rogue cultivator.

530
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,160
I'm looking for some artifacts.

531
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,610
Price is not an issue.

532
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,680
Mr. Li, I like how direct you are.

533
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,270
Come on in. Brew a pot of top-grade tea.

534
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,000
- Yes, sir.
- No need.

535
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,920
I'm not here for tea and chit-chat.

536
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,790
If you've got nothing good, I won't waste my time.

537
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,980
Wait, Mr. Li!

538
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,720
This is a full set of Mother-Child Blades.

539
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,720
One mother blade, and eight child blades.

540
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,750
They're forged from refined steel and pure gold

541
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,790
by a master craftsman over three days and nights.

542
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,110
With the mother blade in hand,

543
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,000
you can control all eight child blades at once.

544
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,960
The enemy won't just be overwhelmed,

545
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,330
they'll lose their minds.

546
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,570
You'll be unstoppable!

547
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,960
This is the Mystic Iron Flying Shield,

548
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,960
a rare defensive artifact.

549
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,280
It's forged from mystic iron
mined in the icy land.

550
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,840
Not only is it tough, once activated,

551
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,890
it orbits your body and defends you automatically!

552
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,920
Tell me, Mr. Li, what have you been through?

553
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,780
Some big-shot battlefield?

554
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,810
Alright then.

555
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,840
No more pretending.

556
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,780
Let me show you my favorite little toy.

557
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,400
The Thunder Ball!

558
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,970
It's formed from condensed heavenly lightning.

559
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,030
Even a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator

560
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,700
will be blasted to dust if caught head-on.

561
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,970
Just gone like that.

562
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,740
It's rare, sure.

563
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,930
But it comes with a fine price.

564
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,450
You sure you can afford it?

565
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,930
Golden Glow Ganoderma?

566
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,190
That's not worth much.

567
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,620
Come on now.

568
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,030
Even one over a hundred years old

569
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,030
barely fetches anything.

570
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,620
Smell it again.

571
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,780
500? 500 years old?

572
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,320
It's 500 years old!

573
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,700
Alright, that's fair.

574
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,840
I want more.

575
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,970
Bring out your best stuff.

576
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,220
Close your eyes.

577
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,550
This is the Golden Brick Talisman,

578
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,340
our shop's finest treasure!

579
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,890
Only a cultivator
at the Core Formation Stage can craft one.

580
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,653
It's a bit slow to activate,

581
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:29,110
but it's far from ordinary.

582
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,230
Now tell me, Mr. Li.

583
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,680
Which treasure do you want?

584
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,580
I'll take them all.

585
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,070
You're talking like a real big spender.

586
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:49,850
But Mr. Li, aren't you mistaken?

587
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Yes, your herbs are rare,

588
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,660
but still not enough to trade...

589
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,710
for all of this.

590
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,660
Who said I only brought 500-year-old herbs?

591
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,290
1,000 years.

592
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,220
It's 1,000 years old!

593
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,320
Deal.

594
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,110
It's all yours. Including the table, the gourd,

595
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,970
and the tea set, take it all.

596
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,480
The Bloody Trial Ground is extremely dangerous.

597
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,760
We'll need to stick together.

598
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,880
Yes.

599
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,150
I'm not going with you.

600
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,920
I'll be moving solo!

601
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,330
Senior! What's wrong, Senior?

602
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,760
Enough. Don't just stand there!

603
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,440
Go get the Grandmaster, now!

604
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,060
Her old illness is acting up again!

605
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,360
I'm in the middle of nowhere,

606
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,110
perfect place to test my new artifacts.

607
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,030
Mother-Child Blades...

608
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,760
Lu Ming Yuan, I even gave you my Foundation Pill.

609
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,190
Now you're breaking off the engagement?

610
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,550
- Someone's there!
- Qiao Qian, was that really necessary?

611
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,030
If I can win Dong Xuan Er's favor,

612
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:26,030
then Grandmaster Hong Fu
may take me as her disciple.

613
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,550
Why will I still need your pill?

614
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,510
You're an absolute idiot.

615
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,110
Alright.

616
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:37,620
Soon enough, you'll see how
lucky you were to have me.

617
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,620
Get your hands off me!

618
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,000
My father will know we're done.

619
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,330
Keep dreaming!

620
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,260
Give me back my Foundation Pill.

621
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,840
Even if you don't,
the Chen family will come for it.

622
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,890
We're done here.

623
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,150
Easy, Qiao Qian.

624
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,480
No need to worry.

625
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,320
That's just my Wind Bind spell.

626
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,000
If you aren't the only heiress of the Chen family,

627
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,620
maybe I'll let you go.

628
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,030
But honestly, I'm worried you'll hold a grudge

629
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,850
and get back at me.

630
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,040
So I'll take your Foundation Pill.

631
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,892
As for you,

632
00:41:36,892 --> 00:41:41,100
it'd be best if you disappeared from this world.

633
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,180
How did scum like him
end up in Yellow Maple Valley?

634
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,989
â™« Shards of dreams inside a dream â™«

635
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:16,900
â™« A pale moon falls into mirrored skies â™«

636
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,340
â™« Years slipped by as I lingered on â™«

637
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,840
â™« Old scenes rise again â™«

638
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,201
â™« Too hard to forget â™«

639
00:42:26,201 --> 00:42:30,986
â™« Easier just to miss â™«

640
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:37,780
â™« They say the past fades like smoke â™«

641
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:43,280
â™« But looking back still stirs the ache â™«

642
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,910
â™« This noisy world, this lonely page â™«

643
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,400
â™« Swept away by time â™«

644
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,521
â™« Eyes once looked far â™«

645
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:56,880
â™« Now lost in the shift â™«

646
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,120
â™« Autumn winds stir â™«

647
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,600
â™« Smoke curls once more â™«

648
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,520
â™« Like clouds on the edge of sky â™«

649
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,600
â™« Returning to my eyes â™«

650
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,881
â™« Looking back from the mountaintop â™«

651
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:16,052
â™« Time lost its name â™«

652
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:19,320
â™« Was it yesterday â™«

653
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,380
â™« Or tomorrow? â™«

654
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,620
â™« The world has changed â™«

655
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,020
â™« Beyond recall â™«

656
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,140
â™« Time will fade â™«

657
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:36,505
â™« All the words ever spoken â™«

658
00:43:36,505 --> 00:43:40,275
â™« Only this longing remains â™«

659
00:43:40,275 --> 00:43:46,380
â™« Crossing centuries and days â™«

660
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,772
â™« In a fleeting moment â™«

661
00:43:49,772 --> 00:43:53,279
â™« we call eternity â™«

662
00:43:53,279 --> 00:43:59,172
â™« In a fleeting moment â™«

663
00:43:59,172 --> 00:44:02,999
â™« called eternity â™«
