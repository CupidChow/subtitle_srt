00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,340
Episode 2

5
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,180
Go ahead!

6
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:25,700
The

7
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,660
Night Immortal, with your power

8
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,100
to save us

9
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,460
can be saved

10
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,780
by Master beats

11
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,460
and

12
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,380
Aah

13
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,620
I found that the one who met with the demon was killed by him.

14
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,100
He tried to kill him.

15
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,940
I ran into him.

16
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,460
I wanted to escort Master Wu back to the cave to heal him,

17
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,300
but I didn't expect that he was still possessed by this evil person.

18
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,460
Don't talk about it.

19
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,380
I will not let him get away with it.

20
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,260
The last words that Master Wu left were for me to report to the Sect Leader.

21
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,860
He said that the demon was hiding a spy in the Seven-Tail Sect.

22
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,700
And that the Mount of Shards is very suspicious.

23
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,980
It was indeed him.

24
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,980
Han Daoyou.

25
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,540
This matter is very serious.

26
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,140
It's not something that you, a disciple of Zhu Jiqi, can interfere with.

27
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,980
I will send someone to investigate.

28
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,860
You should rest in peace and don't leak the news.

29
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,380
Yes.

30
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,060
I didn't expect that after a few years,

31
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,340
you not only got into the sect of Junior Brother Hua Yuan,

32
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,780
but also succeeded in helping Ji.

33
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,700
Thanks to Master and Uncle Shi for your usual teachings.

34
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,300
You are quite talkative.

35
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,340
Maybe I underestimated you in the past.

36
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,900
But don't forget that the path of cultivation is like a boat that goes against the water.

37
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,940
If you don't go in, you retreat.

38
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,500
You still need to continue working hard.

39
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,020
I will follow your teachings.

40
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,340
Don't forget to bury him inside the sect.

41
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,460
Let's go!

42
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,300
Uncle Wu,

43
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,580
is this still the girl I placed in your bed when you were dying?

44
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:40,840
the

45
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,240
cameras

46
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,440
I can't survive

47
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,800
if you hadn't reminded me to change the formation.

48
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
I can't live

49
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,920
in the last battle.

50
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,680
Look.

51
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,600
It's close to my cave.

52
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,360
The scenery is good.

53
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,760
There are the scenery you like,

54
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,600
the Western Liao River you like,

55
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,360
and the stone path you often take.

56
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,200
Han Li.

57
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,040
It's raining heavily.

58
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,520
What are you doing here?

59
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,960
Go back.

60
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,080
Damn until there're discrimination.

61
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Try a little more.

62
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,520
Take this,

63
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
you can call me Moshu

64
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,640
on our yearly festival.

65
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,320
Yah Nit.

66
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,000
Who can break the第二 with courage?

67
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Your spirit energy is too thin now.

68
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Send the spirit energy to the feet.

69
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Try again.

70
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Although your root is weak,

71
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
but you are on the surface of the Qin.

72
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
In ten days,

73
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
you will definitely succeed.

74
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Master Wu.

75
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
You are a person who truly loves me.

76
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Yan's Castle

77
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Yan's Castle will be destroyed in the future.

78
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,360
What do you think?

79
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Master, you are wise.

80
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Yan's Castle is the first defense line

81
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
of Yue's State against the evil.

82
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
If we are the first enemy,

83
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Yue's State will be in danger.

84
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
We will be exposed.

85
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Yes.

86
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
300 years ago,

87
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Yan's Castle was easily

88
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
separated from the six sects.

89
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
How could it be possible

90
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
to be in the same boat?

91
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
What is the right and wrong?

92
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
It's just the defeat of the king.

93
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
A thousand years ago,

94
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,360
the seven sects were just the rebels of the six sects.

95
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Now,

96
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
they are the right and wrong.

97
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Young Master Yan is seriously ill.

98
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
He is afraid that the seven sects will not listen to him.

99
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
What about the blood lilies that promised you?

100
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Are they really useless?

101
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Or are you afraid that Yan's Castle

102
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
will be destroyed

103
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
and the seven sects will become eight sects?

104
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
That's why they don't want to give it to you.

105
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
The six sects are always kind to

106
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,360
the people who are willing to give up their lives.

107
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,360
On behalf of my father,

108
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
the leader of the Ghost Realm,

109
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Wang Tian Gu,

110
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
hereby promises you that

111
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
if Yan's Castle returns,

112
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,360
the holy sect will treat each other with the same style.

113
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
They will cultivate resources and

114
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
learn from each other.

115
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
They can all share

116
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
and not separate from each other.

117
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
How about it?

118
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Isn't this condition

119
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
enough to seduce?

120
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
How can we trust you?

121
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Yes.

122
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
How can we trust you?

123
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Let's come in.

124
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,120
Immortal God,

125
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,120
you rationalized!

126
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
Theические Public Ladies of Deity,

127
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Shoukang in half a day.

128
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Since you are going to move可 Help

129
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
His Majesty the Chief into my place,

130
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
let's do it.

131
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Yes.

132
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
ginger.

133
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Surely you won't treat it as a fake?

134
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Wait.

135
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Bring it to us immediately.

136
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Wait!

137
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
If you want to do good

138
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
and bring it to us,

139
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
go in.

140
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Here is your evil will?

141
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Sting-dry behaviour.

142
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Your evil will.

143
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,640
Young Master Wang has made a bet with me.

144
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
In order to get the treasure,

145
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,320
he will sacrifice his life

146
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,320
to cure Yan'er.

147
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,240
I admire

148
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,760
such a good man.

149
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,040
You've been with me for years.

150
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,440
Why don't you trust me again?

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,720
I hope you don't forget your promise.

152
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,400
Don't let us down.

153
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,760
Of course.

154
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,400
We are a family now.

155
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,320
I hope you can help me.

156
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,400
After all, Yan's treasure and Ghost Realm

157
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,760
are one body.

158
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,040
They are a part of each other.

159
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,520
This battle

160
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,640
has been a big hit for Xinye.

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,600
So the wood she carved

162
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,920
is a puppet.

163
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,560
Don't move.

164
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,200
Something's wrong.

165
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,280
I'll eat Resourcemarine advertised,

166
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,440
and you try it.

167
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
It's good.

168
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,120
You prefer hospitality?

169
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,520
You always play itfly for my sake.

170
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,800
They are jealous.

171
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,200
If I pick you,

172
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,440
I'll feel jealous.

173
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,280
Don't go away.

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,800
Are you gonna go away?

175
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Are you gonna go away?

176
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,240
Ok.

177
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,160
Mine.

178
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,840
Senior.

179
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,400
Xifeng.

180
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,200
Xifeng.

181
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,160
Hongdong.

182
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,560
Hongdong.

183
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,000
Don't bother.

184
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,600
Zhibai.

185
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,840
This card is made of the bones of four-level beasts.

186
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,160
The only thing that can prevent you from exploring is your body.

187
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,960
No wonder I can't see it.

188
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,280
Okay.

189
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,280
Besides, old man.

190
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,880
A bottle of medicine can only be used to block the way.

191
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,160
Do you have to be so vigilant?

192
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,360
Look at you.

193
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,680
You're so lonely.

194
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,240
No wonder the male fairies don't come.

195
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Don't do this.

196
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,720
It's because the male fairies were injured first.

197
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,160
And then she fought with the evil spy.

198
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,120
She went back to heal her wounds.

199
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,120
Otherwise, it's your turn to be on the table.

200
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,200
I'm afraid I'll beat you.

201
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,480
They say it's a game of mahjong.

202
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,640
You just let the upper and lower families win.

203
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,600
You don't let the right families win.

204
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,560
I wonder if you think the same way about us three.

205
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,160
I'm the one who's not strict with the sect.

206
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,240
That's why the evil spy got into the forest.

207
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,160
So you've found out the spy?

208
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,840
He's a trainee named Zhongwu.

209
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,600
He brought the evil spy into the Blood Pond.

210
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,920
I wanted to ask him.

211
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,040
But he took a step away from the Lin Shoushan.

212
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,480
But I've already released the hunt.

213
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,480
A trainee who practices qi can take a step away from the Lin Shoushan.

214
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,800
He hasn't been found yet.

215
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,880
Xiaoji.

216
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,480
I'll do my best to find him.

217
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,640
To clear up Lin Shoushan.

218
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,720
And to give you an explanation.

219
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,640
What's the card?

220
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,760
Nine.

221
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,360
You mentioned Zhongwu.

222
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,160
I remember it.

223
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,640
There's a night-time Zhuji Qi cultivator under my door.

224
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,720
He's missing.

225
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,880
Before he disappeared, a disciple saw him.

226
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,040
He talked to two suspicious people dressed up as Lin Shoushan.

227
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,760
Touch the card.

228
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,480
Hurry up.

229
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,760
Could it be Zhongwu?

230
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,640
Sorry.

231
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,360
Nine.

232
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,760
Fu Yanzi, did you mention it?

233
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,400
I heard it.

234
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,560
But I'm playing.

235
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,080
Yes.

236
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,480
It's a business.

237
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,120
You're not preventing me from playing cards.

238
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,920
I won.

239
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Am I right?

240
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,200
You're stealing the card.

241
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,000
What are you doing?

242
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,480
Thank you.

243
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,800
Hurry up.

244
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,520
You.

245
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,200
Listen.

246
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,800
As my senior sister said,

247
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,680
Ye,

248
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,680
and Zhongwu,

249
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,400
there are many people like him in the Seven Sects.

250
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,120
So we should be more careful.

251
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,200
Including people like him.

252
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,600
What's wrong with me?

253
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,680
I'm just a small person.

254
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,320
Okay?

255
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,920
Sister,

256
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
your junior,

257
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,600
and brother,

258
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,280
we've been friends for years.

259
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,720
I'm the one who brought the evil to the world.

260
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,560
I don't know about others.

261
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,960
As long as I'm here,

262
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,760
I won't let the evil control Lin Shoushan.

263
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,560
Although there are many strange things recently,

264
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,640
I don't suspect you at all.

265
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,480
Please don't blame me.

266
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,120
Master.

267
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,160
You finally come to the competition.

268
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,840
I don't want it.

269
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,360
Uncle.

270
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,400
No.

271
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,160
I'm busy.

272
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,560
Go ahead.

273
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,680
It's business.

274
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,840
Go ahead.

275
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,360
Okay.

276
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,320
My son is so good.

277
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,120
Good?

278
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,280
Today's event

279
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,280
should be avoided by our disciples, right?

280
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,880
Why?

281
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,400
He doesn't care.

282
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,640
What did he say to us?

283
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,760
He's not interested at all.

284
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,840
Right.

285
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,080
My disciple

286
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,440
has just broken through the period of living.

287
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,120
Now his cultivation is not stable.

288
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,600
I'm so worried.

289
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,760
Sister, it's easy.

290
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,680
Just give him a lesson.

291
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,600
It's reasonable.

292
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,120
Master.

293
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,040
Uncle.

294
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,800
Brother,

295
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,640
let me give you this.

296
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,120
What?

297
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,320
Come on.

298
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,960
It's a good thing.

299
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,080
Sister, look.

300
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,480
Then we should send someone

301
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,320
to send some gifts to Huangfeng Valley, right?

302
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,880
There's a good news in Yan's Castle.

303
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,480
Sister, let me see.

304
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,760
The master of Yan's Castle

305
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,280
is going to marry his daughter.

306
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Ruyan is going to marry.

307
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,920
Good.

308
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,960
By the way, Wu Xuan.

309
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,560
You go and call all the disciples here.

310
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,520
Yes, master.

311
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:38,880
Come on.

312
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,480
You lied to me.

313
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,000
You can't.

314
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,400
It's all your fault.

315
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,240
Now you were numerous guests

316
00:16:46,240 --> 00:17:12,720
who tried to get the

317
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,640
It will take me half an hour.

318
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,320
I'll

319
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,660
затемdan Taehyun.

320
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,140
He Co-pilot

321
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,500
Da Li,

322
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,100
come here

323
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,580
Mister asked for me

324
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,220
You are here

325
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,800
Mister asked for me

326
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,100
He is waiting for you

327
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,800
Goacks goatt Herr

328
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,300
Why are you so low?

329
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,700
The young master of Yanjia Fort, Yan Ruyan, is about to get married.

330
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,900
This...

331
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,300
The Yanjia Fort master sent a wedding invitation.

332
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,900
All the sects are sending people to attend the wedding banquet.

333
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Your Uncle Hongfu sent Xuan'er to attend.

334
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,500
There's still one more place.

335
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,700
You guys can go see who wants to go.

336
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Senior Sister, drink some tea.

337
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,100
Look.

338
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,700
You're thinking about it like me.

339
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,700
Song Meng likes to fight.

340
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,900
Wei Niang is too naive.

341
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,500
Jing'er is too dumb and not good at changing.

342
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,700
As for you two...

343
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,300
Master, you know that I have low cultivation and am not good at interacting.

344
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,900
I don't know how to handle this task.

345
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
I'm not good at interacting.

346
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,500
This task is difficult.

347
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,100
Not only do I need to know etiquette, I also need to take care of Senior Sister Dong.

348
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,300
This task is most suitable for Sixth Senior Brother.

349
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,300
Come back. Come back.

350
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Who told you to go back?

351
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,100
What you said earlier is wrong.

352
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,700
Xuan'er is more important than you.

353
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,300
According to the rules, she should call you Senior Brother.

354
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,100
Also, I think that usually,

355
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,700
only you two can talk to Xuan'er.

356
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,300
So...

357
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,300
Senior Sister Zeyu,

358
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
you decide.

359
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,700
You want me to choose?

360
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,500
You decide.

361
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,500
Let's go with Han Li.

362
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,700
This kid looks ordinary.

363
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,900
He looks like a normal person.

364
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,700
Senior Sister, you have good taste.

365
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,900
This kid is usually very stable.

366
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
He has my shadow.

367
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
Okay.

368
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,700
Then it's settled.

369
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,300
It's settled.

370
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,900
If there's nothing else, let's go back.

371
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,700
Let's go. Xuan'er,

372
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,900
let's prepare the gifts.

373
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,100
Okay.

374
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,100
Han Li,

375
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,900
the gifts.

376
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,500
Hurry up and prepare.

377
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Senior Sister, let me send you off.

378
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,300
No need.

379
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,700
It's okay. Just go your way.

380
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Junior Brother Han,

381
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,100
it's beautiful to protect Xuan'er.

382
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,700
It's a big responsibility.

383
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,900
Let's go.

384
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,900
By the way,

385
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,300
prepare some decent gifts.

386
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,500
So nagging.

387
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,900
So unlucky.

388
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,100
I have to bring gifts.

389
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,300
No.

390
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,300
I have to get some benefits from Master.

391
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
I saw the people from Yanjia Fortress came.

392
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,100
Is Qing'er also back?

393
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,300
They came to deliver wedding invitation.

394
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,500
Wedding invitation?

395
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Yan Ruyan is getting married?

396
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,700
It's too sudden.

397
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,700
I only want to practice now.

398
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,500
I don't want to get married yet.

399
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,900
Master,

400
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,500
about the wedding.

401
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,700
This time,

402
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,900
you must take good care of your sister.

403
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,100
Don't let your Master Hongfu worry.

404
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,900
Master has orders.

405
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,100
I will do my best.

406
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
But,

407
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,100
Master taught me.

408
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,700
I only know one or two.

409
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,300
If I encounter danger

410
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,100
between Junior Sister and Senior Sister,

411
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,100
I'm afraid I can't do it.

412
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,500
You are

413
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,700
so arrogant.

414
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,500
You have a lot of tricks.

415
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,900
But you are like my apprentice.

416
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,500
Come on.

417
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
I did promise you.

418
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,700
After I get married,

419
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,900
I will find you another way.

420
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,100
It's all here.

421
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,300
Pick it yourself.

422
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Thank you for teaching me.

423
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,900
I can only pick one.

424
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,860
I saw it again.

425
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,860
It's Gui Yuan's Done at Heratta.

426
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,900
Gui Yuan?

427
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,100
Is she a ghost, no matter what she is?

428
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,900
Gui Yuan?

429
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,300
Is that so?

430
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,700
Did she hit me?

431
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,100
Is she a ghost?

432
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Durch the door.

433
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,300
Gui Yuan.

434
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,100
Dislaw of Lan Years.

435
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,780
The silver leaf and the golden leaf in the forbidden area are so similar.

436
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,580
I wonder what connection they have.

437
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,300
Master, I want to choose this.

438
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,100
You've chosen it?

439
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,900
Are you sure?

440
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,340
I'm sure.

441
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,020
You said so much work.

442
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,300
You chose a stall every day.

443
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
I didn't expect that.

444
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,100
Are you good-looking or lucky?

445
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,180
Lucky.

446
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,020
Fine.

447
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,500
Go back to the cave and prepare to leave.

448
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,300
Yes, Master.

449
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,700
He's my apprentice.

450
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:01,100
Are you ready to plant mountains to help you attack the Andrew for a good time?

451
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,620
Yes, Master.

452
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,220
Are you sure, Master?

453
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,300
All the golds in the forbidden field were those of cooks in Congratulations.

454
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,980
I think I've chosen the correct tree for my master.

455
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
This is the full version of Qingyuan Sword.

456
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,980
Qingzhu Fengming Sword.

457
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,980
This is the magic weapon of the Jiedan.

458
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,980
With twelve swords in one set,

459
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,980
the head is out of the brush,

460
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,980
and the power is endless.

461
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,980
If there is a day,

462
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,980
I can also use it.

463
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,980
Three-turn Chongyuan bow.

464
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,980
This is the support of Qingyuan Sword.

465
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,980
Practice to the sixth level,

466
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,980
strike the top,

467
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,980
and then release the bow.

468
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
After three times,

469
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
the Jiedan will be useless.

470
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,980
No wonder I started to release the bow

471
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,980
after the fourth level.

472
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,980
It turns out to be the support of the Jiedan

473
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
by suppressing the power with the seed.

474
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,980
I can't believe that

475
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,980
this kind of method can overcome the Jiedan.

476
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,980
This founder of Qingyuan Sword

477
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,980
is really a good idea.

478
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,980
But in this way,

479
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,980
I have to repeat the practice three times.

480
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,980
Can I do it in my lifetime?

481
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,980
It's a little boy.

482
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,980
If you don't open the door properly,

483
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,980
you will be under fire.

484
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,980
Han, it's us.

485
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,980
Han.

486
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,980
This tofu is big.

487
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,980
My tofu is really big.

488
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,980
Really big.

489
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,980
Really big.

490
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,980
It's really big.

491
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,980
It's really big.

492
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,980
It's really big.

493
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,980
Really big.

494
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,980
Really big.

495
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,980
It's really big.

496
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,980
Han, your tofu is good.

497
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,980
Isn't that the power of the eye?

498
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,980
The power of the eye?

499
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,980
It's true.

500
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,980
I can't let them see my little garden.

501
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
Senior, senior.

502
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,980
Look at this tree.

503
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,980
It's good.

504
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,980
There is actually this.

505
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,980
Senior, senior.

506
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,980
Why are you here?

507
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,980
Where is Sixth Senior?

508
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,980
Sixth Senior, he...

509
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,980
Han, have you thought about

510
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
bringing any gifts

511
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,980
to Yanjia Fortress?

512
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,980
I almost forgot about this.

513
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,980
We are here to give you an idea.

514
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,980
I heard that Yanjia Fortress's bride

515
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,980
is the cultivator of the eye.

516
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,980
You are good at taking medicine.

517
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,980
Why don't you train some

518
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,980
people who help with cultivation?

519
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,980
It's good for the gift.

520
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,980
It will be useful for training.

521
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,980
What you said is useless.

522
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,980
Yanjia Fortress is a married woman.

523
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,980
Han is also good at taking medicinal herbs.

524
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,980
He should take some

525
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,980
medicinal cream to nourish his eyes.

526
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,980
That's called being considerate.

527
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,980
Do you think everyone is like you?

528
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,980
You only know how to look in the mirror.

529
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,980
I just saw you looking in the mirror.

530
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,980
Really?

531
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,980
When did I look in the mirror?

532
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,980
You still do that every day.

533
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,980
Enough.

534
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,980
Let's talk about business.

535
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,980
Han.

536
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
No matter what gift you give,

537
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,980
remember that

538
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,980
you went there on behalf of Wang Fenggu.

539
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,980
I will follow Senior's instruction.

540
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,980
I have something to tell you.

541
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,980
Senior and Senior Sister

542
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,980
are so concerned about this wedding.

543
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,980
Why are they so desperate

544
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,980
in front of Master?

545
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,980
Well...

546
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,980
Of course we want to go there.

547
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
But Uncle Hongfu is not the one who gave the name

548
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,980
to let Dong Xuan go.

549
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,980
It's not convenient for us.

550
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,980
Dong Xuan is going.

551
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,980
Wu Xuan must go.

552
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,980
Yes.

553
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,980
We don't want to see

554
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,980
that fat face.

555
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
Look.

556
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,980
He will be like this.

557
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,980
Yes.

558
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,980
Senior Sister Dong Xuan.

559
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,980
Right?

560
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,980
Senior Sister Dong Xuan.

561
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,980
How many times have you said

562
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,980
not to talk about the sixth behind the back?

563
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,980
You always talk about the sixth.

564
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,980
Is he like this?

565
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,980
Is he like this?

566
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,980
Brother, you can't talk about the sixth.

567
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,980
What's wrong with you?

568
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,980
You should talk about it in front of him.

569
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
You are always talking about it in front of me.

570
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,980
What's this?

571
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,980
I have to use it if it doesn't work.

572
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,980
Black Iron Shield.

573
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
This is my treasure.

574
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
Where did you get it?

575
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
I can't stand it.

576
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,980
I will go with my son.

577
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,980
You can't go if you want to.

578
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,980
You have to accompany your family

579
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,980
if you don't want to go.

580
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,980
How about giving you some forest grass?

581
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,980
It's not that valuable.

582
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,980
I have a small green bottle

583
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,980
that I can grow.

584
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,980
You are so fast.

585
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,980
You are really giving it to me?

586
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,980
Take a good look.

587
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,980
This is my forest grass from the past hundred years.

588
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,980
It's very valuable.

589
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
You are really giving it to me?

590
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,980
I have a small green bottle

591
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,980
that I can grow.

592
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,980
You are really giving it to me?

593
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,980
Stop.

594
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,980
Brother Han.

595
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,980
Open the door and let me in.

596
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,980
I am Dong Xuan.

597
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,980
Open the door for me.

598
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,980
Brother Han.

599
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,980
Little guy.

600
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,980
You are so cute.

601
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,980
Are you also a friend of Brother Han?

602
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,980
I am also a friend of Brother Han.

603
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,980
My name is Dong Xuan.

604
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,980
Can you help me open the mirror?

605
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,980
Thank you.

606
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,980
Thank you.

607
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
Brother Han.

608
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,980
Brother Han.

609
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,980
How did you get in?

610
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Good.

611
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,980
You are so naughty.

612
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,980
Come here.

613
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,980
Ghosts have a charm.

614
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,980
Don't look at it.

615
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,980
Come here.

616
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,980
Come.

617
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,980
Wake up.

618
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
Brother.

619
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,980
I am here to get a piece of forest grass from you.

620
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,980
Every piece of forest grass I have is useful.

621
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,980
There is no extra.

622
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
Don't you look happy?

623
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,980
You are not happy to go to Yuanjia Castle with me?

624
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,980
Don't think I don't know what you are thinking.

625
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,980
You are the senior of the six realms.

626
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,980
You are taking me to the Taoism Trial.

627
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,980
Yes.

628
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,980
After all, you are the only one who is not bothering me in the whole Huangfeng Valley.

629
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,980
Of course, I will use you as a shield.

630
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,980
If I am not bothering you,

631
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,980
don't bother me.

632
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,980
Who is bothering you?

633
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,980
You are so boring.

634
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,980
Who is willing to go out with you to play in the mountains and water?

635
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,980
It's boring.

636
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,980
If it wasn't for Master saying that it's safer to go out with you,

637
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,980
I wouldn't want to go out with you.

638
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,980
Okay.

639
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,980
Let's make a deal.

640
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
If you go out and do your own things,

641
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
don't bother me.

642
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
Okay.

643
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
Can you do it?

644
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,980
You are always watching such a boring guy.

645
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,980
You are so pitiful.

646
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Master said that you should dress up for the wedding.

647
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
Why don't you go back and change?

648
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,980
I think it's pretty good.

649
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,980
I said it too casually.

650
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980
I'm going to change.

651
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,980
I'm going to change.

652
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,980
I'm going to change.

653
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
I'm going to change.

654
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,980
Oh.

655
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,980
Then I'm going.

656
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,980
I'm going.

657
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,980
I'll come back to play with you.

658
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,980
I'm going now.

659
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,980
Look.

660
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,980
Han Shili and Dou Shimei.

661
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980
They went to Yanjia Bao.

662
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,980
Han Shili.

663
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,460
That

664
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,980
is the gift you want to bring to the bride of Yanjia Bao?

665
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,980
Han Shili.

666
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,980
Do you know why I choose you and me to go on a trip this time?

667
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,980
Didn't you say that

668
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,980
I'm the one who is in the top row?

669
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,980
Yes.

670
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,980
But there are more important reasons.

671
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
Guess.

672
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,980
I can't guess.

673
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,980
Because you are the only one who can look at me normally

674
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,980
and talk to me as usual.

675
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,980
You can't blame anyone else.

676
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,980
After all, Shi Kelang can be attracted by you.

677
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,980
Not only Shi Kelang.

678
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,980
Look at those flowers and grass.

679
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,980
And your double sweet potatoes.

680
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
They all like me.

681
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,980
But sometimes,

682
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,980
I really hope that everyone can treat me like normal people.

683
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
Normal people's world

684
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,980
is much harder than you think.

685
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Besides,

686
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,980
those seniors and juniors

687
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,980
are all gossiping about you

688
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,980
because of your art of beauty.

689
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,980
Don't worry.

690
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,980
I was talking about it.

691
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,980
It turns out that you are the one who is the most beautiful.

692
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,980
You are the most beautiful.

693
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,980
I was talking about it.

694
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,980
In your heart,

695
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,980
I'm the one who can't make friends without using art of beauty.

696
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,980
You don't know it yourself.

697
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,980
My double sweet potatoes

698
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,980
can open my eyes for you.

699
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,980
I didn't use art of beauty on him.

700
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,980
It's useless.

701
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,980
I won't talk to you.

702
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,980
You look ordinary now.

703
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,980
You don't look good at all.

704
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,980
Great.

705
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,980
But I have to remind you.

706
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,980
You can't use art of beauty.

707
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
It's easy to cause trouble.

708
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,980
It doesn't matter if it causes trouble or not.

709
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
Art of beauty is growing on me.

710
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,980
It's not something I can decide.

711
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,980
Come on.

712
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Come on.

713
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,980
You're so beautiful.

714
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,980
Come on.

715
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
Come on.

716
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
Come on.

717
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,980
Come on.

718
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
I'm from the Yan's family.

719
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,980
Are you here for the celebration?

720
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,980
Yes.

721
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
So you are the senior and junior of Huangfeng Valley.

722
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,980
Wait a moment.

723
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,180
Even the card is made of jade.

724
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,420
It seems that Yanjia Bang is really a big city.

725
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,180
Sorry to keep you waiting.

726
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,980
This is the passcode in the city.

727
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,780
With this passcode,

728
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,980
you can enter the designated inn.

729
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,500
Keep it.

730
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,420
Senior Feng,

731
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,100
why is the card you gave us

732
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,220
different from theirs?

733
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,700
I'm really sorry.

734
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,820
This time, there are many guests

735
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,140
who are in the Youth Festival.

736
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,900
Now,

737
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,820
only the inn and the empty seats

738
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,740
are available in the lower city area.

739
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,260
I see.

740
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,700
Why can't we live in the upper city area?

741
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,660
Don't worry.

742
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,940
Except for the different locations,

743
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:54,780
all the inn

744
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,980
are personally selected by the owner

745
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,060
to receive guests.

746
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,220
The fireworks show

747
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,700
will be arranged in the city tonight.

748
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,180
You must enjoy it.

749
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,860
Thank you, Senior Feng.

750
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,700
Senior Feng,

751
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,540
is the guest room in the upper city area

752
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,700
really gone?

753
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,660
Feng.

754
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,260
Shi.

755
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,660
Shi.

756
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,380
Shi.

757
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,020
Shi.

758
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,820
Shi.

759
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,620
Shi.

760
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,860
Brother.

761
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,820
Damn it.

762
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,580
How can I let such a beautiful sister

763
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,700
live in the lower city area?

764
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,380
Isn't there another room?

765
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,980
Give it to me.

766
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,580
Hurry.

767
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,620
Sister, it's me.

768
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,860
Thank you, Senior Feng.

769
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,020
Who is this girl?

770
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,220
Are you blaming me

771
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,460
for using the charm again?

772
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,700
She is born with a beautiful body.

773
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,060
Could it be that she is related to that old monster?

774
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,820
Interesting.

775
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,140
It's time to

776
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,740
give this old monster a shot.

777
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,740
The main event is starting.

778
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,180
Don't look. Hurry up.

779
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,020
Xiao'er.

780
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:31,980
Come out.

781
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,260
Coming, Sir.

782
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,300
You two are together?

783
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,380
Yes.

784
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,780
I'm here.

785
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,380
I'm here.

786
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,100
I'm here.

787
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,900
I'm here.

788
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,740
I'm here.

790
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,540

791
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,540

I'm here.

794
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,540
I'm here.

795
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,540
I'm here.

796
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,540
I'm here.

797
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
I'm here.

798
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,340
We live separately.

799
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,860
Live separately?

800
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,220
But there is only one room left in the pen shop.

801
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,860
It doesn't matter.

802
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,860
You sleep.

803
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,860
I'll live in another room.

804
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,860
You just dislike me, right?

805
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,940
You want to get rid of me by using magic?

806
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,300
Xiao'er.

807
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,220
Go to the guest room.

808
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:06,860
Okay.

809
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,460
Okay.

810
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,020
Then we'll follow the three rules.

811
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,140
Don't care about anyone.

812
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,940
Don't come to me.

813
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,740
The seven disciples of the Seven Sects live here.

814
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,380
There is a patrol team at the door.

815
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,260
It should be a safe place.

816
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,260
Let her stay alone for a while.

817
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,860
I'll be quiet.

818
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,420
This friend

819
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,980
doesn't need to be bored.

820
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,060
Just coax him.

821
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,260
It's okay if you coax him.

822
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,740
The principle is

823
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,260
there is no night-time grudge.

824
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,860
Yes.

825
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,060
Please excuse me.

826
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,060
She is my junior.

827
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,060
She must be a good student.

828
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,060
She is a good student.

829
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,060
She is a good student.

830
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,060
She is a good student.

831
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,060
She is a good student.

832
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,060
This is not the truth.

833
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,140
It's not the truth?

834
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,940
No.

835
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Really?

836
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,500
You lost.

837
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
Give me the snacks.

838
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,780

We are not all.

845
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:25,720

Ninth...

848
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,720
Anyway

849
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,720
Some reason

850
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,900
and people have died.

851
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:50,840
No wonder there's many辛苦 or

852
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,060
The Lord of Yan took the initiative

853
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,780
to prevent the unconditioned and jazzed up

854
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,900
Mayday's wedding

855

859
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,600
If you are interested

860

Evil spirit?
