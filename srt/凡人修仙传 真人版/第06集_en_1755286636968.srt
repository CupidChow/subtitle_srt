OST title

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,480
â™« Chasing wind, I set out afar â™«

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,120
â™« The road ahead lost, my voice unheard â™«

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,169
â™« I've tasted joy and sorrow â™«

6
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:32,460
â™« Laying low, I plan every move â™«

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,160
â™« With a mortal heart and lingering ties â™«

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,740
â™« I'm roaming far and wide â™«

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,000
â™« A twist of fate in desperate times â™«

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
â™« A bond that outlives the dust of life â™«

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,900
â™« Still chasing what immortality means â™«

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:56,106
â™« Even eternity flashes by in a blink â™«

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,280
â™« Don't mock my ordinary life â™«

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,660
â™« I fight alone as chaos shakes the world â™«

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
â™« Don't scorn my humble roots â™«

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,480
â™« Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be â™«

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,881
â™« Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath â™«

18
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:18,123
â™« I hold the tide between life and death â™«

19
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:20,200
â™« Faith carries me through endless dark â™«

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,780
â™« And I return with a heart refined â™«

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,960
â™« Forged by trial, I rise through three realms â™«

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,520
â™« Reborn in the wheel of fate â™«

Title

24
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,400
I paid the right price for the right thing.

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,240
That's what a fair deal should be.

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,350
Fine. Then let me show you
what fairness really means!

27
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,030
Senior Lu, that fragment
of a magic item is dispensable anyway.

28
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,098
The spirit root test is coming up.

29
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:57,988
Better not stir up trouble.

30
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,160
All right.

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,470
Since you spoke up, I'll back off.

32
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,610
Kid, you won't be so lucky next time.

33
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,620
Let's go!

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,380
These clan disciples really are arrogant.

35
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,320
Thanks for stepping in just now.

36
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,790
I'm Han Yun Zhi.

37
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,150
What's your name?

38
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,620
Han Li.

39
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,430
Li, are you also here for the spirit root test?

40
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,470
It's about to begin.

41
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,590
Let's go together.

42
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,220
Sure.

43
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,510
Fellow cultivators,

44
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,180
this round of the trials is hosted
by Moonshadow Sect on behalf of the Seven Sects.

45
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,949
As long as you pass the spirit root test...

46
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:38,280
- Han! Over here!
- You'll have a chance

47
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,940
to be accepted into any sect.

48
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,510
- If your talent is exceptional...
- I thought you almost missed it.

49
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,050
You might even receive
invitations from several sects at once.

50
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,600
Then, the candidates get to choose
where they want to go.

51
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,560
Han, you all right?

52
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,630
Listen. In the cultivation world,
there's a clear hierarchy.

53
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,680
Low-level cultivators must not
look directly at those above them.

54
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,960
That one up there
is a grandmaster at Core Formation Stage.

55
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,460
Never stare at her like that. Got it?

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,520
So that's a Core Formation cultivator.

57
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,160
Yeah.

58
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,420
The slots are limited,
so make the most of this chance.

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,910
Yan Ru Yan.

60
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,280
Wood element. Heavenly spirit root. Passed.

61
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,120
Heavenly spirit root!

62
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,520
- She has a heavenly spirit root!
- That's amazing!

63
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,360
She's worthy of the heiress of the Yan Clan.

64
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,420
Looks like it won't be long before Yue Kingdom

65
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,610
gains another Core Formation expert!

66
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,910
All seven sects want her!

67
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,050
She's incredible!

68
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,540
I choose the Moonshadow Sect.

69
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,170
They say the Moonshadow Sect
is the strongest of the Seven Sects currently.

70
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,240
You blind fool!

71
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,550
How dare you steal from me?

72
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,190
It's just a trial. Don't let it turn deadly!

73
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,150
Leave it at that.

74
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,390
Fire-wood-element dual spirit root.

75
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,200
Passed.

76
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,000
I choose the Moonshadow Sect!

77
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,720
Later, I'm going with Moonshadow too.

78
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,870
Which one will you choose, Han?

79
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,640
I'm good with any sect.

80
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,600
I choose Yellow Maple Valley!

81
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,480
I pick Clear Void Sect!

82
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
I'm choosing Yellow Maple Valley!

83
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,760
I'm going with Spirit Beast Mountain!

84
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,640
I'm picking Giant Sword Sect!

85
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,500
Brother!

86
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,630
- I'm dying...
- You okay, brother?

87
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,540
Brother!

88
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,540
Water-fire-earth-element triple spirit root.

89
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,265
Passed.

90
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,070
Put him here.

91
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,750
Be careful.

92
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,380
It's okay. He's still alive.

93
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,360
You weren't accepted by the Seven Sects.

94
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,930
- Rejected.
- What?

95
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,400
Why is he rejected?

96
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,360
Why didn't they take me?

97
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,390
What do I lack compared to them?

98
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,980
So this is your so-called fairness, Seven Sects?

99
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,180
You truly forgot what you did?

100
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,160
I grabbed it!

101
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,190
Metal-water-fire-earth-element quad spirit root.

102
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,900
Rejected.

103
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,000
Han, it's all up to you now!

104
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,330
Kid, it's not your turn yet.

105
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,170
He's way too cocky.

106
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,160
Looks like your spirit root must be trash.

107
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,950
That guy holds a grudge.

108
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,920
How can trash like him
exist in the cultivation world?

109
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,480
Wind-element variant spirit root.

110
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,270
Passed.

111
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,690
I choose Yellow Maple Valley!

112
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,190
How boring.

113
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,900
That was too easy!

114
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,390
Qiao Qian.

115
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,950
Water-earth-element dual spirit root.

116
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,410
Passed.

117
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,490
Another one made it.

118
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,880
I pick Yellow Maple Valley.

119
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,490
Now give him the orb.

120
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,440
Wood-water-fire-earth-element quad spirit root.

121
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,180
Rejected.

122
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,120
Rogue cultivators always get rejected.

123
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,240
With a fake spirit root, yet dare show up here?

124
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,290
How shameless!

125
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,670
Totally shameless!

126
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,340
Embarrassing!

127
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,870
Wood-earth-element dual spirit root.

128
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,460
Passed.

129
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,060
- Han.
- We're up next!

130
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,910
I choose Spirit Beast Mountain!

131
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,700
This is the final cultivator
to pass the test today.

132
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,770
Didn't expect it. We're both outcasts now.

133
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,690
No need to feel down, everyone.

134
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,570
There's still the tournament at Tianwu Arena!

135
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,190
The tournament? Will that even help?

136
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,055
Even if we fight, as rogue cultivators,

137
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:16,210
going up against those clan kids raised on elixirs since birth,

138
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,910
what chance do we have?

139
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:21,300
Are we rogue cultivators doomed to always be trampled by them?

140
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,260
I can't just swallow this!

141
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,500
They keep talking about the same stuff.

142
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,690
Still, there might be another way.

143
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,322
I happen to have a clever plan.

144
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:32,340
But... I'll need everyone's help.

145
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,790
What plan, Sir?

146
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,480
We can't wait. Just spit it out!

147
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,450
- Sir, please tell us!
- No more teasing.

148
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,100
Mr. Wan, if we run into each other on the arena,

149
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,130
how do you think you'd fare?

150
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,740
Sir, you're really joking.

151
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,150
Your cultivation is way above mine.
Of course I'd lose.

152
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,770
Then...

153
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,000
what if I lend you this horsetail whisk?

154
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,180
It's a mid-grade artifact.

155
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,870
Well... I might have a 50-50 chance.

156
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,360
What if I also lend you this treasure?

157
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,272
Then... maybe... Oh, I'd have a 70 percent chance!

158
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:13,630
Great.

159
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,890
In the cultivation world, battles aren't just about power.

160
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,170
They also rely on artifacts, talismans, and pills.

161
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,460
In terms of strength and techniques,

162
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,920
we can't compete
with those arrogant clan disciples.

163
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,810
But there's one thing we have
that they don't, unity.

164
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,030
If our Azure Vein Society
had a hundred rogue cultivators,

165
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,050
and each one was willing to contribute a treasure,

166
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,140
then we'd have a hundred treasures in our hands!

167
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,780
With that many treasures,

168
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,950
even if we're facing Foundation Establishment cultivators,

169
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,850
we might still stand a chance.

170
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,410
Absolutely!

171
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,460
I'm willing to lend my mid-grade whisk
for everyone to use.

172
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,180
Qing Wen...

173
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,620
Since I brought this up,
it's only right I set the example.

174
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,900
I've said before.

175
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,390
The reason I founded the Azure Vein Society

176
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,260
was to build a world
where all cultivators are equal.

177
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,140
We'll show those clan kids

178
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,530
that rogue cultivators like us
are no less than any of them!

179
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,720
- Yes!
- Right!

180
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,440
- We're not weaker than them!
- They're nothing special!

181
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,810
See? You can't go wrong following this sir!

182
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,110
I know, even with all these treasures,

183
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,750
not everyone here will walk away victorious.

184
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,790
But as long as we give it our all,
even if we lose,

185
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,770
we'll make those clan disciples see

186
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,840
we rogue cultivators won't be pushed around!

187
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,600
We won't be pushed around!

188
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,790
We won't be pushed around!

189
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,500
Sir, even though I lack talent, I still want to contribute something!

190
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,020
Good!

191
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,900
Then, those who want to help, come with me!

192
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,030
All right!

193
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,380
- Let's go!
- Yes!

194
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,060
I'll contribute what I can!

195
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,800
- Take mine!
- Here you go!

196
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,890
- Take mine!
- So that's their plan all along.

197
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,820
Mr. Han, would you be willing to help?

198
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,401
After hearing what you said,

199
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:03,160
I've lost interest in joining the Seven Sects.

200
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,390
I won't join the tournament at Tianwu Arena.

201
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,830
My friend, this is our best chance to make a name for ourselves!

202
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,960
- Yeah, a golden opportunity!
- Totally!

203
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,350
- Do your part!
-  Looks like I can't leave today

204
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,860
without bleeding a little.

205
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,840
If you've got treasures, bring them out and share!

206
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,200
All right.

207
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,020
I happened to come
across a restorative pill.

208
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,910
I planned to keep it for myself.

209
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,550
But under the circumstances,

210
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,750
I'll share it with everyone.

211
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,620
Much appreciated, Mr.!

212
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,910
That's a good one.

213
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,820
Ugh, my stomach hurts.

214
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,810
I need to take a quick break.

215
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,920
You guys keep chatting.

216
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,270
Han!

217
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,730
You... You're fine?

218
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,110
I'm fine now.

219
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,620
Xiao Shan, are you here to talk me
into joining the Azure Vein Society?

220
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,170
Of course not.

221
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,740
But, aren't you planning to join
the Tianwu Arena tournament

222
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,780
and win yourself a Foundation Pill?

223
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,590
The Seven Sects are great, but I gotta stay alive first.

224
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,770
I knew it, Han. You're not one to go in blind.

225
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,080
Well, you weren't joining the fight.

226
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,610
So why'd you still share your treasure?

227
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,890
Just trying to win us rogues a little respect.

228
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,510
Xiao Shan.

229
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,380
I can't shake the feeling that those guys aren't as simple as they look.

230
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,550
With your kind of naivety, you'll get burned.

231
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,030
No way! All rogue cultivators are one big family!

232
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,180
You're overthinking it, Han.

233
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,630
With what we saved up earlier, we've got 38 artifacts now.

234
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,020
Qing Wen, why not take all this and run off now?

235
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,030
No. The barrier at the Tainan
Bazaar won't lift until the tournament is over.

236
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,240
We can't leave yet.

237
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:17,630
If those rogue cultivators give up
their treasures willingly, that's ideal.

238
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,270
If not...

239
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,460
Don't worry, Sir!
If they won't, I'll be the first to...

240
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,840
Yeah, we won't spare them!

241
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,550
How many times do I have to say it?

242
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,710
Stop talking about fighting
and killing all the time!

243
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,250
Get up.

244
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,270
Yes, Sir.

245
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,160
Step back.

246
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,250
Li!

247
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,050
I finally found you!

248
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,320
What is it now?

249
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,380
I've got more talismans here.

250
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,800
I want to trade for more pills. Would that be okay?

251
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,910
I've got Strength Boost Talismans, and Freezing Talismans.

252
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,790
These are offensive.

253
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,860
These ones are defensive.

254
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,770
This Vajra Talisman is amazing!

255
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,720
It can block a full-force strike
from a tenth-level Qi Refiner!

256
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,650
What about this one?

257
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,450
This is a Thunderfire Talisman.

258
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,380
It hits with both lightning and fire at once.

259
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,110
Look!

260
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,320
Maybe I'll get you two brand new ones.

261
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,080
That's weird.

262
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,800
I followed the book's instructions exactly.

263
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,060
Li, how about these two?

264
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,860
I guarantee they're top quality.

265
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,450
These two...

266
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,090
Miss Han, why do you need pills so urgently?

267
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,290
I want to cure my brother's illness.

268
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:06,130
Sorry, but your talismans
are not very useful to me.

269
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:13,610
Still, if you've got cinnabar and talisman paper, I might be interested.

270
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,910
You want to make talismans yourself?

271
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,000
Then you'll definitely need this!

272
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,170
This one is a Golden Bamboo Brush.

273
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,250
The tip is made from the tail hair
of a Level Two demon beast.

274
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,780
The shaft is forged from black iron
mixed with refined gold.

275
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,860
It was crafted using secret techniques
by a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

276
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,190
This is a must-have tool for talisman making!

277
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,830
A true rarity!

278
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,410
You're really selling it to me?

279
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,170
Honestly, it's a family heirloom.

280
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:02,160
But as you can see,
I'm terrible at making talismans.

281
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,870
So this brush is pretty much wasted on me.

282
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,620
How much are you asking?

283
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,620
Two bottles of pills. How about that?

284
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,780
I'll even throw in these talismans, ink, and this Talisman Compendium.

285
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,249
Deal.

286
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,080
Li!

287
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,620
I also have a Clear Stream Note.

288
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,070
It's got all sorts of funny stories
from the cultivation world.

289
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,070
I've read it already.

290
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,450
If you get bored, maybe it'll help pass the time.

291
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,190
I was hoping to learn more anyway. Thanks.

292
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,672
"Anyone holding an Ascension
Token can skip testing and join a sect."

293
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,425
"He may even get a Foundation Pill."

294
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:21,795
What's an Ascension Token?

295
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,210
Han! Let's go check out the Tianwu Arena!

296
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,820
I heard the sects have prepared
a bunch of rewards this time

297
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,250
to attract more participants.

298
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:20,770
The winner gets a Foundation Pill
and a ton of gems and techniques.

299
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:27,620
Xiao Shan, I got a book
with all sorts of cultivation oddities.

300
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,070
Not sure if they're true.

301
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,340
Want to check it out together?

302
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,900
Sure!

303
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,050
Come over.

304
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,430
Clear Stream Note?

305
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,200
What's this?

306
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,080
Looks like a token from some sect.

307
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,590
That's not just any token.

308
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,040
Look at the writing on it.

309
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,820
Ascension Token...

310
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,450
Ascension Token? What's that?

311
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,892
The Ascension Token is for...

312
00:23:20,892 --> 00:23:23,110
They say...

313
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,780
Well, I heard, if you hold an Ascension Token,

314
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,700
you don't have to fight, don't have to take the spirit root test,

315
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,890
you get straight into any of the Seven Sects.

316
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,310
Is that true?

317
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,000
Nonsense!

318
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,070
If that were true, everyone would be fighting over this token.

319
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,570
Who'd bother risking their lives
at the tournament?

320
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,490
Exactly. Sounds like a made-up story.

321
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,850
Grandmaster, you were right.

322
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,250
Several clan disciples
have reported their tokens stolen.

323
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,340
The Azure Vein Society never quit causing trouble,

324
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,680
even hit during the entrance test.

325
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,280
What should we do now?

326
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,000
So those rogue cultivators' missing
is really linked to them.

327
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,590
And now they're pinning it on the clan disciples.

328
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,100
Once the Tianwu Arena tournament ends, let's arrest them all.

329
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,700
Yes, Grandmaster.

330
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,480
Looks like this Ascension Token
is tied to Yellow Maple Valley.

331
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,060
Yellow Maple Valley...

332
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,490
They say it's one of the top sects
among the Seven.

333
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,900
What luck!

334
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,910
Nothing left to worry about now.

335
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,830
Charging in knowing you'll lose?

336
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,340
You think you're worthy of this Foundation Pill?

337
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,110
I've waited for this day for decades.

338
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:04,100
You clan kid, don't get cocky!

339
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,830
Who is this Qing Wen?

340
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,010
Why does he have so many treasures?

341
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,270
Is Lu about to lose?

342
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,980
No way. He's just about to win.

343
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,820
Sir, you went easy on me.

344
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,200
It's a test. Don't take it too far.

345
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,680
He already admitted defeat. Why try to kill him?

346
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,960
Grandmaster, please forgive me.

347
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,820
I didn't realize he had already surrendered.

348
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,380
You didn't realize

349
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,440
or was it because your opponent
was just some nameless rogue cultivator,

350
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,660
and you didn't care?

351
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,640
Thank you, Grandmaster, for standing up
for us rogue cultivators!

352
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,540
- Yes!
- Thank you for standing up for us!

353
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,040
Please stand up for us! Please, we need your voice!

354
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,780
I'm aware many rogue cultivators
have gone missing lately.

355
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,550
Our Moonshadow Sect will get to the bottom of it.

356
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,490
If anyone is found stirring up conflict
between rogues and clan disciples,

357
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,960
disrupting the order of the cultivation world,

358
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,040
I will not show mercy.

359
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,710
Lu Ming Yuan wins! Receives one Foundation Pill!

360
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,880
Senior Lu is amazing! You've got the Foundation Pill!

361
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,480
A cultivator's strength
doesn't just depend on spirit roots,

362
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,210
but also on artifacts, talismans, formations,
and pills.

363
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,300
Use everything you've got, plan carefully before making a move.

364
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,060
Lay low, then explode.

365
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,432
Maybe this is the path meant for me.

366
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:48,729
But in the face of overwhelming strength, all shortcuts are doomed to fail.

367
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,830
- Congrats, Senior Lu!
- Congrats, Senior Lu!

368
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,440
He got into Yellow Maple Valley too?

369
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,040
What are the odds!

370
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:13,010
Just one step...I was just one step from victory!

371
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:17,110
Qing Wen, that guy's a genius with a variant spirit root after all.

372
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,450
No need to go head-to-head with him.

373
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,620
We failed this time, but there's always next time.

374
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,660
Next time? You think chances like this come easy?

375
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,760
I told you,
we rogue cultivators are one big family.

376
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,890
Don't take it so hard.

377
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,520
- Enough already.
- You're making my heart ache.

378
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,040
Hey...

379
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,980
Listen, everyone. Don't be so down.

380
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,400
I heard if you find a certain item,

381
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,000
you can skip the tournament and still get into the Seven Sects.

382
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,480
- What item?
- What is it?

383
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,412
I think it's called...the Ascension Token!

384
00:29:54,412 --> 00:29:56,650
Ascension Token?

385
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,920
Ascension Token?

386
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,400
Sir, I was about to ask you.

387
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,620
Do you know about the Ascension Token?

388
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,862
The Ascension Token was
created by the Seven Sects.

389
00:30:04,862 --> 00:30:08,580
It was meant to reward
cultivation families who made great contributions.

390
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,210
It could be passed down for generations.

391
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,490
They say anyone who holds one can join any sect

392
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:17,100
without taking the test
and even get a Foundation Pill.

393
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,720
A Foundation Pill?

394
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,200
No test and a Foundation Pill? That's amazing.

395
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,160
But this thing hasn't shown up for centuries.

396
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,240
How do you even know about it?

397
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:37,092
I didn't know, but Han...He read about it in a book.

398
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,570
He asked you directly?

399
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:46,340
No... Not really. We were just casually chatting.

400
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,060
Where's Han Li now? Why isn't he here?

401
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,920
Han Li...

402
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,150
He's not around.

403
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,050
Weren't you always with him?

404
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,240
I don't really know him that well. I think he already left.

405
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,480
He left?

406
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,210
But the barrier's still active. Where could he go?

407
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,010
He... I...

408
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,870
My stomach hurts!
I need a bathroom break!

409
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,730
Why'd he run off? Is it really stomach pain?

410
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,790
You buying it?

411
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,170
Looks like this trip to the Tainan Bazaar
wasn't for nothing.

412
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,620
These treasures
will really help my cultivation later on.

413
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,960
So what if I have a fake spirit root?

414
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,010
With this Ascension Token, I've got nothing to worry about!

415
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
I'll just stay hidden till morning.

416
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,480
Once the barrier lifts, I'll head straight to Yellow Maple Valley.

417
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,940
He's there! Hurry!

418
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,540
Stop! Stop running!

419
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,800
Get him! Stop!

420
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,700
Stop! He's there! Quick!

421
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,350
Han! Han!

422
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,010
Han!

423
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,350
Xiao Shan!

424
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,900
Xiao Shan! What happened?

425
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,790
Han... Run!

426
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,770
Qing Wen and his men are bad guys...

427
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,300
I'm sorry...

428
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,520
I... I got you into trouble...

429
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,010
The Ascension Token has been exposed.

430
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,050
Han! Why are you running?

431
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,490
Stay and have a drink with us!

432
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,970
Nowhere to run now, huh?

433
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,830
You two, why are you after me?

434
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,400
What do you think?

435
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,830
At this point, Han, you can drop the act.

436
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,070
Han, you're being awfully selfish.

437
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:38,750
You got a treasure like the Ascension Token, but won't even let us take a look?

438
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,240
Ascension Token?

439
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,550
What is that?

440
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,450
Never heard of it!

441
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:47,050
You're trying to rob and kill someone
in broad daylight.

442
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,740
Aren't you afraid the Seven Sects' punishment?

443
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,230
Enough talk.

444
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:56,260
Take him down first, then search his body.

445
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,110
Where did he go?

446
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,590
Find him!

447
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,150
This won't work if it keeps up.

448
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,520
That Qing Wen guy is still hiding in the shadows.

449
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,260
Han,

450
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,790
I see you!

451
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,800
Stop hiding!

452
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,840
Come out!

453
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,210
A high-grade artifact!

454
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:18,860
Qing Wen! Help me!

455
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,680
Qing Wen!

456
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,390
I knew you'd show up!

457
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:48,282
Wan Xiao Shan was killed by you?

458
00:37:48,282 --> 00:37:50,380
He was a good man.

459
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,580
But good men die too.

460
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,320
You lost your men too.

461
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,110
Why didn't you save them?

462
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,820
I had a feeling you had something up your sleeve.

463
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,960
So I let them go first.

464
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,010
Looks like I was right.

465
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,760
I get it now.

466
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,490
There are three of you
but only one Ascension Token.

467
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,410
You're a clever guy.

468
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,920
Ping Gu and I go way back.

469
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,550
If this weren't about the path to ascension, I wouldn't have let her die.

470
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,660
You really are a complete villain.

471
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,590
Han... that Flying Sword Talisman is your last trick, right?

472
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,420
What do you think?

473
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,590
This is Tainan Valley!

474
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,400
If you kill me here,
aren't you afraid you'll get caught?

475
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,550
You showed up out of nowhere,
clearly up to no good.

476
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,200
All I have to say is you snuck in here,

477
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,990
killed Wan Xiao Shan, Wu Jiu Zhi, and Ping Gu.

478
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,960
I'll kill you to avenge them.

479
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,660
Do you think the other rogues will believe you
or believe me?

480
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,550
Fine!

481
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,670
Then, I'll use the token as bait.

482
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,480
Whoever kills you, gets it!

483
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,880
You!

484
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,630
You'd throw your life away over a token?

485
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,550
You're still young.

486
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:33,520
You don't understand what this means
to us rogue cultivators...

487
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,990
Who's there?

488
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,740
So, you're Daoist Qing Wen?

489
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,820
Looks like you're dying.

490
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,750
But my master said you can't die just yet.

491
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,840
Which means he'll have to die instead.

492
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,960
What stage is that guy in?

493
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,510
I can't even track his movements.

494
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,440
If I get caught, I'm dead for sure.

495
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,110
I have to run!

496
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,510
Who are you, sir?

497
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,710
You founded the Azure Vein Society?

498
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,292
Interesting...

499
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:55,930
I'm just trying to stay alive.

500
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,470
That guy earlier had the real treasure.

501
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:04,100
If you can spare me, I'll question him myself and hand over the treasure!

502
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,460
Ascension Token?

503
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,970
A crumb tossed by the Seven Sects.

504
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,540
You call that a treasure?

505
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,260
Are you interested...

506
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,260
in becoming a Foundation Establishment cultivator?

507
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,110
Foundation...

508
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,230
Senior, if you can help me
step into the Foundation Establishment stage,

509
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,680
I, Qing Wen, will give my life to repay you!

510
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,592
Senior...

511
00:42:34,592 --> 00:42:40,070
Even on death's door,
you're still dreaming of that?

512
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,880
Please, help me!

513
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,410
Fine.

514
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,220
I felt a dark aura!

515
