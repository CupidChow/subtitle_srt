1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,760
♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫

2
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,120
♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,114
♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫

4
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:32,499
♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫

5
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:36,200
♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,000
♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,998
♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫

8
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:46,510
♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫

9
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,648
♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫

10
00:00:50,648 --> 00:00:56,206
♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,296
♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫

12
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:05,589
♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,240
♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,505
♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫

15
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:15,720
♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,920
♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,160
♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,120
♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫

19
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:29,960
♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,580
♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,980
Violet Monkey Blossom.

22
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,690
Celestial Essence Fruit.

23
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,340
Jade Marrow Mushroom.

24
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,230
Being born to a prestigious clan
sure is a privilege.

25
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,160
While Senior Chen failed to get anything
in the Bloody Trial Ground,

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,070
she nonetheless obtained two Foundation Pills

27
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,600
thanks to her family.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,230
For those who were born to cultivate,

29
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,220
two pills will probably suffice.

30
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,030
But knowing my lack of talent,

31
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,030
I need more than ten Foundation Pills

32
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,890
to even stand a chance.

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,530
It works!

34
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,420
The quality is good too.

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,080
♫ That day I first saw you... ♫

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,970
Right.

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,765
♫ We made a promise to reunite ♫

38
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:58,900
♫ And walked into the unknown ♫

39
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,380
♫ But now that we've met again... ♫

40
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,260
♫ Only silence fills the space
as we lock eyes... ♫

41
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,963
Let me try two first.

42
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,620
♫ With no way to know when we'll return... ♫

43
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,180
These pills are too intense.

44
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,300
♫ So be it, I set myself free ♫

45
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,500
♫ To be one who stands tall
between heaven and earth ♫

46
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,540
♫ Never let yourself become a hollow husk
of what you once were ♫

47
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,640
♫ The ones before once told me ♫

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,480
♫ There's still hardship ahead... ♫

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,850
How long has it been?

50
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,500
♫ Even though it mocks loudly ♫

51
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,660
♫ We're just fleeting mortals ♫

52
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,150
♫ Time slipped by before we knew... ♫

53
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,435
I feel warm.

54
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:00,780
Is it the residual effect from the pills?

55
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,940
♫ Into this starry sky ♫

56
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,140
♫ Starlight fades into the Milky Way ♫

57
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,380
♫ While the mayfly dies in the whirlpool... ♫

58
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,740
Again.

59
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,560
♫ Playing the fleeting game of life ♫

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,920
♫ Each step of fate's game unclear... ♫

61
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,890
To build a foundation
is to shed your skin,

62
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,761
to rearrange your physique,

63
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:36,571
and to condense qi into liquid.

64
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,940
♫ Through all the joy and sorrow ♫

65
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,480
♫ How do I choose the way... ♫

66
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,330
This hurts so much!

67
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:18,920
Yan Ru Yan, I invested so much to achieve this.

68
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,650
Don't you let me down now.

69
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,090
Elder Liu.

70
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,800
- My Lord.
- You came at the right time.

71
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,800
His technique works wonders on Yan.

72
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,360
He said he could wake Yan up

73
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,681
if I promised him one thing.

74
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:52,950
What does he want?

75
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,270
- He wants Yan to be his wife.
- No. You cannot trust him.

76
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,950
Let alone let him marry your daughter.

77
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,870
Elder Liu, what do you mean?

78
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,730
You brought him here, didn't you?

79
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,140
May we speak privately?

80
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,870
I just saw the technique he used to heal Miss Yan.

81
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,870
It is an evil art that absorbs others' power.

82
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,361
Not only is it against nature,

83
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:22,070
but it might bring about dire consequences too.

84
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,799
Enough.

85
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:26,950
I've always respected your advice, but this time,

86
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,240
he's my only choice.

87
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,260
My Lord!

88
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,510
That man merely saw Young Lady once

89
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,750
and decided to marry her.

90
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,720
He's extorting you.

91
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,870
I'm sure he wants more out of our clan.

92
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,460
Please think twice, My Lord.

93
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,750
Elder Liu, do you think I'm sacrificing
our clan to save Yan?

94
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,870
On the contrary,
I'm trying to save our clan's future.

95
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,870
What holds the Seven Sects together

96
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,040
is not the disciples or various resources,

97
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,140
but the elusive Nascent Soul Stage elders.

98
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,720
Everything below the Nascent Soul Stage

99
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,850
is as puny as ants.

100
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Yan is bestowed with the heavenly spirit root.

101
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,270
She is the only one in our clan
who can possibly attain the Nascent Soul Stage.

102
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,780
She is our only hope

103
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,290
to leverage against the Seven Sects.

104
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,970
Elder Liu, surely you know about this.

105
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,000
If you've made up your mind,

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,750
there's no need for me to convince you otherwise.

107
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,680
But please give me some time

108
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,750
to investigate his background with others.

109
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,040
Even commoners ask about the groom's family

110
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,290
when they marry their daughters off.

111
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,360
Fine.

112
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,160
But Yan doesn't have much time.

113
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,390
Make it quick.

114
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,610
Understood.

115
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,850
Elder Liu.

116
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,870
What do you want exactly?

117
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,560
This isn't what we agreed upon.

118
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,920
What I want isn't important.

119
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,610
What's important is

120
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,700
how we do it.

121
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,040
We had a deal.

122
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,510
I put in good words for you in front of Lord Yan

123
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,700
and you'll pay me 1,000 gems.

124
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,940
You are so eager, aren't you?

125
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,490
I... I just want to know
where my gems are.

126
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,900
Relax.

127
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,140
The gems are ready.

128
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,840
Now that I have the gems, we are even.

129
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,510
I'll leave the Yan Clan Stronghold now.

130
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,645
I have nothing to do with what you do here.

131
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:38,670
Wait.

132
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,930
Why the hurry?

133
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,410
Are you going

134
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,570
to snitch me out to the other sects?

135
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,360
My Lord, Elder Liu hasn't returned after he left

136
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,720
to meet the target.

137
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,740
I fear the worst has happened.

138
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,630
I see.

139
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,720
You're dismissed.

140
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,690
- My Lord, should I...
- Just go.

141
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,530
Come out already.

142
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,510
Your reputation precedes you, Lord Yan.

143
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,150
As expected of the only Core Formation
Stage cultivator of your clan in the last century.

144
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,870
Your spirit sense is impressive.

145
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,550
Be it treating or betrothing Yan,

146
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,390
they are just your pretexts.

147
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,690
Tell me your real objective.

148
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:24,410
Lord Yan, do you remember
the promise centuries ago?

149
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,390
Of course.

150
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,410
Were it not for our shared past, do you think

151
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:36,309
I would still keep you alive now?

152
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,320
You sure are a sentimental person.

153
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,870
In that case, why don't we
continue our shared history

154
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,910
so the Yan Clan can return to its rightful master?

155
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,570
My father is thirsty
for someone powerful like you.

156
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,120
You must be joking.

157
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,030
My clan has settled down in the Yue Kingdom.

158
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,080
We left the Ghost Spirit Sect 300 years ago,

159
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,020
and we don't plan to return.

160
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,740
You're mistaken, Lord Yan.

161
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,780
What I mean is

162
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,270
the Seven Sects have ruled the Yue Kingdom
for long enough.

163
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:24,150
My sect can help you
become the future ruler of Yue.

164
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:29,500
When that happens, you won't have to beg
for one spirit herb.

165
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,720
Truth be told,

166
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,270
the Six Demonic Sects have rallied armies

167
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,960
and will attack soon.

168
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,630
The Seven Sects will turn into dust.

169
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,600
Alas, the Yan Clan Stronghold
is located on the border.

170
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,690
It will feel the brunt of the invasion.

171
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,260
What will become of it?

172
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,720
The war hasn't begun.

173
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,100
No one knows who the victor is yet.

174
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,870
Isn't it arrogant of your father

175
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,570
to ask me to take his side now?

176
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,150
Besides, your father has sired many children.

177
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,600
His sister, Hong Fen, is still there.

178
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,650
Do you truly have a say in regards

179
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,450
to your sect's matters?

180
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,900
Lord Yan,

181
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,840
this is both my father's and my wish.

182
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,220
Look.

183
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,080
An exceptionally rare dark spirit root?

184
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,450
Exactly.

185
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,960
Your daughter is born
with the heavenly spirit root.

186
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,390
And I have the dark spirit root.

187
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,980
We make the best pair
to study the Blood Spirit Spell.

188
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,320
And knowing her potential and mine,

189
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,450
we're likely to attain the Nascent Soul Stage,
let alone the Core Formation Stage.

190
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,960
Imagine this.

191
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,480
Your clan will have
two Nascent Soul Stage cultivators.

192
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,840
You will be stronger than the Seven Sects.

193
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,260
Additionally...

194
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,510
Additionally, I promise that our child

195
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,380
will become the successor
of both my sect and your clan.

196
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,260
You come up with this plan yourself?

197
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,080
I will take over my sect.

198
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,390
But I need you as my ally,

199
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,290
more so than my father or Aunt Hong Fen.

200
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,500
I ask for your

201
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,170
cooperation.

202
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,740
Will you swear

203
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,570
a Truedeath Oath with me?

204
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,750
Han Li.

205
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,570
Could it be him?

206
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,170
This is the last pill.

207
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,900
I have to make this work.

208
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,030
By swallowing this golden pill,

209
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,570
I shall defy my predestined fate!

210
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh, no.

211
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,390
If I don't put the extra
power within me to use,

212
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,330
my body will be overwhelmed.

213
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,860
Qingyuan Sword Manual!

214
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,270
Did I do it?

215
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,160
I've also reached Tier Four
of the Qingyuan Sword Manual.

216
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,310
Despite my fake spirit root,

217
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,090
I'm now in the Foundation Establishment Stage.

218
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,810
One Foundation Pill left.

219
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,000
Chen Qiao Qian, stop getting distracted.

220
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,570
You can't let your family down again.

221
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,880
I can't stand it anymore.

222
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,640
- What's wrong?
- What's the matter?

223
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,420
I'm sick of it.

224
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,270
I know. He's sick of you.

225
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,880
Me? What did I do?

226
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,360
All you do is stare at the sky

227
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,000
in hopes that Xuan Er will appear.

228
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,750
Pot calling the kettle black.

229
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,200
You keep staring at Senior Liu too.

230
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,330
No, I didn't.

231
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,000
What's so good about dating anyway?

232
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,130
You might as well use the time to cultivate.

233
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,740
Look over there.

234
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,660
It seems our sect has one more...

235
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,640
No. Two more Foundation
Establishment Stage cultivators.

236
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,370
Wonderful!

237
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,830
Mentor Xu.

238
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,872
I saw a column of light here just now.

239
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:26,393
Did someone reach the Foundation
Establishment Stage as well?

240
00:21:26,393 --> 00:21:28,400
Han Li did it.

241
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,260
Who would have thought?

242
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,640
He and his fake spirit root
have proved so many people wrong.

243
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,880
Where is he now?

244
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,030
He just left.

245
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,880
You arrived a second too late.

246
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,090
He is... You're just as impatient as he is.

247
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,830
Han Li!

248
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,110
Han.

249
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,750
- Wait.
- Senior Chen?

250
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,830
Han.

251
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,030
Congratulations. You have reached
the Foundation Establishment Stage.

252
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,740
Likewise.

253
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,400
You saved me that day, didn't you?

254
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,000
What do you mean?

255
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,980
You killed Senior Lu
before the Bloody Trial Ground.

256
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,920
Quit joking around, Senior Chen.

257
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,480
Senior Lu is an excellent
Qi Refining Stage cultivator.

258
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,350
I am not strong enough to kill him.

259
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,240
But you escaped the dangerous

260
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,880
Bloody Trial Ground unscathed.

261
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,720
Grandmaster Li even took you in as his disciple.

262
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,070
It was just a stroke of luck.

263
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,420
I have things to do. Farewell.

264
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,830
Why won't you admit that you saved me?

265
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,020
I should have given her more Oblivion Pills.

266
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,050
I know it was you even if you don't admit it.

267
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,160
Can you feel it?

268
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,590
Do you know I'm performing cupping on your back?

269
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,920
It will remove the cold energy

270
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,030
and the bad energy from you.

271
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,270
All of it.

272
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,680
You're not doing it properly.

273
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,370
I don't think Han Li did this
when he was helping me.

274
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,720
If you're this good, do it yourself.

275
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,330
If I can do it myself, I won't ask you for help.

276
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,700
Mentor Ma.

277
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,550
Mentor Wu.

278
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,050
You've attained
the Foundation Establishment Stage?

279
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,750
Not too shabby.

280
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,110
You've attained
the Foundation Establishment Stage.

281
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,940
Nice one.

282
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,240
It's all thanks to you, Mentor Ma.

283
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,700
I wouldn't have achieved what I did
had you not let me tend to this garden.

284
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,960
Then, you should address me differently now.

285
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,960
Call me Senior Ma.

286
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,680
Now that you're
in the Foundation Establishment Stage,

287
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,180
my garden is of no use to you.

288
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,290
Pack up and find your master now.

289
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,070
Go.

290
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,510
Go now.

291
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,020
Make haste.

292
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,080
♫ The ripples disappear into the river ♫

293
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,840
♫ My robe is soaked under the drizzle ♫

294
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,577
♫ I drink alone
as the moonlight melts with the liquor ♫

295
00:24:57,577 --> 00:25:01,080
♫ The current flows swiftly,
the mountains weigh heavily... ♫

296
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,977
They say you see things differently

297
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:04,942
once you're in the Foundation Establishment Stage.

298
00:25:04,942 --> 00:25:09,202
But all I see are familiar scenes.

299
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,340
♫ The breeze brushes through the corridor ♫

300
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,131
♫ As the swallows whisper overhead ♫

301
00:25:18,131 --> 00:25:23,980
♫ The setting sun graces the bamboo forest
for whom do I harmonize? ♫

302
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,880
♫ Leaning against the rails,
water ripples below me ♫

303
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,600
♫ The wind whispers to the forest ♫

304
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,199
♫ I wander into the dream
under the clear galaxy... ♫

305
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,070
I won't forget you, Herbs Garden.

306
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,663
Just go!

307
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:41,800
♫ This journey that spans across the universe ♫

308
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,400
♫ Feels both familiar and unfamiliar ♫

309
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,225
♫ Looking at the various faces of our world ♫

310
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:53,280
♫ Each word, each utterance ♫

311
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,880
♫ Carries the hopes of a lifetime... ♫

312
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,980
Come up.

313
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,240
You can't bring those weary eyes of yours.

314
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,810
Present yourself properly.

315
00:26:08,426 --> 00:26:09,966
Again.

316
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,090
Come up.

317
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,640
Greetings, I am Han Li.

318
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,180
You're greeting your master. You have to kneel.

319
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,110
Greetings, I am Han Li.

320
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,440
All right. Get up.

321
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,890
Thanks, Master.

322
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,201
As per our tradition, before Master takes you in,

323
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,871
I have to give you a test.

324
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:49,070
I am but an average disciple.

325
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,160
I ask for your leniency.

326
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,440
Relax.

327
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,090
It's just a simple test.

328
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,680
If you can understand my flute notes,

329
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,920
I consider you passed.

330
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,500
Close your eyes.

331
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,700
Open your eyes.

332
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,570
What did you hear?

333
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,402
Silence speaks louder than words.

334
00:27:28,402 --> 00:27:31,000
You passed. In the Foundation Establishment Stage,

335
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,310
you will be able to sense the power in all beings.

336
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,510
It's as if you have one more sense
on top of your five senses.

337
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,460
Do not forget this.

338
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,880
Thank you, Senior.

339
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,330
My turn now.

340
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,070
Remove the bird's ability to fly
without hurting it.

341
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,740
Then, you'll pass.

342
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,960
How kind of you, Senior.

343
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,260
You wanted me to help you
free a trapped bird, right?

344
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,720
Yes.

345
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,790
Since Senior Liu approves of you,

346
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,440
I consider you passed.

347
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,330
All right. It's my turn now.

348
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,400
Dodge all three of my sand pouches.

349
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,350
Then, you'll pass.

350
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,780
Here I go.

351
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:32,160
Good.

352
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,270
You passed.

353
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,400
Listen up.

354
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,590
Cultivation is important.

355
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,750
But don't forget to train your body as well.

356
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,550
If you live a long life and don't move a lot,

357
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,330
you're no different from a tortoise.

358
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,180
It's my turn now.

359
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,740
- Enough, Wu Xuan.
- No. He's better than this.

360
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,090
Tier Four?

361
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,030
Upon reaching Tier Four
of the Qingyuan Sword Manual,

362
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,160
you can guard against blades automatically.

363
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,480
The manual states that when attacked,

364
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,350
the shield will block any blades.

365
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,750
You've reached Tier Four of the manual?

366
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,030
Don't you know you should stop at Tier Three?

367
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,020
Did you feel something off
when you were cultivating?

368
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,440
My progress slows down a lot at Tier Four.

369
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,400
After a while, the spirit power I gathered

370
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,070
will slowly disappear.

371
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,180
It's the dissipation.

372
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,680
Dissipation?

373
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,240
Upon reaching Tier Four
of the Qingyuan Sword Manual,

374
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,420
your power dissipates every few days.

375
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,640
But Master didn't tell me about this
when he taught me.

376
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,750
Calm down, Han.

377
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,030
At Tier Four, only 1/10 of your power
will dissipate.

378
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:07,480
At Tier Five, another 1/10 of your power
will dissipate.

379
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,370
That's too much.

380
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,920
I trained so hard to reach Tier Four

381
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,090
just for it to backfire on me?

382
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,350
It is a flawed but unique technique.

383
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,510
I was told that each tier you reached

384
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,160
would expand your Meridian system

385
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,880
and deepen your energy pool.

386
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,640
You will have much more power reserve
than your peers.

387
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,720
That's right.

388
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,610
Perhaps this is why your power dissipates.

389
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,720
Unfortunately, the manual we have is incomplete.

390
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,980
The sect only possesses
the first nine tiers of the manual.

391
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,420
What do I do?

392
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,260
Master, Han Li is here.

393
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,920
He is?

394
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,720
Right away. I'm coming.

395
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,780
Give me a moment.

396
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,200
Greetings, Master.

397
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,750
Forget it.

398
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,920
At ease.

399
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,700
It's a hassle. Just get up.

400
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,530
As cultivators, we seek simplicity.

401
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,440
From now on, you are my disciple.

402
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,830
Cultivate diligently from now on.

403
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,640
Don't bring dishonor to my name.

404
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,530
Yes, Master.

405
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,020
You see, cultivation

406
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,920
is a way to defy your destiny.

407
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,640
Look at yourself.

408
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,960
The Foundation Pill has transformed your body.

409
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,350
You no longer possess a mortal body.

410
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:51,590
But to go further, you must train your mind too

411
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,130
in order to complete your internal
and external transformation.

412
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,180
Do enlighten me.

413
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,270
Mortals have desires.

414
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,880
Therefore, they have obsessions.

415
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,680
When you are obsessed, it'll affect your progress.

416
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,200
You'll hit a bottleneck

417
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,920
as it turns into your inner demon.

418
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,610
In serious cases, you might lose your progress
or your life.

419
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,070
Master, do you mean we should forsake our desires?

420
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,070
Not at all.

421
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,400
See? I knew you would think that way.

422
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,920
You're wrong.

423
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,030
Cultivation is about easement.

424
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:42,960
To forsake all desires is to go against
the purpose of cultivation.

425
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,590
But true easement is hard to achieve.

426
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,110
Therefore, I ask my disciples

427
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,240
to accept all outcomes with grace.

428
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,680
Accept your failures and
you make peace with yourself.

429
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,880
Make peace with yourself?

430
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,440
This is very important.

431
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,160
Make peace with yourself.

432
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,750
Ask your seniors.

433
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,270
I became the top Core Formation Stage cultivator

434
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,570
in our sect thanks to this philosophy.

435
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,780
Greetings, Grandmaster Hong Fu.

436
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,540
Hong Fu.

437
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,249
Well, I meant to say

438
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:24,400
the top male Core Formation Stage cultivator.

439
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,520
I need to borrow your master for some quick words.

440
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,750
But carry on. I can wait.

441
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,310
We're done.

442
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,200
Han Li, you're now
in the Foundation Establishment Stage.

443
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,550
You can have your own cavern.

444
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,720
Show him where to get the map
to the back of the mountain

445
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,440
as well as the array for the cavern.

446
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,550
Go now.

447
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,680
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

448
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,440
Hong Fu, just some quick words?

449
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,510
It could be more.

450
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,440
- Well, you...
- Farewell, Master.

451
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
- Go.
- Farewell, Grandmaster.

452
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,680
You're so long-winded.

453
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,920
Just go already.

454
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,830
Farewell.

455
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,940
That silly kid.

456
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,720
Go ahead.

457
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,870
The Clear Void Sect brought us some news.

458
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,190
Fu Yun Zi conducted an investigation for a year.

459
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,590
He reported that half of the surviving disciples
in the Trial Ground

460
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,690
said that Spirit Beast Mountain was fishy.

461
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:22,830
300 years ago, that sect split from
the Beast Taming Sect of the Six Demonic Sects.

462
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,150
It's not a stretch to think

463
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,150
that they are consorting with the demonic sects.

464
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:30,190
Remember who suggested that we changed
the opening date of the Trial Ground?

465
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,830
And who insisted that
they knew where the demonic sects were?

466
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,610
The Beast Taming Sect.

467
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,670
I remember that.

468
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,960
You know what? There's no use speculating.

469
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,060
Bring them over and interrogate them.

470
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,480
All right.

471
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,930
I'll be leaving, then.

472
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,860
You're leaving?

473
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,170
So that's all.

474
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,920
I rehearsed my greetings so many times

475
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,870
only for it to end so abruptly.

476
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,590
Can I trust this master of mine?

477
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:09,390
He doesn't look like someone enlightened.

478
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,760
Making peace with yourself.

479
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,100
What does that even mean?

480
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,390
Han, stop ruminating.

481
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,430
Making peace with yourself

482
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,020
is not something you get
by thinking very hard about it.

483
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,370
Master was very cryptic about it.

484
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,480
Would you care to explain to me?

485
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,280
Obsessions can be huge or small.

486
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,389
We want different things,

487
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,740
so we each have different obsessions.

488
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,520
Oh.

489
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,590
For Senior Liu, his obsession

490
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,102
is to kill all evil perpetrators.

491
00:35:53,102 --> 00:35:55,866
Wu Xuan's obsession is Xuan Er.

492
00:35:55,866 --> 00:35:59,836
- Wei Niang's obsession is...
- Shut your mouth.

493
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,750
My obsession is to have a real fight with you.

494
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,480
Senior Song, you know I can't defeat you.

495
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
Work hard then.

496
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,090
I'll be waiting.

497
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:18,040
Han, there's no need to obsess over it.

498
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,880
Making peace with yourself
is easier said than done.

499
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,848
Look at our master.

500
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:27,080
Grandmaster Hong Fu came and was like,

501
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,340
"I need to borrow your master
for some quick words."

502
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,854
Just some quick words?

503
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:33,080
You silly kid.

504
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,150
You're so long-winded.

505
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,820
Just go already.

506
00:36:36,602 --> 00:36:37,920
Just go!

507
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,010
- We're talking about you.
- You weren't aware?

508
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,955
If you get easily distracted in your progress,

509
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:53,575
how can you achieve true peace?

510
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,880
Congratulations, Wan.

511
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,670
You have returned to the Core Formation Stage.

512
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,180
I've nonetheless lost a lot of progress.

513
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,790
It's all that fool's fault.

514
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,450
Who?

515
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,560
I was asking if our disciples

516
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,930
have been cultivating properly or not.

517
00:38:30,504 --> 00:38:34,360
Wan, I've had a feeling that
something is on your mind

518
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,920
after you left the Bloody Trial Ground.

519
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,630
Tell me already.

520
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:41,080
What exactly happened there?

521
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,790
My name is Han Li.

522
00:38:43,663 --> 00:38:45,670
Shoo.

523
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,115
Shoo?

524
00:38:47,115 --> 00:38:48,440
No.

525
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,790
I mean the sun.

526
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,435
The sun is bright today.

527
00:38:53,435 --> 00:38:57,560
You... Since you care so much about our sect,

528
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,360
tend to those pending tasks accumulated
while you were cultivating in solitude.

529
00:39:02,017 --> 00:39:03,208
You just returned to the Core Formation Stage.

530
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,169
Your mind is still clamoring.

531
00:39:05,169 --> 00:39:07,599
We don't want any inner demon now, do we?

532
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,829
Anyway, I was expecting you.

533
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:22,151
Thanks to the Green Vial,
I have an abundance of pills.

534
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:25,418
But the dissipation of my power is an issue.

535
00:39:25,418 --> 00:39:28,080
They also said I could have my own cavern.

536
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,180
How do I do that?

537
00:39:31,395 --> 00:39:33,495
Perhaps I should ask Mentor Wu.

538
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,480
I'm so pissed.

539
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,000
If I don't get rid of Han Li,

540
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I'll have an inner demon sooner or later.

541
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,840
Grandmaster.

542
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,920
Yes?

543
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,550
Yellow Maple Valley sent us a jade scroll.

544
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,630
Cultivator Li Hua Yuan

545
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,280
invites all Core Formation Stage cultivators

546
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,220
of the Seven Sects to discuss a strategy.

547
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,220
Got it.

548
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,260
What strategy?

549
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,580
He just wants someone to play mahjong with him.

550
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,410
But I do like the food there.

551
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,590
All right.

552
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,677
This can be my excuse.

553
00:40:21,677 --> 00:40:23,977
My senior can't stop me.

554
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,320
And it's not about the food too.

555
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,590
I can use this visit

556
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,710
to check if that he told anyone or not.

557
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:36,490
If he did, I'd make him pay.

558
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,010
I need to kill him sooner or later.

559
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,740
Mentor Wu.

560
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,100
Mentor Wu.

561
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,630
Just call me Senior Wu.

562
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,190
I'm used to it already.

563
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,000
You taught me so many things
when I first came here.

564
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,190
If you hadn't done that,

565
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,710
I wouldn't have been able
to enter the Bloody Trial Ground.

566
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,398
Allow me to keep this appellation, Mentor Wu.

567
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:17,408
It doesn't matter anyway.

568
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,750
I saw you studying mugwort therapy
in Herbs Garden last time.

569
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,790
These two vials can help
reduce the foul energy on you.

570
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,000
It's more convenient too.

571
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,660
Just let me know
if you want to steam some mugwort.

572
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,880
Thanks.

573
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,930
It's very considerate of you.

574
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,840
Oh.

575
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,400
Have you found a place for your cavern?

576
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,110
The array we distribute barely suffice.

577
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,180
You need to pull some tricks.

578
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,590
That said, I can't help you in this regard.

579
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,880
Head to Treasure House to find a spirit beast.

580
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,000
A spirit beast?

581
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,620
It can help you.

582
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,230
Wise choice, Mr. Li.

583
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:19,750
This is a Treasure-Hunting Mouse
that reached Grade Two recently.

584
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,110
It can find herbs, steal gems,

585
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,750
and even locate a secret realm.

586
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,490
Locate a secret realm?

587
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,670
How much for it?

588
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,010
A lot.

589
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,140
I'll take it.

590
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:46,979
Come.

591
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:51,125
This is a lot.

592
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:12,528
♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫

593
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:18,415
♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫

594
00:43:18,415 --> 00:43:21,965
♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫

595
00:43:21,965 --> 00:43:24,404
♫ Old scenes rise again ♫

596
00:43:24,404 --> 00:43:27,760
♫ Too hard to forget ♫

597
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,550
♫ Easier just to miss ♫

598
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:39,249
♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫

599
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:44,920
♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫

600
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,480
♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫

601
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,880
♫ Swept away by time ♫

602
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,080
♫ Eyes once looked far ♫

603
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,520
♫ Now lost in the shift ♫

604
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,641
♫ Autumn winds stir ♫

605
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:04,200
♫ Smoke curls once more ♫

606
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,219
♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫

607
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:11,300
♫ Returning to my eyes ♫

608
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,580
♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫

609
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,600
♫ Time lost its name ♫

610
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,841
♫ Was it yesterday ♫

611
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:25,040
♫ Or tomorrow? ♫

612
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,440
♫ The world has changed ♫

613
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,680
♫ Beyond recall ♫

614
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,600
♫ Time will fade ♫

615
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:38,081
♫ All the words ever spoken ♫

616
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:41,808
♫ Only this longing remains ♫

617
00:44:41,808 --> 00:44:47,920
♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫

618
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,372
♫ In a fleeting moment ♫

619
00:44:51,372 --> 00:44:54,787
♫ we call eternity ♫

620
00:44:54,787 --> 00:45:00,732
♫ In a fleeting moment ♫

621
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:04,507
♫ called eternity ♫
