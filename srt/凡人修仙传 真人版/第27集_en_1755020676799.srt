00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Legend of Xiao Chuo

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Elder Han.

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Huangfeng Valley.

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Stop.

6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Elder Han.

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Where are you going?

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I received the letter from Huangfeng Valley.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's for Uncle Li.

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sending it to him.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Bastard.

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're just a good leader.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If the evil road attacks us now,

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the Chinese gate will be opened.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
No one else can go?

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Uncle Gen.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
All the disciples are preparing for battle.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
There's really no one to fight.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Nonsense.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Forget it.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I happen to be looking for

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
something to discuss with Huayuan Taoist.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Give me the letter.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll teach him.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This...

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Uncle.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is for Huangfeng Valley.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's for Uncle Li.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why are all the disciples of Qingxu Sect

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
so absent-minded?

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Do you want me to tell

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Fu Yun about this?

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I dare not.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Please forgive me.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Then...

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll trouble you.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
All the disciples are on their own.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Since there are not enough people,

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll arrange for the people from Lin Shoushan

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
to take over the transfer in the future.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You don't have to worry about it.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Right?

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're quite thoughtful.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Congratulations, Elder.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We just got news from Lin Shoushan.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Now we know

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
when the Seven Sects will be at war.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
They're going to attack us

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and attack us.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The Seven Sects have been

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
in the way for a long time.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They're already losing.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What's wrong?

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They're losing.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They're losing.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They're losing.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They're losing.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
They're losing.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They're losing.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They're losing.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
They're losing.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They're losing.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They're losing.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They're losing.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
After a long time,

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
now it's time to see the end.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Master, it's almost time to pack up.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We should get ready to go.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Xiao Sui.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Elder brother, you're back.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're so good at fighting.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You should call me Senior Brother.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm used to it.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Uncle Han.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You've grown taller.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Here, take this.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is the basic medicine

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
to strengthen your qi.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is the gift from me

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
to you.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Thank you, Uncle Han.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I won't let you down.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Come.

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You always talk to your little sister.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You don't even come to see me.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Uncle Ma.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Who are you looking for?

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You, Uncle Ma.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Who is Uncle Ma?

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Senior Brother.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Uncle.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll call you by your name.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay?

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Long time no see.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You little brat.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You still remember to come back?

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Remember me, you old man.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Senior Brother, you're joking.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm here to help you.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Thanks to Senior Brother's help,

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I still have the medicine.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll always remember your kindness.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Come.

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Go inside.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Pack your things.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I have something to tell you.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You little brat.

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't take my apprentice's idea.

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It seems that the apprentice

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I found for Senior Brother

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
is not bad.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's okay.

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He's a little talented.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He's a little more talented.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's okay.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You can teach him slowly.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Senior Brother.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think you're going to leave Yuan Gate.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I need to leave for a while.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Recently,

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I found that there are many

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
different places in the gate.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm going to go to the wind tunnel.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I can see it.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In the past two months,

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
there have been many people

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
coming to Baiji Hall.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They took away the herbs and herbs

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
that were in the past.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Not only those hundred years of herbs,

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
but also those twenty years of the year.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What happened?

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Is the war going on in the front line

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
not going well?

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Han Li just returned from the capital.

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't know what happened

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to him.

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I've been taking care of the medicinal garden for many years.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The whole grass and trees here

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
are all of our efforts.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Especially when I see them

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
taking the fish away,

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I can't help but be shocked.

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're smart.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This war is unknown in the west.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm here to fight for the land

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and the garden.

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
After fighting for so long,

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
those old people

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
are all in the west.

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's all our efforts.

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Listen to me.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If you have a future,

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
you must find a way out.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Your life is yours.

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm very touched

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
to hear you say that.

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm old.

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
When I'm old,

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll say more.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm still a man of the past.

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't need to talk.

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I just don't know

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
when I can meet again.

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I didn't let them

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
touch some of the grass.

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The grass here

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
is all of our efforts

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
to grow it.

178
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If you need it,

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
take it.

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Take care, Han.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Remember,

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
don't die in front of me.

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I won't die.

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Master.

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Come.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't know

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
if I can see

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you again.

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Is the war

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
at this point?

191
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If the Seven Sects are defeated,

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't know

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
where there is

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
a quiet place

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
for people to practice.

196
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
When I first met you that day,

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I was so happy.

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We made a promise

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
to go back to the past.

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're so annoying.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Master.

202
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm worried about you.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Do you think

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
anything will happen?

205
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Don't worry.

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The Seven Sects

207
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
are all of them.

208
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I think

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
we can win at least fifty percent.

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
How about this?

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You watch the battle first.

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll kill the enemy

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
with my disciples.

214
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm leaving.

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yes.

216
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Master.

217
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The Seven Sects

218
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
only have you two left.

219
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
All disciples of the Imperial Palace,

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
listen up.

221
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We're here.

222
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We're here.

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We're here.

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Hold on to the flag,

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
we will surely succeed.

226
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Look,

227
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
they are Tôizzan and Excuse,

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
both succeeded.

229
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's already my turn now.

230
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You can't go left this time.

231
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,800
You will encounter立五

232
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,000
if it's over.

233
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah,

234
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,480
The Long Ballad

235
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,280
We have to prepare for the next war.

236
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,080
If we leave,

237
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,200
I don't know when we can come back.

238
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,600
It's a pity that we can't take the Eastern Prefecture and the spiritual power.

239
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,000
These are the spirits of the short-term.

240
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,720
They are so hard to grow.

241
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,320
We can't waste any of them.

242
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

243
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

244
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

245
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

246
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

247
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

248
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

249
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

250
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

251
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

252
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

253
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

254
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

255
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

256
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

257
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

258
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

259
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

260
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

261
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

262
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

263
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

264
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

265
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

266
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

267
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

268
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

269
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

270
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

271
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

272
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

273
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

274
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

275
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

276
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

277
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

278
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

279
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

280
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

281
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
The long ballad is about to begin.

282
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,160
Gu's Mansion

283
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,760
A molded dragon sandstone

284
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,700
is on the ground below the 80th floor.

285
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,320
Could it be

286
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,380
something happened to QianPiau?

287
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
The dragon bell is 81.

288
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
I'm sure everyone knows what it means.

289
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
That's right.

290
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
A few hours ago,

291
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
I fell down at the last minute

292
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
at the Song of the Lingshou Mountain and Tianque Castle.

293
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
The allied army was defeated.

294
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
The main force was defeated.

295
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
We lost more than half of the army.

296
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
This battle,

297
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
our Huang Feng family

298
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
was defeated.

299
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Now, the Demon Sect

300
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
is in the long-term.

301
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,440
We're about to break through the last line of defense.

302
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
The last line of defense?

303
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
The Lingshou Mountain and Tianque Castle

304
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
have been betrayed.

305
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
Betrayed?

306
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Master!

307
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
I wonder how they are doing?

308
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
It's all over.

309
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
It's all over.

310
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
It's all over.

311
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
It's all over.

312
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Damn it.

313
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
It's all over.

314
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
I reminded you.

315
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Blame this person for not believing it.

316
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
It's all over.

317
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
It's all over.

318
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
It's all over.

319
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
It's all over.

320
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
It's all over.

321
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
It's all over.

322
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
It's all over.

323
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
I'll say it.

324
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,440
It's not a time to be in danger.

325
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,440
But it's not the time to be in a state of dismay.

326
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Although the elders of the Jiedan clan are not here,

327
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,440
we can still ask the Great Elder to lead the battle.

328
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Please help us.

329
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Please help us.

330
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,440
Please help us.

331
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
Please help us.

332
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
Please help us.

333
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Please help us.

334
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Please help us.

335
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
Please help us.

336
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Please help us.

337
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Please help us.

338
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Please help us.

339
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Please help us.

340
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
You're kidding.

341
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
If Yuan Yin Da wants to help,

342
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
I'm afraid it would have ended long ago.

343
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Why wait until now?

344
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
It's hard to turn around.

345
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
Rather than relying on others,

346
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
it's better to find a way by ourselves.

347
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Please help us.

348
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Please help us.

349
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Please help us.

350
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Please help us.

351
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Please help us.

352
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Please help us.

353
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
What's going on?

354
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Are you practicing some kind of magic?

355
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Master,

356
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
I'm really practicing a spirit-binding magic.

357
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,440
You're a stubborn kid.

358
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
You have a good heart.

359
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,440
But your spiritual lamp is too long.

360
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
This is the reason why I'm practicing.

361
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,440
If I hadn't practiced the Great Eye-catching Token to nourish my soul,

362
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
I wouldn't have been able to do it.

363
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,440
I hate it when people kneel down.

364
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Get up.

365
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,440
Please help us, Your Highness.

366
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
I've said it before.

367
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
I hate it when people kneel down.

368
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Get up.

369
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Get up.

370
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Do you think that I can promise you

371
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
as long as you kneel down?

372
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
How can a person who practices

373
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
forget the four words,

374
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
quiet and serene?

375
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
As you can see,

376
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,440
the Yellow Wind Valley is going to be over.

377
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Let it go.

378
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
I've disturbed my peace of mind.

379
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Master,

380
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
I'm sorry.

381
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
Please forgive me.

382
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,440
But the Yellow Wind Valley has been destroyed for hundreds of years.

383
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Please help us to get rid of the evil

384
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
and save the world.

385
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Senior.

386
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
You're so arrogant.

387
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Senior.

388
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
How can you let me

389
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,440
fight for you and your useless people?

390
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,440
I just want to make peace.

391
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
You're not as good as others.

392
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,440
How can you let me fight against those monsters?

393
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
I want to,

394
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,440
but I can't beat them.

395
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Fighting for reasons

396
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,440
is a big deal.

397
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,440
It's a matter of life and death.

398
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
It's a matter of life and death.

399
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
Master.

400
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Master.

401
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
You want me

402
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,440
to die for you?

403
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
You want me to

404
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,440
be a teacher

405
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,440
and a teacher?

406
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Joke.

407
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Joke.

408
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
These monsters

409
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,440
are so arrogant

410
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,440
that they let the disciples go to the Heavenly Palace.

411
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,440
It's so despicable.

412
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
Master.

413
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Master.

414
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
Master, please forgive us.

415
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Please forgive us.

416
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
Everyone.

417
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Don't panic.

418
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,440
We still have the Great Wall.

419
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,440
As long as we work together,

420
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,440
we can protect it.

421
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,440
I'm going to die with the Yellow Wind Valley.

422
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
You're right.

423
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
We still have the Great Wall.

424
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
We don't fear to die together.

425
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
It's been said that

426
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,440
no matter how arrogant you are,

427
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
you can't beat them.

428
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Let's think about how to deal with

429
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
the demon's attack.

430
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
These fools.

431
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
If you hear the rumor,

432
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
if you want to live,

433
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
come to the Heavenly Hall

434
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
in a moment.

435
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,440
It's not good to die.

436
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
You chose me?

437
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
It seems that

438
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
you have other plans.

439
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
Gui Niang.

440
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Are you okay?

441
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
I'm fine.

442
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,440
It's the famous red powder.

443
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Kulou.

444
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
You're a little sharp.

445
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
Elder Han.

446
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
You betrayed the Seven Sects.

447
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
How many people were killed

448
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
in the fencing?

449
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,440
You're wrong.

450
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
In the face of your master,

451
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
I gave you the chance to live.

452
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
You should have admitted it.

453
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Elder Han.

454
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
I'm not good at learning.

455
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
But I can't do

456
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
such things as

457
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
fighting with the enemy.

458
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Huangfenggu Qingbo Cave.

459
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
Four disciples of Lihua Garden

460
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,440
are sent to die.

461
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
Elder Han.

462
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Elder Han.

463
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
Elder Han.

464
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
Elder Han.

465
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Elder Han.

466
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Gui Niang.

467
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Why don't you go?

468
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,440
Brother Jing is gone.

469
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
If you're gone,

470
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
what's the point of

471
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,440
living alone?

472
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,440
Brother.

473
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
I love this kind of play.

474
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
The chess players

475
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
can't fight.

476
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
But these people

477
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
love and hate Jiu Ge's play.

478
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
It's a good play.

479
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
It's good that you're happy.

480
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Unfortunately,

481
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,440
there are still some rain clouds on the battlefield.

482
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,440
We can't waste time.

483
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Let's send them off.

484
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Huangfenggu Qingbo Cave.

485
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Seven disciples of Lihua Garden.

486
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
Zhong Wei Niang.

487
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
They're sent to die.

488
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
Anyway,

489
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,440
as you wish.

490
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
They're going to die.

491
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Who's bullying people here?

492
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Finally, I caught up.

493
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Zhong Shizhi.

494
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
Song Shizhi.

495
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
You're done.

496
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Go home and rest.

497
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Oh, right.

498
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
Don't forget to tell your master

499
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
that he owes me a favor.

500
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Go.

501
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
I said,

502
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
Elder Han,

503
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
you bastard.

504
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,440
You three bullied two dolls.

505
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
You still want to be flattered?

506
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
Brother.

507
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
Brother.

508
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
You're not well.

509
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,440
You must be in a deep sleep.

510
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,440
You're injured.

511
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
You're going to die.

512
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
How about this?

513
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,440
We can work together to make up for it.

514
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Go to sleep.

515
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Mister.

516
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,440
That old man is so annoying.

517
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
He can't stand it.

518
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
You should beat him up.

519
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Beat him up.

520
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
Fu Yin.

521
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
You made my wife angry.

522
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,440
It seems that you can't leave today.

523
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,440
Three friends.

524
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Let's see if you have this.

525
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,440
Yes.

526
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Yes.

527
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
Bow.

528
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
You're fast.

529
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Master.

530
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
You've been through a lot

531
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
since we last met.

532
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
You're so kind.

533
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Master.

534
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Are you okay?

535
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
I'm fine.

536
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,440
What do you mean?

537
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
I'm fine.

538
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
I'm fine.

539
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440
I'm fine.

540
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
I'm fine.

541
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
I'm fine.

542
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
I'm fine.

543
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
I'm fine.

544
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
I'm fine.

545
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
I'm fine.

546
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
I'm fine.

547
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
I'm fine.

548
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
I'm fine.

549
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
What do you mean?

550
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
You're looking forward to me?

551
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
How could it be?

552
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
I knew it.

553
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
Master.

554
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
My master is very powerful.

555
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,440
He will be fine.

556
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Master.

557
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
Master.

558
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
Master.

559
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
About the Black Shark Education Station in the capital,

560
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
the disciples were useless.

561
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Wu Duan was involved in the murder of Senior Wu and Senior Liu.

562
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Please punish me.

563
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
It's okay.

564
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Master.

565
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
Actually,

566
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Lao Si and Wei Niang have told me about this.

567
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Who would have thought that the evil religion

568
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,440
would infiltrate the royal court of the royal family?

569
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Now the evil Taoists are coming again.

570
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
It's really a trouble.

571
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
But it's okay.

572
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
You can come back safely.

573
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
I'm very happy.

574
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
By the way,

575
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
I heard that Fourth Brother and Seventh Sister

576
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
went to the front yard again.

577
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
Yes.

578
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Where are they now?

579
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
They left.

580
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
I thought they could come back.

581
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
But now it seems

582
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
that it's not going well.

583
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Master.

584
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
Master.

585
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Han Li, listen.

586
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,440
What's important is the later.

587
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,440
I've been begging for a long time

588
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,440
to find you such a good name.

589
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,440
Don't waste it.

590
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,880
The skills of the

591
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,440
Master are above the level of the middle-level.

592
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
It seems that

593
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,440
the rest of the elite are here.

594
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Master.

595
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
Master.

596
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Master.

597
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
Master.

598
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
Good.

599
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
You're here again.

600
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
In this case,

601
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,440
I don't need to play tricks.

602
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
I'm sure everyone knows

603
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,440
that the front line is defeated like a mountain.

604
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,440
The army of the six clans

605
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,440
is coming to this place.

606
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,440
And Yang Yan is weak and resistant.

607
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
He doesn't have any chance.

608
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,440
It seems that

609
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
there is no hope.

610
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,440
I can't scare the children like this.

611
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
Everyone here,

612
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,440
you are the core disciples of the family.

613
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,440
The skills of the ancient

614
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
are all on you.

615
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,440
The show that the ancestors

616
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,440
played in front of the hall

617
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
is to let those

618
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
who are skilled in both sides

619
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
escape earlier.

620
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,440
This is convenient for our next action.

621
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Master, please forgive me.

622
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
Then what are we going to do next?

623
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
We'll go to the front line.

624
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
I'll answer for Master Li.

625
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
Before this,

626
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
the elders of the Tai Shang

627
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
have contacted the nine clans.

628
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,440
They allowed us

629
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
to provide shelter for us.

630
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
So next,

631
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
I will lead everyone

632
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,440
to retreat separately with Master Li.

633
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
It's the nine clans.

634
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
That's great.

635
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
That's the strength of Tienan.

636
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
Now we can all

637
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
go to the front line.

638
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
Yes.

639
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
Let's go.

640
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
Let's go.

641
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
The world is not worth it.

642
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Since we are here,

643
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,440
we are all here.

644
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,440
We are all here.

645
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
Let's go.

646
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Let's go.

647
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
The Qianji tree

648
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,440
must be familiar to everyone.

649
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
This time,

650
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,440
I will add

651
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
the transmission tree.

652
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,440
Within 100 miles,

653
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
it can be used

654
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
to send a message

655
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,440
with seven senses.

656
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,440
Only if this light is not extinguished,

657
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
the transmission tree

658
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
will be destroyed.

659
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,440
Only if this light is not extinguished,

660
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
I can know

661
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,440
your whereabouts.

662
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
It's a pity that the Taonan is outside.

663
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,440
It's not like being quiet in the valley.

664
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,440
You guys

665
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,440
should be careful.

666
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Thank you for your advice.

667
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,440
We will guard and help each other.

668
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,440
We will not be in danger.

669
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,440
You guys

670
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
are going to run away.

671
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,440
What danger?

672
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,440
What are you waiting for?

673
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,440
Wait for the opening.

674
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,440
Go and prepare.

675
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
After the class,

676
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,440
we will go to the hall to drink.

677
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
Yes.

678
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,440
Don't walk around.

679
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Yes.

680
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,440
Hurry up.

681
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
Master.

682
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
Go.

683
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,440
I don't want to leave

684
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,440
but I can't sit and wait.

685
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,440
I'd better be prepared

686
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
and change at will.

687
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,440
It seems that it's not here.

688
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,440
I have to find another place.

689
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Actually, I quite like

690
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,440
this place.

691
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Young Master.

692
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,440
We are now in the Huangfeng Valley.

693
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,440
It's not right to take the gold.

694
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
This is a good chance.

695
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
It's a good chance.

696
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
It's a good chance.

697
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
It's a good chance.

698
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
It's a good chance.

699
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
It's a good chance.

700
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
It's a good chance.

701
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
Now, the Yanyuan Sect is closed.

702
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
The Qingxu Sect is in danger.

703
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,440
Only three sects are left.

704
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
They are all in danger.

705
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
It seems that Young Master

706
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,440
is going to make a great contribution.

707
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Young Master, I know your little heart.

708
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
You are worried about someone

709
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
who is called Li,

710
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Fei, or Yu.

711
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,440
He is not Li Fei Yu.

712
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,440
His name is Han Li.

713
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,440
What Li?

714
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
Han Li?

715
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,440
The name of the Huangfeng Valley disciple.

716
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
I thought it was a good thing.

717
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
Where did you get it?

718
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,440
Someone gave it to me.

719
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
His name is Han Li?

720
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,440
I've been fooled by such a fool for so long.

721
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,440
Pass my order.

722
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,440
Those who enter the Huangfeng Valley

723
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,440
and take Han Li

724
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
will be severely punished.

725
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,440
Enter the Huangfeng Valley

726
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
and take Han Li.

727
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,440
Yes.

728
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,440
I can't bear to leave.

729
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,440
But now is not the time to be sad.

730
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
The Demon King

731
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,440
is about to arrive at the Huangfeng Valley.

732
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Please come and meet him.

733
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,440
Such a good cave

734
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,440
can't be left to others.

735
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
I'm afraid that

736
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
the Demon King

737
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,440
will be very angry.

738
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
I'm afraid that

739
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
the Demon King

740
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,440
will be very angry.

741
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
I'm afraid that

742
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
the Demon King

743
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,440
can't be left to others.

744
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
I don't know

745
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
when I can come back.

746
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,440
I don't know when I can come back.

747
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,440
This battle is over.

748
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,440
I can't take you with me.

749
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,440
I can only say goodbye.

750
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,440
It's OK. Don't be like that.

751
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
If it's fate,

752
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Greetings, Uncle.

753
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,440
He is my disciple and he has cultivation.

754
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,440
He won't be a troublemaker.

755
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
Have you done your work properly?

756
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,440
We can't go back for a while.

757
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
Thank you for your concern.

758
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,440
I've done my work properly.

759
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,440
Where is Master?

760
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
He won't come with us?

761
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Your master and Master Zhong

762
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
will take another group of disciples

763
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
to retreat later.

764
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
Otherwise, the team is huge

765
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
and it's easy to attract attention.

766
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Master Hongfu.

767
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
Listen up, disciples.

768
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
This is dangerous.

769
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
We have to cross the Demon Realm.

770
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
If we encounter monsters,

771
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
we must not fight.

772
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
After escaping,

773
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
we must use the skill of a thousand attacks

774
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
to meet at the marked place.

775
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
If we can't do it,

776
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
we must not fight.

777
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
If we can't do it,

778
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
we must not fight.

779
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
If we can't do it,

780
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,440
we must meet at the marked place.

781
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,440
Yes.

782
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
Let's go.

783
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,440
Go.

784
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,440
Go.

785
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,440
Go.

786
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
Go.

787
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Han Li.

788
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
Uncle.

789
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
I'm afraid I let you down this time.

790
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
I'm sorry

791
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
that I let you down.

792
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
Your master and I were there,

793
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,440
but we still couldn't get back what we lost.

794
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Uncle.

795
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
Actually,

796
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Han Li accidentally knew about

797
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
Lin Shoushan's plan.

798
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
He told Master Zhong

799
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,440
and told Master about it.

800
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
So it happened.

801
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
Your master and I

802
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,440
have been working together all the time,

803
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,440
but we never got any news.

804
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
But, Uncle,

805
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
it's over.

806
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,440
It's no use to worry about it.

807
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
You're so generous

808
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,440
and unwavering.

809
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,440
You're really different from others.

810
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
I don't want to see your master

811
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
to torture you.

812
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,440
Even the ancestors of Linghu

813
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,440
told me to take you away.

814
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
It seems that he also has a good taste in you.

815
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
Han Li is capable

816
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
to get into the ancestors' abode.

817
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,440
But Xue'er is not so lucky.

818
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,440
Now,

819
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
I regret it more.

820
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
Uncle.

821
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,440
I'm afraid that we're down.

822
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,440
What if there's a demon?

823
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,440
What should we do?

824
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
This thing is called Wind Cloud Reversal.

825
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,440
We'll depend on it later.

826
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,440
Wait.

827
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,440
Uncle.

828
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,440
It's been a year.

829
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
Have you seen Uncle Hongfu?

830
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,440
He...

831
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,440
Didn't you receive

832
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,440
the message from the ancestors of Linghu?

833
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
He told me to take some people

834
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
to leave with Uncle Hongfu.

835
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,440
You and I will leave later.

836
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
What's wrong?

837
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
He sent the message himself?

838
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
Yes.

839
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,440
What happened?

840
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,440
I need to confirm something.

841
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
You go first.

842
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
Don't worry about me.

843
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,440
It's really a coincidence

844
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,440
that he passed by here again.

845
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
Be careful, everyone.

846
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
There are monsters here.

847
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,440
Be careful.

848
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,440
The red ginseng, loneliness, and books

849
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,440
are all ruined by the six years of regret.

850
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,440
The night is gone.

851
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,440
Time flies.

852
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,440
The wind rises again and blows.

853
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:34,440
It's like the change of fate.

854
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,440
Looking back, it's already at the top.

855
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,440
You forget the past.

856
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,440
It's yesterday.

857
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,440
It's tomorrow.

858
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:54,440
The sea of hurt is still the same.

859
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,440
Time will also change.

860
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,440
All the people in the world

861
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,440
will have this year

862
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:11,440
that has been crossed a thousand years.

863
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,440
In the moment of life and death.

864
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:28,440
In the moment of life and death.
