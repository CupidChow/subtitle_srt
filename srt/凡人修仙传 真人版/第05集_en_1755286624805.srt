OST credit

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,465
♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫

4
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:27,120
♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,060
♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,545
♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫

7
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:36,200
♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,700
♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,000
♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,900
♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:56,182
♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,280
♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,760
♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,295
♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫

16
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:13,560
♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,720
♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,140
♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫

19
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,160
♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,376
♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫

21
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:30,000
♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,410
♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,970
The cold poison is acting up more frequently now.

24
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,820
I must get my hands on the Sunwarm Jade today.

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,790
Who's there?

26
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,940
Li.

27
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,300
- Who are you?
-

28
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,520
Open the door.

29
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,750
Just you alone?

30
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,820
You don't look well.

31
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,770
Are you very sick?

32
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,850
How did you find me?

33
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,940
Anyone can see that tall guard of yours.

34
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,700
What do you want?

35
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,520
Here.

36
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,850
Sunwarm Jade.

37
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,610
Use it to cure yourself.

38
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,210
Sunwarm Jade?

39
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,970
Impossible.

40
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,490
Don't worry.

41
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,020
This is the real Sunwarm Jade.

42
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,100
I won't cause you harm.

43
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,140
Li!

44
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,000
His poison runs deep.

45
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,170
Li.

46
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,300
Li. You're awake.

47
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,120
Li.

48
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,070
Look.

49
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,020
It's truly a Sunwarm Jade.

50
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,410
Did I fall asleep just now?

51
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,140
Yes, you did.

52
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,410
I let out your blood just now to cure you.

53
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,070
It was all back at the start.

54
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,820
But now, it's red like normal blood.

55
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,750
You would still be unconscious, otherwise.

56
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,020
Let me do it.

57
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,090
How did you get the jade?

58
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,460
They couldn't possibly let you have it.

59
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,210
Actually, my mother and sister are good people.

60
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,820
They are often threatened by bad guys,

61
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,500
so they hope you can stay to protect them.

62
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,730
They do not harbor malice.

63
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,860
They just can't see

64
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,555
that Jiayuan City
isn't a place my father would stay in,

65
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:46,945
let alone you.

66
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,390
Drink this now. It's Chinese ginseng broth.

67
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,137
My father gave me the jade as my dowry.

68
00:09:09,137 --> 00:09:12,430
My sisters have their own dowries too.

69
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,720
But I told my mother that I'd never marry anyone.

70
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,300
Therefore, I have no use for it.

71
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,920
And this one here.

72
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,560
Thrombus Pill.

73
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,830
You like to heal people?

74
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,610
I've learned some from the books
my father left behind.

75
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,610
Your father was a great physician.

76
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,330
Alas,

77
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,530
he didn't want to be a physician.

78
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,650
He wanted to be an immortal.

79
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,290
Before this, I did not believe

80
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,150
that the Sunwarm Jade was an excellent antidote.

81
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,640
Me neither.

82
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,980
Even though your father poisoned me,

83
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,020
I trusted him when he told me that only the Sunwarm Jade could save me.

84
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,290
No.

85
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,030
He wasn't completely right.

86
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,820
You saved me.

87
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,510
Give me the jade.

88
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,570
I mean I want to place it under the sun

89
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,060
to see if its color can be restored.

90
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,180
All right.

91
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,660
Keep it. It's yours now.

92
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,970
You should keep it.

93
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,210
I Have a favor to ask.

94
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,720
Speak.

95
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,891
Who do you want killed?

96
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:24,120
It's not that.

97
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,340
I...

98
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,160
I want you to take me with you.

99
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,650
Sorry, I can't do that.

100
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,060
Okay.

101
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,030
Why don't you stay with the Mo Family for now?

102
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,720
If someone bothers them, you can protect them.

103
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,857
Once I find a place to cultivate and settle down,

104
00:13:58,857 --> 00:14:00,159
I'll come and pick you up.

105
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,989
What do you think?

106
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,620
♫ The ripples disappear into the river ♫

107
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,455
♫ My robe is soaked under the drizzle ♫

108
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:40,700
♫ I drink alone
as the moonlight melts with the liquor ♫

109
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,201
♫ The current flows swiftly,
the mountains weigh heavily ♫

110
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:48,401
♫ The setting sun
shines on the returning boats... ♫

111
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,200
Miss Mo, may this missive find you well.

112
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,990
I have left.

113
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,790
Qu Hun is a good friend of mine,

114
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,440
and a great disciple of your father's.

115
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,550
I entrust him to your hands.

116
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,650
He should scare those
who wish to give you trouble.

117
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,720
Please keep the vial.

118
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,690
Take care.

119
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:14,460
♫ The wind whispers to the forest ♫

120
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,820
♫ I wander into the dream under the clear galaxy ♫

121
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,100
♫ This journey that spans across the universe ♫

122
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,076
♫ Feels both familiar and unfamiliar ♫

123
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:35,001
♫ Looking at the various faces of our world ♫

124
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,960
♫ Each word, each utterance ♫

125
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,270
♫ Carries the hopes of a lifetime... ♫

126
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,580
Li!

127
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,560
♫ Let's make the present count
and strive for a legacy ♫

128
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,720
♫ Reunion and departure, searching around ♫

129
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,520
♫ No one speaks the tongue I know ♫

130
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:58,360
♫ Sadness follows me like a shadow ♫

131
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,440
♫ I see the sky, the cloud,
the moon, and the star ♫

132
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,300
♫ I see the wind and the rain ♫

133
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:11,940
♫ There's no need to ask when I will return ♫

134
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,130
Ni Chang.

135
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,960
Wan. It's been 20 years.

136
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,760
You've finally left your cultivation.

137
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,320
Ni Chang, what's new about the world?

138
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,080
What else could it be?

139
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,100
Just feuds and conflicts.

140
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,670
Our grandmasters made the wise choice

141
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,980
to forbid us from intervening
in the mortal's affairs.

142
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,980
Indeed. Some like to whine
about how short life is.

143
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,200
But if they are given
the opportunity to live longer,

144
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,960
who knows what matter of oddity they will commit?

145
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,790
You know this better than all of us.

146
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,800
So why did you leave the mountain
to meddle in those affairs?

147
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,790
Be it the demon sects or the dark cultivators,

148
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,810
they are endless.

149
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,360
You should focus on your cultivation
and ignore them.

150
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,960
You sure are indifferent, Ni Chang.

151
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,360
But I study the Maiden Cycle Technique.

152
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,480
It requires me to be at peace.

153
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,500
I hate strife so I must leave to intervene.

154
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,080
You never listen to me.

155
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,860
The mortal affairs are the most potent venom.

156
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,360
Make sure you don't get too involved.

157
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,020
Don't worry, Ni Chang.

158
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,080
I'm planning to visit the six other sects first.

159
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,750
Then, I'll check if they are dark cultivators
and demon sects roaming about.

160
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,450
I'll be back soon.

161
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:51,190
Do not forget that we are to host the next Immortal Ascension Trials.

162
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,420
Worry not, Ni Chang.

163
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,210
Cultivators

164
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,270
rarely appear in crowded places.

165
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,430
Where do they usually go?

166
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,960
Are there truly cultivators in Tainan Valley?

167
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,970
I want to see what they see.

168
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,040
The valley a hundred li south of Jiayuan City

169
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,700
is shrouded by mists all year round.

170
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:25,216
According to the scroll,
Tainan Valley should be here.

171
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,310
I am Wan Xiao Shan.

172
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,320
How may I address you?

173
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:54,600
Han Li.

174
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,290
Your name is Han Li, I see.

175
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,110
You're alone here.

176
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,410
You must be a rogue cultivator
who wishes to enter Tainan Valley.

177
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,060
You know what? Let's band up.

178
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,900
Band up?

179
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,950
Are you perhaps lost?

180
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,690
Han, don't underestimate me.

181
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,650
Even though I'm an elementary cultivator,

182
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:17,180
I know very well how to get to Tainan Valley.

183
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,140
All right, then.

184
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,270
Let's travel together.

185
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,310
Lead the way.

186
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,970
Follow me.

187
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,350
What do you mean by a rogue cultivator?

188
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,000
Like us,

189
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,590
we do not belong
to those seven sects like Moonshadow Sect

190
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,680
or hail from a cultivator clan like the Yans.

191
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,730
We cultivate alone
so we are the rogue cultivators.

192
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,300
He seems to know quite a lot about cultivation.

193
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,860
Perhaps I can get more out of him.

194
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:57,750
Wan, do you know of a way
to dispel the mist before us?

195
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,940
Han, you must have only
become a cultivator recently.

196
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,031
This misty barrier only opens up
once every ten years.

197
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:05,272
If we can't enter the valley,

198
00:21:05,272 --> 00:21:08,030
it means it is not the right moment yet.

199
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,860
Come. Have some fruit.

200
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,900
They say immortals do not eat rice.

201
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,490
They ingest wind and pebbles
and drink morning dew.

202
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,040
That's not true then.

203
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,060
Only immortals do that.

204
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,720
People like us are called cultivators.

205
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,520
Immortals live as long as the universe.

206
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,300
They live as long as the universe?

207
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,780
No wonder Physician Mo did everything
to become one.

208
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,580
But considering our current cultivation progress,

209
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,240
we can only live a century at most.

210
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,100
That's not bad already.

211
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,010
It's open!

212
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,090
Wan.

213
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,240
Wan?

214
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,310
Come in.

215
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,310
Check out this Glacial Sword.

216
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,960
- Check out this Glacial Sword.
- Advanced Ice Talisman.

217
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,480
Three gems for one talisman.

218
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,010
Check this out.

219
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,620
- Wan, this is...
- This is Tainan Bazaar.

220
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,780
It Lasts for three days.

221
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,790
We're lucky to run into its opening.

222
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,560
This is a fair price already.

223
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,100
- 20 gems.
- Come. Take a look.

224
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,490
Come. A century-old ironcoil snake.

225
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,350
It took me a lot to catch it.

226
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,580
Glacial Sword!

227
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,510
Check out my Glacial Sword.

228
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,110
20 gems for one.

229
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,270
Talisman.

230
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,550
Do you want any? Take a look.

231
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,280
- Come.
- Come take a look.

232
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,550
My friend, come browse my wares.

233
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,170
- Come.
- Advanced Ice...

234
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,740
Advanced Ice Talisman for three gems only.

235
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,310
Common items like these aren't very useful.

236
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,190
They are common?

237
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,550
You need gems to buy them. Do you have any?

238
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,010
Besides, it's a rip-off.

239
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:05,080
Are gems the currency among cultivators?

240
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,760
Come on, Han.

241
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,480
As the name suggests, a gem is a stone filled with spiritual aura.

242
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,170
A good gem is transparent and bright.

243
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,800
You can use it as a source of light.

244
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,820
This is already a very fair price.

245
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,066
Mine is not as good, but it's good enough to provide energy

246
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:33,810
for an array or to restore your spiritual power
after a battle.

247
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,970
Another rogue cultivator.

248
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,410
How many has it been?

249
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,290
Grandmaster, this is the seventh.

250
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,620
Grandmaster, I found this nearby.

251
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,820
Yan?

252
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,540
From the Yan Clan Stronghold?

253
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,030
Those clan disciples
love to bully rogue cultivators.

254
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,340
Enough.

255
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,300
Do not jump to conclusions
before we investigate thoroughly.

256
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,860
Yes.

257
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,440
The barrier has been lifted.

258
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,060
The valley is now filled
with rogue and clan disciples.

259
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,470
Both parties are not on good terms, so anything could happen.

260
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:35,100
Yu, Qing, Dispatch more disciples to guard the valley.

261
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,182
I don't want any accidents before the Immortal Ascension Trials.

262
00:24:39,182 --> 00:24:40,760
Understood.

263
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,301
Keen eyes, Miss.

264
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:53,970
The emerald stones embedded on the bracelet come from

265
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,070
the eyes of a Grade Two Twinhead Raven.

266
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,170
Well, it's a bit expensive.

267
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,350
500 gems.

268
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,410
500?

269
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,730
You might as well commit robbery.

270
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,410
- Do you know we are...
- Enough.

271
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,180
Scarcity brings up the price.

272
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,260
Father will like this.

273
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,190
Miss, this is...

274
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,820
Take it.

275
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,590
Thank you, Miss.

276
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,130
I... Thank the maker!

277
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,380
Stay there.

278
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,690
They are the ones who killed Liu.

279
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,530
Nonsense.

280
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:34,170
Foundation Establishment Stage?

281
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:37,970
A Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator
is her guard.

282
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,690
Just who exactly is that woman?

283
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,470
Feng, who said you could intervene?

284
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,690
Forgive me, Miss Yan.

285
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,860
Your safety
dictates the continuity of Yan Clan Stronghold.

286
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,270
Master has instructed me
to prioritize your safety.

287
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,620
She's Yan Ru Yan?

288
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,970
Yan Ru Yan?

289
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,580
Is her family very famous?

290
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,680
Of course!

291
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,380
Her family is the top cultivation family
in the Yue Kingdom.

292
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,490
The paterfamilias, Yan Yun Shan, is her father.

293
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,090
He's a cultivator in the Core Formation Stage.

294
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,970
Wan, you know many things.

295
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,810
I'm so impressed.

296
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,780
He is so knowledgeable.

297
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,760
I should listen to him more.

298
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,590
Look.

299
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,580
I know everything about the cultivation world in the Yue Kingdom.

300
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,580
Just ask me anything if you have questions.

301
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,410
Thank you, Wan.

302
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,650
Just call me Xiao Shan.

303
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,480
Xiao Shan.

304
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,300
By the authority of the seven sects, all troublemakers

305
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,670
will be disqualified from the trials and expelled from Tainan Valley.

306
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,780
As this is your first offense, I'll forgive you but don't do it again.

307
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,670
Leave right now.

308
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,660
She's holding the token

309
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,650
of a Core Formation Stage cultivator from the Moonshadow Sect.

310
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,156
Miss Ru Yan, Grandmaster Nangong
would like to see you.

311
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:08,350
What is the meaning of this?

312
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,730
- Grandmaster Nangong?
- Is your sect challenging Yan Clan Stronghold?

313
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,820
Just for a few rogue cultivators?

314
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,690
Cease your impertinence, Feng.

315
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,390
Withdraw for now. I will be back in a moment.

316
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,330
Han, come.

317
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,930
What a day.

318
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,210
I saw a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator
serving as a guard

319
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,380
and also a token
from a Core Formation Stage cultivator.

320
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,590
There is always someone more powerful
than the powerful ones.

321
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:53,660
If you see them in the future, Han, you run away.

322
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,850
Run away?

323
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,041
Let's go. I'll show you around.

324
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:05,558
Thank you so much, Xiao Shan.

325
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,729
No worries at all.

326
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:08,950
Rogue cultivators are like my brothers.

327
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,100
If you have further...

328
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,970
Are you all right?

329
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,600
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

330
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,170
- Thank you.
- Look where you're going.

331
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,760
Okay.

332
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,340
You sure are stealthy, my friend.

333
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,655
But I suggest you return the pouch to its owner.

334
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,770
Didn't you promise to stop stealing?

335
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,111
Xiao Shan, it seems like we have thieves among the cultivators too.

336
00:28:41,111 --> 00:28:42,930
He took your pouch first.

337
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,550
I merely grabbed some interest on your behalf.

338
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,120
Isn't it fair?

339
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,010
- You...
- I Just wanted to borrow it.

340
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,250
I didn't say I wouldn't return it.

341
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,860
Give it back.

342
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,730
Give it back.

343
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,860
Give it back!

344
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,490
He took my things and won't give them back.

345
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,010
You two should check
if your personal effects are intact.

346
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,300
That's right. This happens
on the Azure Vein Society's territory.

347
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,210
Our leader will intervene.

348
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,930
You belong to the Azure Vein Society?

349
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,450
Qing Wen is my Dharma name.

350
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,340
This is my peer, Hu Ping Gu.

351
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,490
My friend, since you've heard of my society,

352
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,850
will you be so kind
as to look past what the thief did?

353
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,060
It feels like you're reciting lines.

354
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,140
Is this perhaps a premeditated ruse?

355
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,010
Han, Daoist Qing Wen is known for his heroic deeds

356
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,270
among the rogue cultivators.

357
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,550
We have not suffered any losses.

358
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,340
Let's just move on.

359
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,650
Everything's fine.

360
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,090
Let's go, Han.

361
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,140
Give back the pouch.

362
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,300
Thank you.

363
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,750
My friends, Wu Jiu Zhi is mischievous, but he bears no ill intention.

364
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,440
If he did offend you, I apologize on his behalf.

365
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,010
That's right. We crossed paths today.
-   These two are either crooks...

366
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,960
- How may I address you two?
-  Or fraudsters.

367
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,060
-  I should stay away from them.
- You're too courteous, sir.

368
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,380
I am Wan Xiao Shan.

369
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,650
This is my friend, Han Li.

370
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,810
And he exposed my name just like that.

371
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,100
You look like you're here for the trials.

372
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,510
Our society has rented a venue nearby

373
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,830
to discuss the trials
with other rogue cultivators.

374
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,540
Would you like to join us?

375
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,280
Of course.

376
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:32,060
Grandmaster, Miss Ru Yan from the Yan Clan Stronghold is here.

377
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,780
I'm Yan Ru Yan of the Yan Clan Stronghold.

378
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,150
Greetings, Grandmaster Nangong.

379
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,470
I was told you brought a lot of guards
to Tainan with you.

380
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,820
Grandmaster Nangong, while I can't speak for other prestigious families,

381
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,640
I can reassure you that my guards have never left my side

382
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,300
ever since I set foot in Tainan.

383
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,710
My family has nothing to do with the disappearance of rogue cultivators.

384
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,580
You keep yourself abreast with the goings-on.

385
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,520
But how do you explain this?

386
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,860
We found this next to a dead rogue cultivator.

387
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,880
Grandmaster Nangong, a female attendant of mine

388
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,100
had her token stolen since we entered Tainan.

389
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,630
Someone is obviously trying to frame me.

390
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,620
Have you decided on which sect to join?

391
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,910
Grandfather recommended
Spirit Beast Mountain many times.

392
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,300
But I prefer the Moonshadow Sect.

393
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,710
You have better taste than your grandfather.

394
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,210
All right. You may return.

395
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,840
Be prepared for the trials tomorrow.

396
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,670
Grandmaster, judging from those brash rogue cultivators just now,

397
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,820
they were clearly manipulated by someone else.

398
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,250
Yet Yan Clan Stronghold
does not make enemies often.

399
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,180
Do you know who is trying to frame us?

400
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:01,740
In my opinion, Yan Clan Stronghold is not the only target.

401
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,540
Your behavior does not
merely represent your family,

402
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,490
but also other clan disciples like you.

403
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,690
Someone is trying to exacerbate the divide

404
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,430
between the clan disciples and rogue cultivators.f

405
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,910
I shall take my leave.

406
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:32,110
Grandmaster,

407
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:36,840
I can't let Spirit Beast Mountain take away a smart girl like her.

408
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:42,100
My friends, this is our base.

409
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,870
Welcome aboard!

410
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,180
We are a family of rogue cultivators.

411
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,280
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

412
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,250
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

413
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,760
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

414
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,280
Welcome.

415
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,760
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

416
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,060
This is a map of the Yue Kingdom.

417
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:05,060
I chanced upon this map and found it intriguing.

418
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,200
You can find all seven sects on it.

419
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,580
- That's the Moonshadow Sect.
- That's the Spirit Beast Mountain.

420
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,250
- That's the Saber-Shearing Sect.
- That's the Clear Void Sect.

421
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,440
- Skyfort Castle.
- That's the Yellow Maple Valley.

422
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,920
That's the Giant Sword Sect.

423
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,010
These seven cultivating sects are generally abbreviated as the seven sects.

424
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,340
They survived a fierce battle 1,000 years ago
in the Yue Kingdom.

425
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,894
Then, where is Yan Clan Stronghold?

426
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:25,100
Yan Clan Stronghold.

427
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,620
Here. That's the Yan Clan Stronghold.

428
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,640
- Yes.
- That's right.

429
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,400
Then, where do rogue cultivators belong?

430
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,420
We...

431
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,930
We're not on this map.

432
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,250
I might even say that we won't have a place in the Yue Kingdom either.

433
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,350
Enough, Qing Wen.

434
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,310
We brought them here to discuss the trials.

435
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,130
Why bring this up?

436
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,060
I'm sorry.

437
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,600
Some rogue cultivators have gone missing lately.

438
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,740
- Some are also left stranded...
- Qing Wen.

439
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,868
What are they trying to achieve?

440
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,879
They never finish their sentence, and that only diverts more attention to them.

441
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:01,111
We're cultivating as well.

442
00:34:01,111 --> 00:34:05,492
How come some were born with access to so many resources,

443
00:34:05,492 --> 00:34:09,900
while we have to risk our lives
for a Foundation Pill?

444
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,300
- Exactly.
- That's unfair.

445
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,180
A Foundation Pill?

446
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,140
What is that?

447
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,780
You cannot not know this.

448
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,610
A Foundation Pill

449
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,550
can help a cultivator
to get to the Foundation Establishment Stage

450
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,450
from the Qi Refining Stage.

451
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,220
Qi Refining Stage?

452
00:34:26,604 --> 00:34:28,325
Which stage am I in?

453
00:34:28,325 --> 00:34:32,230
If you're just starting out, you're in the Qi Refining Stage.

454
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,160
And then?

455
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,750
Listen carefully.

456
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,960
In the world of cultivation,

457
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,480
all stages can be divided into

458
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,880
lower level, middle level, and upper level.

459
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,370
The lower level stages include

460
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,480
the Qi Refining
Stage, the Foundation Establishment Stage,

461
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,920
the Core Formation Stage,
the Nascent Soul Stage,

462
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,200
and the Spirit Transformation Stage.

463
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,270
The middle level stages
are the Void Refining Stage,

464
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,210
the Body Unity Stage, and
the Great Ascension Stage.

465
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,900
The upper level stage only has the Tribulation Transcendence Stage.

466
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,550
If you ascend from this stage,

467
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,180
you can become an immortal
and live as long as the universe.

468
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,480
But these are just myths.

469
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,570
No one has seen anyone
above the Nascent Soul Stage.

470
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,515
Is it very difficult to get a Foundation Pill?

471
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,250
It's not just difficult to get one.

472
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,690
The pill determines the fate of a cultivator,

473
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:24,720
and by extension, the future of a sect.

474
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,860
Therefore, in the past, the seven sects

475
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,330
and the prestigious families
had a monopoly over the pills.

476
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,940
They have all the pills.

477
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,780
Until the trials came along.

478
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,830
Han, at a glance, the trials give you a chance

479
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,110
to enter the seven sects.

480
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,370
But in reality, everyone is after the pills.

481
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,920
500 years ago, a veteran rogue cultivator

482
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,510
gathered thousands of other rogue cultivators

483
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,280
to negotiate with the seven sects.

484
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,130
Thanks to them,
we now have a chance to compete fairly

485
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,050
against disciples of prestigious clans
to enter the seven sects.

486
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,820
And as a result, we also become their enemies.

487
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,970
But let's be frank.

488
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,050
We rogue cultivators
do not have access to many things.

489
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,220
And those who hail from a prestigious clan

490
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,550
can feed their disciples with tons of elixirs.

491
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,700
- How is this fair?
- Yes, that's not fair.

492
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,740
Uneven distribution of resources.

493
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,660
No wonder they hate the clan disciples.

494
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,000
Have you found anything
about the rogue cultivators?

495
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,860
Several men are following
the core members as we speak.

496
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,110
The leader is a man called Qing Wen.

497
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,340
He has only attained Tier 11
of the Qi Refining Stage,

498
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,510
but he is a great speaker.

499
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,630
He has many followers among the rogue cultivators.

500
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,900
Keep a close eye on him.

501
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,590
Let me know if anything happens.

502
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,010
Yes.

503
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,970
My friends, the seven sects will put us through two trials.

504
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,300
The first one is the spirit root trial tomorrow.

505
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,880
The second one is the Tianwu Arena trial tomorrow.

506
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,360
The Tianwu Arena trial is very dangerous.

507
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,120
Therefore, we must secure a spot in tomorrow's trial first.

508
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,340
A spirit root

509
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,670
comes in five elements:
Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

510
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,560
- You know it already.
- Metal, wood, water, fire, .

511
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,720
- and earth.
- Mortals do not have a spirit root

512
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,800
so they cannot cultivate.

513
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,320
The more spirit roots you have,
the worse you progress.

514
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,360
Those who have four or five spirit root elements

515
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,610
can sense the spiritual aura around us.

516
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:21,220
Yet they can only reach Tier Three or Tier Four in their lives at most.

517
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,620
We call this a fake spirit root.

518
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,300
- Fake spirit root?
- Fake spirit root?

519
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,980
Those who have two or three spirit root elements

520
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,970
have a true spirit root.

521
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,860
Sir, what if the spirit root
comes with only one element?

522
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,450
Then, it is an exceptionally rare
heavenly spirit root.

523
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,920
A cultivator with that gift
has earned the favor of the maker.

524
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,660
His progress will defy comprehension.

525
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:47,300
I see. Cultivation is deeply tied to one's talent.

526
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,110
In that case, do I have a true spirit root

527
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,200
or a fake spirit root?

528
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,380
Physician Mo never told me.

529
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,490
I hope I have the heavenly spirit root.

530
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,330
There are only limited spots for those who wish to enroll in the seven sects

531
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,930
through the spirit root trial.

532
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,530
People from the prestigious clan

533
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:09,670
will do what they can to take our spots
in the seven sects.

534
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,740
They wish to impede our cultivation.

535
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,890
So, power speaks the loudest
in the cultivation world.

536
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,450
Tier 1 to Tier 13.

537
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,610
It is the complete set of Longevity Art.

538
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,710
Interested?

539
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,010
Pay up.

540
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,890
- How much?
- Nine gems.

541
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,230
Nine gems?

542
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,720
That's too expensive.

543
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,450
Tier Ten of the Qi Refining Stage?

544
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,930
Now you've seen what I can do.

545
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,700
Pay up.

546
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,180
Little girl, I do want to buy this book.

547
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,280
But nine gems is too expensive.

548
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,670
Can I ask for a better price?

549
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,220
How much are you offering?

550
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,660
Two?

551
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,840
Da. Er. San. Si.

552
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,660
Come!

553
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,760
Is this the guy?

554
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,450
That's right.

555
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,030
He read our book but refused to pay.

556
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,020
I'm selling it for nine gems.

557
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,500
But he only offered two.

558
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,360
What in the daylight robbery!

559
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,140
What?

560
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,665
How did you know we were robbers
before we started cultivating?

561
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,016
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

562
00:39:28,016 --> 00:39:29,880
We quit many years ago.

563
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,800
- How did you know?
- Speak up.

564
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,740
Everyone, this sign means two strengthening pills

565
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,410
for your book.

566
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,010
What do you think?

567
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,880
Give me the book.

568
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,170
Stand there. You can't leave.

569
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,710
I gave you the pills.

570
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,340
What else do you want?

571
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,560
- Your pills...
- You overpaid.

572
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

573
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,680
You can have the Longevity Art book.

574
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,170
This mega mystic pouch is a gift for you as well.

575
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,790
It's a gift.

576
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,540
The Five Mengs are righteous!

577
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,360
Indeed, indeed. Farewell.

578
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,880
No need to see me off!

579
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,400
No need!

580
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,951
The pills are more useful than gems.

581
00:40:57,951 --> 00:41:00,936
Lucky for me, I brought extra when I left
Shenshou Valley.

582
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,610
And now, I also have a mystic pouch.

583
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:07,470
I no longer have to bring many bags with me.

584
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,780
For your fragment of a magic item,

585
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,180
I'll buy it for five low-grade gems.

586
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,300
What do you think?

587
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,480
No.

588
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,410
It is nonetheless

589
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,570
a fragment from a Core Formation Stage
cultivator's magic item.

590
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,820
You keep promoting it.

591
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,280
What can it do exactly?

592
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,840
It's very useful.

593
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,380
Look.

594
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,400
I...

595
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,650
I can use that fragment
to hide the Green Vial.

596
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,050
It is a fragment of a magic item, all right.

597
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,780
But it's too small.

598
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,970
You know what?

599
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:44,060
Given you also have a cute face,

600
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,540
I will offer one strengthening pill.

601
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,260
Mister Lu,

602
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,970
you're taking advantage of her.

603
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,300
I offer six gems.

604
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,590
Can I have it?

605
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,550
I offer seven gems.

606
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,710
Eight gems.

607
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,050
Okay. Eight gems, it is.

608
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,660
Sorry.

609
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,920
I was just joking around.

610
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,020
Me too.

611
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:10,000
Besides, Miss. Your fragment
truly isn't worth that much.

612
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,180
Miss. Don't go.

613
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,990
They don't want it, but I do.

614
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,180
One gem.

615
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,860
I offer one gem.

616
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,930
I'm asking for seven gems.

617
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:31,280
All of you... Is anyone else interested?

618
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,260
I don't think anyone else is bidding.

619
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,880
Anyone?

620
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,410
Two vials of Golden Marrow Pill

621
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,483
for your fragment of a magic item, please.

622
00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:45,940
Please don't tell me you're joking around too.

623
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,530
Deal.

624
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,360
My friend, why are you doing this?

625
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,300
You ruined my negotiation for no reason at all.

626
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,170
You think you can leave?

627
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:23,930
But I bought this fragment with a fair price.

628
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,820
Isn't this a fair trade?

629
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,860
Fine.

630
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,620
Let me teach you what fairness means.

633
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:53,360
♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫

634
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:59,294
♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫

635
00:43:59,294 --> 00:44:02,740
♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫

636
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,275
♫ Old scenes rise again ♫

637
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:08,536
♫ Too hard to forget ♫

638
00:44:08,536 --> 00:44:13,440
♫ Easier just to miss ♫

639
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,156
♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫

640
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:25,840
♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫

641
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,300
♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫

642
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,720
♫ Swept away by time ♫

643
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,040
♫ Eyes once looked far ♫

644
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,200
♫ Now lost in the shift ♫

645
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,480
♫ Autumn winds stir ♫

646
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,080
♫ Smoke curls once more ♫

647
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,040
♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫

648
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,140
♫ Returning to my eyes ♫

649
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,640
♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫

650
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,520
♫ Time lost its name ♫

651
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,761
♫ Was it yesterday ♫

652
00:45:01,761 --> 00:45:05,954
♫ Or tomorrow? ♫

653
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:09,320
♫ The world has changed ♫

654
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,540
♫ Beyond recall ♫

655
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,500
♫ Time will fade ♫

656
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,880
♫ All the words ever spoken ♫

657
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,610
♫ Only this longing remains ♫

658
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:28,840
♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫

659
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:35,492
♫ In a fleeting moment we call eternity ♫

660
00:45:35,492 --> 00:45:46,212
♫ In a fleeting moment called eternity ♫
