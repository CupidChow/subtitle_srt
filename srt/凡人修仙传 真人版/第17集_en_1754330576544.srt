Episode 14

6
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,880
Brother Han

7
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:58,960
What's going on here?

8
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
What's going on?

9
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
We're leaving the city.

10
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
There's a bad guy chasing us.

11
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
I can leave the city by taking the ancient water route.

12
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
I'll take you there.

13
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
This way.

14
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Brother Han.

15
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Why is it suddenly dark?

16
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Brother Han.

17
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,960
This is the way that a patient I treated told me.

18
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
We can go straight out of the city.

19
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Why is it a dead end?

20
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Dead end?

21
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Back off.

22
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Don't hurt yourself.

23
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
My name is Dong Xuan.

24
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
What's your name?

25
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
My surname is Meng Cai Huan.

26
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
I'm Brother Han's friend.

27
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Friend?

28
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
When did you meet your friend?

29
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
It's very early.

30
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,960
No wonder you didn't hear him.

31
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,960
We haven't seen each other for many years.

32
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
A date?

33
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
I also want a friend who can watch fireworks together.

34
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
Hurry up.

35
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
The chase is coming.

36
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
There's light ahead.

37
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Hurry up.

38
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Elders.

39
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,960
I think everyone already knows the news of the destruction of the Jiang and Che Qi Kingdom.

40
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
The demon road has been in use for a long time.

41
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
This time, the wolf is really here.

42
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,960
I think the royal family of these two countries are secretly practicing the immortal laws and trying to practice immortality.

43
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
They broke the rules of the king's not being able to practice the Tao first.

44
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,960
The demon road is also a good start.

45
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,960
The two corners of the country are like a bull's eye.

46
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,960
In fact, the state of Zheng is fighting.

47
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,960
Why do our seven sects of Yue have to interfere?

48
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,960
If the demon road is angered, it will cause a fire to rise.

49
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Yes.

50
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Everyone.

51
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Since the palace has invited everyone here, let's listen to what he has to say first.

52
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,960
After all, I heard that Yuan Ying Xiu is also involved in this battle.

53
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Yes.

54
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,960
It's the old group of the Yunlu of the Hehuan Sect.

55
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
The old group of the Yunlu?

56
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
What do you mean by these old guys?

57
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,960
You can say whatever you want. Why are you looking at my senior?

58
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Everyone.

59
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
The one who has gathered everyone here today is not me.

60
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,960
It's the South Palace Pillar of the Moon Sect.

61
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
What did you say? Yanjia Bao's head of the enemy?

62
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
I saw it with my own eyes.

63
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Two big battles have been started in Yanjia Bao.

64
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,960
In addition to the isolation of the探室, the purpose is to trap all the seven sect disciples who are going to attend the wedding in the city.

65
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
It seems to be a good news.

66
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,960
In fact, it's a trap set by Yanjia Bao and the evil sect.

67
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,960
How is this possible?

68
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
I dare not delay.

69
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,960
Once I find out, I will immediately come back to report.

70
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
I should have thought about it.

71
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Yanjia Bao is out of the border.

72
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,960
How can he be in contact with the Jiang State?

73
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Yan Wu Yan is getting married.

74
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
And about Qin Er.

75
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,960
There are so many doubts. How come I didn't notice?

76
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
The tribe has been alerted enough.

77
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,960
If you hadn't reminded me to pay attention to the evil sect's actions,

78
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,960
I wouldn't have gone to Yanjia Bao to investigate.

79
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,960
The seven sect elders are still in the valley.

80
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Come with me to the Yellow Wind Valley.

81
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Go to the Yellow Wind Valley?

82
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
They are discussing things there now.

83
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,960
I want you to tell them everything you know.

84
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Let's go.

85
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Senior Han, the cultivation committee is back.

86
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
It seems that we have left the battle area.

87
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Let's go first.

88
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
They are here.

89
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
You guys go.

90
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
There are mines all around.

91
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
We can't run away.

92
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Miss Mo, you go first.

93
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Senior Han and I will drag her for a while.

94
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
You guys...

95
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Hurry up and go.

96
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Hurry up and go.

97
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
You guys be careful.

98
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Hurry up and go.

99
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Senior Han, we meet again.

100
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Demon, why are you still following me?

101
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
You little rascal from the Yellow Wind Valley.

102
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
I underestimated you before.

103
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
You are the one who is the most powerful.

104
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
You are the most powerful.

105
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
You are the most powerful.

106
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
I underestimated you before.

107
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
I will expose your name

108
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
and kill all the soldiers in the imperial court.

109
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
The Yellow Wind Valley, Li Feiyu.

110
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
It's not worth mentioning.

111
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Li Feiyu.

112
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,960
You can already destroy my plans.

113
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
It seems that you are a little rascal

114
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,960
in the Yellow Wind Valley.

115
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
You are just a little rascal.

116
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
You dare to call yourself a rascal?

117
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
I will tell you the truth.

118
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
I have been to many places in the Yellow Wind Valley.

119
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
I have been to many places in the Yellow Wind Valley.

120
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
I am just a little rascal.

121
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,960
But I am still better than you.

122
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Okay.

123
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
This blood?

124
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
It will turn into bones.

125
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Run!

126
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Run!

127
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Wang Shaofei!

128
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
No one can escape from me.

129
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Go back!

130
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
You are trapped in the formation.

131
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Run out before you die.

132
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Still want to run?

133
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
The flying tally is too fast.

134
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
I can't hold on anymore.

135
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
I still have one last flying tally.

136
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
I will send you out first.

137
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
What about you?

138
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
I have my own way.

139
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Finally, I sent him away.

140
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Master, I just want to ask you a question.

141
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
At least, I have an explanation.

142
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
You must not die.

143
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
You must come back alive.

144
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Okay.

145
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Then I will play with you first.

146
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Tell me how to die.

147
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,960
I am sorry to meet you today.

148
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
You did the bloodshed in the Purple Sleeve.

149
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,960
You called the seven gangs and stole the Yanjia Treasures.

150
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
You are so agitated.

151
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
What other plans do you have?

152
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Can you make it clear to me?

153
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Don't talk to me like that.

154
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Do you think I don't know what you are thinking?

155
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,960
You just want to keep the two women away from you.

156
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
You think I am stupid?

157
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
You are so smart.

158
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Die!

159
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
No way.

160
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
How can he fight against me?

161
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Die!

162
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
It's okay.

163
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Each team is the captain.

164
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,960
We can fight with him.

165
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Tianning Jing.

166
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Oh no.

167
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
He is going to die.

168
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Xia Ruining.

169
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
You are here.

170
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
You are here.

171
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
You are here.

172
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
You are here.

173
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
You are here.

174
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
You are here.

175
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
You are here.

176
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
You are here.

177
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
You are here.

178
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
You are here.

179
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
He is quite something.

180
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Jin Jiangji.

181
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
Go.

182
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Jin Yuan Sword.

183
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
You are not on the stage yet.

184
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
You can't fight against me.

185
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
What?

186
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
What?

187
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
I don't know.

188
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Come here.

189
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
Die!

190
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
The tenth move of the Moon Spirit Technique.

191
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
Moon Spirit Explosion.

192
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Oh no.

193
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
I finally got you.

194
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Moon Spirit Explosion.

195
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
Oh no.

196
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
I don't know.

197
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
This Golden Fire Palm

198
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
is the only thing I know.

199
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Speaking of which,

200
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
I got it in the Blood Color Border.

201
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
You...

202
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,960
You are so stupid.

203
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
What's the point of fighting against

204
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
someone like you?

205
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
You are not a man.

206
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
You are not a man.

207
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
You are not a man.

208
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
You are not a man.

209
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
You are not a man.

210
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
You are not a man.

211
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
You are not a man.

212
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
You are not a man.

213
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
You cannot be unnecessary.

214
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
You beat me.

215
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
You Li Feiyu.

216
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
I bullied you.

217
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
I'm afraid that I'll be in danger if I keep fighting.

218
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Elder Jiedan is a man of great power.

219
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
He's not a man of great power.

220
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
This is the disciple of the Yanyue Sect, Xuan Yue.

221
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
He's been in charge of contacting Yanjia Bao.

222
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Yanjia Bao is in big trouble.

223
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Tell everyone what you know.

224
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
I'm not a man of great power.

225
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
I'm a man of great power.

226
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
I'm a man of great power.

227
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
I'm a man of great power.

228
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Tell everyone what you know.

229
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Elders,

230
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
I saw it with my own eyes.

231
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Yanjia Bao and the evil sect are working together

232
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
to set up a trap.

233
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
All the disciples of the seven sects

234
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
who participated in the wedding

235
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
have been trapped in the city.

236
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
They're all dead.

237
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
What did you say?

238
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
How is that possible?

239
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
The evil sects didn't plan to let Yue State go.

240
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
They're going to attack Yanjia Bao today.

241
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
They might attack the whole sect tomorrow.

242
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Xuan Yue.

243
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,500
Wudang Hall

244
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:37,960
'tii

245
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Yan.

246
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Yan, you're awake.

247
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Father, Father.

248
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
Yan, you're awake.

249
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,880
What do you think?

250
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,600
Shouldn't I be playing Yue Zong?

251
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,800
Are you feeling unwell?

252
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,360
How did I get hurt like this?

253
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,560
Don't panic.

254
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,760
Listen to me.

255
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,960
During your coma,

256
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,600
too many things happened.

257
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,360
I can only tell you

258
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,880
that you are now the Young Master of the Gui Ling Sect.

259
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,840
The time of death is near.

260
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,640
Yanjia Bao

261
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,800
is officially sick at the Gui Ling Sect.

262
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,800
Father, what are you talking about?

263
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,280
The Gui Ling Sect is a evil sect.

264
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,440
Are you trying to defeat the Seven Sects?

265
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,280
Seven Sects?

266
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,880
Yan'er,

267
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,200
don't blame me.

268
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,480
When you were sick,

269
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,400
who cared about you?

270
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,360
I didn't want to betray you.

271
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,560
They forced me to rebel.

272
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,880
I can only do this

273
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,920
to save you.

274
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,720
I can only do this to save you.

275
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,400
I can only do this to save you.

276
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,120
I can feel the spiritual power

277
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
of those who are willing to die.

278
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,560
So,

279
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,400
these people died because of me.

280
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,440
They didn't die,

281
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,880
so you can't live.

282
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,640
Su,

283
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,400
I, Yanjia Bao, have been a demon for 300 years.

284
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
It's just because of me.

285
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,440
It's just because of me that you went to fight against the evil.

286
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,160
If I had known this,

287
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,280
why did you save me?

288
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,400
I want to go back to Yan Yue Village.

289
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,320
Yan'er, stop.

290
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,560
Yan'er, it's okay.

291
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,360
Yan'er, stop.

292
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,280
Yan'er.

293
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,160
Yan'er.

294
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
Yan'er, you can't go back.

295
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,280
Your husband's death was caused by the blood of the bloodline.

296
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,880
He used the blood of Qi Bai to save you.

297
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,520
Do you think you can go back?

298
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
In Yan Yue Village,

299
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,720
more than 700 years have passed.

300
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,680
We are already dead.

301
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,880
You can't go back.

302
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,240
Yan Yue Village you've been living on is also dead.

303
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,440
Stop.

304
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,520
I'm dying.

305
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,320
Here.

306
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Father is old,

307
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,040
his cultivation

308
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,560
You have unlimited potential on this road.

309
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,320
I always believed

310
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,480
you would be the first Yuan Yingxiu

311
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,800
in our family.

312
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,920
With your protection,

313
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,480
no one dares to bully us again.

314
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,720
Yan,

315
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,160
I must save you.

316
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,400
Not only because you are my daughter,

317
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
but also because

318
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,640
you are the future of our Yan family.

319
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,620
The strength of the Yan family

320
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,240
will be in yours.

321
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,880
The other layer,

322
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,000
is our rear wheels.

323
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,920
Our rear wheels

324
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,880
will not fail again

325
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,720
in surgery.

326
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,960
When Yonghuang

327
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,000
walks on it,

328
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,660
I will do whatever book jog Plan B could take me,

329
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,720
if anything went wrong, I will stay behind.

330
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,960
This will be clearly done.

331
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,920
Or else, this will be painful.

332
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,540
Then just let me rest for a change.

333
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,560
You still seem to believe that you can always succeed.

334
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,880
Until the day the goddamn game of Maotai begins,

335
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,120
I will only hope to achieve my goal.

336
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,200
Alright.

337
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,120
We too have a chance.

338
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,520
You said a lot of things that were inconvenient to do.

339
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,680
We shouldn't have asked you.

340
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,840
But...

341
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,600
It's about the Seven Devils.

342
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,200
We have no choice but to ask.

343
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,080
Before, I had fought a demon master who was a part of the Yue State.

344
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,720
He said that the Yue State also has a Jiedan Master to rely on.

345
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,080
Even the Jiedan Master also relies on the demon master?

346
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,400
No wonder they pushed the Three-Demon Prince and disappeared.

347
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,600
They turned out to be traitors.

348
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,680
Are you sure about what that person said?

349
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,640
There's nothing that I'm completely sure about right now.

350
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,640
I'm saying this to tell the Seven Devils that they can't just watch.

351
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,520
They should be careful of their back.

352
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,840
I won't forget what Nan Gong said.

353
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,280
Right now, Yan Jiabao is already a head of the enemy.

354
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,000
The Yue State can be a door to the door.

355
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,360
I wonder if you have any countermeasures.

356
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,280
The demon path is fierce.

357
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,480
The Yuan Yi Cult is also participating in the war.

358
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,440
We can only go find Elder Yuan Yi to appear.

359
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,680
At least we can control the war fire between the high-level Cultists

360
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,360
to avoid the mortal's life being in danger.

361
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,080
Of course. You are thoughtful.

362
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,960
Besides, the battle between the Jiedan Cultists is the key to determining the winner.

363
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,320
All the front lines must have Jiedan Cultist as their assistant

364
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,080
so that they can resist the attack of the demon path.

365
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,320
I agree. Yan Jiabao has already fallen.

366
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,920
My Huangfeng Valley and the Moon Sect should be the first to fight against the demon path.

367
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,680
Junior Brother Li and I will lead our troops to go there.

368
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,600
Senior Brother, you are so wise. I admire you.

369
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,240
Third, it's time to let the Golden Eagle attack the disciples.

370
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,360
We need to form a team to go to Yan Jiabao's side to search for the comrades.

371
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,000
Once the demon path moves, we will report back immediately.

372
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,800
Our Moon Sect is led by the Xuan Yue team.

373
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,120
This time, we are searching for the complete counterattack.

374
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,840
I will obey your command.

375
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,160
Junior Master Xuan Yue,

376
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,160
are there really no one left from the seven sects?

377
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,720
Uncle, I wasn't able to go there on the spot.

378
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,320
But I'm afraid that there are more than ten people.

379
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,600
Senior Sister, don't worry. My little disciple is very cautious.

380
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Before he leaves, he will guarantee that he will take care of Xuan'er.

381
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,200
So if anyone misses, it will definitely be him and Xuan'er.

382
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,280
But Hanli is just a bait.

383
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,920
Hanli? He went to Yan Jiabao?

384
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,520
He won't die like this, right?

385
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,920
And...

386
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,760
Mister, let me ask you a question.

387
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
I think you are fatally captivated by late Leftoushan稔

388
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,160
when you were in Golden binding.

389
00:26:42,160 --> 00:27:00,220
The Lord is like a

390
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:00,480
什么

391
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
Miss Mo!

392
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Brother Han!

393
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Come up!

394
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Brother Han!

395
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
Come on.

396
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Brother Han, are you badly hurt?

397
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,480
I'm fine. I've taken the pill.

398
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Did the bad guy who chased you kill him?

399
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,480
No. But he's in a bad mood.

400
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Brother Han, I'm sorry.

401
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
I'm sorry.

402
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
I'm sorry.

403
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
I'm sorry.

404
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,480
What are you going to do after that?

405
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,480
There's a village ahead. You can hide.

406
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
Then go to the capital.

407
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Don't be too dangerous.

408
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,480
We met ten years ago.

409
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,480
I don't know when we'll meet again.

410
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,480
You can live a long life.

411
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,480
But I'm an ordinary person.

412
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,480
I have a few decades.

413
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Can I wait until that day?

414
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
I'll wait for you.

415
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Brother Han.

416
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
It's okay.

417
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Miss Mo, I can only take you here.

418
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,480
If I'm right, there will be a big battle in the next cultivation festival.

419
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
I have some pills here.

420
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
You can take them yourself.

421
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
You can take them to pay for them.

422
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
Go to the capital and settle down.

423
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Have a few peaceful days.

424
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
I don't need these.

425
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Miss Mo.

426
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,480
When will we meet again after this farewell?

427
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Take care of yourself.

428
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
Brother Han.

429
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,480
If I have the spiritual root,

430
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,480
can I stay by your side?

431
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,480
You always have such a hard time.

432
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
You don't say anything.

433
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
I love you.

434
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Take care of yourself.

435
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
Brother Han.

436
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Take care.

437
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,480
The wind rises and the sword blows.

438
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,480
It's like the sky changes.

439
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,480
It's like the face of the moon.

440
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,480
Looking back at the mountain top,

441
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,480
I've forgotten the past.

442
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,480
It's yesterday.

443
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,480
It's tomorrow.

444
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,480
The past is not as good as the past.

445
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:02,480
The light will also erase all the wishes in the world.

446
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:12,480
Only this year has passed thousands of years.

447
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,480
In the moment of eternal life.

448
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:29,480
In the moment of eternal life.

449
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Is he really dead?

450
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
Grand Master.

451
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
What is it?

452
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,480
You asked me to find the blood of the royal family of the State of Che and Jiang.

453
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
I only brought back two children.

454
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
Stay in the tribe.

455
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,480
If you have the spiritual root, teach them to cultivate.

456
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,480
If not, find a British family to adopt.

457
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Yes.

458
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
Grand Master.

459
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,480
When I sneaked into the two countries, I found something strange.

460
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,480
The Taoist priest concentrated the people of the two countries together.

461
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Test the spiritual root.

462
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Everyone who has the spiritual root, take them all to the scene.

463
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Even the children are not spared.

464
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,480
I'm really heartbroken.

465
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Aren't you afraid of hurting the world?

466
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Tell me.

467
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,480
Why are they doing this?

468
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
Of course, they are forcing their cultivation.

469
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Using the secret method to force their progress.

470
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Send them to the front line to kill us.

471
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Even if these people are alive, their spiritual roots are gone.

472
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
They won't live long.

473
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Who is it?

474
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,480
Congratulations, Young Master.

475
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,480
Young Master, you have great spiritual power.

476
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
You have a small skill.

477
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
You are not a man of the blood.

478
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,480
I'm sure you are one of the Seven Sects.

479
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
You are worthy of being killed.

480
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
Get lost.

481
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
I'm not a man of the blood.

482
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
I'm a man of the blood.

483
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
I'm a man of the blood.

484
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,480
Young Master, you are badly hurt.

485
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
The blood is all over the place.

486
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
Don't be so stubborn.

487
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,480
Zhongwu, you know the people of the Seven Sects.

488
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,480
You have also gone to the Blood-red Golden Land.

489
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
You have also gone to the Blood-red Golden Land.

490
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
You have also gone to the Blood-red Golden Land.

491
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
You have also gone to the Blood-red Golden Land.

492
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Have you ever met a guy named Li Feiyu?

493
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,480
Young Master, I was just busy making trouble.

494
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,480
Who can remember their names?

495
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,480
How about this?

496
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Let's wait until we beat Huangfeng Valley down.

497
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
I'll catch them all.

498
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
You just give them to him.

499
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Isn't that a deal?

500
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Then order them to

501
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
find out his whereabouts.

502
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,480
This guy is more hurt than me.

503
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
He can't run far.

504
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
He can't run far?

505
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,480
How can he run far?

506
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Wait.

507
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
How is Yan Ruyan's condition?

508
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
He is awake.

509
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
But maybe he woke up and found that

510
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
he lost his family and married someone else.

511
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
He was greatly stimulated.

512
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
Now no one cares.

513
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
The big picture is set.

514
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
I can't afford to lose him.

515
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
Let me write a few more poems.

516
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
I'll take my leave.

517
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
I'm leaving.

518
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,480
You're really a good girl.

519
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,480
Let's get to know each other.

520
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
My name is Wang Chan.

521
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
I'm your new husband.

522
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
You thief.

523
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
You'd better kill me today.

524
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Or I'll kill you one day.

525
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
If you really want to take revenge,

526
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,480
then let's break up.

527
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
When you're able to get better,

528
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
come to me as soon as possible.

529
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
You're shameless.

530
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
I'm afraid that

531
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,480
you can't bear to kill me.

532
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
It's still day time.

533
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Congratulations on your nephew's new marriage.

534
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,480
My nephew should congratulate me.

535
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
He won the car race again.

536
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
He even made the fishmonger so happy.

537
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
You're so sweet.

538
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
You did a good job in Yan's family.

539
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,480
I've already paid my brother a tribute for you.

540
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
My brother knows that

541
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
he can't even drink.

542
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Thank you, my dear.

543
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,480
But you lost to a nobody

544
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,480
in Yan's family.

545
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
If my brother knows,

546
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
he won't be happy.

547
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Aunt,

548
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
I'm sorry.

549
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
I'll be more careful in the future.

550
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
You're really my good son.

551
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,480
You're sensible.

552
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
Your small body is badly injured.

553
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,480
Don't go to the fight next time.

554
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Why?

555
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,480
I'll just go there.

556
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
You're so stupid.

557
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,480
This is not the first time for Yan's family.

558
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,480
You're a son-in-law of a rich family.

559
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
You should stay at home with your new wife.

560
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,480
Forget about the war.

561
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
This is my brother.

562
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
Your father wants this.

563
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,480
Now the situation is urgent.

564
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
Where are the people who can send you to the front line?

565
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,480
I recruited a lot of mortals

566
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
from Jiang and Cheqi.

567
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Mortals?

568
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,480
They're all mortals with spiritual roots.

569
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I'm sorry.

570
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Okay.

571
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Go to the hell with your new wife.

572
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
Sorry to make you laugh.

573
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480
This is the real look of the Ghost Realm.

574
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
You have to get used to it.

575
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,480
Is this your aunt?

576
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Yes.

577
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
But she's also

578
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
the one who wants me to die most in the world.

579
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,480
Your family relationship is really special.

580
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
From now on, it's also your family.

581
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480
Don't worry.

582
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,480
I'll need you very much in the future.

583
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,480
But I'll betray you at any time and use you.

584
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,480
Of course,

585
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,480
you can betray me at any time

586
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
and use me.

587
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Madam.

588
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,480
Everyone must know about Yan's family treasure.

589
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
The evil is rampant.

590
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
We must be careful.

591
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
Under the order of the seven elders,

592
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
we, Huangfeng Valley,

593
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,480
will send some disciples

594
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:27,400
to join the seven-man

595
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
and the eight-man

596
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,480
sect.

597
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,480
I'm afraid that

598
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
the evil is rampant.

599
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
But I was given the elixir

600
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,480
and succeeded in the operation.

601
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
But I'm afraid that

602
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,480
I will leave a new edict.

603
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,480
This time, the evil is rampant.

604
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
I have a good relationship with my junior sister and brother Han.

605
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,480
I really can't do nothing.

606
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
Please help me.

607
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
Since you are kind to your junior sister,

608
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
then please

609
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,480
go to the Five County's junior brother.

610
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,480
Xuan Yue will take the order.

611
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,480
Those who are in the rear team,

612
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,480
follow me.

613
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
Yes.

614
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,480
Father.

615
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,480
Listen to my order.

616
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,480
Now the evil is rampant.

617
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,480
We have seven sects to declare war.

618
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
The elders in the sect have ordered

619
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
that the disciples of the seven-man sect

620
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,480
will be sent to the seven-man sect

621
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
to join the seven-man sect

622
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,480
and choose a front-line battlefield

623
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,480
to fight against the evil.

624
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,480
You can't retreat

625
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,480
or surrender to war.

626
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,480
Those who disobey the order

627
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,480
will be punished severely.

628
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,480
Yes.

629
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,480
The blood and blood fall in the water.

630
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,480
This is a year of love.

631
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,480
The green leaves are flowing.

632
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,480
The scenery is beautiful.

633
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
It's hard to forget.

634
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,480
It's better to miss it.

635
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,480
It's said that the past is like a leaf.

636
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,480
Looking back, it's absurd.

637
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,480
The lonely books in the school

638
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
are ruined.

639
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,480
I only hope that

640
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,480
the past is like a sword.

641
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,480
The wind blows and the sword blows.

642
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,480
The water is like a river.

643
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:06,660
It's like a

644
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,480
dream.

645
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,480
Looking back, it's absurd.

646
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,480
I have forgotten the past.

647
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,480
It's yesterday.

648
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,480
It's tomorrow.

649
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:26,480
I have forgotten all the promises in the world.

650
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,480
Only this longing

651
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,480
has been crossed a thousand years.

652
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,480
In the moment of eternal light.

653
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:53,480
In the moment of eternal light.
