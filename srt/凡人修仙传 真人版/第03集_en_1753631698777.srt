Episode 16

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He's back.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There are still two of them.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Who's the one with the mask?

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How's the training going?

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You asked too early.

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's not time yet.

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The world is so big.

13
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No matter where you are,

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I always think of you.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm always thinking of you.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm always thinking of you.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm always thinking of you.

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm always thinking of you.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm always thinking of you.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The dead flag on Dr. Mo's face is getting heavier.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Acupuncture.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Since you lied to me,

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't need to tell you the truth.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The most powerful part of the fifth level

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
is to control the acupuncture power in the body.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If the cultivation is controlled on the third level,

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
he won't be able to find it.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I told you not to play tricks on me.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How are you going to deal with me?

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Not bad.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're indeed the one I chose.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You can still change your face now.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But don't worry.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It will be fine.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's not even a year yet.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But it's been so long.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why is your cultivation still on the third level?

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're still a young man.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How can you stay on the third level?

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I've tried my best.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you know

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
what I gave you last time?

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hold on to this.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That medicine is called the Poisonous Pill.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Or that's not a medicine.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Poisonous Pill

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
is a kind of insecticide

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
that is made by secret methods.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
After taking it,

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
it will settle down in the body.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But don't worry.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You'll be safe

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
in this period of time.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
As long as you take

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
the antidote I made

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
secretly within a year,

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the insecticide will automatically dissolve

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and leave no隱患.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Otherwise,

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the insecticide

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
will absorb nutrients

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and degrade the body.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Then it will

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
make your internal organs

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and kidney

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
die in pain

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and death.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's right.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I went to Qingniu Town

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
a few days ago.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I saw your family

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and your family

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
in the distance.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They were doing well.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They ate a lot.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And your sister

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
was a good girl

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
except for being a big girl.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I promise

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll be the fourth

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
in the third month.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's right.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, I've been

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
in the field of medicine

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
for the past few months.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I won't go anywhere.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This is the antidote

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I've been looking for

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
for you.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's very helpful for you

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
to practice martial arts.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
In the next three months,

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you can do whatever you want.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't worry.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I won't be working out anymore.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's just

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
if you don't get it by then,

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
you'll be in a bad situation.

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you don't get it,

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
then three months later,

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
you'll be in a bad situation.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There are three months left.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I have to hurry.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
One year and a half.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I even learned how to cure the poison.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I didn't teach him this.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You brat.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're cruel.

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You're shameless.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I've been practicing martial arts.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I've been practicing martial arts.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I've been practicing martial arts.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I've been practicing martial arts.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I've been practicing martial arts.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I can't get a normal method

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
from a master like Dr. Mo.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Li Feiyu helped me find a secret technique

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
called the blink of an eye.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He said it's the best for people

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
who don't have any foundation like me.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In fact, rather than a sword,

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
it's more like a killing technique.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What's important is how to use the environment

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
to set up traps

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and use light to distract the enemy.

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In the end,

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
the trick will work.

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I've finally reached the sixth level.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
My martial arts sense has been improved.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The wind and rain are flowing.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The sound of the flying insects

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
can be felt clearly.

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No.

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No, no, no.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You're really a good apprentice,

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
like a master.

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You're so fast.

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Why are you faster every day?

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm still good at teaching you.

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Here you are.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's perfect to match your blink of an eye.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Thanks.

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm going back.

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Han Li.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Although I don't know

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
what you've been through recently,

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
no matter what happens,

148
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
don't hold on to it alone.

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Remember to recite the flying insects' stories.

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Take care.

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The three-month period has come.

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Mo Da Fu,

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm here.

154
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
For today,

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I've done everything I could.

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm not afraid anymore.

157
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's quite timely.

158
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Where's the antidote?

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Have you reached the fourth level?

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The antidote.

161
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
When people are struggling,

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
they will be inspired by

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
the unimaginable abilities.

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm sure

165
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
you've got the ability.

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay.

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Take it away.

168
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm still a beginner.

169
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm still a beginner.

170
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I have one more question.

171
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Go ahead.

172
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Did you really

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
go home with the antidote?

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Of course.

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You're lying.

176
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We've made a deal.

177
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If you don't show up,

178
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
you'll never go home.

179
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Look at you.

180
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You're half-hearted.

181
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You're just a kid.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You're just a childish joke.

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You've already made up your mind.

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Why bother asking?

185
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Let me go to the fourth level

186
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and cure your poison.

187
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're lying to me.

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll tell you

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
everything you want to know.

190
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's cold outside.

191
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Come on.

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's talk inside.

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Come on.

194
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Come on.

195
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Come on.

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Come on.

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Come on.

198
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Come on.

199
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Come on.

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Come on.

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Come on.

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Come on.

203
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Come on.

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Come on.

205
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Come on.

206
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Come on.

207
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Come on.

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Come on.

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Come on.

210
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
mouths

211
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
the fourth level.

212
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I can't die

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
for only 37 years

214
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and I'm far away

215
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm not alive enough.

216
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,400
What's so strange?

217
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,800
A 37-year-old man called himself an old man.

218
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,400
Anyone who sees it will think he's from

219
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,800
the old family of the old.

220
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,000
If I hadn't been poisoned,

221
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I would have had to suppress it.

222
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,200
Why would I waste this opportunity?

223
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,600
Come on.

224
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,200
Han Yulin.

225
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,600
Today is the day we two

226
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,600
are destined to meet.

227
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,200
Use whatever means you have.

228
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,600
Let me see what you've prepared.

229
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Three months later

230
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,200
Three months later

231
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,800
You've achieved so much.

232
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You've been always

233
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,200
surprising me.

234
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,200
Han Yulin

235
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,600
But my reputation

236
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,200
is not just about art.

237
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,400
Han Yulin

238
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Come with me.

239
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Tan Jiaxin

240
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,680
Mo Juying's one of the best您

241
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,600

243
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:24,000
Today, it is surroundedSP

244
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,000
Be quiet

245
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
Sun Yunlan!

246
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,320
And finally

247
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,680

248
00:17:42,960 --> 00:18:04,980

Ma reminder,

In this temple,

252
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,420
Ma clerk is in charge of the musical director side.

253
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,380
I die!

254
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,220

255
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,760
Pull it.

265
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,060
a

266
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,940
name

267
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,720
that

268
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,540
supermarket

269
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,120
that

270
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,360
recycled

271
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,620
Should I curse Yatian

272
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,280
and send it to her?

273
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,660
It's all your fault

274
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,000
for getting marijuana stuck in my hand!

275
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,800
You should be punished for jailing somebody else!

276
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,520
You did no wrong.

277
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,160
I've been working since I was little.

278
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,120
I just drew them out of disrepair.

279
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,520
Don't worry.

280
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,880
An Li,

281
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,160
we're crosslings after all.

282
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,520
We won't let you get 개� nicknamed as medate.

283
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,680
Zhang Tian,

284
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,320
do you until it happens to you?

285
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
He treats you as his biological parents.

286
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
How much more do you want from him?

287
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,160
I have no choice.

288
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,160
Who says he doesn't have a soul?

289
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Who says he doesn't know the Long-lasting Decay?

290
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Then he only has me.

291
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,160
It's useless.

292
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Mu Jiyuan!

293
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Don't talk nonsense with him.

294
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
Do it!

295
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,160
What are you yelling at?

296
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
As things stand,

297
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,160
as long as you can use the Seven-Ghost Soul Beads,

298
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,160
he won't be able to escape.

299
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Who are you talking to?

300
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Who is that person?

301
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,160
I'm not going to talk to you.

302
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,160
I'm going to kill you.

303
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,160
I'm going to kill you.

304
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,160
I'm going to kill you.

305
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,160
I'm going to kill you.

306
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,160
I'm going to kill you.

307
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,160
I'm going to kill you.

308
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,160
I'm going to kill you.

309
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,160
I'm going to kill you.

310
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,160
I'm going to kill you.

311
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,160
I'm going to kill you.

312
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,160
I'm going to kill you.

313
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,160
I'm going to kill you.

314
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,160
I'm going to kill you.

315
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,160
I'm going to kill you.

316
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,160
I'm going to kill you.

317
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,160
I'm going to kill you.

318
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,160
I'm going to kill you.

319
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,160
I'm going to kill you.

320
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,160
I'm going to kill you.

321
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,160
I'm going to kill you.

322
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,160
I'm going to kill you.

323
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm going to kill you.

324
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,160
I'm going to kill you.

325
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,160
I'm going to kill you.

326
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,160
I'm going to kill you.

327
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,160
I'm going to kill you.

328
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,160
Come on.

329
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,160
Don't be afraid.

330
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Don't resist.

331
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,160
I'm so worried about the victory.

332
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,160
I've been running this business for a long time.

333
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,160
It's so exciting to feel like a new life.

334
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Seven Ghosts.

335
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,160
Who are you?

336
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Who are you?

337
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Who are you?

338
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Look.

339
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,160
This is what I used to look like.

340
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Don't be afraid.

341
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,160
There won't be such pain.

342
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,160
It's over soon.

343
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,160
Give him a body-suppressing talisman.

344
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Don't let him bite his tongue.

345
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,160
Hurry up.

346
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,160
Everything you did won't be in vain.

347
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,160
Everything you did is all because of us.

348
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,160
I'm going to kill the hero.

349
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,160
I'm going to kill the hero.

350
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,160
Leave Bärmäki to me.

351
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Help me.

352
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Help me.

353
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Help me.

354
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
It's mine.

355
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
Help me.

356
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Help me.

357
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
Help me.

358
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
No.

359
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
This is my body.

360
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,160
All of you, get out.

361
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Why can he shoot?

362
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
You said I could use the Seven Devils to shoot.

363
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
How far can you go?

364
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,160
The way I taught you is to practice the four layers of skill.

365
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,160
And he also learned the fourth layer.

366
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,160
So you want us to lose and win.

367
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
And then you can use it to gain power.

368
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
You are mine.

369
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
You are a cruel man.

370
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
I won't let you win.

371
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
I won't let you win.

372
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
He is my disciple.

373
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,160
You are a cruel man.

374
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
You can't win.

375
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Sixth layer.

376
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
He lied to me.

377
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
He shot my sixth layer.

378
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Han Li.

379
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
Han Li.

380
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,160
It seems that I am really

381
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
the one who can't win.

382
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
I'm the one who can't win.

383
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
I'm the one who can't win.

384
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
I'm the one who can't win.

385
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
I'm the one who can't win.

386
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
I'm really

387
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,160
looking down on you.

388
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,160
You taught me

389
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,160
how to use the Sixth Layer.

390
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,160
You are really my good disciple.

391
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
If that's the case,

392
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
what else do you want to say?

393
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
I won't say it.

394
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,160
The one who is the real talent is Yu Zitong.

395
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
After you go out,

396
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
don't believe anything I say.

397
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Kill him quickly.

398
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
The most powerful person is afraid of poison.

399
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,160
Just use the money to deal with the old man.

400
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
That's enough.

401
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
And

402
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
I'm afraid that

403
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
you will be able to win.

404
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
I'm afraid that

405
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
you will be able to win.

406
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
And

407
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
even if you are afraid of the past,

408
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Goodbye.

409
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Master.

410
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Master.

411
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Master.

412
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Master.

413
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Master.

414
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
Master.

415
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
What about you?

416
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
My name is Yu Zitong.

417
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm from the cultivating family.

418
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Cultivating

419
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
is a background.

420
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
I understand.

421
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
If you

422
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
can help me find another body

423
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
to take the snake and re-cultivate,

424
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
I will

425
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
push you into my family.

426
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Don't believe anything I say.

427
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Kill him quickly.

428
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
The most powerful person is afraid of poison.

429
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
Just use the money to deal with the old man.

430
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
That's enough.

431
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
In the cultivating family,

432
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
we have to fight back.

433
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
We must be defeated.

434
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Master.

435
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
The same words

436
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
you said to Doctor Mo.

437
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
How can that bastard

438
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
compete with our body?

439
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
That's right.

440
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
But he asked me to bring you something.

441
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
I gave you a voice.

442
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Exclamation.

443
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
You thinkitated this time.

444
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Maybe I shouldn't have

445
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
following you

446
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
by weakness

447
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
and regret over this.

448
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
I follow you

449
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
because

450
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
especially

451
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
my parents

452
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
chose not

453
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,880
Hold it.

454
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,740
So scary

455
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,480
Get out

456
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
What do you want?

457
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,120
Let me out.

458
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,040
Let me out now.

459
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,720
I don't care what happened between you and Doctor Mo.

460
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,480
I just want to live.

461
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,760
I don't harm others.

462
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,240
Others don't want to harm me.

463
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,160
Let me go.

464
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,460
With Love of Always By Your Side

465
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,600
Without Doctor Mo's licence,

466
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,800
this man can't move at all.

467
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:08,380
as the

468
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:08,740
INTERPOSING

469
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,860
50

470
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,060
know

471
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,980
this place

472
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,900
s

473
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,160
people

474
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,020
know

475
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,740
us

476
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,020
Wait a minute.

477
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,260
Old man,

478
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,340
don't even show mercy to me till death,

479
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,560
I must be at your call

480
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,920
I'm sorry

481
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,140
I'd quite taken offense

482
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,620
I didn't put these on

483
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,540
Please come and take a look

484
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,940
You wouldn't ne'er bring me any trouble

485
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,720
My 10 taels of money

486
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,360
You wouldn't mess with me

487
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,660
I told you

488
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,440
There are 1000 taels each

489
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,620
Clear up the room

490
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,980
Woman the Shili

491
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,120
Lady the hooligan

492
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,880
Lady the hooligan

493
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,280
I've left you some blood and medicine.

494
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,880
It's enough to suppress your wish.

495
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
But if you want to follow the rules,

496
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,880
you'll have to use my family's warm-up protection.

497
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Han Lin,

498
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
you've never explained to anyone

499
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,880
when you were in the dark.

500
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
The king of the city has a free heaven.

501
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,880
However, my wife and daughter have nothing to do with this.

502
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,880
I believe you can make your own judgment.

503
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Didn't you always ask me where Zhang Tie went?

504
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,880
It's a pity that Zhang Tie is no longer with us.

505
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,880
I didn't want to kill him,

506
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,880
but he knew my secret.

507
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,880
I had to use his body to make a move

508
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
to get rid of him.

509
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
His name is Tian Nu.

510
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:39,640
The Human

511
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,760
I can't forget you

512
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,280
I don't regret it

513
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,440
You always say the past is like a dream

514
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,600
Erlongzi, it's time to go

515
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,320
What?

516
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,480
I have a pen

517
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,120
My dad borrowed three bowls of noodles from your uncle

518
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,840
for me

519
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,680
Erlongzi

520
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,280
You should wear a girl's dress

521
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,200
It's beautiful

522
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,360
You two can wear it in different ways

523
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:31,160
The affection of these two

524
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,120
is what drives people to do something

525
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,960
The desire for love is very strong

526
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,760
Time is shallow

527
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,960
Love is쎈

528
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,400
I will tell you to happanEstienne in the future

529
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,400
is tomorrow

530
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,400
The blue sea and the blue sky are not the same as before

531
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Time will also erase all the wishes in the world

532
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Only this year

533
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,400
has passed thousands of years

534
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:23,400
In the moment that is never-ending

535
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
There are many secrets in Mo Dafa

536
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
The world is in danger outside

537
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,400
I have to learn more magic before leaving the valley

538
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Changchun Palace

539
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,400
So this is the name of the mouth

540
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Why is there only half of it?

541
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,400
The air is empty, the air is empty

542
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,400
The sky eye is a kind of magic that can observe the power of the human body

543
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
At that time, Yu Zitong

544
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
used this trick

545
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,400
to see that I was the sixth level

546
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,400
But the most difficult thing to do

547
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
was the fireball trick

548
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,400
If this trick can be mastered

549
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,400
the power is the most amazing

550
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Come

551
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Come

552
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,400
The eight-fifth level of the mountain

553
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,400
The Wild Wolf Gang actually reached the Qi Xuan Gate

554
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Jiuwen, let's run

555
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Come

556
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Come

557
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Come

558
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Come

559
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,400
Come

560
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Come

561
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Come

562
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Come

563
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
Come

564
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
Come

565
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Come

566
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Come

567
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
I have been with you for so many years

568
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
I will get it back with all my strength

569
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
Come

570
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
Kill

571
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Kill

572
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Kill

573
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,400
Chief Wang

574
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
You want to kill yourself?

575
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Chief Ya

576
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,400
The Qi Xuan Gate's power can't be destroyed by me

577
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,400
Once the mechanism is broken, the mountain will collapse

578
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,400
If you don't want to kill yourself

579
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,400
why don't you listen to me?

580
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Chief Wang

581
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
What are your plans?

582
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
Stop the mechanism and talk

583
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,920
Chief

584
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
Jiuwen, come on

585
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
I am here

586
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
Come

587
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,040
uate !

588
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,200
Han Li

589
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,740
my good buddy

590
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,720
generations ahead come

591
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,340
They have entered the palace

592
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,760
Go to guard the Alberto Gate

593
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,360
Intelligence

594
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:37,980
Конечно Leader Wang Jue andouvert

595
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,920
und Glabaster

596
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,680
Li Zhailing of Qi Xuan Sect.

597
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,880
Liu Chong of Qi Xuan Sect.

598
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,200
Give me one.

599
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,120
Li Feiyu of the Outskirts is here.

600
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,200
Who wants to fight with me?

601
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,600
I really don't want Tang Zhi to die.

602
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,360
But I can't watch him die in the war.

603
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,080
I'll sign the blood contract.

604
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,360
I'll pay the price.

605
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,520
You're a doctor.

606
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,080
What price?

607
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,640
No.

608
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,920
You guys, back off.

609
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:13,760
I'll do it.

610
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,880
Master Lu is here.

611
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,680
They'll win.

612
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,480
Master Lu is here.

613
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,280
Master Lu is here.

614
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,120
Jia Tinglong,

615
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,440
are you playing tricks on me?

616
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,140
It's so good to eat it,

617
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,540
but it's better to eat it.

618
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,940
The main cigar is useless.

619
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,660
Pick them up with great care.

620
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,600
The Cultivator.

621
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,440
Cultivation is not better than me yet?

622
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,800
We have a master.

623
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,980
I did not expect that.

624
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,560
Uncle Long!

625
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,520
Bravo!

626
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:31,400
aspirant!

627
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,280
How dare you!

628
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,800
Lao Yi, you're looking for death.

629
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,800
You're not worthy of your own power.

630
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,800
You all have to die today.

631
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,800
I'll kill you.

632
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,800
Why don't you listen to me?

633
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Little immortal.

634
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,800
Leave it to me.

635
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,800
Senior.

636
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,800
It's a good thing.

637
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,800
I'll take it.

638
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,800
You, you.

639
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,800
Whose son are you?

640
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,800
Whose son are you?

641
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
I'm the son of Ye family of Qin.

642
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
I came here to go to the mountain valley.

643
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
I have no intention to be enemies with you.

644
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,800
Since you're here,

645
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,800
I'll take it.

646
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,800
What nonsense.

647
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,800
Ye family of Qin.

648
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,800
You're all wrong.

649
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,800
Why did you do it?

650
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,800
I, I, I.

651
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,800
I just received the gift of this person.

652
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,800
I broke the law and took action.

653
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,800
I didn't offend you.

654
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,800
Break the law?

655
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,800
We, the cultivators,

656
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,800
should not interfere in the affairs of the secular world.

657
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,800
But, but I have no choice.

658
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,800
Since you know your mistake,

659
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,800
this flying sword talisman

660
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,800
is returned to you.

661
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,800
Then it's good to be successful.

662
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,800
Don't mess with these mortals.

663
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,800
In case of getting hurt.

664
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,800
Good.

665
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,800
Good.

666
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,800
Good.

667
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,800
Good.

668
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Good.

669
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
Good.

670
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,800
Good.

671
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
What treasure is this?

672
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
It can't even burn the bomb tree.

673
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,800
Chief Jia.

674
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,800
Where are you going?

675
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,800
This immortal.

676
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,800
I have something to say.

677
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,800
I have no grudge against the immortal.

678
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,800
If you can let me go,

679
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,800
I'm willing to give you a thousand gold coins.

680
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,800
You kill people like a ring.

681
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,800
Have you ever thought of today?

682
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,800
Other people are fine.

683
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,800
Only you.

684
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,800
I will never let you go.

685
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,800
I will let you go.

686
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,800
Are you confident?

687
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,800
Or should I help you?

688
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,800
Brothers of the Wolf Gang.

689
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,800
Kill.

690
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,800
Kill.

691
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Kill.

692
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,800
Hang Shuo is a dead man.

693
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,800
Don't move.

694
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,800
Kill.

695
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,800
Immortal entered the Qixuan Sect and saved the king.

696
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,800
I am very grateful.

697
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,800
I don't know what you want to pay me back.

698
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,800
The vice chief of Qixuan Sect has a post.

699
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,800
A thousand gold coins.

700
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,800
The elders of the sect are all at your command.

701
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,800
But you have to wait for me for a hundred years.

702
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,800
The Qixuan Sect can only be yours.

703
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,800
How about it?

704
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,800
The sect leader still ambushed the people behind.

705
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,800
Take it away.

706
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,800
These disciples may be ordered by Elder Zhang.

707
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,800
Immortal.

708
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,800
I have no ill intent.

709
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,800
As the sect leader,

710
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,800
many things are not urgent.

711
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,800
One day, you can open a sect

712
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
and understand.

713
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,800
Don't worry, sect leader.

714
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,800
I won't let the Qixuan Sect go.

715
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,800
I will not let them go.

716
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,800
I will not let them go.

717
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,800
Don't worry, Wang.

718
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
I won't keep the Qixuan Sect for long.

719
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,800
I will leave here today.

720
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,800
I will never regret leaving here.

721
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,800
But before leaving,

722
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,800
we both have to make a deal

723
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,800
that is good for each other.

724
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,800
Of course, it's no problem.

725
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,800
The sect leader hasn't listened to my conditions.

726
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,800
Please speak first.

727
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,800
I will take the position of the official disciple.

728
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,800
And

729
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,800
let him be the sect leader of the external committee.

730
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,800
Okay.

731
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,800
What else?

732
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,800
He likes the third daughter of Elder Zhang, Zhang Xiu'er.

733
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,800
Elder Zhang thinks he is from a poor family.

734
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,800
I will go and talk to him.

735
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,800
I don't know what else.

736
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
Is there anything else?

737
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,800
I have a third uncle.

738
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,800
He is a disciple of the outside world.

739
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,800
He is a disciple of the outside world.

740
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,800
I am the one who brought him to the Qixuan Sect.

741
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,800
If he has any problem later,

742
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,800
I hope you can tell me.

743
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,800
It's easy to say.

744
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,800
It's easy to say.

745
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,800
I will not let you do it for nothing.

746
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,800
This is the rare medicine for curing the spirit.

747
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,800
Keep it.

748
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,800
But at the critical moment,

749
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,800
you will be the only one.

750
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,800
I will accept what you have said.

751
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,800
I will take leave now.

752
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,800
I have been used to being alone since I was a child.

753
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,800
I didn't expect to be able to make such a close friend like Brother Han.

754
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,800
I dare not say anything else.

755
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
I have never been afraid of anyone when fighting.

756
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,800
Since I have recognized you as my brother,

757
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,800
if anyone dares to bully Brother Han,

758
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,800
you should call my name.

759
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,800
Li Feiyu.

760
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,800
Sooner or later, you will have a son.

761
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,800
I will be your brother.

762
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,800
I will be your brother.

763
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,800
I will be your brother.

764
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,800
Li Feiyu.

765
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,800
One day, my name will be on the southern continent.

766
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,800
Li Feiyu.

767
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,800
Li Feiyu.

768
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
The late Han Xian.

769
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,800
I have been through the ups and downs,

770
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,800
but I have been forgotten for a lifetime.

771
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,800
I am like the color of the sky and the earth.

772
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,800
The starlight has been stewed into the galaxy.

773
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,800
I have no right to understand the whirlpool.

774
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,800
The light of fate is the brightest.

775
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,800
Is this really going to leave?

776
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,800
It's still strong.

777
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,800
A fish is going to be caught.

778
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,800
What a big fish!

779
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,800
Come on, come on, come on.

780
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,800
Come on.

781
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,800
It's been six years.

782
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,800
The world is gone.

783
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,800
Remember what I said.

784
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,800
Life is the most important thing.

785
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,800
If you are not a enemy,

786
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,800
run quickly.

787
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,800
Remember?

788
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,800
Don't forget that your roots are mortal.

789
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,800
Even if you become a god,

790
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,800
you have to be a human.

791
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,800
I don't want to hurt those high-ranking immortals.

792
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,800
I just want to laugh.

793
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,800
You can go to sleep.

794
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,800
But I still want to laugh.

795
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,800
Why do we only allow immortals to travel the world?

796
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,800
We white people can only be the king of the gold.

797
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,800
Hai Li, there are many beautiful scenery in the world.

798
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,800
You can go and see for me.

799
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,800
The starlight has been stewed into the galaxy.

800
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,800
There is no need to understand the world.

801
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:20,800
Goodbye, Doctor Mo, Zhang Di, and Shen Shou Gu.

802
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,800
The life is full of ups and downs.

803
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,800
Life is hard to get.

804
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,800
Who can solve the problem?

805
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,800
This heart has never been satisfied.

806
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,800
Standing still,

807
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,800
I am so confused.

808
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,800
The so-called love is not enough.

809
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,800
How much money should I have?

810
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,800
I am leaving.

811
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,800
The pills I left for you are enough to eat ten years.

812
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,800
Even if there is no end to it,

813
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,800
you will become a hero.

814
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,800
Don't worry about me.

815
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,800
Take care of yourself.

816
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,800
I believe one day,

817
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,800
your name will be on the way to the southern continent.

818
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,800
Hai Li!

819
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,800
Hai Li, remember this.

820
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,800
Before Li Fei Yu's name is on the way to the southern continent,

821
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,800
I won't die.

822
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,800
You don't have to die.

823
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,800
I can't forget you.

824
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,800
It's better to miss you.

825
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:18,800
It's said that the past is like a night.

826
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:24,800
Looking back, it's absurd.

827
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,800
The lonely books on the red city wall

828
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,800
have been ruined for six years.

829
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:37,800
The past is like a night.

830
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:43,800
The wind rises and blows.

831
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:50,800
It's like a wildfire.

832
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,800
Looking back, it's absurd.

833
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,800
The lonely books on the red city wall

834
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,800
have been ruined for six years.

835
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,800
The wind rises and blows.

836
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,800
It's like a wildfire.

837
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,800
The wind rises and blows.

838
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,800
It's like a wildfire.

839
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,800
The wind rises and blows.

840
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,800
It's like a wildfire.

841
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,800
The wind rises and blows.

842
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:27,800
It's like a wildfire.

843
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:33,800
The wind rises and blows.

844
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,800
It's like a wildfire.

845
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,800
The wind rises and blows.

846
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,800
It's like a wildfire.

847
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,800
The wind rises and blows.

848
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:57,800
It's like a wildfire.
