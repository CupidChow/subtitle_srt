Episode 16

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm willing to give both hands.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He's good at fighting.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He's always in the middle of the world.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He's good at fighting.

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He's good at fighting.

I didn't expect you to be so sensible.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're not a good writer.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Your skill of controlling fire is small,

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
but it's not interesting.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I can give you some bow and arrow.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You should think about what you want.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
OK.

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Please have a drink.

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you're satisfied,

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll be bold.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I want some tranquilizer.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Please help me.

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have two bottles of yellow dragon pill.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You know the purpose.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Take it.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are you really not on the same side with them?

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Which two?

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
In that case,

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I have one more favor to ask.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you can finish my spiritual beast mountain,

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I won't treat you badly.

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're the senior of the spiritual beast mountain.

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Senior, if you have any questions,

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm willing to answer.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I'm afraid I can't help you.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm afraid I'll be a burden to you.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's not a big deal.

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Your high-ranking prince

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and the royal guard of the Wang's Mansion,

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I suspect they have something to do with the evil.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Can you monitor me?

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Are you willing?

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This is a good defense weapon.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Take it.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You'll get a reward after you finish it.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll do whatever you say.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What's the point of saying this?

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We can catch more people in the future.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Catch?

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You think it's a mouse?

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He asked three people to kill five people today.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The old man has already thrown half of the three bears.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If it goes on like this,

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Second Brother,

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
you can bring us together.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Right?

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Fourth Brother.

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You're a traitor!

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What's wrong with you?

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't listen to Fourth Brother.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We're not familiar with the three bears.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I want to write a letter

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
to the god of the Qingxu Sect.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If they're willing to help,

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
then this might be...

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Seven Sects?

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Big Brother,

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
don't say that the Seven Sects are fighting against the Mo Island.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Even if it's in a peaceful city,

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
he can't kill five people in three days.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I must save the three bears.

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll do it myself if you don't.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You bastard!

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Second Brother!

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Big Brother,

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I've already sent my three bears to kill them.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll go and find them.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll go and find them.

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Third Brother.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You must save the three bears.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But not now!

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I can't let you save them yourself!

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Big Brother,

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
from what I see,

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the Seven Sects are fighting against the Mo Island.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's better to join the Black Cloak Sect.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's more difficult.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He's a mortal.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes, he is.

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What's wrong?

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm not old,

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
but I'm not a three-year-old child.

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If you want to fool around,

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you shouldn't have found a mortal to fool me.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Although you're a cultivator,

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
you're only practicing the five-level cultivation.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Whether in front of me,

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
or in front of those bad people,

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
you're just like a mortal.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why look down on them?

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Of course,

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
your family business has nothing to do with me.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
If you want to leave, I won't stop you.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This Miss Mo is my old friend.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
She has some connections with the head of the Wang family.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
She's been exploring the land for a long time.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't look down on her.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
She's amazing.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Your silver incense is so good.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I brought my sister to buy it.

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you.

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll give you two more discounts next time.

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Ji Xue Fu Xiang.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Ji Xue Fu Xiang.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Brother Han.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Miss Mo, your clinic is really white.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
How come the rouge powder is better than the medicine?

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Brother Han, don't make fun of me.

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's because you taught me how to make silver incense pills.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The ladies in Beijing are most interested in this.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They always beg me to make more for them.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm not that kind of person.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm just a little girl.

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm just a little girl.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm just a little girl.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm just a little girl.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm just a little girl.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm just a little girl.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
How come you didn't ask me for a discount?

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You just asked me for a discount.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm just a little girl.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm just a little girl.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm just a little girl.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm just a little girl.

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm just a little girl.

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm just a little girl.

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's not like an pharmacy to visit the patients from one clinic to another.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But I can also get some information to know.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Brother Han

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Miss Mu, don't get close to the tube room.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Get rid of any traces of the previous investigation.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Brother Han, don't worry.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Cai Huan knows what's important.

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This time, I'm just going to explore the missing and repaired objects.

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I won't think about the person who committed the suicide again.

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I won't think about the person who committed the suicide again.

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Recently, many of the houses in the new mansion have been filled with many items.

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They are all managed by the housekeeper.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Although they are very secretive,

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
they are divided into many parts every time.

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But I have many acquaintances in the mansion.

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I've checked them all.

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I suspect that the repaired objects were probably hidden in these places.

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Brother Han, wait for me.

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Brother Han, look.

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This is the east of the city.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The shops are too busy.

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's a very objective place.

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Cheng Xi is near the palace.

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There are soldiers there.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
They are not very active.

164
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes.

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Zhao, I think we should all go and have a look.

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Aren't you pretty good?

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Come on, tell me about it.

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Before, all the missing people in the Li family were near the site of Nan Cheng.

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And Sister Zhao was also.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
They were all lost in the way back to the city.

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They were all in Nan Nan.

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So I think we should check all these places.

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You know so much.

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You are really good.

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Someone is right.

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You are really good.

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Miss Cui Ru, let's go inside and talk.

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let's go.

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
They are quite close.

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm not worried about that.

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It was my dream to open such a clinic.

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's a very easy life for a mortal.

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Brother Han, this is the rouge you wanted.

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Thank you.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
How much money do you need?

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll ask Qin Gui to send it to you.

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What money do you mean?

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
How much money?

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But this is something from my daughter's family.

190
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Are you going to give it to Miss Xuan Er who you met last time?

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Miss Mo, you misunderstood.

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I bought this for a fellow senior sister.

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
She likes these.

194
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This Senior Sister Zhong is so cruel to me.

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I will never buy things for them again.

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Brother Han, you are really good at this.

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm really happy to see you.

198
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Brother Han, you have a lot of senior sisters.

199
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Let's go inside.

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Come and look.

201
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This grass is so pretty.

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This child is good at it.

203
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's good for health.

204
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If you don't care, I'm always worried that something bad will happen to him.

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I will investigate this time.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Cui Er, I will leave it to you to take care of it.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Okay.

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Brother Han,

209
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I understand your feelings.

210
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You said you wanted me to take care of it.

211
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You actually want it to protect me, right?

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Don't worry.

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I will take good care of myself.

214
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Of course, I will take good care of Cui Er.

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Let her not get you into trouble.

216
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This talisman, you take it first.

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Take it with you.

218
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
When you are in danger, it will automatically trigger and protect you.

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I hope that you will never need it.

220
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm leaving.

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Brother Han.

222
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Can I see you again?

223
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
He's gone.

224
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's great.

225
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The 7th month of the 7th month,

226
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
the sword and sword are cut off.

227
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
A hundred people are killed in the side of the mountain.

228
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They are attacked by the Yelang Mountain.

229
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
They are half dead.

230
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
After a few years of fighting,

231
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
there's no good news.

232
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Wan Er.

233
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Senior Sister.

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Didn't you go to the Heavenly Capital to seek help?

235
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Why did you come back?

236
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Did something big happen before?

237
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm going to the Heavenly Capital.

238
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Why did you come back?

239
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Did something big happen before?

240
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's good news.

241
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
There's a report from the front line.

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The spirit beast and the Tianxue Castle have fought a great battle.

243
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Elder Han led a team to surround the Yuling Sect

244
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and a hundred people's troops.

245
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
They also killed two of the evil sect's sect leaders.

246
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But...

247
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Didn't our people find out

248
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
that Elder Han and the evil sect are close friends?

249
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But...

250
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Didn't our people find out

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that Elder Han and the evil sect are close friends

252
00:15:47,000 --> 00:16:12,140
and even have a letter of

253
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's good to be cautious.

254
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But this battle is definitely not fake.

255
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Many disciples witnessed it.

256
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And the Jiedan Xiu Sect

257
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
fell in this battle.

258
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Even if the evil sect and the spirit beast mountain

259
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
really have a collusion,

260
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
they won't use the Jiedan Xiu Sect's life

261
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
to play a trick.

262
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's really a long story.

263
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's really a long story.

264
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I've been talking to these evil sects for so long.

265
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I finally have some good news.

266
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's good.

267
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
When this battle is over,

268
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I must ask Elder Han

269
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
for advice.

270
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'll tell him.

271
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll tell him.

272
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll tell him.

273
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll tell him.

274
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll tell him.

275
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll tell him.

276
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'll tell him.

277
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Please ask Elder Han for advice.

278
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
These days,

279
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I've been feeling down.

280
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,080
You are in charge of

281
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,000
the battle.

282
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's all my fault.

283
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I've dragged Jinggu Garden down.

284
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Senior.

285
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Is there still no news of Xun'er?

286
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That monster is missing.

287
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,640
The Qingxu Sect and Ling Shoushan will meet us one day.

288
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,200
When the main force is gathered,

289
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,520
I'll send more people to expand the search.

290
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,280
We'll find them.

291
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,200
Wang Chan of Guiling Sect

292
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,600
asks to see the Yunu Patriarch.

293
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,160
Please inform him.

294
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,080
The Wang family is here.

295
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,800
Why are you here to ask for medicine?

296
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,040
You're still young.

297
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,520
You're not fit to be here.

298
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,160
You're here to ask for medicine for your father.

299
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,200
You must be joking.

300
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,800
I'm the one who's curious about the medicine.

301
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,040
I thought I was a bit distant from the Patriarch.

302
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,760
So I came to visit you.

303
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,720
You're curious about the medicine?

304
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,000
Show me.

305
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,680
Elder,

306
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,600
please have a look.

307
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,640
Here.

308
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,040
Wang Chan of Guiling Sect

309
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,640
asks to see the Yunu Patriarch.

310
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,960
💀

311
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,000
頭

312
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,120
HHH

313
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,720
Is your mother

314
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,880
all right?

315
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,720
My mother?

316
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,240
You're already a grown-up.

317
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,480
What's your name?

318
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,360
My name is Dong Xuan'er.

319
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,880
You're still so stubborn.

320
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,680
Master.

321
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,000
Master is a righteous man.

322
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,720
How could he fight against you?

323
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,880
Righteous?

324
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,280
Righteous?

325
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,120
Who taught you such a vulgar statement?

326
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,040
The so-called Seven Sects

327
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,520
is the branch of the six sects.

328
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,960
Hundreds of years ago,

329
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,760
when the righteous sects and the grassland people were in the criminal,

330
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,160
they split up and fought for their own interests.

331
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,640
It's a bit absurd.

332
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,200
They're just a group of people

333
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,520
who are just fishing for fame.

334
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,200
I've never heard of

335
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,840
what you said.

336
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,680
You're a great person.

337
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,480
Why would I lie to you?

338
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,360
The Moon Sect was born from the Lotus Sect.

339
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,600
The Sacred Beasts Mountain is also from the Jade Spirit Sect.

340
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,560
Now, Yanjia Bao is back to the Ghost Realm.

341
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,240
The Seven Sects

342
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,920
are about to break up.

343
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,320
Really?

344
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,440
It seems that

345
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
it's time for you to

346
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,840
take the class again as a father.

347
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,320
Father?

348
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,920
The son of the tiger

349
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,160
can't fight against Niuyang

350
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,040
however.

351
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,780
There is no

352
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,440
question about

353
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,240
being Xun,

354
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
you'll be a disciple of me from now on.

355
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,360
From today onwards,

356
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:50,640
I forbid you to

357
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,960
at the fate of Heaven.

358
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,440
I told you long ago,

359
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,520
you should thank me for

360
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,980
seeing Ren Qing's future.

361
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,200
I've never heard so many stories about her.

362
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,680
Congratulations, Mum!

363
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,700
Today, carnal daughter of Xuan has finally reunited with you.

364
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,480
I will remember your generous behavior of that late gl petition.

365
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,480
But why did you meet with Xuan'er?

366
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
You brought her here.

367
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Didn't her mother stop you?

368
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Mother?

369
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
Is she from the Hong family?

370
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Is she my mother?

371
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Master.

372
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,480
I first met Xuan'er in Yanjia Bao.

373
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,480
I knew she was a descendant of the family.

374
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
This is the Yellow Wind Valley.

375
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
You are so ungrateful.

376
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,480
You arranged for your disciples to be together.

377
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,480
You are just trying to make a mess.

378
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,480
You saw how worried she was.

379
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
You should be careful.

380
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Don't let the despicable people

381
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,480
make a mess.

382
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Don't talk nonsense.

383
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
And this?

384
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
What is her name?

385
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Just a name.

386
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
It's not worth mentioning.

387
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Li Feiyu.

388
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Of course.

389
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,480
If it wasn't for the ancestors asking,

390
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
this name doesn't deserve to be near the ancestors.

391
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
You don't deserve it.

392
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,480
I deserve it.

393
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,480
This ancient tree is not a common tree.

394
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:44,520
It's a pity that we can only see the

395
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
tree.

396
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,480
Why hasn't there been any movement

397
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,480
for so many days?

398
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,480
Why can't I sense Wu Sanxing's breath?

399
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Could it be that she was killed?

400
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Go.

401
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
Go.

402
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Go.

403
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
Go.

404
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,480
It's a pity that they killed Wu Sanxing.

405
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
But why are the people who buried her

406
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
so familiar?

407
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
Brother, did they all leave?

408
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
It's them.

409
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
This kind of death is really a tragic event.

410
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,480
Everyone, where do you want to go?

411
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
Do you want me to send you off?

412
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
No.

413
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Who are you?

414
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Who are you?

415
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
What are you doing?

416
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
You are a coward.

417
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
What kind of hero are you?

418
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
You are a coward.

419
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
You are a coward.

420
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
You are a coward.

421
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
I am a drunkard.

422
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
I don't need to be a smart man.

423
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Smart man.

424
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Smart man.

425
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Smart man.

426
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Smart man.

427
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
What do you want?

428
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Give me a smart man.

429
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
I want to be a smart man.

430
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
Are there not five people?

431
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
Where is the other one?

432
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,480
How do we know?

433
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Is the third sister alive?

434
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
She is alive.

435
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,480
Where is the other one?

436
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
The third sister.

437
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
The third sister was hit.

438
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
We were also hit.

439
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,480
Brother.

440
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,480
I won't be able to break the seal of the wall.

441
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,480
Brother, there.

442
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,480
Tell the truth about everything you know.

443
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,280
You know everything.

444
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,080
Wu Zhao.

445
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,760
Stay here.

446
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,560
Senior.

447
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,080
Senior.

448
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,280
Senior.

449
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,480
We are poor people.

450
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,240
Poor people?

451
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,600
We are not blinded by blood.

452
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,240
We...

453
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,200
Who is blinded?

454
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,080
Black... Black Silly.

455
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,280
Why?

456
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,160
Black Silly wants to control us.

457
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,680
Let us hold him.

458
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,880
He is around the Imperial Valley.

459
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,520
He is kidnapping and abetting.

460
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,360
Where are the scattered oil?

461
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,280
Spattered oil?

462
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
No...

463
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,080
Can't you see it?

464
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,680
So,

465
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,040
each of you

466
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,000
has killed many people.

467
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,520
No...

468
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,120
People?

469
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,840
Yes.

470
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
I didn't kill those scattered oil.

471
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,360
We saved them.

472
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,920
Who killed you?

473
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,720
No...

474
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,920
We didn't kill them.

475
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,080
It's the Japanese government.

476
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,160
They told us to kill them.

477
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,000
What about the other scattered oil?

478
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,840
Let me tell you.

479
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,800
Those scattered oil

480
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,400
were not torn.

481
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,240
Black Silly hid them.

482
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,360
Where?

483
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,120
Hid...

484
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,760
Hid...

485
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,840
Hid...

486
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
Still can't find it?

487
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,120
Senior.

488
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
I know.

489
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,120
I know.

490
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,320
Senior.

491
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,040
You are the master of other sects.

492
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,760
Other sects?

493
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,000
Senior.

494
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,560
I have a friendship with Liu Shan Wang.

495
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,000
We have a friendship.

496
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
He is our second uncle.

497
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,400
Uncle.

498
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,240
Uncle and second uncle.

499
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,760
Yes.

500
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,080
Senior.

501
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Please help us

502
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,880
to solve the problem.

503
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,760
We will help you

504
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,120
to kill the black people.

505
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,000
I will never give up.

506
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,120
We, Meng Shan Wu You,

507
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,560
will never give up.

508
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,520
Meng Shan Wu You

509
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,720
What the hell is Meng Shan Wu You?

510
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,800
He is not qualified to be a teacher.

511
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
He is not qualified to be a teacher.

512
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,520
But some

513
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,080
who are not qualified to be a teacher

514
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,160
have already put the curse on them.

515
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,840
You are so wise.

516
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,760
Now those useless people

517
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,320
are not guilty anymore.

518
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,360
There is someone behind this Wulao Dao.

519
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,880
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

520
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,160
Master, right now

521
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,000
we need to help the blood of the cultivating wife.

522
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,440
This person

523
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,400
might be the one who is in the snow.

524
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,480
If there is someone who asks the East and West

525
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,600
like Wulao Dao,

526
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,880
it must be related to this person.

527
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
We can find him out

528
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,600
and give him to the master.

529
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,760
Your Majesty.

530
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,600
We have found the curse.

531
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,620
Watch out for this quickly

532
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:38,620
and get the black men quickly.

533
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,160
iquest.

534
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,040
ähr quickly.

535
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,360
Your Majesty.

536
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,240
Let's go.

537
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,440
Your Majesty.

538
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,120
suitable

539
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,600
고,

540
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Little Sage removed the ban on us

541
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
and saved our three sisters.

542
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,400
I am so grateful.

543
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Okay, you may all rise.

544
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,000
Get up.

545
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,000
Since the five of you have been forced to be siblings,

546
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,200
I won't report this matter to the sect.

547
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,400
But, you indeed should make up for your mistakes.

548
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Little Sage, if you have any problems, just tell me.

549
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,200
How many strongholds are there in the city?

550
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,800
I will give you a day to investigate.

551
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,600
Yes, Your Majesty!

552
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,600
Miss Mo.

553
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,600
It's closed today. You all go home first.

554
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Okay, Miss Mo.

555
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,000
This is the record of the transport of the goods.

556
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,400
It's all food, weapons, and so on.

557
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
It's enough for a few hundred people to use.

558
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,800
It seems that these books are their strongholds.

559
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Hurry!

560
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Hurry!

561
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,800
Thank you for saving us.

562
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,400
This way.

563
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Hurry.

564
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Cui.

565
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Grandpa!

566
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Cui.

567
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,600
Grandpa!

568
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,800
Cui.

569
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,200
That man will be my wife.

570
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,000
You have recognized her too?

571
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,800
I recognized her at the first glance.

572
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,000
What? You are like a secret agent.

573
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,400
It's too hard to be filial.

574
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,600
It's using two books to accompany people.

575
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,000
I will change one book of martial arts.

576
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,000
Be careful. Goodbye.

577
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,400
I remember now.

578
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,600
It's her.

579
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
It's her.

580
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,800
It's her.

581
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,000
Yes. When she was in Tainan School,

582
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,400
Xiao Xian was just a practice chess player.

583
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
Yes.

584
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,200
He was a good student.

585
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,600
He is still good.

586
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,600
No matter if he was the previous Xiao Xian player,

587
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,200
he is now a chess player.

588
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
That's the old school.

589
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,000
I will go and say hello to him.

590
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,200
You...

591
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
You go down.

592
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,800
Since he didn't take the initiative,

593
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,000
he just didn't want to show his feet.

594
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,600
You don't understand the rules of the old school?

595
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,560
How did the old school around here oven-fire?

596
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,040
Does this mean Bhikshuannaburi mouse Nate Liu

597
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,640
has gone and fled to pitched their place

598
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,800
in RTU?

599
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,900
Yes.

600
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,900
Let's go.

601
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:48,940
constitution more

602
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:56,980
from time to time

603
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,260
they can not

604
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,460
position

605
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,160
are

606
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Yes, it's here.

607
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,160
It's just a basic attack.

608
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
It's not a big deal.

609
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
We can break it with force.

610
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
There must be a reason to visit the gate.

611
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Let me take a look.

612
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
Yes.

613
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Little Fairy,

614
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
is there a pulse here?

615
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
Yes.

616
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
Let's go.

617
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Everyone,

618
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
you can finally show up.

619
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
Master,

620
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,160
this is the thief who attacked our clan.

621
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
Catch him alive.

622
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Arrange the formation.

623
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
Yes.

624
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,160
No.

625
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
Attack.

626
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
The main attack is the final attack.

627
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
I'm going to show my power.

628
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
You can do whatever you want.

629
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
No.

630
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Xiao Wu.

631
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Xiao Wu.

632
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
Xiao Wu.

633
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
No.

634
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,160
Xiao Wu.

635
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
Xiao Wu.

636
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,160
Xiao Wu is a big snake.

637
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
Xiao Wu, Xiao Wu.

638
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
Charge.

639
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Fox.

640
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,160
No, no, no

641
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
I can't hold it

642
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Get out of my way

643
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,160
It's gone

644
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
Keep an eye on him

645
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,160
I, I, I

646
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,160
You, you, you

647
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
You, you, you

648
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
You, you, you

649
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
I, I, I

650
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
I'm fine

651
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,160
You

652
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
What a tough skin

653
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,160
It seems that it will not break for a while

654
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Wait

655
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,160
I am the son of the king of the west

656
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,160
The seven sects have all followed my rules

657
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,160
You can't do anything to the royal family

658
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,160
The rules of the seven sects are different from mine

659
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,160
You are not the seven sects

660
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,160
Why are you so muddled?

661
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,160
I am happy

662
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
You

663
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
Hold him tight

664
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,160
Don't let him live

665
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
Let's go

666
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,160
The immortal master is on

667
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
The immortal master is on

668
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,160
The immortal master

669
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,160
The murder of the mechanical god Hainin

670
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Is all done by the Black Sand Sect

671
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
It's all done by the Black Sand Sect

672
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,160
Maomao is also forced to live

673
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,160
I have a personal grudge with the immortal master

674
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,160
Today, he sent me a horse

675
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,160
I am willing to tell the immortal master

676
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,160
All the secrets of the Black Sand Sect

677
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
I heard that you are from Lanzhou

678
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,160
Do you know a person named Mo Juren?

679
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,160
I wonder what kind of grudge this person has with the immortal master

680
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,160
This person tried to harm me

681
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
I didn't follow

682
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
So to speak

683
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,160
I also treated the immortal master with a bad breath

684
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,160
I killed everyone

685
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
You have entered the immortal land

686
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,160
Why are you going to a mortal family?

687
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,160
You are a mortal

688
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,160
You will die

689
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,160
Who was the one who named me?

690
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,160
I wanted to ask you

691
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,160
The magic of the demon painting

692
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,160
I am here

693
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
Immortal master

694
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,160
If you are willing to let me go

695
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,160
I would like to use this magic

696
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,160
with both hands

697
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,160
Forget it

698
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,160
A guy like you

699
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
is better to die

700
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,160
I will die

701
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,160
I will die

702
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,160
I will die

703
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,160
I will die

704
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,160
I will die

705
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,160
I will die

706
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,160
I will die

707
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,160
I will die

708
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,160
I will die

709
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,160
I will die

710
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,160
I will die

711
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,160
I will die

712
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,160
I will die

713
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,160
I will die

714
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,160
I will die

715
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,160
I will die

716
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,160
I will die

717
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,160
I will die

718
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,160
I will die

719
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,160
I will die

720
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,160
I will die

721
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,160
I will die

722
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
I will die

723
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,160
I will die

724
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,160
I will die

725
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,160
I will die

726
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,160
I will die

727
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,160
I will die

728
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,160
I will die

729
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,160
I will die

730
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,160
I will die

731
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,160
I will die

732
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,160
I will die

733
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,160
I will die

734
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
I will die

735
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,160
I will die

736
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,160
I will die

I will die

I will die

745
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,160
I will die

746

00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,160
I will die

748
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,160
I will die
