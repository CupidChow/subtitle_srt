00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

2
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
You're badly injured.

3
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm here.

4
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,500
I won't let you die.

5
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,300
You...

6
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,500
Don't get so close.

7
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,000
You can't even breathe.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,700
My spiritual power.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
You're taking my spiritual power.

10
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,500
Wake up.

11
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,300
Wake up.

12
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,700
Wake up.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Wake up.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,500
Go.

15
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,200
Five-star Formation.

16
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,000
Hurry.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
It's going to be useful.

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hurry.

19
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Why are there still people?

20
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,700
Forget it.

21
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
The benefits I got that day,

22
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,600
I'll return them to you today.

23
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,700
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,700
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,700
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,700
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,700
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm sorry.

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,800
It's him.

30
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
Why is there no spiritual power?

31
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can't see anything.

32
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,500
Oh no.

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,200
I'm badly injured.

34
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,200
I used the Soul-gathering Needle.

35
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
If I'm touched,

36
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
I'll reflect on myself.

37
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
I'm so embarrassed.

38
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
I have to find a way.

39
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,400
I can't be found out by him.

40
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,600
How about...

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,800
I run away?

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,400
At least, because you saved me.

43
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,000
If it's spread out in the future,

44
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,700
forget it.

45
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
I'll kill him then.

46
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,400
This kid.

47
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,000
He really has a lot of things to save.

48
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The rumors at that time

49
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
turned out to be true.

50
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
I don't know

51
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
if it's his luck

52
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
or not.

53
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,500
What's wrong with him?

54
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,240
Sir,

55
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
what area is this?

56
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Is it in my dreams?

57
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,800
You kid

58
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,640
has a lot of means to protect yourself.

59
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,600
How could you

60
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
How did you get yourself like this?

61
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Master, I'm fine.

62
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
You're still being stubborn.

63
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Besides, how long have you been alive?

64
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
You're so old-fashioned.

65
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
Let me tell you.

66
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
When you can't find the right way,

67
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
you won't find the right way either.

68
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
What are you talking about?

69
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
I'm bolder than you.

70
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
You taught me well.

71
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
You're so little.

72
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Master.

73
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
I didn't expect

74
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
you're the one

75
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
who's the most angry with me.

76
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
You're the one who's the latest student.

77
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
You're so worried.

78
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
What happened?

79
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
What you said is more important

80
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
than my life.

81
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
What is it?

82
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
I was chased by the Xiu family.

83
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
In the end,

84
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
it's all for Qiu Changsheng.

85
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
It's all for you.

86
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
You're so bad.

87
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
I didn't mean it.

89
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
I just...

90
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
I just...

91
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
I just...

92
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
I just...

93
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
I just...

94
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
I just...

95
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,640
I just...

96
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
I just...

97
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
I just...

98
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,280
So, they say

99
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,460
Taoist of Zhao Wen can do it

100
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,640
That is my favorite

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,360
Journey to advise master

102
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,420
while taming your

103
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,260
feet should be revealed

104
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,640
That's why you don't change

105
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,040
Don't bother

106
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,460
What?

107
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,320
Taoist of Zhao Wen

108
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,620
actually

109
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,220
many people

110
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,900
It doesn't matter if you're asleep or awake,

111
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,420
but you must be careful not to be poisoned by light and shadow.

112
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,580
You must remember your roots and intentions.

113
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,220
Xiao Ban.

114
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,220
Don't you still have a lot of things to do?

115
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,220
Don't miss it again.

116
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,780
Go.

117
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,100
There are so many beautiful scenery in the world.

118
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,300
Just take me to have a good look.

119
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,900
invite

120
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,300
Heaven Go smoothly.

121
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
What's going on?

122
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,700
What's going on?

123
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
You're awake?

124
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,100
Senior Nangong, I saved you with kindness.

125
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,700
Why did you suck up my spiritual power?

126
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Who?

127
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,300
Who sucked up your spiritual power?

128
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,500
Who else is not your Nangong Wan?

129
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,500
I'm your Nangong Wan.

130
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,900
I'm your Nangong Wan.

131
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,500
I'm your Nangong Wan.

132
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,900
I'm your Nangong Wan.

133
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,500
I'm your Nangong Wan.

134
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,900
Who else is not your Nangong Wan?

135
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,700
Nangong Wan?

136
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,100
You think I'm Nangong Wan?

137
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,300
You think I'm Tang Jian?

138
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,300
I'm not Nangong Wan.

139
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,700
Then who are you?

140
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,500
I'm

141
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,700
Nangong

142
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
Ping.

143
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,900
Ah, Nangong Ping.

144
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
You're Huang Fenggu's little bastard, right?

145
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
My sister told me about you.

146
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,900
She told me?

147
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,300
Yes, she told me.

148
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,900
Your shameless behavior is a great honor.

149
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,900
The most humiliating thing is

150
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,100
you even gave her a engagement.

151
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,500
What?

152
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,100
You're going to scold me?

153
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
I heard that the first thought of this moment

154
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,300
is to catch you from Huang Fenggu

155
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,300
and feed the beast.

156
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,500
So, you're so kind and kind today.

157
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,900
Suck up my spiritual power.

158
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,700
You're a bad friend and a bad friend.

159
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,500
You're the one who took the karma.

160
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,700
Who else is to blame?

161
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,100
This time, I'm giving you a lesson.

162
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,900
In the future,

163
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,500
you can be a good thief

164
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,300
and save other people's beauty.

165
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,300
Why are all the people in this family like this?

166
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,100
It's hard to say.

167
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,700
But she's right.

168
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,900
We can't do anything rash in the future.

169
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,100
You're her cousin.

170
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,700
I'm a little bit of a bully.

171
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,500
You don't have to worry.

172
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,700
I'm just a little bit of a bully.

173
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,100
I'm just a little bit of a bully.

174
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,100
I'm just a little bit of a bully.

175
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,100
I'm just a little bit of a bully.

176
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,700
I don't know when I can recover.

177
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
But you're not a bad person.

178
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,100
You're quite clever.

179
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,900
Although yesterday,

180
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,700
I acted as if I were a cousin.

181
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,700
That's also helping me.

182
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,100
I'll pay back this favor in the future.

183
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,300
Thank you, Senior.

184
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,300
I'm a thief.

185
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,100
Why is he dizzy again?

186
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
Excuse me.

187
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,120
I won't baby talk with little winner

188
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,500
You saw miss the ghost

189
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,900
She…

190
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
Is there anything to eat?

191
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,900
Qin is so cold.

192
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,900
There's nothing.

193
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,900
These...

194
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
You brought them with you?

195
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Senior.

196
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,900
I've heard that

197
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,900
there's a very hardworking monk.

198
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
He's always eating.

199
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,900
He even brought a pot of rice noodles.

200
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,900
I didn't expect it to be him.

201
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
I finally don't have to worry about my life.

202
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
It's a pity that I lost my love in the past.

203
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
But

204
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
it's just right to

205
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
work with the effect of the Three-Changing Chong Yun Palace.

206
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,900
It's also a good thing.

207
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
It's a pity that

208
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,900
I have to repeat it twice.

209
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,900
Then I can get the answer.

210
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
The Little Asshole

211
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,900
What did you cook?

212
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
It smells so good.

213
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,900
This guy

214
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
really knows how to cook.

215
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
Here.

216
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
It's a little salty.

217
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
I'll cook it for you.

218
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
You can't just leave it like that.

219
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
You can't just leave it like that.

220
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
You can't just leave it like that.

221
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
You can't just leave it like that.

222
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Nothing will happen.

223
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,900
We will return without her loving.

224
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
Your Majesty,

225
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,900
you'll have to deal with your duty from this time.

226
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Who knows

227
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
if it takes too much effort to fill your mouth

228
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
by eating music too much.

229
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,880
It might get我跟你講 on the

230
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
side otherwise,

231
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
you can still eat it.

232
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
What does it mean to eat edible food?

233
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,900
Please eat it while it's hot.

234
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,500
What's this?

235
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,940
A pancake.

236
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,500
Is it good?

237
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,500
My favorite.

238
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,700
I want it too.

239
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,300
Only one?

240
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,100
To taste.

241
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,300
Please tend standing.

242
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,780
In our comeback department.

243
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,540
Everyone is approached for small calls.

244
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,800
But I didn't know that

245
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,860
in order to inspiring culture by all the power,

246
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,520
the truly tasty food is to cook slowly

247
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,440
by explain the 싶שר degrees.

248
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,540
I didn't expect that

249
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,240
you would cook.

250
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,480
It seems that you are not usually

251
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,040
shot with a small bow.

252
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,560
As long as you're satisfying.

253
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,680
Tell me why you showed up here

254
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
Why are you here?

255
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,120
What are you going to do?

256
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,080
Since it's not the South Palace,

257
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,960
I'll keep the thing about the transmission formation

258
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,920
a secret.

259
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,440
Now,

260
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,280
Huangfeng Valley is under the control of the evil.

261
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,880
We can't go back.

262
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,160
Before this,

263
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
I learned that there is a temporary mine

264
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,840
in this place.

265
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
It's also under the control of the evil.

266
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
But it's weak.

267
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,640
I wanted to get some materials

268
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,920
and go to other places.

269
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,800
I wanted to learn from the mountains and rivers.

270
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,080
But now,

271
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm afraid that I can't

272
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,320
make it.

273
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
It's good for me.

274
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,640
Fine.

275
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,440
Since he's loyal,

276
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,920
I'll give him a chance.

277
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,360
Although it's hard to get materials,

278
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,560
this place is under the control of the evil.

279
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,600
Don't take the risk.

280
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,800
How about this?

281
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,240
I'll give you two options.

282
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,040
First, I'll give you some snacks

283
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,600
and training resources

284
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,120
to make up for your cultivation

285
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,240
and help you with your cause and effect.

286
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,080
Second,

287
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,680
you can go back to the Night Clan with me.

288
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,280
Don't take the wrong course.

289
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,720
I mean

290
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:48,440
you can be priestess from the

291
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,440
I'll go back and say hello to my sister.

292
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
She won't make it hard for you.

293
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
The conditions are so difficult.

294
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Did she intentionally let me choose to leave with her?

295
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
But since she's leaving...

296
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
How is it? Have you thought it through?

297
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Have you thought it through?

298
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,440
I've thought it through. Thank you for your kindness.

299
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,440
I'm used to the free-range. I'll choose the snack.

300
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,440
As for the cultivation, I'll think of a way to recover it.

301
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
I won't trouble you anymore.

302
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,440
So many? I didn't expect this senior Nangong to have so many moves.

303
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,440
Okay. It's too late to change your mind now.

304
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Since you already have your own plans, I don't need to force you.

305
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,440
It's just that you shouldn't regret it in the future.

306
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
Today's decision.

307
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,440
If that's the case, I'll take my leave.

308
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,440
Wait. You're leaving now?

309
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Fine. Your power is very weak now.

310
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,440
I'm afraid you're not a match for the Demon's Cult.

311
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,440
Take me out to kill him first. Then you can leave.

312
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm leaving now.

313
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
I'm leaving now.

314
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
I'm leaving now.

315
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
This is a good place.

316
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
I was made by a friend.

317
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,440
Your friend is a girl who doesn't like killing.

318
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,440
Kid, I'm leaving.

319
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Even a miracle.

320
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,440
I don't want to leave now. I have to leave.

321
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
I'm leaving now.

322
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
Shao Duo, the fire in the hall has been put out for a while.

323
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
I think they've gone far away.

324
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Damn it.

325
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,440
I didn't expect Yin Yue Sect to recover so fast.

326
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
The time has come.

327
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,440
There's a suspicious person here.

328
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
You're too much.

329
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,440
And that man in black who was in trouble under my eyes.

330
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
I always feel like I've seen him somewhere.

331
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Let's check it out.

332
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
See what he's got.

333
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Shao Zhu, from his martial arts,

334
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,440
I can't see what he's got.

335
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Right? It's like he's got everything.

336
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
He's got everything.

337
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,440
Right? It's like he's got everything.

338
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
But why does Miss Xuan want to help them?

339
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,440
Is there something between them?

340
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,440
What's the relationship?

341
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,440
Yin Yue Sect, Huang Feng Valley.

342
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
Could it be...

343
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
Han Li?

344
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,440
I know.

345
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,440
It's him.

346
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,440
It's that damn Han Li.

347
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Shao Zhu, that...

348
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,440
That Han... Han Li.

349
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Didn't he run away?

350
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Why is he here?

351
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
I should have known.

352
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,440
He's not close to that bitch in Yanjia Bao.

353
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,440
I didn't expect people from Yin Yue Sect to come.

354
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
It's been so long.

355
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
Why is he still here?

356
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Yin Zhao is the one he's been hiding.

357
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,440
Shao Zhu is smart.

358
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
Shao Zhu, think about it.

359
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
He must have come alone.

360
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
He's just pretending.

361
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Congratulations, Shao Zhu.

362
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,440
No, he finally got what he wanted.

363
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,440
It was just a dream.

364
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,440
I let him get away under my eyes.

365
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
You still want to laugh?

366
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,440
No.

367
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Keep going.

368
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,440
Five hundred miles.

369
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,440
Even if it takes three hours,

370
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,440
I want him to die right in front of me!

371
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:59,060
She's one of my crispy

372
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,440
They must not expect me to return to the place where it happened.

373
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,440
But now is the time to practice Qi Qi.

374
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,440
We still need to quickly repair the formation.

375
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,440
In case of any changes in the future.

376
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Fight quickly.

377
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,440
I will not let you die.

378
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,440
I will not let you die.

379
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,440
Fight quickly. Let's start.

380
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Fight quickly.

381
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
Fight quickly.

382
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
Fight quickly.

383
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,440
Why is there no reaction?

384
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Could it be that the charge is not enough?

385
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
The energy has been absorbed.

386
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,440
Looks like you are also a coward.

387
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
Forget it. Let's first use a skill.

388
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Let's go.

389
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,440
Uncle, we have searched the whole area.

390
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,440
There is only this mine left.

391
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,440
Uncle, I know him. He is there.

392
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,440
Great.

393
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,440
Uncle, let's use our skills.

394
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
If we follow the training correctly,

395
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,440
the one who will not be able to find me is Hu Chuan Song Zhen.

396
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
He is dead?

397
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,440
Congratulations, Young Master.

398
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,440
That Hu Chuan Song Zhen is a treasure that all sects are looking for.

399
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,440
If you can give it to the sect leader, you will be able to make achievements.

400
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,440
I never thought that a dead person would become my blessing.

401
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,440
Second Older Brother, go.

402
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,440
Capture this person.

403
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Do not hurt him.

404
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,440
Hu Chuan Song Zhen, go.

405
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Xue Huan.

406
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,440
This time, we really have to leave.

407
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,440
It's him again.

408
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Xue Huan.

409
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Use the formation.

410
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
There is a way.

411
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,440
Go up to the mountain pass.

412
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
Take a rope and kill him.

413
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
The Jidan Qi is ready.

414
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Xue Huan, you take out the bag.

415
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
Why is it so slow?

416
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Uncle, he still has the formation.

417
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,440
This formation can block the attack of the Jidan Qi.

418
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,440
What are you waiting for?

419
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,440
Break the formation.

420
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,440
Go.

421
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
The key moment.

422
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
Don't leave any behind.

423
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
All of you, stay.

424
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Formation.

425
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
Kui Lei.

426
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,440
I never thought that he has so many tricks.

427
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,440
This person is not dead.

428
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,440
This person is not dead.

429
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,440
This person is not dead.

430
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,440
This person is not dead.

431
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,440
He must be a big ghost.

432
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Don't leave any behind.

433
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Break the formation.

434
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,440
Xue Huan, charge.

435
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,440
Why did you stop?

436
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,440
Where is the light?

437
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,440
No more jade?

438
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,440
No more jade?

439
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
Jade.

440
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Finally, the light is on.

441
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,440
The light is on.

442
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,440
This is the light.

443
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,440
I told you to go.

444
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,440
Go.

445
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Go.

446
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,440
Go.

447
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,440
Go.

448
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,440
Go.

449
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Go.

450
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,320
No way!

451
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,000
Don't touch it!

452
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,880
Han Li,

453
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,000
I'll kill you!

454
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,800
Come on, General Fu contr fundraising.

455
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,840
But no burn hurt!

456
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,840
Shut up!

457
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,800
Go die!

458
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,120
Come on!

459
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,920
Yunxiang!

460
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,440
Let's see whether you'll know how to punish me.

461
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,960
Take off the seal.

462
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,140
Lord.

463
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,700
suspension.

464
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,720
Go.

465
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,320
Tr maladies have been set free.

466
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,480
I'm the only one who can't see the end of the world.

467
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,880
I'm the only one who can't see the end of the world.

468
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,400
No matter how many times I return,

469
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,400
there will always be a moment.

470
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,360
I haven't finished this battle with you.

471
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,360
One day, I will come back.

472
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,280
The battle begins, the wind blows.

473
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,760
I'm ordinary.

474
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,600
I'm brave and brave.

475
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,280
I'm a fool.

476
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,280
My fate is dark and unruly.

477
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,720
I'm a man of great power.

478
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

479
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,720
I'm the only one who can't see the end of the world.

480
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

481
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

482
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

483
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

484
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

485
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

486
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

487
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

488
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

489
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

490
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

491
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

492
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

493
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

494
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

495
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
I'm the one who can't see the end of the world.

496
00:39:33,180 --> 00:40:01,380
I am struggling alone in the way of love.

497
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,660
My 거죠

498
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,700
Los Angeles

499
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,700
Of the first my

500
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,880
Embracing disappearc

501
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,700
Healing theords

502
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,180
To move on

503
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,480
But not unexpectedly

504
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,440
It's hard to forget

505
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,940
We are still living

506
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,120
write this radical world

507
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,100
Where have you brought these flowers?

508
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,900
There's no need for my representative to see it.

509
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,960
This...

510
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,620
Why is Sheng exaggerating so much?

511
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,440
Anyway,

512
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,480
take a look.

513
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,560
I already inspected it when I was still little.

514
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,560
You've mentioned it.

515
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,920
Let's bring it to your relatives' place.

516
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,040
The scene

517
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,320
is really good.

518
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,120
I'm sorry.

519
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,120
I'm sorry.

520
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,120
I'm sorry.

521
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,120
I'm sorry.

522
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,120
I'm sorry.

523
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,120
I'm sorry.

524
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,120
I'm sorry.

525
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,120
I'm sorry.

526
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,120
I'm sorry.

527
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,120
I'm sorry.

528
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,120
I'm sorry.

529
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,120
I'm sorry.

530
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,120
I'm sorry.

531
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,120
I'm sorry.

532
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
I'm sorry.

533
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
I'm sorry.

534
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,120
I'm sorry.

535
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm sorry.

536
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,120
I'm sorry.

537
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,120
I'm sorry.

538
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,120
I'm sorry.

539
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,120
I'm sorry.

540
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,120
I'm sorry.

541
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,120
I'm sorry.

542
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,120
I'm sorry.

543
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,120
I'm sorry.

544
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,120
I'm sorry.

545
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,120
I'm sorry.

546
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,120
To make you happy,

547
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,120
how to make it more real?

548
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,120
This song is so romantic.

549
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:41,120
Let's say goodbye.

550
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:17,080
Th Ve e Nad

551
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:32,120
The people in the underworld turn into empty

552
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,120
People can't fool me

553
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,120
You will still be in trouble

554
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,120
Even if the cold wind is small

555
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,120
Even if it's noisy

556
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,120
You and me are ordinary people

557
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,120
I don't mind the pain

558
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,120
Only a moment of silence

559
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,120
The night is like a long autumn

560
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,120
The heart is broken into pieces

561
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,120
No need to be so strong

562
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,120
Fate is hard to save

563
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:21,120
I know the future of life

564
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,120
Life is hard to save

565
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,120
Who can solve it

566
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,120
This heart has never been broken

567
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,120
Standing still and waiting

568
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,120
The so-called friendship is not broken

569
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,120
What should I do

570
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,120
This song of hope

571
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,120
We are ordinary people
