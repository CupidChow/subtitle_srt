The Legend of Xiao Chuo

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Although we have a marriage contract,

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I still want to develop a relationship with you.

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I didn't expect you still don't want to be close to me.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
As expected, you just dislike my birth and not as good as you.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I didn't mean that.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Then what do you mean? You are so afraid of me.

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Senior Brother Lu, be careful.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You look so shy.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There is no one else here.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's him again.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Senior Brother Lu, why do you always trouble him?

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He is the one who is troubling me.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The pearl elixir in his hand should be mine.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Han Li, stop right there!

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Stop!

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Senior Brother Lu, I have been patient since I came here.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why do you still have to be so aggressive?

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You know it.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Give me the pearl elixir.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Otherwise, you can only be a fertilizer to this forest.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I really shouldn't have remembered him.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
itz

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,800
I don't blame you for taking things that don't deserve to be taken.

26
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,800
What are you doing?

27
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,200
This is a grudge between me and him.

28
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,800
Please don't do anything.

29
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,600
Braai.

30
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,500
Forcing you not to

31
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,200
do Senior Bro with the same pickaxe!

32
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,000
When I was in Heaven Dance Platform for my DNC training

33
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
I got together with a spilled easy drug

34
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
during my Funk Song journey.

35
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,200
This숍unko

36
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
simply used Saint Se featured

37
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,900
as my preologia

38
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,980
The old men of the Tang family decided

39
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,060
that if you don't accept it,

40
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,380
you should go to them for justice.

41
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,900
I just want a fair one.

42
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,780
Even if the Shi family and the Su family look down on me,

43
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,220
he is a brother of Weiling Gen.

44
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,460
How can he get me?

45
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,860
Since you have taken the supplementary snacks

46
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,180
from the valley,

47
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,380
you shouldn't play the bamboo-bucket bamboo.

48
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,020
You will get another chance to play the bamboo-bucket.

49
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,580
You can fight for it.

50
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,140
Brother Lu, let's go.

51
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,380
Don't waste time.

52
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,820
Han Li,

53
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,420
wait and see.

54
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,020
It's not over yet.

55
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,540
I don't believe that someone will vote for you.

56
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,180
Are you okay?

57
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,500
Uncle Xie Wu.

58
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,020
He was right.

59
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,940
A man with no sin is a sinner.

60
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,700
If you want to keep this bamboo-bucket,

61
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,380
there is only one way.

62
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,460
You should train it to the 13th level as soon as possible

63
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,540
and eat it.

64
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,900
That's the only way.

65
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,140
Would한 this bamboo-bucket

66
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,620
really belong to me?

67
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,200
The bamboo-bucket is for killing the snake,

68
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,700
except one person.

69
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,500
Brother Lu.

70
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,700
Brother Lu, calm down.

71
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
Brother Lu.

72
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,420
Calm down.

73
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,500
I'm not calm.

74
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,220
You'll only hurt yourself.

75
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,500
I'm trying to get the bamboo eggs for you.

76
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,980
I deserve you only if I can get the eggs as soon as possible.

77
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,340
Lu...

78
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,540
Didn't the gate compensate you with three hundred taels of silver?

79
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
That's a lot.

80
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,540
You don't need to come here to take on the task, right?

81
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,660
If it doesn't compensate,

82
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,140
it's obviously a robbery.

83
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,140
Uncle.

84
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,660
I heard that

85
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,340
you have a way to get the bamboo eggs.

86
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,380
I have it.

87
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,740
But it's not cheap.

88
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,540
I don't know if you're willing to take the risk.

89
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,660
Three hundred taels of silver.

90
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,660
Here you are.

91
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,540
Three hundred taels of silver.

92
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,060
You don't need to keep it.

93
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,460
Compared with the bamboo eggs,

94
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,460
it's worth more than one tael of silver.

95
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Go back and wait.

96
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,060
Thank you, Uncle.

97
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,140
Well done.

98
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,420
Finish this man.

99
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,860
After the bamboo eggs are wrapped,

100
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,140
they should be put into a bottle.

101
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,940
How is it?

102
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,740
Challenge yourself.

103
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,980
You won't break your promise.

104
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,300
After you finish that bottle,...

105
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,020
you can drink your heart out with the foam,

106
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,700
and drinks your heart out with the foam.

107
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,900
There's no bar floods.

108
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,420
Yeah.

109
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,420
Is that a zombie!

110
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,420
That's a zombie!

111
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,060
Haven't you polítid anything yet?

112
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,140
Uncle.

113
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,520
Ten copies in total.

114
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,540
Ti equity twenty zero edited喪.

115
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,740
After you put the zero you can go.

116
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,380
What can a fine cost me?

117
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,180
I'll bring drinks.

118
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:57,100
Actually you can rent the gun of the

119
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,220
U.S. military immediately.

120
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,780
Women can move around as well.

121
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,880
After dinner, I won't hurt you anymore.

122
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,660
Don't worry.

123
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,340
changing

124
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,540
after dinner

125
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,540
can make things better for you.

126
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,380
I can't.

127
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,140
I carefully selected these books.

128
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,940
Or later...

129
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,540
Okay.

130
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,740
Just this time.

131
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,540
I'll give you the next one.

132
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,700
Let's go.

133
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,820
Thank you, Master.

134
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,460
Don't move.

135
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,740
I'll help you cure the big scar on your neck.

136
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,580
It's not worth it.

137
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,420
Two snacks.

138
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,420
You know medicine?

139
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,140
I didn't hear you say that.

140
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,700
I didn't say that.

141
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,820
Have you been

142
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,100
утaly had much

143
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,980
fr選r solid quickly recently?

144
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,060
I haven't.

145
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,260
As to pick,

146
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,340
I might not have had

147
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,180
No, I can't.

148
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,860
You're so swollen

149
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,940
because of the toxic gas.

150
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
You have to cut it open.

151
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,500
When I pick up the poisonous grass,

152
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,540
I'll use the anesthetic.

153
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,620
Take it.

154
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,820
It won't hurt if you cut it.

155
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,580
Hanlin.

156
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,100
Yes.

157
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,620
Come on.

158
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,140
Cut it directly.

159
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,140
Why are you so clumsy?

160
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,860
My bag is so uncomfortable.

161
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,580
Come on.

162
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,060
It hurts.

163
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,420
It's more uncomfortable than

164
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,820
sleeping and eating every day.

165
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,820
Cut it directly.

166
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,060
Come on.

167
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,540
Hurry up.

168
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,060
It's not reliable.

169
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,460
This one is not reliable either.

170
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,780
It's so uncomfortable.

171
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,500
Uncle.

172
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,740
Please.

173
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,460
Can you do it?

174
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,740
I'll do it later.

175
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,020
Listen, boy.

176
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,380
If you break it,

177
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,700
I won't forgive you.

178
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,980
Is it real?

179
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,020
The same doctor claimed

180
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,240
that it was biomarkers ΈA

181
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,460
external import Kṛṣṇa

182
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,380
It might seem to be awake

183
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,100
Or spurt

184
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,100
The sound of birds

185
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,800
It was

186
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,700
The fear when she saw

187
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,060
It was

188
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,940
Choked

189
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,720
The fire-related spirit

190
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,040
Styled

191
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,220
Let me apply some medicine.

192
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,360
Good.

193
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,720
How is it?

194
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,240
It's really good.

195
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,800
I didn't expect you to have this skill.

196
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,280
It seems that you have a good sense of spirituality

197
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,640
for these medicinal plants.

198
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,120
Come on.

199
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,160
The first-in-law's gift.

200
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,520
Keep it.

201
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,280
Uncle Shi, no need.

202
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,840
I'll take it if you want.

203
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,560
Come on.

204
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,400
I just said

205
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,640
I'll help you cure the big bag on your neck

206
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,840
and eat two snacks.

207
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,800
Then I chose ten books.

208
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,160
I still need two snacks.

209
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,600
So,

210
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,680
one horse is one horse.

211
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,520
I'm satisfied.

212
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,160
You little...

213
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,040
You're quite clear about the account.

214
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,120
Speaking of snacks,

215
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,120
it costs a lot in the valley.

216
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,240
You poor boy.

217
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,480
Go to the White Cloth Store

218
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,600
and get more tasks.

219
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,520
Get more snacks.

220
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,920
Am I qualified to get tasks now?

221
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,320
I told you to go.

222
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,320
Uncle Xie.

223
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,840
This Uncle Xie

224
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,320
is clearly looking at the wooden sculpture.

225
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,800
But I feel like I'm being looked down upon.

226
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,520
Could it be that

227
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,840
people can really use it?

228
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,120
Come in.

229
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,800
Greetings, Uncle Ye Shi.

230
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,240
You're here to get tasks?

231
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,560
It's your first time here alone.

232
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,560
Do you want me to introduce you?

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,040
The spiritual beast of Xun Fu.

234
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,800
Five is a snack.

235
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,840
That's a lot.

236
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,640
But is it dangerous to tame the spiritual beast?

237
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,440
It's a dangerous game.

238
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,000
If you don't dare,

239
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,040
there's this.

240
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,000
One mountain

241
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,920
and one spirit stone.

242
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,640
Is there anything simpler?

243
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,960
I don't need so many spirit stones.

244
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,680
If you can't even get these two,

245
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,800
you can only come back next month.

246
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,760
Uncle Ye.

247
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,000
Uncle Ye.

248
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,560
Is there still a task for the White Cloth Store?

249
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,800
Can I choose this?

250
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,240
Do you know where the White Cloth Store is?

251
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,960
I looked down once when I was flying.

252
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,720
If it's just a task to control the materials,

253
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
I can still get the job.

254
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,240
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

255
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,080
The spirit grass of the White Cloth Store

256
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,360
is lower than the spirit grass of the Yellow Wind Valley.

257
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,560
The spirit grass is more precious

258
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
than the disciples of the Yellow Wind Valley.

259
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,520
If one or two spirits die,

260
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,440
the spirit stones you want to pay

261
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,000
are not worth hundreds of thousands of taels.

262
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
You don't believe me?

263
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,360
I'm not talented.

264
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,120
I want to try.

265
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,920
You're so ungrateful.

266
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,880
Take the spirit stone.

267
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,920
I'm afterlife here.

268
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,560
Why do I have to give you spirit stone?

269
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,760
It's the fee of my reward tax.

270
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,760
It's a rule.

271
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,440
What about other tasks?

272
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,160
What's more,

273
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:59,480
to avoid you four from working hard on the service

274
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,600
and no way to make feelings good while working with Spirit Oriental.

275
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,280
Why don't you тут a spoken spirit?

276
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,360
Baiyaoyuan?

277
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Actually, there's a way.

278
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,360
You're willing to help me?

279
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Simple.

280
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,280
Don't you have the Elixir of the

281
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
Soul?

282
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Sell it to me.

283
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
I can have a large amount of spiritual stones.

284
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
I have a better task.

285
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Just pick one.

286
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
Master Xue,

287
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,360
you shouldn't use the Elixir of the Soul.

288
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Who asked you to help?

289
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
What's the use of asking this?

290
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
You're a spirit root.

291
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
You've never been connected to the Elixir of the Soul.

292
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
I'm willing to buy it with the spiritual stones.

293
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
You should thank me.

294
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
That's right.

295
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
As long as there's a chance to get a thousand points,

296
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
I don't want to miss it.

297
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Two hundred spiritual stones.

298
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
I'll give you another fifty.

299
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
Don't be so stingy.

300
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
This is 250 spiritual stones.

301
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
With your strength,

302
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,360
you can't protect this pearl.

303
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Why do you have to die and not let go?

304
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,360
If you miss your chance,

305
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,360
you'll lose your chance.

306
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Master,

307
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,360
is this a threat?

308
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,360
It seems that if I don't get this Elixir of the Soul today,

309
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,360
I can't get out of this door.

310
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,360
Are you sure you want this mission?

311
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
Yes.

312
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,360
I want to get the Elixir of the Soul.

313
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
I'll go to the temple.

314
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
Yes.

315
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
I want it.

316
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,360
Go to your Master Ma.

317
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Maybe,

318
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
as you said,

319
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,360
I can't protect this Elixir of the Soul.

320
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Fortunately,

321
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
I got the mission of the Hundred-Yellowing Garden.

322
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Next, I can prepare the spiritual grass,

323
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
train the elixir,

324
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
and improve my cultivation.

325
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
As for the Elixir of the Soul,

326
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
I'll find a way.

327
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Is anyone here?

328
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Is anyone here?

329
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Is anyone here?

330
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
I'm here to take the mission

331
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
to take care of the Elixir of the Soul.

332
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
Han Li,

333
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,360
is Master Ma here?

334
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Why are you making a scene?

335
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,360
Don't scare my flower.

336
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Master Ma,

337
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,360
I'm here to take care of the Elixir of the Soul.

338
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
I'm here to take care of the Elixir of the Soul.

339
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
I'm here to take care of the Elixir of the Soul.

340
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Where are you going?

341
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Is it Master Ma?

342
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,360
Who cares?

343
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Hello, Master Ma.

344
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
My name is...

345
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Han Li.

346
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Although this is the Hundred-Yellowing Garden,

347
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,360
there are tens of millions of herbs in it.

348
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,360
You want to stay?

349
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,360
You count how many bamboos you have here today.

350
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,360
If you get it wrong,

351
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
you don't have to come tomorrow.

352
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Grass medicine?

353
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,360
You count it clearly,

354
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
you'll know how many bamboos you have.

355
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,360
If you lose,

356
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,360
you have nothing to say.

357
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
Yes.

358
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,360
17823, 17824, 17825, 17826.

359
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Here are all the herbs.

360
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,360
There are 7123 bamboos in total.

361
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,360
17827, 17828, 17827.

362
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
I come here every day to paint.

363
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
I remember every plant here.

364
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
I won't be wrong.

365
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,360
1739.

366
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
You're a new student, right?

367
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
178...

368
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Oh no.

369
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
He's using some magic.

370
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
The magic power should be on me.

371
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Let's go.

372
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
Wait.

373
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
What's wrong?

374
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
What are you doing?

375
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Don't move. I'm just looking at you.

376
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
You look ordinary.

377
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Your magical powers are average.

378
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,360
But your eyes are good. They're clean.

379
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,360
Miss, please leave.

380
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
You don't like to be looked at?

381
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
I just don't like to be stared at.

382
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
If you look at me like this,

383
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
I'll feel uncomfortable.

384
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Are you nervous to see me?

385
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
Don't worry.

386
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
In this garden,

387
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
except for these flowers and flowers,

388
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,360
there are rarely people.

389
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Don't be nervous.

390
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
Don't move.

391
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,360
The 91st place on the western bed.

392
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Look at his long legs.

393
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Black and white, straight and straight.

394
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
They're dancing.

395
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Look at his fine fur.

396
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
Under the sun, he's so handsome.

397
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
Look at his beautiful eyes.

398
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
He's so handsome.

399
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
Under the sun, he's shining like a green shadow.

400
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,360
How beautiful he is.

401
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
He's like a general.

402
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
What's the rare treasure?

403
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,360
There are different ranks of bugs.

404
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,360
Yes.

405
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Even the cultivators have ranks.

406
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,360
Why can't these bugs and flowers and plants have ranks?

407
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Don't look at this garden.

408
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,360
There are many things in it.

409
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Yes.

410
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
This cultivator's place

411
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,360
is really amazing.

412
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Where are they?

413
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,360
I forgot them all.

414
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
Don't look at me, okay?

415
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
One, two, three.

416
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,360
But people are born to be seen.

417
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
Three.

418
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Look at these bugs and plants.

419
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,360
They don't care about us.

420
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
So they're happy.

421
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Why do you care about others' eyes?

422
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,360
Why are there some weird people in this garden?

423
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,360
I hope no one will notice me.

424
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,360
But he looks like he's familiar with this place.

425
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,360
Why don't you go and ask around?

426
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
I'm sorry.

427
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
I'm sorry.

428
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
I'm Han Li.

429
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,360
I don't know how to call you.

430
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
So you're the immortal.

431
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
I don't look down on you.

432
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
I'm Dong Xuan'er.

433
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,360
We'll get to know each other.

434
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Are you also a gardener?

435
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
He's Dong Xuan'er.

436
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,360
No one can like him.

437
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
Uncle Ma.

438
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,360
Uncle Ma.

439
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Since you two have met,

440
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
you don't need to say so much.

441
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
This is Han Li.

442
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,360
Dong Xuan'er is different from others.

443
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,360
He's a disciple of Qingchuan,

444
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
a disciple of Jidan.

445
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,360
So everything in his eyes is different from what you see.

446
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,360
Don't waste your time with him.

447
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
I understand.

448
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
This is a good thing.

449
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
What do you think?

450
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
It's really good.

451
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Looking at the quality,

452
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
it can be upgraded to level two

453
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,360
after a dozen years of cultivation.

454
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
You're so lucky.

455
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
Heaven and earth are like a painting.

456
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
Everything is in the world.

457
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,360
Since they exist,

458
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
they should learn to appreciate each other.

459
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,360
Isn't that right?

460
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,360
Han Li.

461
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
What I see is beautiful.

462
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,360
Maybe this is also a kind of cultivation.

463
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,360
This herbal garden is really good.

464
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,360
I like it.

465
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
How are you today?

466
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,360
You seem to be very happy.

467
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,360
Be happy.

468
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Master Ma.

469
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,360
How many plants did you find today?

470
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
If you count the surface,

471
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
it's 7123 plants.

472
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,360
If you count the jade dragon roots growing underground,

473
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,360
the total number is 7177 plants.

474
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
That's not right.

475
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
I said it twice.

476
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
It must be right.

477
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,360
7187 plants.

478
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,360
8123 plants.

479
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
Impossible.

480
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,360
Impossible.

481
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
Absolutely impossible.

482
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
I have the martial arts.

483
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Take this.

484
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
You're a good fighter.

485
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
Thank you, Master Ma.

486
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Can I stay?

487
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,360
Master Ma.

488
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,360
I was hit by it before.

489
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,360
Don't worry, Master Ma.

490
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,360
Wait here.

491
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
Don't look.

492
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
I'll go.

493
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Han Lei, come here.

494
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,360
I told you before.

495
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,360
If the herbal grass is in good condition,

496
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
you have to pay.

497
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,360
Did you prepare a compensation plan?

498
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,360
I'll try my best.

499
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Okay.

500
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,360
Write it down if you need anything.

501
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Okay.

502
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
I'll leave it to you.

503
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,360
I'll go back to the inn.

504
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
You can stay here.

505
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
It's convenient to manage the garden.

506
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,360
I'll come back to you after I'm done.

507
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
When the harvest is over,

508
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
I'll give you some snacks.

509
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Okay?

510
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
Don't worry, Master Ma.

511
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,360
And don't bother me.

512
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
Okay, sure.

513
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
Bye.

514
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
Bye.

515
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,360
Bye.

516
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,360
See you.

517
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
Bye.

518
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
Bye.

519
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,360
Bye.

520
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
Let's go.

521
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Mr. Ye!

522
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Where did that old woman go so early in the morning?

523
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,360
It seems that he has a lot of research on the puppet tree.

524
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,760
This guy is so powerful.

525
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,960
If I fight him, I definitely won't be able to defeat him.

526
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,160
Old and undead.

527
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,360
You came so early.

528
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,160
You're not here to steal a new mission, right?

529
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,960
Master.

530
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,160
I heard that you've already helped me get the bamboo chicken.

531
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,960
I'm here to thank you.

532
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,760
Thank you for what?

533
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,560
Who told me, an old and undead, to promise you, a young and undead?

534
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,160
Then when are you planning to give me the bamboo chicken?

535
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,360
No rush.

536
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
Just wait.

537
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,960
The new mission's disciple is about to arrive.

538
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,160
If you're not afraid of losing, just wait for me here.

539
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,760
When they leave, I'll definitely give you an answer.

540
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,560
Come, come, come. Everyone, come in.

541
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Good morning, Master Ye.

542
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Choose the mission you like.

543
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,960
Which ungrateful person took Bai Yao Yuan's mission?

544
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,760
Does he not know Master Ma's temper?

545
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,160
Or does he not know how powerful these herbs are?

546
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,760
Who else could it be?

547
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Who?

548
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,360
That Immortal Deity.

549
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,960
I didn't think it was him.

550
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,160
Then he's done.

551
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,360
This Bai Yao Yuan is the last stop in the Yellow Wind Valley.

552
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,360
This Bai Yao Yuan is no different from the Immortal Deity.

553
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,760
Just a little bigger. No problem.

554
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,760
The roots don't grow.

555
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,960
It needs to be sun-dried for four hours.

556
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,360
Taking care of these flowers and plants

557
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,560
is much more familiar than mixing with those people who are my enemies.

558
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,560
The sunshine is so good.

559
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,160
You guys eat more, look more, and have more flowers to bloom.

560
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,360
The great plan to gain spiritual power and gain spiritual power is all up to you.

561
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,140
I'm going to the

562
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,560
Yellow Wind Valley.

563
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,560
I'm going to the Yellow Wind Valley.

564
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,560
I'm going to the Yellow Wind Valley.

565
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,560
I'm going to the Yellow Wind Valley.

566
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,560
I'm going to the Yellow Wind Valley.

567
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,560
I'm going to the Yellow Wind Valley.

568
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,560
I'm going to the Yellow Wind Valley.

569
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,560
I'm going to the Yellow Wind Valley.

570
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,360
Ya Nan.

571
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,760
Del USS.

572
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,760
We're all here...

573
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,160
We're all here...

574
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,960
I don't think we should let Dad and I in.

575
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Somehow, this hardships...

576
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,360
Even though document's paper teeth are broken,

577
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,360
I promise to never forget

578
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,360
I will only be with you for the rest of my life

579
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,360
Let time pass by

580
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,360
and return to the beginning

581
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:50,360
Missing you is like a flower blooming in the middle of the night

582
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,360
We are always together

583
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
I will never leave you

584
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:05,360
I will always be your left hand

585
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,360
I will always be by your side

586
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,360
I will always be with you

587
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,360
I will always be your right hand

588
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,360
I will always be your left hand

589
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,360
I will always be your right hand

590
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:36,360
I will always be by your side

591
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
You were supposed to take on the mission of Baiyaoyuan

592
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,360
I was worried that you would be fooled by that old man

593
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Now it seems that you are not only good at medicine

594
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,360
You also have a good sense of discipline

595
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
Not bad

596
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,360
Uncle Wu, I am also a scholar

597
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,360
Everything depends on your trust

598
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,360
It seems that you have mastered the transmission technique I taught you last time

599
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,360
I am leaving

600
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,360
It is not over yet

601
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,360
There is more?

602
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,360
Come on

603
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
It is comfortable

604
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
This is it

605
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Tell me, what kind of skills do you want to change this time?

606
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
I want all of them

607
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
I am not good at self-study

608
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
It is too late to go to school

609
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,360
There are too many things I want to learn

610
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
It is done

611
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Good

612
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,360
Today, I will teach you this magic

613
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,360
Watch this

614
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
This is the ice move

615
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,360
This is called the sand move

616
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,360
But don't underestimate these two magic tricks

617
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,360
If a person who knows the art of magic can make a thousand miles of cold land into a desert

618
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,360
And the Great River of the Yangtze River into an ice spring

619
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
Try it

620
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
This is good for the first time

621
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
Don't worry

622
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:29,360
The power of magic is based on the ability of the master

623
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
And the degree of practice

624
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Although you are not good at it

625
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,360
But you are in the front

626
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,360
You will make it in a few days

627
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Thank you, uncle

628
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
I am leaving

629
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
I

630
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
I

631
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,360
I

632
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,360
When will you come again?

633
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
Uncle, you are welcome

634
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
Ok

635
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,360
You need to practice more

636
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,360
You are good

637
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,360
You manage the whole medicine cloud very well

638
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,360
It's all thanks to your good handling

639
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,360
I am just a moth

640
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
And the sky is beautiful

641
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,360
So I can have a little success

642
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,360
Uncle

643
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,360
You have a good knowledge of medicine

644
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,360
I think you know a lot about medicine

645
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
I am not good at it

646
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
Nonsense

647
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
I am just a moth

648
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,360
But I see the silver light on the wall of the moth

649
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,360
I think it should be the traces left by the elixir stone

650
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,360
So I dare to ask

651
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,360
You are so eager to study things here

652
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,360
It seems that the fire is too light

653
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,360
Uncle

654
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Can you give me a pack of elixir?

655
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,360
To be honest

656
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,360
I also want to try to practice elixir by myself

657
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,360
You are really out of your mind

658
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:41,360
I have studied these elixir packs for several years

659
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,360
How can I give them to you?

660
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,360
It's ok to try them by yourself

661
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
I can't do it by myself

662
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,360
You have passed the test of medicine cloud

663
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,360
But the difficulty of medicine cloud

664
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,360
I am still determined

665
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,360
I will come here every year

666
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,360
You should keep an eye on the medicine cloud

667
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,360
When you finish it

668
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:18,360
You can buy the elixir of medicine cloud

669
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Thank you

670
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,360
If you want to find the elixir of medicine cloud

671
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,360
You should prepare the elixir of medicine cloud

672
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,360
Go to Lushan Hall and tell the director

673
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,360
It's my old horse's idea

674
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,360
Don't tell anyone

675
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,360
Thank you, uncle

676
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,360
This is Lushan Hall

677
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,360
You dare to go to Lushan Hall without elixir?

678
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,360
The elixir of medicine cloud

679
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,360
is not for you

680
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,360
It's for you

681
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
I don't want to see you

682
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,360
I don't want to see you

683
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,360
I don't want to see you

684
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,360
I don't want to see you

685
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,360
I don't want to see you

686
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,360
I don't want to see you

687
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,360
The elixir of medicine cloud

688
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,360
The elixir of medicine cloud

689
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,360
The elixir of medicine cloud

690
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,360
The elixir of medicine cloud

691
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,360
Here you should have enough elixir

692
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,360
It's the end of the world

693
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,360
I know who you are

694
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
I am the sacred spirit

695
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,360
I am the sacred spirit

696
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,360
Uncle, you are a joke

697
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,360
Don't call me uncle

698
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
I don't like to hear it

699
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,360
My surname is Xu, call me Lao Xu

700
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
Master Xu

701
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,360
Master Xu

702
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,360
Master Xu

703
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,360
Lao, Lao, Lao, Lao

704
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,360

705
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,360
Your cloud

706
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,360
The elixir of medicine cloud

707
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,360
One hour, one piece of elixir

708
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,360
Remember

709
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,360
You can't take it out

710
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,360
Please

711
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,360
Please don't tell master Xu

712
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
I have been here

713
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
I have been here

714
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,360

753
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,360
