OST credit

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,465
♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫

4
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:27,120
♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,060
♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,441
♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫

7
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:36,160
♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,560
♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,959
♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫

10
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:46,502
♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫

11
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:50,800
♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,879
♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,340
♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,426
♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,264
♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫

16
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:13,429
♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫

17
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:15,720
♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,980
♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫

19
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,160
♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,603
♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,020
♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,550
♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫

23
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,972
Welcome to Jiayuan City, sir!
Right this way.

24
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,370
- No need.
- Check out my shop.

25
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,810
You dare steal business from Lone Manor?

26
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,810
- Tired of living?
- Get over here!

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,970
You just hit someone from the Black Bear Gang?

28
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,950
You're asking for trouble!

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,640
Hey, sir! Welcome to Jiayuan City!

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,660
Right over here. We've got a little shop.

31
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,130
Our herbal tea is the perfect thing
to cool off with.

32
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,900
Take a sip on a hot day to feel refreshed!

33
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,650
Come on! Right this way, sir.

34
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,330
Please, have a seat.

35
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,220
Take a look around!

36
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,080
Great taste, sir!

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,390
Waiter! Bring some tea!

38
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,860
Here you go! This way. Come, have a seat.

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,940
Right this way!

40
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,770
Come on, Sir. Give it a try!

41
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,192
This tea...

42
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:32,580
This tea of ours really hits the spot!

43
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,570
It's the real deal.

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,410
- Uh, excuse me.
- I need some information.

45
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,970
You've come to the right guy!

46
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,540
Here in Jiayuan City,
there's nothing I, Sun Er Gou, don't know!

47
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,305
What do you need?

48
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:50,290
Mo Ju Ren. The Mo Residence.

49
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,490
Mo Ju Ren... Physician Mo?

50
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,200
Oh, his family? I know everything!

51
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,590
Something big just happened
at Physician Mo's place.

52
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,210
What happened?

53
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,180
Physician Mo is now dead.

54
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,480
He died?

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,840
No one else knows yet.

56
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,460
How do you know?

57
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,290
His final disciple told me himself.

58
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,600
Final disciple?

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,250
Who was it?

60
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,030
Wu Jian Ming.

61
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,900
- Hey, beggar boy, move it!
- Out of the way!

62
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,410
Move, you little brat!

63
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,580
Open your eyes!

64
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,980
My young master is coming through!

65
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,730
Out of the way!

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,160
That's him!

67
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,530
- Make way!
- Don't block the road!

68
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,180
This kid's no ordinary punk.

69
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,330
Who do you think you are? Get lost.

70
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,530
He got into trouble a few years ago.

71
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,360
- The Five-Color Sect kicked him out.
- Move aside!

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,770
Now he goes around saying
he's Physician Mo's final disciple.

73
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,900
Just last month,

74
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,420
he got engaged to Miss Yu Zhu
the first daughter of the Mo family.

75
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,515
They are picking a date for the wedding.

76
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:11,726
The entire Mo family business might fall right into his hands.

77
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,295
That means the Sunwarm Jade that cures poison

78
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:19,905
will be part of her dowry too.

79
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,240
Sir? Are you alright? You're drenched in sweat.

80
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,300
Did you get heatstroke?

81
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,860
Waiter, a bowl of mung bean soup! Hurry!

82
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,800
- Do you have any rooms?
- Yes, we do.

83
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,390
Get me an upper room. My friend needs to rest.

84
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,580
Right away. Don't worry.

85
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,360
- Alright.
- Come on.

86
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,390
Watch your step, sir.

87
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,030
The poison from the Silver Demon Palm has been acting up more often.

88
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,860
I have to get the jade
before Miss Mo gets married.

89
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,331
If I don't get the Sunwarm Jade, Wu will probably take it for himself.

90
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,300
Get some rest.

91
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,550
Until the bell rings, don't go anywhere.

92
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,610
The secret branch in Changping Town sent in 7,300 taels of silver.

93
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,886
The one in Luogu Town only sent 5,800 taels.

94
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:28,957
These secret branches
are getting worse every year.

95
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:30,420
The silver they sent this year

96
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,740
is over a quarter less than usual.

97
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,460
What is this?

98
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,040
That's Father's Dragon Mark Ring.

99
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,260
Thief!

100
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,260
I'm not a thief.

101
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,870
Ladies of the Mo family, I am Han Li, Physician Mo's final disciple.

102
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,040
I came to pay my respects.

103
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,330
Final disciple?

104
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,050
Another one of those impostors.

105
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,770
This is Master's handwritten letter.

106
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,540
Please have a look.

107
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,350
Go fetch Mother.

108
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:30,394
Come to the main hall.

109
00:06:30,394 --> 00:06:33,500
You should hand the letter to Mother yourself.

110
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,130
Alright.

111
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,530
It's dark. Watch your step.

112
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,400
The Master has been gone so long. He finally remembered us.

113
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,620
-  One of them.
- That's right.

114
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,260
At least we finally heard
something from him today.

115
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,411
Two of them.

116
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:10,970
What kind of final disciple did he take in?

117
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,530
-  Three of them.
-Yeah, what does he even look like?

118
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,380
-  Four.
- Final disciple, really?

119
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,180
Unbelievable.

120
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,270
Five, six.

121
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,498
Why are there so many?

122
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:22,288
Watch out.

123
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,970
So, you're the real final disciple.

124
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,460
You're a lot better
than that impostor Wu Jian Ming.

125
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,260
Why haven't we heard of you before?

126
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,000
This final disciple seems alright.

127
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,980
Pretty handsome too.

128
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,850
- Not bad.
- Looks like the Master made the right choice.

129
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,290
He's impressive.

130
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,240
Very impressive.

131
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,860
Newcomer, this is my mother,
Madam Li of the Mo family.

132
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,539
This is Third Madam, Madam Liu.

133
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,150
Fourth Madam, Madam Yan.

134
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,220
And Fifth Madam, Madam Wang.

135
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,068
I am Han Li. Greetings, Madams.

136
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,510
Han Li?

137
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:10,969
My eldest sister, Yu Zhu. I am Feng Wu.

138
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:13,320
My younger sister, Cai Huan.

139
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:17,399
Greetings, ladies.

140
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:20,704
So, she isn't a servant.

141
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,820
Young man. Did that old fool say when he'll be back?

142
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,330
Madam Liu, whatever Master wanted to say was written in the letter.

143
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,281
Letter?

144
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,770
Where's the letter?

145
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,941
My wives and daughters,
may this letter stand in for my presence

146
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:57,076
I'm entangled in pressing matters and still can't return home anytime soon.

147
00:08:57,076 --> 00:09:01,770
The one delivering this letter
is my final disciple, Han Li.

148
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,260
He possesses unique skills and can be trusted.

149
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,150
If anything happens at the Mo Residence, feel free to let him handle it.

150
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,540
If he can keep the Mo family safe,

151
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,550
then he may choose to marry one
from Yu Zhu, Feng Wu, or Cai Huan.

152
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:25,340
As for her dowry, use the Sunwarm Jade.

153
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,410
Why are they looking so guarded?

154
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,975
It doesn't make sense.

155
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,976
I've read this letter hundreds of times.

156
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:40,396
There's nothing suspicious in it.

157
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,820
Master cares deeply for the family.

158
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,500
He wants me to ease the burdens on the Mo family.

159
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,330
If you ladies have anything urgent that needs dealing with, just let me know.

160
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,290
I shall give it my all.

161
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,140
It's getting late today.

162
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,380
Young Master Han, why don't you
stay here at the residence tonight?

163
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,480
As for everything else,

164
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,290
we can talk about it tomorrow.

165
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,600
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

166
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,120
- But...
- Yu Zhu, Feng Wu, Cai Huan, quickly.

167
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,860
Show Young Master Han to the west wing to rest.

168
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,890
Please.

169
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,131
They're in such a rush to send me off.

170
00:10:51,131 --> 00:10:53,141
Something is up.

171
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,255
You all remember what the Master told us before leaving.

172
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:03,980
If valuables are sent here, all is well.

173
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,810
But if it's a letter, it's most likely bad news.

174
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,477
Madam Yan, let's read the letter.

175
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:12,410
Very well.

176
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,845
The secret letter will show its content.

177
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:16,050
Secret letter?

178
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,930
That old fool had a backup plan in place.

179
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,620
I told you to stop fooling around.

180
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,059
Our mothers seem to like him.

181
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,379
Nanny Wu, bring some water.

182
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,050
Why water?

183
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,630
It's all silent now.

184
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,050
Li, be honest.

185
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,870
First impression of Yu Zhu?

186
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,960
What do you mean?

187
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,920
My father told us he'd betroth one of us to his final disciple.

188
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,380
You three are prestigious ladies.

189
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,441
Master must have been kidding.

190
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:57,052
I can't take it seriously.

191
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:59,220
Ladies, you need not worry.

192
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,994
Madam Wang, activate your inner strength.

193
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:03,984
Inner strength?

194
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,325
"If you're reading this, it means I'm no longer
of this world."

195
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:17,772
"The one who took my life was..."

196
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:19,270
Father would never

197
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,970
- make a joke with our marriage.
-  Did they finish reading?

198
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:23,283
-  Darn it.
- My sister would like to speak with you.

199
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:24,520
-  What's on the letter?
- Young Master Han?

200
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,880
You came at the perfect time.

201
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,000
-  She talks a lot.
- If you can get rid

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,640
- of that impostor Wu Jian Ming...
-  I can't hear a thing.

203
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,840
I don't mind marrying you.

204
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,545
It's him!

205
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:33,906
He looked like an honest fellow.

206
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:35,620
Can't judge a book by its cover.

207
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,471
If he could fool the Master, we must be cautious.

208
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:40,760
What are they whispering?

209
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,580
This grudge must be avenged.

210
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,615
Vengeance is needed.

211
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:45,750
He must pay for this.

212
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,260
- What now?
- We kill him.

213
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,650
It's always the same methods.

214
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,127
My venomous spider
was a gift from the Master before he left.

215
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:55,620
After all these years, it's time for it to get some fresh air.

216
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,380
I have a recipe.

217
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,500
The Master says to use it when necessary.

218
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,340
Tonight, I'll brew the drug.

219
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,860
Madam Yan, brew the drug for my Jade Hornet Sting.

220
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,877
Before we act, we can knock him out with incense.

221
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:12,020
One more thing. Father said you could choose.

222
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,570
But you must marry me first.

223
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,450
- I am the oldest sister.
-  I can't hear a thing.

224
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,422
In this family,

225
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:17,800
- the old ones can't get married.
-  They talk too much.

226
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
The young can't get married yet.

227
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,369
Miss Yu Zhu, do you have the Sunwarm Jade?

228
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:25,740
You need not worry.

229
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,840
Since Mother said so,
the Madams will take care of it.

230
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,670
No, I mean, you'd better not be a greedy one.

231
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,320
You'd ignore a beauty like Yu Zhu?

232
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,000
All you care about is the Sunwarm Jade.

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,750
Forget it, Feng Wu.
Don't make things hard for him.

234
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,640
Yu Zhu! Don't speak like you've married him.

235
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,690
I wasn't!

236
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,000
The path ends here.

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,680
Where am I staying?

238
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,040
We got carried away chatting.

239
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,080
West wing. This way.

240
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,181
When do we make our move?

241
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,560
Tonight. No time like the present.

242
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,120
Alright.

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,710
Wait.

244
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:06,450
Young Master Han, please.

245
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,050
Thanks for walking me here.

246
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,080
Rest well.

247
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,120
I didn't say anything wrong just now, did I?

248
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,530
He won't be upset, right?

249
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,920
- Why are they still here?
- I told you to talk less.

250
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,260
Alright. I'm going.

251
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,390
- Go.
- Go on.

252
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,880
Did I say anything wrong just now?

253
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,110
Right?

254
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,420
What do you think about me and him?

255
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,340
They are finally gone.

256
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,080
Madam Yan always thinks things through.

257
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,761
Strange.

258
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:42,891
Why is it quiet again?

259
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,485
- We'll go with your plan.
- Whatever you say.

260
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:50,410
Alright.

261
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,220
Since everyone agrees,
we still have to treat him well.

262
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,140
Let him stay at the residence.

263
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,690
Give him good food and drink.

264
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,740
Let him build up his strength.

265
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,750
That way, he'll be more useful to us later.

266
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,860
Nanny Wu.

267
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,140
Make sure Young Master Han
gets a hearty breakfast.

268
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,440
Use the same standard that we had for the Master.

269
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,900
Whatever they're planning,

270
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,760
I have to get the Sunwarm
Jade they promised me.

271
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,790
I'm running out of pills.

272
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,690
Better save them for a critical moment.

273
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,030
Good morning, Young Master Han.

274
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,440
Mother asked Nanny Wu
to prepare a hearty breakfast.

275
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,590
Come eat with us.

276
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,500
Young Master Han, have some.

277
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,630
Everything was specially made
by Nanny Wu at our mothers' request.

278
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,380
I called someone greedy last night, but that was totally wrong.

279
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,810
He's just stingy, that's what.

280
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:02,840
Who comes as a guest, eats and drinks for free, and shows up empty-handed?

281
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,150
That's enough.

282
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,600
Can you stop going on and on?

283
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,960
Asking him for gifts
the moment you open your mouth?

284
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,460
That's just as bad.

285
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,650
Didn't he ask us for the Sunwarm Jade?

286
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,500
Ladies, this meal, is too much for me.

287
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,640
But, I do have something that can serve as a gift.

288
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,438
What's this?

289
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:34,770
This? It's called Fragrance Pellet.

290
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,140
Carry it with you.

291
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,340
It helps keep mosquitoes and bugs away with a light floral scent.

292
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,510
It smells so good.

293
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,360
What if men start lining up to propose?

294
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,440
This is official imperial medicine.

295
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,980
Such a rare and precious court medicine, and you're giving it away?

296
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,540
Don't tell me you've fallen for the two of us.

297
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,739
Feng Wu, don't talk nonsense.

298
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,900
All of this was made by Nanny Wu
based on guesses.

299
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,510
We're not sure if it suits your taste,
Young Master Han.

300
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,390
Whichever one you like, we'll have her make it again tomorrow.

301
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,790
These two girls are noisy,

302
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,770
but they're easier to deal with than the mothers.

303
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,160
Until I find the jade,
I'd better play along with them.

304
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,020
Delicious.

305
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,990
Do you like it?

306
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,050
If you like it, then I like it too.

307
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,586
My belly hurts.

308
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,486
Mothers?

309
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,940
You, come with us.

310
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,299
We brought you here because there's something we want to ask you in person.

311
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,380
No need to ask.

312
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,620
I killed Physician Mo.

313
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,490
At least you're honest.

314
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,060
He tried to kill me first.

315
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,040
All I did was defend myself.

316
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,970
We can look past what you did to the Master.

317
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,120
But you must agree to do something for us.

318
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,780
Alright.

319
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,245
But I want you to swear on Physician Mo's spirit.

320
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:32,785
Once it's done, give me the Sunwarm Jade.

321
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,890
Do you know who you're going after?

322
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,280
I must have the Sunwarm Jade.

323
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,440
His name is Ouyang Fei Tian.

324
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,000
He has always committed evil acts.

325
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,340
He slaughters the innocent.

326
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,720
He has even spread the word that he'd wipe out our family.

327
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,400
Eliminating him not only protects us, but also benefits the people.

328
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,900
Fine.

329
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,820
Don't say we didn't warn you.

330
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,680
His martial skills surpass the Master's.

331
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,170
He treasures his life dearly.

332
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,640
He's probably surrounded by layers of traps.

333
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Underestimating him will only get you killed.

334
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,030
Did you get all that?

335
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,870
No need for you ladies to worry about that.

336
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,460
And your sincerity?

337
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,960
Alright.

338
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,110
We can do that.

339
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,590
We swear on the spirit
of our late husband, Mo Ju Ren.

340
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,920
If you can get rid of Ouyang Fei Tian for us,

341
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,240
we'll give you the Sunwarm Jade.

342
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,220
Deal.

343
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,310
Deal.

344
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,270
It's like he didn't hesitate at all.

345
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,230
Who might this mighty warrior be?

346
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,420
You're Ouyang Fei Tian?

347
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,410
This is a sacred place of serenity.

348
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,100
Don't be reckless.

349
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,450
You're reeking of murderous intent,

350
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,620
and you talk about serenity?

351
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,820
You're a cultivator?

352
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:12,260
A proper cultivator getting involved in mortal disputes?

353
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,900
Who sent you?

354
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,820
Which family hired you?

355
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:24,472
I am willing to pay double if you could spare me.

356
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,100
Bargaining?

357
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,780
I've looked into you.

358
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,620
You've committed countless crimes.

359
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,820
Now you think you can buy your life back?

360
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,210
Master, why must you
trouble a mere mortal like me?

361
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,800
I've even sent men many times to Tainan Valley to seek cultivators,

362
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,820
but I never managed to find any trace.

363
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,350
Now that I finally met one,

364
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:57,999
naturally, I'd like to build
a good relationship with you.

365
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,860
Tainan Valley?

366
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,840
Yes.

367
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,580
Since ancient times,

368
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,470
Tainan Valley has been a gathering place for immortals.

369
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,380
Legend has it that a hundred years ago,

370
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,000
someone there was chosen to become
a disciple of an immortal.

371
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,520
Please look, Master.

372
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:33,340
This is a map of Tainan Valley.

373
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:39,170
If you wish to have it,
I will gladly hand it over.

374
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,170
Tainan Valley...

375
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,290
That sounds familiar.

376
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,690
Could there be other cultivators?

377
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,820
Seems like you're not interested in that, Master.

378
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,730
Well then, forget it.

379
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,500
Once this is all done,
I'll go check out Tainan Valley.

380
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,150
Mother.

381
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,250
Ouyang Fei Tian...

382
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,480
- We have news.
- What happened?

383
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,930
He's dead.

384
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,720
That fast?

385
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,360
- Mother!
- How is that possible?

386
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,900
He is back.

387
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,290
So soon?

388
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,010
She is the only one who tends to the herbs.

389
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,290
Looks like Physician Mo passed all his knowledge to this mute girl.

390
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,380
It's done.

391
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,220
Now hand over the Sunwarm Jade.

392
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:38,090
This is indeed the Ouyang family heirloom
from Lone Manor.

393
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,970
What's the meaning of this?

394
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,690
Trying to go back on your word?

395
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,110
No.

396
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,010
It's just that it happened so suddenly, we...

397
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,210
we weren't prepared at all.

398
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,730
Prepared for what?

399
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,010
We had an agreement.

400
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,140
I help you, you give me the jade.

401
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,940
How long do you need?

402
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,010
Ten days.

403
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,730
Ten days?

404
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,640
We originally estimated you and Ouyang Fei Tian would fight for ten days.

405
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,430
Those ten days were critical for us
to seize control

406
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,380
of the Lone Manor forces.

407
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,250
Who knew you'd kill him in just two hours?

408
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,010
You completely disrupted our plan.

409
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,360
That was way too fast.

410
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,080
You told me to kill Ouyang Fei Tian, but you never said how long.

411
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,060
Besides, you swore to me.

412
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,300
Right. We did make a vow.

413
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,100
We promised if you took care of Ouyang Fei Tian,

414
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,010
we'd give you the Sunwarm Jade.

415
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,170
But now what?

416
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,660
You call that taking care of it?

417
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,340
Exactly. One old problem is gone,
and now a new one shows up.

418
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,970
Now that Ouyang Fei Tian is dead,

419
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,850
not just the Jingjiao Sect, but all of Jiayuan City will be in chaos.

420
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,100
I even heard whispers that the Five-Color Sect will make a move tonight.

421
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,250
- The Five-Color Sect?
- Yes.

422
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,620
- Tonight?
- Yes.

423
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,970
If they take over Lone Manor, what about us?

424
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,730
Will we even survive?

425
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,010
- What now?
- What should we do?

426
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,580
Seems like you didn't just kill the Master,

427
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,010
you're also about to bring ruin to the Mo family!

428
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,690
We're widows and orphans here. What are we supposed to do?

429
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,880
- Yeah!
- What now?

430
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,480
- Tell us what we should do!
- What should we do?

431
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,970
Sounds to me like you're backing out!

432
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,690
We're not backing out!

433
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,120
Then, how do I get the jade?

434
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,632
You...

435
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,830
Stay.

436
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,730
That's impossible.

437
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,170
- Why not?
- Yeah!

438
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,380
The Sunwarm Jade
is the Mo family's heirloom treasure.

439
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,780
And we've made a deal.

440
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:55,350
Our family has three daughters, and they'll all marry you.

441
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,830
The Sunwarm Jade would be their dowry.

442
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,960
- All yours.
- No way!

443
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,240
- Everything yours.
- I'm going to become an immortal!

444
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,720
Our daughters are the pride of Jiayuan City.

445
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,690
The Three Beauties of the Mo family!

446
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,250
Trust me, people are lining up
just to marry into this family.

447
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,970
- Exactly.
- You're scoring big here, you know?

448
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,510
You even get the Sunwarm Jade!

449
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,030
- Don't be ungrateful.
- It's all yours!

450
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,780
- So lucky.
- Seriously.

451
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,970
- Don't run!
- You hit the jackpot!

452
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,900
- Right?
- Stop!

453
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,380
Are you all done? Now hear me out.

454
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,120
There's no way I'm staying.

455
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,060
Come up with something else.

456
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:28,029
There are still villains in the City.

457
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,900
I wonder where they hide the Sunwarm Jade.

458
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,490
If the three of us will marry Li...

459
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,510
-   If I snatch it by force,they might destroy it.
- Yeah.

460
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,690
-  That'd be trouble.
- You little rascal.

461
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,690
Just say it. Do you agree or not?

462
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,920
If they're all bad guys, then I'm just saving the people.

463
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,010
But I can't let them keep dragging this out.

464
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,970
It's you.

465
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,670
Can you hear me?

466
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,340
This book contains essentials
of medicines written by your father.

467
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,790
Aside from the Fragrance Pellet formula,

468
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,490
I've also added my own notes.

469
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,420
I hope it'll help you.

470
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,400
No need.

471
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,300
This belongs to the Mo family.

472
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,490
I'm returning it to its rightful owner.

473
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,660
Of all in the Mo family, only she seems decent.

474
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,900
Quiet and well-behaved.

475
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,910
Looks like she has
inherited Physician Mo's medical skills.

476
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,960
Too bad she can't speak.

477
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,980
Young Master Han.

478
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:23,190
Young Master Han. Have some tea before you go.

479
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,800
Never mind.

480
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,880
That's a good idea.

481
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,040
This man is nicknamed Black Bear. He's the top contender

482
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,310
for the next Sect Leader of the Five-Color Sect.

483
00:32:57,312 --> 00:32:59,310
He rose through the ranks
by pillaging and killing.

484
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,890
He even kills the elderly and children.

485
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:04,400
Taking him out
means removing a threat to the Mo Family.

486
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,240
It rids the people of a menace.

487
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,590
Once it's done, I'll hand over the Sunwarm Jade with both hands.

488
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,040
We give you our word.

489
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,300
So, you're Black Bear.

490
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,560
Sounds like you really are rotten to the core.

491
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:23,380
Who are you calling Black Bear?

492
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,650
He did it again.

493
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,318
He really killed Black Bear.

494
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:39,730
So what do we do now?

495
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,010
Are we seriously going to let him
marry all three of our daughters?

496
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,930
And give him the Sunwarm Jade too?

497
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:50,000
No way. If he leaves,
we'll be four helpless widows.

498
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,960
Besides, we still have so many enemies.

499
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,030
That's why we must do whatever it takes to make him stay.

500
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,350
Why is it so quiet?

501
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,180
No one is here.

502
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:12,010
Don't tell me they ran off to avoid paying up.

503
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,590
Young Master Han, we were just looking for you.

504
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,070
- Weren't you all out?
- We've been waiting here for you.

505
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,480
- Come.
- What for?

506
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,680
Measurements for new clothes!

507
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,070
- Haven't had time to wash your old ones.
- What?

508
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,640
- You've killed two villains.
- What?

509
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,720
- We'll wash them for you.
- No, no need!

510
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,920
Ladies, you don't have to.

511
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,060
From now on, we'll take care of all your laundry.

512
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,019
No need!

513
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:39,010
You've killed two, your clothes must be filthy!

514
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,340
I'm great at sewing.

515
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,340
From now on, I'll make all your clothes.

516
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,820
- Never mind.
- Just help us out this once.

517
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,780
Don't tell me you want me to get revenge again?

518
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,930
That's right.

519
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:50,770
Guihua Alley. Old Master Wu.

520
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,120
How do you have so many enemies?

521
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,880
I'm not going.

522
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,670
Han Li!

523
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,590
No. I can't delay any longer.

524
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:54,820
Here. Have a bowl of herbal tea.

525
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,610
It'll cool you down.

526
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,180
Sir! You're finally back!

527
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,780
Jiayuan City has been in chaos lately.

528
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,010
Ouyang Fei Tian, Black Bear,

529
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,030
and even the Mo Family's
future son-in-law are dead.

530
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,180
- Where's my friend?
- Don't even ask about him.

531
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,260
He is lovesick.

532
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,880
He has been moping day and night.

533
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,480
He does nothing but stand there.

534
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,740
He's ruining my business.

535
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,530
Qu Hun.

536
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,690
Let's go.

537
00:36:39,476 --> 00:36:40,700
There's no time.

538
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,400
If they try to stop us again, I won't hold back.

539
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,590
Why did you bring someone along?

540
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,310
He's backup.

541
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,570
Look, aren't you misunderstanding us?

542
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,380
What? You really think
we'd try to cheat you?

543
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,960
You know best.

544
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,150
I did everything Physician Mo asked in the letter.

545
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,410
As promised, hand over the Sunwarm Jade now.

546
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,110
Don't worry.

547
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,980
You all, hurry and bring the jade here.

548
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,450
Young Master Han, word has been going around

549
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:39,450
that the Mo family
has gained a son-in-law with thunderous means.

550
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,930
Really, we couldn't be happier.

551
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,930
At last, we have someone to rely on.

552
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,390
- Look...
- Spare me the excuses.

553
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,710
Look.

554
00:37:50,794 --> 00:37:52,900
Turn around and take a look.

555
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,090
The dowries are all here.

556
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:06,090
The first chest
is filled with priceless gold and jewels.

557
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,900
In the future, the earnings
from all our secret ventures

558
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,900
will be yours to manage entirely.

559
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,180
The second chest
holds our Mo family's ancestral medical compendium

560
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,590
and the keys to the clinic storeroom.

561
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,590
The third chest contains
all the weapon manuals from the Jingjiao Sect,

562
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:26,410
along with the Sect Master Token
to rally the masses.

563
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,552
You're trying to use these to keep me here?

564
00:38:33,552 --> 00:38:36,932
And also our three daughters.

565
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:42,260
And also the four of us.

566
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,610
We all want to leave too.

567
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,220
Don't forget me.

568
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:49,300
We all want to go with you, together.

569
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,670
Take us with you. Let's run away together.

570
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,820
Who said I'm taking you along?

571
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,340
Let me be clear.

572
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,860
None of those three will ever be my wife.

573
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,895
The four of you are not coming with me!

574
00:39:00,895 --> 00:39:03,376
Young Master, take me with you.

575
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:04,901
Go back.

576
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:06,562
All I want is the Sunwarm Jade!

577
00:39:06,562 --> 00:39:09,180
Why... Why don't you want me?

578
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,180
Are the Three Beauties not good enough for you?

579
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,090
Where did you get the confidence?

580
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,450
I'm one of the four Han heirs!

581
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,860
If I say no, it's no. Don't even try to persuade me!

582
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,610
What are we supposed to do
without a man in the house?

583
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:28,940
I know what the ladies are really up to with all this crying.

584
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,260
- Stop crying.
-  With Father gone,

585
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,010
those eying the Mo family fortune
will surely strike.

586
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,480
- Stop crying.
-  The ladies just want to keep this cultivator here...

587
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,950
- Stop crying!
-  To protect us.

588
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,050
As for marrying us off
and giving him the Sunwarm Jade,

589
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,150
they never meant to follow through.

590
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:44,260
I just hope Li doesn't fall for it.

591
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:54,500
Keep this up and I'll burn this place to the ground.

592
00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:05,360
So there's really no room to talk?

593
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,130
None at all.

594
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,570
The Sunwarm Jade.

595
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,590
Hand it over now.

596
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,460
No more talking. Attack!

597
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,000
You've been poisoned by Silver Demon Palm.

598
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,570
You don't have long left.

599
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,520
Once that poison sets in, not only can you not cultivate,

600
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,880
you won't live much longer.

601
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,860
If I die, you're coming with me!

602
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,880
Stay here, and no one has to die.

603
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,380
The Sunwarm Jade, now! Are you handing it over or not?

604
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,550
No!

605
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,920
We're dead either way.

606
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,392
If you've got the guts, kill me.

607
00:40:46,392 --> 00:40:47,306
Kill us all.

608
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:48,660
- Kill us!
- Go ahead!

609
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,820
- Kill every one of us!
- Kill us!

610
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,710
Do it!

611
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,300
- Kill us!
- Kill us!

612
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,490
- Go on!
- Kill us!

613
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,910
- Kill!
- The poison's taking effect.

614
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,260
You can talk?

615
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,340
Kill us!

616
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,490
- Hurry!
- Quick!

617
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,220
- Hurry!
- Sleeping drug?

618
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,090
Hurry!

619

00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:37,316
♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫

622
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:44,400
♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫

623
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,740
♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫

624
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,380
♫ Old scenes rise again ♫

625
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,600
♫ Too hard to forget ♫

626
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,485
♫ Easier just to miss ♫

627
00:41:58,485 --> 00:42:04,180
♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫

628
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:10,725
♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫

629
00:42:10,725 --> 00:42:14,460
♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫

630
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,860
♫ Swept away by time ♫

631
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,980
♫ Eyes once looked far ♫

632
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,405
♫ Now lost in the shift ♫

633
00:42:24,405 --> 00:42:27,626
♫ Autumn winds stir ♫

634
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:30,200
♫ Smoke curls once more ♫

635
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,140
♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫

636
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,100
♫ Returning to my eyes ♫

637
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,680
♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫

638
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,436
♫ Time lost its name ♫

639
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,777
♫ Was it yesterday ♫

640
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:50,998
♫ Or tomorrow? ♫

641
00:42:50,998 --> 00:42:54,539
♫ The world has changed ♫

642
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,840
♫ Beyond recall ♫

643
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,740
♫ Time will fade ♫

644
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,905
♫ All the words ever spoken ♫

645
00:43:03,905 --> 00:43:07,675
♫ Only this longing remains ♫

646
00:43:07,675 --> 00:43:13,780
♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫

647
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:20,612
♫  In a fleeting moment we call eternity  ♫

648
00:43:20,612 --> 00:43:31,512
♫  In a fleeting moment called eternity  ♫
