1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,600
I'm ordinary, I'm not good at fighting, the world is full of love

2
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,400
I'm ordinary, I'm a man of honor, I'm a man of good will, I'm a man of good will

3
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,320
bitch

4
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
What should we do with the two people in the Yellow Wind Valley?

5
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,800
Brother Lv, calm down.

6
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
The two people in the Yellow Wind Valley are in danger.

7
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
If we can find them,

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
we can kill them.

9
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Xun.

10
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Xun.

11
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Xun.

12
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Xun.

13
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Xun.

14
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Xun.

15
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Xun.

16
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Xun.

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Xun.

18
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Xun, what's wrong?

19
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Xun.

20
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Brother Wu.

21
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Hurry.

22
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Brother Han.

23
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
What's wrong with Han Li?

24
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Hurry and save Brother Han.

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Where is he?

26
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Xun.

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Xun, what's wrong?

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Everyone.

29
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Xun just escaped from Yanjia Fort.

30
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I want to send him back to the Yellow Wind Valley immediately.

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Hurry and go.

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Let's go save Brother Han.

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Xun.

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
It's better.

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Go back.

36
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I'm afraid we'll meet the evil path.

37
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Let's just go around.

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Go.

39
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Go.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Go.

41
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Go.

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Go.

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Go.

44
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Go.

45
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Go.

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Go.

47
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Go.

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Go.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Go.

50
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Go.

51
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Go.

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Go.

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Go.

54
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Go.

55
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Go.

56
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Hurry and go.

57
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Two seniors.

58
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Didn't we go to save Brother Han?

59
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Why did you turn around?

60
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Junior Chen.

61
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
According to the rumors of the senior,

62
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
there is a mine near Yanjia Fort.

63
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
We can't let him fall into the hands of the evil path.

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
The gate orders us to go and get it.

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Han Li, why are you here?

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Why is he here too?

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Senior Chen.

68
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
This brother is also from the Yellow Wind Valley.

69
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I am Lingshou Mountain, Lü Tian Meng.

70
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Lü Tian Meng.

71
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Yan Yue Sect, Xuan Yue.

72
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
I am Han Li from the Yellow Wind Valley.

73
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I just escaped from Yanjia Fort.

74
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Junior Han, are you okay?

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
I feel like you're badly injured.

76
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
We can't let anyone else know

77
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
that we turned around on the way.

78
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
We must keep this person.

79
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
I have the same idea.

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
What's going on with these two people?

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
It's strange.

82
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Junior Han can escape from Yanjia Fort

83
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
and build his stronghold.

84
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
We are ordered by the seven sects

85
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
to carry out the task.

86
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
The situation is urgent.

87
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Why don't you go with us?

88
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
It's good to have a care.

89
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Senior Xuan.

90
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Since Junior Han is injured,

91
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
why don't you let him go back to the valley first?

92
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
We can complete the rest of the task.

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Junior Chen.

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
The army ordered

95
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
all the disciples of the assistant machine

96
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
to be assigned to the task.

97
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Lü Xiong has the command of the army.

98
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
It can prove that.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
I hope that Junior Han can help us.

100
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Don't refuse.

101
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Look at this.

102
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
If I don't go,

103
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
I'm sure I'll be charged with something.

104
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Please.

105
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
I can't help it.

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
I can't take a step.

107
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Han Li is ordered.

108
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I'll go with you.

109
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Senior Chen.

110
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
What's going on with these two brothers?

111
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
We were ordered

112
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
to check the map of Yanjia Fort.

113
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
But they changed their route.

114
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
They said they received a message

115
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
asking us to go to the Lin's Mine.

116
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Lin's Mine?

117
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Yanjia Fort is surrounded by the county.

118
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Only we can fight it down

119
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
and defend it.

120
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
We can't let them go.

121
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
We can't let them go.

122
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Only we can fight it down

123
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
and defend it.

124
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Why are you here?

125
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
You can't go to Yanjia Fort

126
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
alone to save people.

127
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
No need.

128
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I can do it alone.

129
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
The war is coming.

130
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
You need to go to the front line

131
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
to host the big show.

132
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
I don't know how many people

133
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
came to the devil's road this time.

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
I heard that it was that person who led the team.

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm going because of that person.

136
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
That person is the devil's road.

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Xuan.

138
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Come back.

139
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Master.

140
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Master.

141
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Uncle.

142
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Master Yanjia has joined the devil's road.

143
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
To cover me from the evil,

144
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Brother Han is still fighting against the devil's road.

145
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
You go to save him.

146
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Otherwise, it will be too late.

147
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Okay.

148
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
I got it.

149
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Here. Eat this first.

150
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Hurry.

151
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
He is in danger now.

152
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
You go.

153
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Go.

154
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Come.

155
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Wu Xuan.

156
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm here.

157
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Take good care of your little sister.

158
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Without your uncle's permission,

159
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
you can't let her go out of the valley.

160
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Why are you still standing there?

161
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
She just bled.

162
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Do you think she will have

163
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
such luck in the future?

164
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Yes, master.

165
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Help me.

166
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Okay.

167
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Xuan is finally safe.

168
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
But your little apprentice...

169
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
I asked Liu Jing to search for the old man.

170
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
This brat is smart.

171
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Since he can escort Xuan out,

172
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
he must have escaped from me.

173
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
That's the best.

174
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
If he can come back safely this time,

175
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
I should reward him

176
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
for being my uncle.

177
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
But now,

178
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
I'm afraid that Xuan's identity will be exposed.

179
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
What if I meet that person?

180
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Don't worry, Senior Sister.

181
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I'm here with you and your junior.

182
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
I won't let anyone hurt you.

183
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Don't rush into my face.

184
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Don't forget that

185
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
you can't even beat me.

186
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Look at you.

187
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Okay, don't worry.

188
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
The war is important now.

189
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
We have to go up there

190
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
and we can't let the evil path succeed.

191
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
That's right.

192
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
It's here.

193
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
It seems that the guards here

194
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
are both mortals and low-ranking soldiers.

195
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
It's almost night.

196
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
We can't delay it.

197
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
While the evil path is not ready,

198
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
we must capture the children quickly.

199
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Senior Brother Lv, Junior Sister Chen, and Junior Brother An,

200
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
the four of us who are helping the machine

201
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
are going to fight the enemy.

202
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Is there any problem?

203
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Come on, come on, come on.

204
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Junior, drink, drink.

205
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Come on.

206
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Come on, come on, come on.

207
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Come on, come on, come on.

208
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Come on, come on, come on.

209
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Take it.

210
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Take it.

211
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Come on, come on, come on.

212
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Brother, are you okay?

213
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm fine.

214
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600

I'm fine.

300
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Good and miserable

301
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Fight your Strength

302
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Who will defeat this?

303
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,520
You can't demo

304
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
This road ends

305
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:03,800
The An 사람이

306
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,600
Don't worry

307
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
It's Yesterday

308
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
.

309
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
It's mine

312
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Do it especially

313
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
In the head

314
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
As the Ceivers Generally

315
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Don't be Blade

316
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Though there'll be hatred

317
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I won't budge

318
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,600
The thing is

319
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600

338
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm the best.

339
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
I'm the best.

340
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
I'm the best.

341
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600

I'm the best.

345
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm the best.

346
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I'm the best.

347
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I'm the best.

348
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Senior Brother Lv.

349
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Junior Brother Han,

350
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
you're quite good at fighting.

351
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Senior Brother is here again.

352
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
I'm just a little lucky to defeat the enemy.

353
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
You can leave the battle of Yanjia Fort completely.

354
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
You're not a lowly person.

355
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
You must take good care of yourself in the future.

356
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
What?

357
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
We finally took it down smoothly.

358
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
According to the order of our faction,

359
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
we will use the death as a strong point

360
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
and wait for the reinforcements to come.

361
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Then, Junior Sister Chen, Junior Brother Han,

362
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
the defense is left to you.

363
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Brother Lv and I will go around and look around

364
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Do you have any chance to escape?

365
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Okay. Let's go.

366
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Where are they going?

367
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Let's go.

368
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Zhong Wu, I'm here.

369
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
I'm here. What can I do for you?

370
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Where is my wife?

371
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
The latest news.

372
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
My wife has arrived at the six sect's territory this morning.

373
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Li Fei Yu?

374
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Haven't you found him?

375
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
The Marquis has come to report.

376
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,600
But he hasn't found the Huangfeng disciples who are escaping.

377
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
The Marquis has come to report.

378
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
But he found the seven sect's cultivators.

379
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
They went to the southwest direction.

380
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Southwest?

381
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Isn't that Yanjia Bao's territory?

382
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Why did those fools go there?

383
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Let's go find them.

384
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Go find them.

385
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Young Master!

386
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
There's nothing there.

387
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
It's all big rocks and empty mines.

388
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Are you sure you want to go there?

389
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Go. Go. Go.

390
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Just take a look.

391
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
You're a bad man.

392
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
You're a bad man.

393
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Stop talking nonsense.

394
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Go and contact our local people.

395
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Find out what these fools are up to.

396
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
You're right.

397
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
There's a temporary mine there.

398
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,600
I'll go and tell them.

399
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Temporary mine?

400
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Temporary mine.

401
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Let's go and take a look.

402
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
The Yanjia Bao and the Yuezong disciples' trade

403
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
was run by Young Master.

404
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Now they're relying on the devil.

405
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,600
We know these tricks.

406
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
But the Huangfeng disciples

407
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
look ordinary and clean.

408
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
They're really amazing.

409
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
They're really amazing.

410
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
They're really amazing.

411
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
They're really amazing.

412
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
They're really amazing.

413
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
They're really amazing.

414
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
It's really amazing.

415
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
So what?

416
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,600
We have the order of our sect.

417
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
No matter if it's elite or useless,

418
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
we have to obey your order.

419
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
But these snacks,

420
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
I think they're forbidden.

421
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
I'm afraid we have to remove them

422
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
to make it easier to enter the Chudai.

423
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,600
So we have to hurry up.

424
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
I heard that Brother Lv

425
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
is quite knowledgeable about forbidden magic.

426
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I'll leave it to you.

427
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Brother Xuan is really good at it.

428
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Then before these

429
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
little devils come,

430
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
we'll do whatever we can.

431
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
But we have to say this.

432
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
This time,

433
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
we'll be the best.

434
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
I won't treat you badly.

435
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,600
I'll listen to you.

436
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Hahaha.

437
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I just said it's bad.

438
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
The defense of the formation is also ready.

439
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Looks like Senior Sister Chen

440
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,360
I'm from a family with a reputation.

441
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Uncle Chen.

442
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,040
The formation is almost ready.

443
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,280
We've prepared enough snacks.

444
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,880
There won't be any mistakes.

445
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,560
The disciples are also alerted.

446
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,520
You go first.

447
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,760
I'll come to you later.

448
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,440
Go.

449
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,280
Chen,

450
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,080
you've worked hard.

451
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,800
Here...

452
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,640
Han,

453
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,960
it's great that you're fine.

454
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,200
How's your injury?

455
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,320
I'm fine.

456
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,440
Thank you for your concern.

457
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,960
Han Li is fine now.

458
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,400
That's good.

459
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,880
It's only been a few days.

460
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,960
Your fighting skills have improved.

461
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,560
You must have suffered a lot.

462
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,080
You're over thinking it.

463
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,720
It's just some moves that can't be done.

464
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,600
By the way,

465
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,080
what about the two seniors at the top?

466
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,680
Do you know

467
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,920
why does Yanzi's always manage to

468
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,020
insanely よ прив多 anymore with

469
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,080
Lv estás pésirly and Herrn Again ?

470
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,560
What?

471
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,420
unexpected normalies in future

472
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,200
yu's king

473
00:19:48,600 --> 00:20:00,340
Because of the

474
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,680
young king's perfect

475
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,460
mosaic

476
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,460
Although there is a defense formation here,

477
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,460
it's far from enough for the Mou Dao Army and the Jiedan masters.

478
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,460
If there's a mistake,

479
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,460
we'll be at the edge of the abyss.

480
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
You're right.

481
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,460
The priority is not only to improve the defense formation,

482
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,460
but also to ask the two senior brothers who will be assisting later

483
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,460
to come up with a plan.

484
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,460
You're right.

485
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,460
Let's split up.

486
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,460
Senior Sister is here to prepare the defense formation.

487
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,460
I'll go find them.

488
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,460
Master Qin!

489
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,460
Master Qin!

490
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,460
I'd like to ask you for your advice on the four killing strategies.

491
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,460
This mine is really complicated.

492
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,460
I don't know where they lead to.

493
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,460
I'll go find them.

494
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,460
I'll go find them.

495
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,460
There's something wrong with the patrol.

496
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,460
Find a place to prepare for it.

497
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,460
I'll go find them.

498
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,460
This place is quiet.

499
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,460
It's perfect.

500
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,460
I've prepared the ambushes.

501
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,460
Let's go.

502
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,460
Where did you get this?

503
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,460
You find out how it happened in the order of Pallant aquiatum

504
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:42,580
It has been found in the

505
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,460
trap mantener's secret lair.

506
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,460
We can use it as a trap.

507
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,620
This is the most zona,

508
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,460
it's the square in front of Grand Superintendent Employee's Museum.

509
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,460
Except for that research team.

510
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,460
It's the incentive team's business.

511
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,460
There's no need to wait for traces if you completely forget it.

512
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,460
Understand?

513
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,460
Good start.

514
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
That seems to be it.

515
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,380
Done.

516
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,480
Like this

517
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,680
It seems the only problem is a lateness

518
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,340
Don't think too much about what I'm doing.

519
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:35,760
You are,"

520
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,140
how can that beNever mind.

521
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,100
A Night job can boost your jeżeli.

522
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,380
With my current power

523
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,580
and the K mata

524
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,260
I can fight against the shoots of the main move.

525
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,460
["The

527
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,900
This does not account for the human mind and focus in daha results of the aforementioned use of power.

528
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,900
Even in the danger.

529
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,060
Tell me.

530
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,900
Who is Boss Luo of Small cousin?'

531
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,580
He is our fromage.

532
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,300
We use to work together long time ago.

533
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,340
I think he is strange.

534
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,900
He set us up and left us.

535
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,020
Yes...

536
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,020
Young Master!

537
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,020
Young Master!

538
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,020
Young Master!

539
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
Young Master!

540
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
This is bad!

541
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
The mine...

542
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,020
The mine was bombed!

543
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
Who?

544
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,020
The people from the Qi Sect!

545
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,020
The Qi Sect?

546
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,020
They know me?

547
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,020
The distance is similar.

548
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,020
Could it be you?

549
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,020
Li Fei Yun!

550
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,020
The Demon Sect's evil spirit is really everywhere.

551
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,020
This place is not good for waiting.

552
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,020
Young Master!

553
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,020
Young Master!

554
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,020
It's not good for waiting.

555
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,020
I hope Senior Sister Chen can see it.

556
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,020
Prepare yourself.

557
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,020
The fire at the Jingshi Firm in the Huangfeng Valley?

558
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,020
You still have time to play football but you're lucky.

559
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,020
The fools of the Huangfeng Valley

560
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,020
will die for me.

561
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,020
Send an advance!

562
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,020
Why is it the fire at the Jingshi Firm in the Huangfeng Valley?

563
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,020
Look!

564
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,020
The fire at the Jingshi Firm!

565
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,020
This is a trap!

566
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,020
Everyone!

567
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,020
Put the spirit-shark into the trap!

568
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,020
The Qi Sect will protect the trap!

569
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,020
Commander!

570
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,020
Sister Chen, I'm here to collect the spirit stones.

571
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,020
Is this the signal you sent?

572
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,020
Is the spirit stone enough for the magic?

573
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,020
I've sent people to search for a lot of them.

574
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,020
But this mine is big, and there are still a few empty places.

575
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,020
How long can we search? It depends on how big the town is.

576
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,020
At least half of them. It's a good thing we didn't empty the weapons.

577
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,020
Brothers of the Sword-gathering Sect,

578
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,020
you guys are the ones who are searching for the spirit stones.

579
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,020
The rest of you, continue to charge the magic.

580
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,020
Yes!

581
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,020
The spirit stones are here.

582
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,020
This magic array is too weak.

583
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,240
And the whole place is full of low-level

584
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,020
And the whole place is full of low-level

585
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,020
The two brothers haven't returned yet, have they?

586
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,020
The two brothers haven't returned yet, have they?

587
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,020
I haven't seen them either.

588
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,020
There must be something fishy.

589
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
Sister Chen,

590
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,020
it's the same battle. I advise you.

591
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,020
At this critical moment, others can't point it out.

592
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,020
If we can't do anything about it,

593
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,020
we can't go back to the mine.

594
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,020
There may be some chance of survival.

595
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,020
At this critical moment, we can save you.

596
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
I'll go find them.

597
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
You have to be careful, Junior Brother.

598
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,020
No one in the whole sect knows that I'm a person.

599
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,020
Don't worry. I won't treat you badly.

600
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,020
Bad news!

601
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
There's a warning signal from the Huanfeng Valley!

602
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,020
The evil Tao! The evil Tao is here!

603
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,020
What are you waiting for?

604
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,020
Keep going!

605
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,020
It's too late.

606
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,020
At this time...

607
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,020
Brother Xun,

608
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,020
what do you think we should do?

609
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,020
It's up to you.

610
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,020
If the main force of the evil Tao comes,

611
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,020
we can't stop them with our formation.

612
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,020
But if we withdraw them,

613
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,020
the formation will be destroyed.

614
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,020
So we have to wait here.

615
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,020
Yes.

616
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,020
You're right.

617
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,020
We sent you and me out

618
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,020
to find out the enemy's situation.

619
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
As for where the spiritual stones went,

620
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
no one will care about it.

621
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,020
The Qi Sect won't.

622
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
The evil Tao won't.

623
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,020
The Yanjia Bao won't either.

624
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,020
But the cultivation of the other sects

625
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,020
is a little troublesome.

626
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Brother Li,

627
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,020
the court is in chaos.

628
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,020
But we won't go to the defense.

629
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,020
So we'll let Chen Qiaoqian of the Huanfeng Valley

630
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,020
go alone.

631
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,020
It's hard to cause trouble.

632
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,020
I have an idea.

633
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,020
You and I will send two people

634
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,020
to cover up here.

635
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,020
So that no one will talk about it.

636
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,020
Okay.

637
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,020
Xiao Liu, Xiao Qi.

638
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,020
Lan Yan, Lan Rong.

639
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,020
Listen to my order.

640
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,020
Now,

641
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:56,720
the

642
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
Yes.

643
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,020
Tell Chen Qiaoqian

644
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,020
that we'll be there soon.

645
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,020
Yes.

646
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,020
You,

647
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,020
go and put on the mask.

648
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,020
Yes.

649
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
Hurry up.

650
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,020
Yes.

651
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,020
Even the Four Murder Faction is open.

652
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,020
It seems that we're right.

653
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,020
It seems that we're right.

654
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,020
Even the Four Murder Faction is open.

655
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,020
Li Fei Yu, you little rascal.

656
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,020
I finally caught you.

657
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,020
Let's see how I kill you.

658
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,020
Qiao Ran,

659
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,020
open this shell for me.

660
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
Come on.

661
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,020
Open the shell of Young Master.

662
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,020
Open the shell for me.

663
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,020
Open the shell for me.

664
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,020
Open the shell for me.

665
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,020
Open the shell for me.

666
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
Open the shell for me.

667
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,020
Open the shell for me.

668
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,020
Open the shell for me.

669
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
Open the shell for me.

670
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,020
Open the shell for me.

671
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,020
Open the shell for me.

672
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,020
Open the shell for me.

673
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,020
Open the shell for me.

674
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,020
Open the shell for me.

675
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,020
Open the shell for me.

676
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,020
Open the shell for me.

677
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
Open the shell for me.

678
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,020
Open the shell for me.

679
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,020
Hear my order,

680
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,020
this mine is connected to the surface of the battle field.

681
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,020
We can't let it backfire.

682
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,020
You two keep giving the magic array.

683
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,020
The rest of you, defend yourself.

684
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,020
Yes.

685
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,620
Quite slow.

686
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,560
Go, Tang Lu!

687
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,780
Go.

688
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,580
Don't move.

689
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,580
It's almost time.

690
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,380
Let's retreat.

691
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
It's too late.

692
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,100
Go. Go. Go.

693
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,300
Shaoze.

694
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,340
Shaoze.

695
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,100
We don't know how long it will take.

696
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,220
How about I go to the rear

697
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,620
and get some attack lines?

698
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,420
Stop the attack.

699
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,660
Stop the attack.

700
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,980
Stop the attack.

701
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,060
Stop the attack.

702
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,900
Stop.

703
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,300
Look.

704
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,660
The attack seems to have stopped.

705
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,020
It's a self-destructing battle.

706
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,780
Especially the usual magic can move.

707
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,260
Is this the great gift

708
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,660
left by Yan's family?

709
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,980
One stroke is a shield.

710
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,500
One stroke is a feather.

711
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,860
It's a waste of food.

712
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,220
Prepare the Qingyang Fire.

713
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,980
Shaoze, I didn't hear it wrong, right?

714
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,700
Qingyang Fire.

715
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,620
Shaoze.

716
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,460
The fire is so precious.

717
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,780
I don't know how to use it.

718
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,260
It's none of your business.

719
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,660
I'll go to the front.

720
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,500
I'll go to the back.

721
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
I'll go to the back.

722
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
I'll go to the back.

723
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
I'll go to the back.

724
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
I'll go to the back.

725
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
I'll go to the back.

726
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,500
I'll go to the back.

727
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,500
I'll go to the back.

728
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
I'll go to the back.

729
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
I'll go to the back.

730
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
I'll go to the back.

731
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,500
I'll go to the back.

732
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
I'll go to the back.

733
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
I'll go to the back.

734
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
I'll go to the back.

735
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
I'll go to the back.

736
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,500
I'll go to the back.

737
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,500
I'll go to the back.

738
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
I'll go to the back.

739
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
I'll go to the back.

740
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,500
I'll go to the back.

741
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
I'll go to the back.

742
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
I'll go to the back.

743
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
I'll go to the back.

744
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,500
I'll go to the back.

745
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
I'll go to the back.

746
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,500
I'll go to the back.

747
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
I'll go to the back.

748
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,500
I'll go to the back.

749
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
I'll go to the back.

750
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,500
I'll go to the back.

751
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
I'll go to the back.

752
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,500
I'll go to the back.

It's the Golden Snake Valley.

00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Go on.

793
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,500

Tang Soomin

802

Tang Soomin

803
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,900
No.

804
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,500
No.

805
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,180
No.

806
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,980
No.

807
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,820

No.

814
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,340
No.

00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:19,900
No.

817
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,700
No.

818
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,500

00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,340
No.

827
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,340
No.

828
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,340
No.

829
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,820
Where are Shen Yue and Li Tianmou?

830
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,060
Why are only you four here?

831
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,060
They are still moving things

832
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,060
in the Spiritual Master's Cave.

833
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,380
Uncle Shi, why don't you go back?

834
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,500
Continue attacking!

835
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,220
Inmmigration at critical time,

836
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,580
someone could be endangered.

837
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,620
You can retreat

838
00:37:50,620 --> 00:38:07,220
into the

839
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,300
hole saw,

840
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:52,520
Rapturous

841
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,760
Hurry f消idm it

842
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,500
Like this

843
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,880
Take off

844
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,040
Go

845
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,960
Go

846
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,140
Go

847
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,540
It seems that the ghost river can't last long

848
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,540
Go

849
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,700
Go around it

850
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,340
Where is the treasure?

851
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,140
We're almost there

852
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,060
It's here

853
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,860
It's so creepy

854
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,260
It seems that

855
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,020
it's not the first time they come here

856
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,540
Two intermediate and two intermediate

857
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,860
intermediate and intermediate

858
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,060
They're going to attack

859
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,420
If they know

860
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,980
I found their conspiracy

861
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,820
They will kill us

862
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,660
Please run

863
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,860
Uncle, it's three times

864
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,060
I'm afraid we can't hold on

865
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,260
What do you know?

866
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,300
The people below are the sharp fools of the Seven Sects

867
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,900
And Li Feiyu

868
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,340
He must die here today

869
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,820
Keep going

870
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,500
Do it

871
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:08,740
Wait.

872
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,660
Tell us!

873
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,300
Run!

874
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,340
I'm gonna hide down there.

875
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:11,820
Go.

876
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:12,900
Run!

877
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:14,340
It's hard to forget. It's better to forget.

878
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:20,340
It's said that the past is like a leaf.

879
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:27,020
Looking back, it's absurd.

880
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,340
The world is in chaos. Loneliness is in the books.

881
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,580
The regret is gone.

882
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:40,580
The past is like a leaf.

883
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:46,580
The wind rises and blows.

884
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:53,580
It's like a butterfly.

885
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:57,580
Looking back, it's absurd.

886
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:03,580
I've forgotten the past.

887
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,580
It's tomorrow.

888
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:13,580
The past is like a leaf.

889
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,580
The time will change.

890
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:20,580
All the wishes in the world

891
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:30,580
Only this longing has crossed a thousand years.

892
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:36,580
In the moment of life and death.

893
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:47,580
In the moment of life and death.
