Episode 16

6
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
I finally got you.

7
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
You want to escape from the battlefield?

8
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Si, stop it.

9
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Brother Han,

10
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
this is the medicine I got from the mission

11
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
I went out last time.

12
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Take it.

13
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Don't waste it.

14
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
You know it all.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Master trusts us the most.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,500
Here, take it.

17
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Si.

18
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Brother,

19
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,000
why don't you tell Master

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,500
that I can't find someone to play with

21
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
after sending me to go with you?

22
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
We haven't played the game yet.

23
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Now the war is on.

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
You want to escape from the battlefield?

25
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Who wants to escape from the battlefield?

26
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Brother Han,

27
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
I want to tell you something.

28
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
I heard that in the capital,

29
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
there is a new medicine shop.

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
It's called Mo Xiang Ju.

31
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
They sell all the perfumed spices for the pregnant woman.

32
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Go and burn some for sister.

33
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I've already prepared the man.

34
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Just buy as I want.

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Don't let Brother Liu know about it.

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
So lively.

37
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
This kid.

38
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Let's see how he will meet me when he gets on the boat.

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Since she doesn't want to see me,

40
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
then she will pretend to not know me

41
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
like what's said in the capital.

42
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
I will try to convince her.

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Brother Han.

44
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
I don't want to see her.

45
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
I don't want to see you.

46
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
I don't want to see you.

47
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
I only want to talk to you.

48
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
I will leave.

49
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
If you don't want to see me,

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
I'm not going to live.

51
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
I won't see you.

52
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
I'm not going to live.

53
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,360
I can't ask him

54
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,960
Guild media I'm on

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,640
What does this guy mean?

56
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,940
He didn't even say a word

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,700
Where're you going?

58
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,960
behind the wall

59
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,460
This time Grade 1

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,100
you're not even looking at me

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,800
I feel a g secretly huh

62
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,760
You are liberty

63
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,880
You Wedge

64
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,300
Explain

65
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,380
It is said that an auspicious holy trinket...

66
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,900
can make men happy easily.

67
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,580
If he became someone else's former car,

68
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,420
then, he would not have lived to date a former girl.

69
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,140
He would have been in the car since he met her at the end.

70
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,140
I'm not angry.

71
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,140
I'm not angry.

72
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,140
Who are you with?

73
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,140
Who are you buying rouge for?

74
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,140
What does it have to do with me?

75
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,140
You don't deserve it!

76
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,140
You don't deserve it!

77
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:49,800
Give me back my

78
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,140
Give me back my

79
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,020
I must forget him.

80
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,660
I must forget him.

81
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,900
I'll keep practicing.

82
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:08,980
Han Li.

83
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,380
I won't forgive you.

84
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,580
He shouldn't

85
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,020
really want to kill me, right?

86
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,100
Whew

87
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,420
It should be Yuanwu회

88
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,820
Just go and find Qingyun October

89
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,140
and the GT teacher of his back

90
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:32,840
Watch, envie mon

91
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,180
Childe Han

92
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,340
You aren't there yet

93
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,960
I have a task

94
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:47,980
I'est leaving

95
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,540
Don't bother ECak.

96
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,940
I'm your big hamster.

97
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,180
Here comes another specialty of yours.

98
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:03,780
Right.

99
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,900
There's one thing.

100
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,060
Take it to the parameters of North제멱.

101
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,220
What's this?

102
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,860
C але.

103
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,820
Why did you come here?

104
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,620
Shizu.

105
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,740
Houchao has jumped in the boat.

106
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,780
Jumped in the boat?

107
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,580
He must have gone to Yuanwu Country.

108
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,700
He didn't come to me.

109
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,820
He asked me to give this to you.

110
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,900
What?

111
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,700
This is a pill.

112
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,140
He said it's called Dingyan Pill.

113
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,580
Dingyan Pill?

114
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,900
What does it mean?

115
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
I still have things to deliver.

116
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,060
It's all my fault.

117
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,540
But I don't really want to leave.

118
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,420
Great.

119
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,300
Leave us.

120
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,500
Yes.

121
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,620
Wait.

122
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,140
Don't discuss it with anyone.

123
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,700
Especially Zhai Li.

124
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,180
I'm back.

125
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,020
Forget it.

126
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,740
Let's forgive you this time.

127
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,300
We don't have a good watch in the day-time.

128
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,220
Where are you going?

129
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,300
superior приз,

130
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,940
Guoyun Sword.

131
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,140
Fire Martial Arts

132
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,180
210.

133
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,660
Any more?

134
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,940
I'll give you 300.

135
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,780
300.

136
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,620
I'll give you 400.

137
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,340
400.

138
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,980
410.

139
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,060
Any more?

140
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,820
500.

141
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,860
510.

142
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,620
Any more?

143
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,380
They're different from the last auction.

144
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,180
They have the least chance to show off.

145
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,940
503.

146
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,980
Deal.

147
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,420
Congratulations.

148
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,740
Good.

149
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,100
Next, the next item.

150
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,900
The best pill.

151
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,220
Salt-resistant pill.

152
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,340
Two.

153
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,260
Salt-resistant pill.

154
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,540
I want one too.

155
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,900
This is the rare one from Hehuan Sect.

156
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,420
I want one too.

157
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,660
It's not common in the market.

158
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,180
Everyone knows it.

159
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,700
The starting price is 110.

160
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,140
This is good.

161
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,300
I want this.

162
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,340
I'll give you 130.

163
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,140
You're a man.

164
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,540
How dare you grab the salt-resistant pill from us?

165
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,500
You're so shameless.

166
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,500
150.

167
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,260
150.

168
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,700
250.

169
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,740
250.

170
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,300
300.

171
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,260
300.

172
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,980
500.

173
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,340
Is there any higher price?

174
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,340
Who said the cultivator is shameless?

175
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,660
The starting price of these two salt-resistant pills

176
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,620
is going to be the top.

177
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,660
503.

178
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,740
Deal.

179
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,500
Congratulations.

180
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,300
Great.

181
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,860
Please come to the trading office to get the treasure.

182
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,820
Ladies and gentlemen,

183
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,380
the next is the 28th item.

184
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,740
It's also the last one of this month.

185
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,620
The yellow-star juice.

186
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:44,940
How can it be so expensive?

187
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
It's a thousand-year-old.

188
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,260
Is it really a thousand-year-old?

189
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,380
It's not a starting price.

190
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,180
Isn't this the thousand-year-old yellow-star juice

191
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,740
I gave Wanbao House last time?

192
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,700
Is it the back-end boss of the auction

193
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:12,560
of the

194
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
gold-star juice?

195
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,480
Wait.

196
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
Qi Yunxiao?

197
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,040
I'm sure to get

198
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,880
the thousand-year-old yellow-star juice.

199
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,760
Don't make a mess here.

200
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,880
Get out of here.

201
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,720
Why is he here again?

202
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,880
He doesn't even learn a lesson.

203
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,360
This time,

204
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,920
he even doesn't pretend to be here.

205
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

206
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,600
I'm Qi Yunxiao,

207
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,480
a master of the pure Chinese.

208
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,120
I really need the thousand-year-old yellow-star juice

209
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,280
to cure and save people.

210
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,120
I'm willing to get two high-quality magic array

211
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,320
to get this thing.

212
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,280
Where did you come from?

213
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,440
You have two high-quality magic array.

214
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
I have eight more.

215
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,800
Get him out.

216
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,320
I'm here for...

217
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,440
Boss, don't make a mess.

218
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,240
I'm here.

219
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,280
Wait.

220
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,000
This young man,

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,120
you'd better come again next time.

222
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:56,800
Let's go.

223
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,680
Senior.

224
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,120
I'm here to cure and save people.

225
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,880
Senior.

226
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,560
He's a fat sheep who practices qi.

227
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:01,840
Senior.

228
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,000
He's a master of qi.

229
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,480
Let's go.

230
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,720
I'll pay four thousand.

231
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,160
Four thousand.

232
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,960
Cure and save people.

233
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,600
Four thousand.

234
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,960
Is there anyone who wants to add more?

235
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,600
I'll pay four thousand and five.

236
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,560
Four thousand and five.

237
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,520
Four thousand and eight.

238
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,440
Four thousand and eight.

239
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,680
Is there anyone who wants to add more?

240
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,080
Go.

241
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Uncle Yu Dao.

242
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,520
You're from the Fu family.

243
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,000
Since you know it,

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,600
you can't stay here

245
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,400
until you hand over the array.

246
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,040
You're my b чем?

247
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,560
Stop fighting.

248
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,440
How dare you!

249
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,320
Brother Han?

250
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,560
Yunxiang.

251
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,760
Ru Yi.

252
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,040
I was distracted and was targeted by the bad guys.

253
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
This woman...

254
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Han Xiong saved her.

255
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
She's the one she's thinking about.

256
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Han Xiong, please come in.

257
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
The spirit grass you used to seal

258
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
was the one Han Xiong gave us.

259
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,040
I heard Yun Xiao often mention you.

260
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,040
I'm very grateful to you for saving me.

261
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Han Xiong, please come in.

262
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Han Xiong, you may not know

263
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
that the two people just now

264
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,040
are the first Shis in Yuan Wu State.

265
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
They're from the Fu family.

266
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
It's hard to make a fuss about it.

267
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,040
I advise you to leave as soon as possible.

268
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
You started it to save me.

269
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
I'm afraid you'll cause trouble.

270
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,040
I've erased their traces just now.

271
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
I won't talk for long.

272
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
But I think you two

273
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
can find a quiet place

274
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,040
to live for a while and hide from the wind.

275
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Ru Yan, did you hear that?

276
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Han Xiong said

277
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
we should find a quiet place to live.

278
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,040
Yun Xiao, we haven't married yet.

279
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
By the way, Han Xiong,

280
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
with the help of Ru Yan,

281
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
the five-star town has been upgraded smoothly.

282
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Not only has the defense increased,

283
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,040
it also adds a fantasy that can hit the trapped area.

284
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
I'll go get it for you.

285
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Brother Qi, don't worry.

286
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
No hurry.

287
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
I'm glad that you're here.

288
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
No hurry.

289
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
I'm glad that you're here.

290
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
I'm here

291
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,040
to ask you to help me monitor the items.

292
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Delivery, stability, acceleration,

293
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,040
spiritual power transmission, and Zong Fu.

294
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
I didn't expect that the ancient transmission formation

295
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
in this transmission really exists.

296
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
This formation

297
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
can only be used to help the spiritual power

298
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
and the transmission of the ten thousand miles.

299
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
It seems that it needs to be

300
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
accompanied by a big slave's order

301
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,040
to be able to resist the chaos.

302
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
Looking at the spiritual power of Mr. Han,

303
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
the big slave's order is not difficult for you.

304
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
It's just a pity that

305
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
this formation is not complete.

306
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
It's broken.

307
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm afraid it won't be useful.

308
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
I'm afraid it won't be useful.

309
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
I don't know if you're sure

310
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
to repair it.

311
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
This formation...

312
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
This formation is old-fashioned.

313
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
It's broken.

314
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
When it's repaired,

315
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
it needs a lot of high-end materials.

316
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
It's also designed with a secret method.

317
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Now,

318
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Ru Ying is sick.

319
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
I'm afraid she's not in a good mood.

320
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
I'm sorry that I can't help you.

321
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
If it's a cost problem,

322
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
don't worry.

323
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
I'll take responsibility.

324
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
I still have the thousand-year gold branch.

325
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
I can exchange it at a good price.

326
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Ru Yan,

327
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
your illness is cured.

328
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Let's agree to it.

329
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Brother Han, don't worry.

330
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
I'll find a way.

331
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
Yun Xiao,

332
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
my illness

333
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
is not a big deal.

334
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
My illness

335
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
is a natural cause of my illness.

336
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,040
The meridians will grow with the cultivation.

337
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
It's getting worse.

338
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
It's hard to know the key.

339
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,040
It's already a good fortune to be alive today.

340
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Why bother

341
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,040
to spoil Yun Xiao's mind

342
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,040
and Han Qian's spirit?

343
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Moreover,

344
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
I heard that there are many demons in the world.

345
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,040
Once the ancient ship is sent out,

346
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,040
it's inevitable that one person will be in danger.

347
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
It seems that this girl

348
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
is afraid that I'll keep the secret of the bird's nest

349
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
and kill the people.

350
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
It seems that

351
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
I have to eliminate her doubts.

352
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
You two,

353
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
I'm used to being idle.

354
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
I don't like to fight.

355
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Now the war is rampant.

356
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
The war is rampant.

357
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
It's not good for us to play in the mortal world.

358
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
This time,

359
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
it's also a coincidence.

360
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
I got the upper hand.

361
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,040
I got the ancient ship's map.

362
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
It means

363
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,040
I have to find a way out.

364
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Although I'm not talented,

365
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
I've learned some magic tricks.

366
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
It's said that

367
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
there are no such things as the great heaven and earth.

368
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
How can there be such things as the unknown?

369
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,040
But we haven't found it before we met.

370
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Miss Ru Ying,

371
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
you can't lose your confidence.

372
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Brother Han is right.

373
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
There are such magic tricks.

374
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
The world is big,

375
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
but we can't go anywhere.

376
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
Ru Ying,

377
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
don't say such silly things

378
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
like the key is the man.

379
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
With Brother Han and the magic,

380
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
there must be a way to cure you.

381
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Senior Han,

382
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
if that day really comes,

383
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
will you take us with you?

384
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
Of course.

385
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Speaking of this,

386
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
this is the first time I've been to the capital.

387
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
The cultivation world is not in the same place.

388
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
But it's still prosperous here.

389
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
I'm confused.

390
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
I just don't know

391
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
how to calm down

392
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
and how to be calm.

393
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,040
I'm afraid

394
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
I can't be with you.

395
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
I'm afraid

396
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
I don't know how long

397
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
this calmness can last.

398
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Grandpa, look.

399
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Sweet potatoes.

400
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Delicious sweet potatoes.

401
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Sweet potatoes.

402
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Sweet potatoes.

403
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Delicious sweet potatoes.

404
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
Miss Shen Qiang,

405
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
look.

406
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Go.

407
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Don't run.

408
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Slow down.

409
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Slow down.

410
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Go.

411
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Lian Qi Qi.

412
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Why can't he get the cultivation?

413
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
He's not good at cultivation.

414
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Did he use some kind of skill?

415
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Xiao Zhan,

416
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
I'm sorry for offending you.

417
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Please forgive me.

418
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Don't panic.

419
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Your magic is interesting.

420
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
I've recorded your breath.

421
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
When it's done,

422
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I'll come to you again.

423
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Come and have a look.

424
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
Old man,

425
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
do you know how to walk the Qin Pu?

426
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Thank you.

427
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
There are big buns in the hand.

428
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Let's go.

429
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Come on.

430
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Come on.

431
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
Xiao Zhan.

432
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Grandpa, what's wrong with you?

433
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
Did someone bully you?

434
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Come on.

435
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
What's wrong with you?

436
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
What are you doing?

437
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
You broke into the Qin Pu.

438
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Do you know your crime?

439
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Old man.

440
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Who is your old man?

441
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Young man,

442
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
I have something important to ask you.

443
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Please tell me.

444
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Our old man

445
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
is also a man you want to see.

446
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
It's our old man's name.

447
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Come with me.

448
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I'm here to see you.

449
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
I'm sorry for my rudeness.

450
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Please forgive me.

451
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Please come up.

452
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Come up.

453
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Don't be nervous.

454
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
As you said,

455
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,040
I'm here on your order.

456
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
I'll be here for a few days.

457
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
Thank you.

458
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm sorry.

459
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
I'm sorry.

460
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
I'm sorry.

461
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Thank you for your generosity.

462
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
I'm so honored.

463
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
My father said before he passed away,

464
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,040
when the Qin family was in the disaster,

465
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
you would help us.

466
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,040
I wonder if you came for this.

467
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Don't ask.

468
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
But I'm here

469
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
to save you

470
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
and get through this.

471
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
This?

472
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
In that case,

473
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
I'll risk my life

474
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,040
to save you.

475
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
You're indeed a powerful man.

476
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
You're more sensible than the family.

477
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
I'm here to help you.

478
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,040
I'm here to help you.

479
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Please rise.

480
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,040
I'm here to help you.

481
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
I should try my best.

482
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,040
But this is a secret.

483
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
You should not tell others.

484
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
In the future,

485
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,040
you and I will call each other Shu Chi.

486
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Shu Chi?

487
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
kowtow to a little fairy's life.

488
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
kowtow to a little fairy's life.

489
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,040
kowtow to a little fairy's life.

490
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Enough.

491
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Please sit down.

492
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
Now you and I

493
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
care about Shu Chi.

494
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Ok.

495
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Normally,

496
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
you know

497
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
to be a servant.

498
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,720
He really claimed to be

499
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,800
your old friend?

500
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,400
Yes.

501
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,920
I think he's here to cheat us.

502
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,520
Young Master and Madam,

503
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,880
we just observed in the hall.

504
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,520
Master was also a man of good character.

505
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,960
But after reading his letter,

506
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,000
he was so calm

507
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,760
and told all his servants

508
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,280
that he wanted to fight with him alone.

509
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,240
He's quite old.

510
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,000
How does he look like?

511
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,120
Tell me in detail.

512
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,280
Madam,

513
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,920
he looks plain and normal.

514
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,600
He's even a commoner.

515
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,880
I thought he was

516
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,000
a poor man who came to rebel.

517
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,560
But I've been following Master since I was a kid.

518
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,840
I've never seen Master

519
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,080
like this before.

520
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,320
Come on.

521
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,040
Master is being investigated by him?

522
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,840
Kill him.

523
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,720
Sir,

524
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,240
drive him out.

525
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,760
Madam,

526
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
I dare not.

527
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,880
Madam, wake up.

528
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,680
Madam, wake up.

529
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,960
You're still sleeping.

530
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,920
You're still sleeping.

531
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,920
Grandpa.

532
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,480
Go.

533
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,320
Get up.

534
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,640
ner Anne

535
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,320
WhoN ears he is

536
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,680
troubled the city

537
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,480
The place where the mark on the old man disappeared yesterday

538
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
is here.

539
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,680
The wave of spiritual power is still here.

540
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,480
It seems that it's only a matter of time.

541
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,080
Zan Xiu Sect,

542
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,880
welcome to your heaven.

543
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,680
Black Shark Sect.

544
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,880
The people here

545
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,680
are all the Seven Sects that you don't like.

546
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
Big Brother,

547
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,680
don't say anything.

548
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,680
Big Brother, what are you going to do?

549
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,880
It's not like you're going to sell your life for us.

550
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,680
We just want to tell you

551
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,680
that the so-called main plan

552
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,680
is a lie of the Seven Sects.

553
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,280
Without the main plan,

554
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,680
we can still break through the chain

555
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,080
and defeat the main plan.

556
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,280
I have something to tell you.

557
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,080
The leader of our Black Shark Sect

558
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,280
is also a secret master.

559
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
Soon,

560
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,280
we will break through the chain.

561
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Everything that the Seven Sects hide

562
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,280
is what our Black Shark Sect

563
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,880
gives to everyone.

564
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Now,

565
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,480
our Black Shark Sect

566
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,480
is willing to share the secret method with you

567
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,680
and cultivate the Da Dao together.

568
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
Big Brother,

569
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,280
listen to me.

570
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
What should we do?

571
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,280
Share the secret method.

572
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
What is this?

573
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Share the Da Dao together.

574
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
It's so scary.

575
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,480
Share the secret method.

576
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,680
We will cultivate the Da Dao together.

577
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,480
Share the secret method.

578
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,480
We will cultivate the Da Dao together.

579
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,280
Share the secret method.

580
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,280
We will cultivate the Da Dao together.

581
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
We're fine.

582
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Are you okay?

583
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
I'm fine.

584
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Brother.

585
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
How do you feel?

586
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,880
Brother, you will be fine.

587
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,480
I have nothing to do with your grandfather.

588
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,880
Big Brother,

589
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
save my grandfather.

590
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Let go. Let go.

591
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,680
As long as you can save my grandfather,

592
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,480
I can write this book

593
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,280
as a poem to you.

594
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,880
I...

595
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,480
I can even ride a horse.

596
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,480
I've told you

597
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
that I can't help you.

598
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Don't bother me anymore.

599
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Hurry up and go.

600
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,480
If you don't help me,

601
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,680
I'll tear it open for you.

602
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
If you don't help me,

603
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,480
then kill me.

604
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,280
Anyway, we are going to be

605
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:48,260
arrested for these

606
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,460
and I'll be arrested.

607
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,660
What do you think?

608
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,660
You're right.

609
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Now we are all

610
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,660
the servants of Dao.

611
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,260
We will never be

612
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,460
involved in these petty things.

613
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,260
If you didn't

614
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,260
see through our faces,

615
00:29:59,260 --> 00:29:59,860
how could my grandfather

616
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,060
go out in the middle of the night?

617
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,060
If I didn't,

618
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,460
I would do anything I wanted to do.

619
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,460
If I didn't...

620
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,860
What's the matter?

621
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,460
Young Master,

622
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,460
I heard that

623
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,860
there's something important to discuss.

624
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,860
Okay, I got it.

625
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,060
Wait.

626
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,260
I've wronged you.

627
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,460
You can talk to your mother

628
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,660
when you come back.

629
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,260
They were all taken away.

630
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,860
They weren't killed on the spot.

631
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,660
It seems that it's useful to keep them.

632
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,460
It's not easy to control so many

633
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,660
so they should be locked up separately

634
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,260
and in different places.

635
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,860
What did Qin Shu say?

636
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,860
Young Master,

637
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,660
the late Prince has sent a message

638
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,460
that Master values you.

639
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,660
He might want to take you to the banquet.

640
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,260
You'll know when you get there.

641
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,260
Greetings, Mr. Qin.

642
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,060
How are you, Steward Wang?

643
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,060
Thanks to your father.

644
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,060
Please.

645
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,660
Okay.

646
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,660
Qun Fei, sit here.

647
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,260
Han Li, sit here.

648
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,860
Young Master Han, please.

649
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,460
What a strange spiritual wave.

650
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,460
Is it a magic sword?

651
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,260
Young Master Qin, please.

652
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,860
The new king has arrived.

653
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,260
Today's banquet

654
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,860
is actually a great opportunity

655
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,260
to give to you.

656
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,460
Steward Wang, please.

657
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,060
So powerful.

658
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
garlic

659
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,660
garlic

660
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,460
When the fire- inconsistent feeling

661
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,060
places a plate wrapped in ducts.

662
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,060
вас

663
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,860
and fur,

664
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
they can be handled.

665
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,060
Not bad.

666
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,940
Bravo!

667
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,300
Good job!

668
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,940
Interesting.

669
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,380
Dear guests,

670
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,620
here is my lord's archetype

671
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,100
of a 먹을 cuz to a master.

672
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,340
Now, our lord

673
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,780
is passed over to his disciple...

674
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,900
Why is this

675
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,860
male friend a mere discussing device?

676
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,740
Since he was actually standing year-round,

677
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,580
his disciple steps into the enemy,

678
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,500
and teaches himself the Long structured attack method.

679
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,100
Dad,

680
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,900
dad,

681
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,980
get up!

682
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,700
He is indeed an unraveling spirit.

683
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,820
His cultivation is pretty good,

684
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,500
he won't be able to Georg schreiben in time.

685
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,300
Master mortals!

686
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,020
Master mortals,

687
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,660
Master, please forgive me.

688
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,860
Please forgive me.

689
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,860
Master, please forgive me.

690
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,860
Master, please forgive me.

691
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,060
It seems that other people

692
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,060
have no traces of spiritual power

693
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,060
except for this Steward Wang.

694
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Miss Mo,

695
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,300
why is she here?

696
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,420
My master,

697
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:25,580
did you do it

698
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,500
by yourself

699
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,420
about the incident annoyed last night?

700
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,020
Why did you have to show up?

701
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,460
By tutaj of the full Одama!

702
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:33,820
I wonder

703
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,780
what spell it's using.

704
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,660
Psyche's control is excellent!

705
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,180
Master was also involved in

706
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,980
some natural disasters

707
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,660
during his initial treachery,

708
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,420
and there was no problem with it.

709
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,060
This deceitful young thunder

710
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,220
will make the Master

711
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:47,340
have a hard time.

712
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,020
If he capture it,

713
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,940
our team

714
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,740
will have to perform our military service.

715
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,660
You're right, Master.

716
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,940
Yes, Lord Wu Fa.

717
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,500
I'll ask those five assholes to find out

718
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,020
if there are any three brothers around here.

719
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,780
Miss Mu,

720
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,500
why are you here?

721
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,220
Why are you here?

722
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,780
I'm here to find her.

723
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:47,740
You're following at the

724
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,740
I think it's the evil and the evil.

725
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,740
Not the real sect.

726
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,740
I should have known it.

727
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,740
He said those words.

728
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,740
And did those weird things.

729
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,740
Where did so many cultivators come from?

730
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,740
I met them all.

731
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,740
Miss Mo, it's dangerous here.

732
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,740
Go back before anyone finds you.

733
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,740
Don't come back.

734
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,740
Go back.

735
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,740
Brother Han.

736
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,740
I thought

737
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,740
I would never see you again.

738
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,740
Since we parted last time in Yanjia Castle.

739
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,740
Although you didn't say anything,

740
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,740
I know

741
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,740
we were destined not to be together.

742
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,740
Our lives are too short.

743
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,740
Like Zhaolu,

744
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,740
or Jishi.

745
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,740
All love and hatred will become a bubble.

746
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,740
But even with such a small life,

747
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,740
I still want to live.

748
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
Even if it's a bad life,

749
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,740
I will still go.

750
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,740
But you...

751
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,740
Brother Han.

752
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,740
All these years,

753
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,740
your appearance

754
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,740
hasn't changed at all.

755
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,740
Don't worry.

756
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,740
I won't kill him today.

757
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,740
I won't fight with him in the future.

758
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,740
I will be like you and father taught me.

759
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,740
Little by little,

760
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,740
find his flaws and trap him.

761
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,740
Until one day I can kill him.

762
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,740
No matter what method,

763
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:15,740
no matter how long it takes.

764
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,740
Brother Han.

765
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,740
Goodbye.

766
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,740
Brother Han.

767
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,740
Miss Mo.

768
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,740
If I don't let you investigate,

769
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,740
you won't listen, will you?

770
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,740
You...

771
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,740
Okay.

772
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,740
Do you know your crime?

773
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,740
I'm not only a master here.

774
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,740
Please forgive me.

775
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,740
Senior.

776
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,740
I'm new here.

777
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,740
I'm just a big guy.

778
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,740
I just know the offerings of those mortals.

779
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,740
I really don't know

780
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,740
what crime I committed.

781
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,740
Whether you committed a crime or not,

782
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,740
I'll tell you.

783
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,740
I just ask you.

784
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,740
You have to answer truthfully.

785
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,740
Yes.

786
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,740
Get up.

787
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,740
Thank you, Senior.

788
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,740
Thank you, Senior.

789
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,740
What's your name?

790
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,740
Where are you from?

791
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,740
Where did you get the skill of

792
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,740
empty fire

793
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,740
that you used in the hall?

794
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,740
I'm telling you.

795
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,740
I'm a nobody.

796
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,740
I have no family.

797
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,740
I'm just a layman.

798
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,740
I learned the skill of empty fire

799
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,740
from my teacher.

800
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,740
I summarized it.

801
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,740
It's just a trick.

802
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,740
I'm just a mortal.

803
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,740
I'm sorry for your loss.

804
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,740
If you like it,

805
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,740
I'm willing to

806
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,740
offer both hands.

807
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,740
It's smooth and smooth.

808
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,740
I've been fighting in the secular world all the time.

809
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,740
I'm good at human and human relations.

810
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,740
I've been there before.

811
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,740
It's better to miss you.

812
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:11,740
You always say that the past is like a night.

813
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:18,740
Looking back, it's absurd.

814
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,740
The sound of the flute, loneliness, and the books

815
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,740
bring back the regret.

816
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:31,740
The past is like a night.

817
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:37,740
The wind blows, the willows flutter.

818
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:44,740
It's like a butterfly in the night.

819
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,740
Looking back, it's absurd.

820
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:53,740
The past is like a night.

821
00:44:54,740 --> 00:45:00,740
The wind blows, the willows flutter.

822
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:06,740
It's like a butterfly in the night.

823
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:12,740
The wind blows, the willows flutter.

824
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:18,740
It's like a butterfly in the night.

825
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:24,740
In the moment of eternity.

826
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:31,740
In the moment of eternity.

827
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:53,740
