00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,422
This fictional drama is set in the 1990s and contains outdated language that may be deemed inappropriate today.

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,756
It's totally fine.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,473
I also did the same thing to Fujii-san...

4
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,228
But when its between guys...

5
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,030
it's only natural to be faced with rejection

6
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,080
I’m totally fine.

7
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,217
Whaaat!?
- I was so shocked!

8
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,596
Look, I work as a housekeeper for the Kirino family’s

9
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:58,975
and I saw Makoto and that rumored Futoshi-kun were together!

10
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,853
Makoto, that handsome kid, right?

11
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,148
And he’s with Futoshi?
- Again with that Futoshi?

12
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,817
I thought he was fooling around with that foreigner’s kid!?

13
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,403
And now he’s with that handsome kid too?

14
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:16,910
Wait!! Does that mean
Futoshi is two-timing those two boys!?

15
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,245
So it’s a love triangle?

16
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,789
Between boys?

17
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,800
It's already like that just from the sightings alone...

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,136
Who knows what they’re doing in private

19
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:39,182
This might be the most scandalous thing this town has ever seen.

20
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,725
Whaaat!?

21
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,103
Scandalous, right! Scandalous! It’s scandalous!

22
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,361

Penultimate episode

29
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,522
Alright, alright...

30
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,234
So, everyone, remember to maintain a disciplined routine...

31
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,569
Don’t slack too much, kay?

32
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,238
Hey, Takada, ya listening?
Geez.

33
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,241
Alright, everyone, have a fun summer break!

34
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,996
Mishima, let’s walk home together halfway.

35
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,135
So got any plans for summer break?

36
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:02,515
Hmm... probably help my mom in the fields,

37
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,226
or do house chores, I guess?
- Ohhh...

38
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,604
Then let’s go out whenever you’re free.
Just the two of us.

39
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:12,650
Yeah!
Oh, btw can I get your phone number?

40
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,320
Oh, we never exchanged numbers until now, right?

41
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,365
It’s kinda late, but you should give me yours too.
- Yeah!

42
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:23,161
I’ll give you mine.
I’m usually the one who picks up...

43
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,590
Sorry to keep ya waiting.
Here’s my Horumon itame (stir-fry innards).

44
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,967
Yay! My honey’s ‘Hormone’ itame,

45
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,345
I love it! Let’s eat!

46
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:43,014
It’s ‘Horumon,’ kay?
Haha!

47
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,350
Horumon itame
- Haha, exactly.

48
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,060
Horumon itame!
Hahaha

49
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,936
Sigh...

50
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:50,772
Why you sighing?

51
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,775
If anyone should be sighing, it’s me.

52
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,819
Your report card,
besides PE, everything is

53
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,529
either “C” or “D”

54
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,199
Hey, old hag,

55
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,203
what would you do
if I told you Im a homo?

56
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,916
“Homo”... “Ho”...

57
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,210
Dad.

58
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,170
I’ll put you in your place!

59
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,338
Eh~ Wait a second!
- Whoa!

60
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,673
I said "What if"!

61
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:19,050
No excuses! I won’t listen!

62
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,967
Whoa!

63
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,011
Shut it you two during meals!

64
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,388
But, you see...
- But, old hag...

65
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:26,766
Shut it! Seems like

66
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,768
both of you don’t want my Horumon!

67
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,146
Oh...

68
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,569
I really don’t wanna mention this but

69
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,863
It’s about Makoto...

70
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,949
Makoto?

71
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,617
What happened to my boy?

72
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,996
Uh, your boy is the talk of the town...

73
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:51,040
Yumeno-san!
- Ah~ Hello.

74
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,044
Hello~. Hehe.

75
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,464
Um~ What’s the matter?
- Uh... well, you see

76
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,425
Everyone was saying, you know...

77
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,513
What’s with the crowd?

78
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:09,225
You see, the whole town has been

79
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,227
talking about...

80
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,229
Everyone’s been talking about you guys.

81
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,274
My Ma said she saw you and Mishima embracing.

82
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,986
I heard Mishima and Kirino were kissing.

83
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,696
Of course, I don’t believe it.

84
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,032
No way!
Nobody told me!?

85
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:28,411
Am I the only one who haven’t heard it yet?

86
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,495
Is it true?

87
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,413
What’s the deal?

88
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,459
Don’t talk stupid shit!
What the fuck are you talkin?

89
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,505
Like there’s no way in hell that’s true!

90
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,216
Those old hags must’ve seen it wrong!

91
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,218
Right, Kirino?

92
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,596
Right.
That’s just a baseless rumors.

93
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:50,975
They must saw some illusions or something?

94
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,644
Blowing up rumors like that is seriously annoying.

95
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,355
Right? Haha.
- Yeah, seriously.

96
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,691
Fuckin unbelievable, right?
- Man, those hags got me.

97
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,069
Yow I was freaking out, I thought I was the only one who didn’t know.

98
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,780
Oy, oy let’s go!
Edogawa’s gonna get pissed again.

99
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,782
Let’s go!

100
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,920
Is it true?

101
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:29,013
I heard… that you were hugging this boy Mishima-kun.

102
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,724
Huh…

103
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:37,772
Tell me…

104
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,776
Does that mean you’re gay?

105
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,532
It’s not true.

106
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:50,534
It’s just a rumor.

107
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,456
So it’s true?

108
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,291
No, it’s not.

109
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,336
Huh...

110
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,004
Ugh…

111
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,715
I told you, it’s not true.

112
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:09,762
Oh… I see…

113
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,222
That's right.

114
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,766
Rumors are just...

115
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,811
things everyone enjoy exaggerating

116
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,522
and adding details to,

117
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,566
so we never really know the truth...

118
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,569
But then...

119
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:31,951
why did your expression has changed...

120
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,707
Is it true...

121
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:41,710
That you're a Homo?

122
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,133
Ahh!

123
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,844
No... No... Ahh!

124
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:55,516
No... No! Ugh... Ah...

125
00:07:55,516 --> 00:08:00,938
This... wasn't supposed to happen...

126
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,315
No! Ugh...

127
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:06,652
Why did I...

128
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,030
Why is it always me?

129
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,742
Ugh...

130
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:16,745
I shouldn't have...

131
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:19,790
gotten married!

132
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,503
I shouldn't have given birth to you!

133
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:27,506
Ah... ah...

134
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:30,509
Ugh...

135
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,933
Ahh... Ahh... Ahh...

136
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,686
Who’d spread rumors like that…

137
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:45,024
Well, that might be a rumor, but…

138
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,068
it’s true that you’re gay, right?

139
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:50,112
No… that’s not true.

140
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,739
Idiot.

141
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,450
Don’t take your mom for a fool.

142
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,829
Even if you try to hide it, you couldn’t hide it at all...

143
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:07,254
So? Your type of guy is...

144
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:11,967
Hmm… a hairy, macho guy?

145
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:14,345
What?

146
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,014
I can tell just by looking at you.

147
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:30,152
But… I…

148
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,155
I don’t plan to live my life as a gay person.

149
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,243
I’ll get married, have kids,

150
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,245
and stay here for good…

151
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:43,290
What!?

152
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,337
Maybe I raised him the wrong way, Dad…

153
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:52,382
Tsk...

154
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:54,051
Well ain’t this a good chance now?

155
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,844
Spill your guts and lets talk.

156
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,099
Spill your guts and talk about what?

157
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,476
I’ve already made up my mind.

158
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,728
You stupid little brat!

159
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,566
Well, you see…

160
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:14,530
I was waiting for you to open up and tell me someday.

161
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:22,663
What I want to hear is your true feelings.

162
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,707
I know you've came to that conclusion

163
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:27,584
after thinking it through a lot.

164
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:31,964
But was it for my sake?

165
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,800
No…it's not.

166
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,803
If you lie, you’ll have to swallow ten million needles, y’know?
(from jp children’s rhyme)

167
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,600
I thought that was the best choice that would bring happiness

168
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:46,728
to you,

169
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:49,273
and of course, and for me too.

170
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,276
Sigh...

171
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:59,366
You... really are such a brat...

172
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:04,413
Sigh...
Did I really messed up raising you?

173
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,791
Sorry...

174
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:12,170
I raised you to be strong and kind.

175
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,882
But...

176
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:18,885
You became too strong and too kind.

177
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:29,688
Listen.
There’s just the two of us!

178
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:33,025
We’re all each other have for a family!

179
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,736
But I am me.

180
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,738
And you are you.

181
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,114
Everyone has their own life.

182
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:46,830
Even if it's painful,
you have to follow your own path!

183
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,541
If this is the path you chose for my sake,

184
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:53,920
and you need to hold yourself back...

185
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,257
or give yourself up even just a little bit...

186
00:11:57,257 --> 00:12:03,347
if it means you can’t follow the path you truly want

187
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:10,062
then I’d feel so sad...

188
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:14,107
that would truly make me unhappy...

189
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,201
Im sure Dad up there would feel the same way.

190
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,295
Hey, Futoshi.

191
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:45,430
What is it that you really want?

192
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,434
Uh… Mom, I’m sorry…

193
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:56,858
Ugh… Thank you, Mom.

194
00:12:56,858 --> 00:13:01,613
Heh… That’s not an answer, y’ know.
Heh heh.

195
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:04,950
Ugh… Ugh…

196
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,327
I’m sorry, Mom…
Mmm…

197
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,996
Stop saying sorry.

198
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:12,374
No more apologizing!

199
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,377
Kay? Heh heh…

200
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,798
What the heck? Hmm?

201
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:23,844
Ugh… Geez... Heh heh.

202
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,805
Ugh… Ugh…

203
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,937
That night, for the first time in years, I slept next to Mom.

204
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:36,940
We talked a lot.

205
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,652
About my first love.

206
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:42,654
About when I secretly put on her lipstick.

207
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,742
About how I was bullied.

208
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:50,078
Tho mom sort of noticed that...

209
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,790
Mishima…

210
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,584
About Yumeno.

211
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,836
And about Kirino.

212
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,838
Whoa! Ah, ah, what…

213
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:06,595
I wonder if Kirino’s mother heard about the rumors?

214
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:14,311
Was he able to talk about it with her mother as well?

215
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:53,725
Coming...

216
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:57,062
Yes, Mishima here.

217
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,104
Mishima?

218
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,273
Kirino?

219
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:02,817
Yeah.

220
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:04,819
What’ya doing just now?

221
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:07,864
Just now?

222
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:10,867
I was cleaning. What's up?

223
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,869
Well, I...

224
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:17,957
I'm going to Shangri-La.

225
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:20,669
Huh? Wait, Shangri-La...?

226
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,671
You're going now?

227
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,383
Well, I mean, it is summer break, but...

228
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,385
What about basketball practice?

229
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,429
I don’t care anymore... I'm done with that.

230
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:35,475
I'm going to Shangri-La right now.

231
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:37,477
Kirino...

232
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:42,190
Where are you right now?

233
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:50,490
What's with all that stuff?
Ya running away from home?

234
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:57,539
Mom, I'm going to Shangri-La with Kirino.

235
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,250
To... what? Shangri-La?

236
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,253
Yeah. Is that okay?

237
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,465
Alright, have fun.

238
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:09,342
Huh? Really?

239
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:11,386
Regardless if I say yes or no...

240
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:13,304
You're young,

241
00:16:13,304 --> 00:16:16,766
so if you're going to take risks, do it head-on.

242
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:19,102
When I was a kid...

243
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:23,148
I’d always say, Im going on an adventure and did a lot of things.

244
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,817
Like playing tag with the police.

245
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:28,194
Hehe.
Hahaha.

246
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:30,196
But...

247
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:32,240
Don’t do anything too dangerous, kay?

248
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,909
If you die then there's no point in anything.

249
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:37,287
Yeah. I’m off.

250
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,289
Take care.

251
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:46,045
I hope you get to Shangri-La.

252
00:16:57,807 --> 00:17:00,852
Kirino~!

253
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,854
Mishima~!

254
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:05,899
You’re late! But I’m glad you came.

255
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,902
Sorry! I was waiting for Mom to come back.

256
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,371
Did your Mom…

257
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:22,373
heard about the rumors?

258
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:30,465
Did you talk… about it?

259
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:34,177
Yeah.

260
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,266
I see…

261
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:43,227
I see… I see.

262
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:48,983
That’s good.

263
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:50,985
Yeah.

264
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,364
Kirino, did your mom…

265
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:02,789
Alright, let's go to Shangri-La!

266
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:04,165
Wait, wait, wait!

267
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:06,167
Shangri-La as in Thailand, right?

268
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:10,546
What about passport? Money?

269
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:13,591
Oh… no, I…

270
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:17,595
I haven’t thought about that...

271
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:21,599
Shangri-La…
I just wanted to go to Shangri-La…

272
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,695
Tokyo…

273
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,196
Hey, Kirino!

274
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:37,782
Huh?
- Let’s go to Tokyo!

275
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:41,494
What… Tokyo?

276
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,541
I wanna go!

277
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:56,676
Our boy, Futoshi
is going to Shangri-La with his friend.

278
00:18:56,676 --> 00:19:00,680
I wonder where their Shangri-la is.

279
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,183
(Shangri-la = an imaginary paradise on earth)

280
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,770
Ah~…

281
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,774
Crap... I should have gave him some money.

282
00:19:13,526 --> 00:19:17,905
That said, how are we gonna get there? Tokyo.

283
00:19:17,905 --> 00:19:21,909
Yeah... not by a plane, right?

284
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:24,954
Maybe by Shinkansen?
- Anyway...

285
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:29,333
We'll transfer to a station where there is a Shinkansen...

286
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:34,046
Ah...
It's gonna be impossible to get there by today.

287
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:37,049
Yeah. We have to stay somewhere.

288
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:41,471
Ah!
Huh?

289
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:45,850
I... brought all my money, just in case.

290
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,185
Oh wow!

291
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,187
Me too...

292
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:53,566
I brought my bankbook.
- Oh nice!

293
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:59,614
But I've never withdrawn money myself...

294
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:16,839
Amazing! This is so fun!
Hahaha!

295
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:19,884
Yay!
Yay! Hahaha!

296
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:47,161
You still good?
- Ahh this is so hard!

297
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:48,955
Ma'am!

298
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,877
What is it, Fumi?
Could you be a little quieter?

299
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:58,923
Makoto hasn’t come back yet.

300
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:00,633
What are you talking about?
He has practice, right?

301
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:04,971
Actually, when I went to his room just now, his bag

302
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:06,973
and his practice clothes were left behind...

303
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,105
Hey, Taro-chan.
- Huh?

304
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:17,441
Hah... What is it, old hag?

305
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:21,487
Well, the other day,
you asked me, right?

306
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:24,198
If...
- Ah, that was... no...

307
00:21:24,198 --> 00:21:27,201
You’re wrong...
- Im wrong?

308
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:33,916
So, you didn’t like
Futoshi-kun from the Mishima’s?

309
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,960
Huh?

310
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,964
You heard the rumors?
- Hehe, that’s right.

311
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:48,097
That’s right... you’re wrong.

312
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:51,809
I’m not a homo...

313
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:55,146
Sure, I did liked Mishima...

314
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:57,189
But I...

315
00:21:57,189 --> 00:22:01,235
I liked him as ‘Mishima’

316
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:04,238
not him as a boy,

317
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:06,949
so you’re wrong...

318
00:22:06,949 --> 00:22:11,328
Huh? But "like" as in

319
00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:14,331
love, right?

320
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:16,333
"Love," well, that...

321
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:20,004
Maybe...

322
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:24,425
Oh, how wasteful.

323
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:28,262
Because to fall in love with someone,
regardless if they’re a boy or girl

324
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:31,515
is quite an amazing thing, right?

325
00:22:31,515 --> 00:22:34,560
But...

326
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,563
you’re wrong.

327
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:40,608
I see.

328
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:43,319
But if

329
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,988
that’s the case with you

330
00:22:45,988 --> 00:22:49,700
then I think it can't be helped.

331
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,747
But you can't say
that having feelings of love is wrong!

332
00:22:54,747 --> 00:22:56,749
So that’s why you’re feeling down these days.

333
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:05,841
You know when you call me an ‘old hag’

334
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:08,886
I get so annoyed that I want to sink you in a well sometimes,

335
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:13,682
but the truth is, I know you’re just an awkward but

336
00:23:13,682 --> 00:23:18,312
kind and pure-hearted boy.

337
00:23:18,312 --> 00:23:22,024
Well being pure and stupid are two sides of the same coin.

338
00:23:22,024 --> 00:23:25,027
Hehe, hehe.

339
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:29,114
Right now, your feelings for Mishima-kun

340
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:32,117
are kind of left hanging, right?

341
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:39,875
I wonder where those feelings will take you.
