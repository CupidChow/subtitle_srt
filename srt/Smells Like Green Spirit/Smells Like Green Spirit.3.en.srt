00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:30,238
This fictional drama is set in the 1990s and contains outdated language that may be deemed inappropriate today.

2
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,584
Tada! Mascara!

3
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,919
Whoa, where'd you get that?

4
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,796
I took it from my mom's dresser.

5
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,506
Let me try! Let me try!

6
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,508
Hold it! I go first!

7
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:56,890
So, what do you like about Edogawa-sensei?

8
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,266
Hmm... Well, for me...

9
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,644
First, it's his body hair, right?
- I get it! I get it!

10
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,647
And also, um...

11
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,691
His tight ass.

12
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:13,781
I know, right! That ass is super sexy.

13
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:19,579
Wait... all you’ve talk about is his body...

14
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,248
You look all innocent, but you have a pretty dirty mind.

15
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,251
Dirty?
Really?

16
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,296
But...

17
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,674
When I'm doing it myself

18
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,385
I often imagine it with Edogawa-sensei.

19
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,388
Wait... "when you're doing it yourself"!?

20
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,766
"You do what with who...?”
Seriously?!

21
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:45,146
Huh? c’mon you never imagine it with Edogawa-sensei?

22
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,859
Ah... I have...

23
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:55,240
And several times actually...
Haha.

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,243
Lately, I can't even do it unless it's with Edogawa-sensei.

25
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,375
Even when I'm with a girl, I close my eyes

26
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:10,421
and think about Edogawa-sensei...

27
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:15,802
Heh, is that so?

28
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,514
Huh!? What!
Kirino you’ve done it with a girl!?

29
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,183
Ah, yeah, that's right.
But

30
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,561
There’s a big gap between girls and Edogawa-sensei.

31
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,897
Hehe, that was crazy.
- No, not that!

32
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,942
That's not what I meant.

33
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,278
Ah… I see.

34
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,990
I’ve dated a girl, for just a short time tho.

35
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,993
Eh… Did you like her?
That girl?

36
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:48,084
Yeah… At that time,
I thought I really liked her.

37
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,794
So I felt really relieved.

38
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,839
Like,
“Geez, I’m straight after all.”

39
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,884
I thought that if I do it with this girl,
my world would completely change.

40
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,267
“Completely”…

41
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,645
Yeah…
Yeah, right.

42
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,689
It would change, right?

43
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,358
Hehe…

44
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,693
But it didn’t.

45
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,740
It was the opposite.

46
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,744
It only confirmed that I’m gay.

47
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,876
Then right after that, I puked.

48
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:43,598
Araki Towa

49
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,435
Sono Shunta

50
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:51,189
Fujimoto Kodai

51
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,984
Sakai Wakana

52
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,031
Abe Alan

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:17,089

00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,134
episode 03

55
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,722
You felt so sick, that you throw up...

56
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:31,479
The act didn’t really feel bad… it just felt wrong.

57
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,482
And then we broke up right away.

58
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:41,239
I'm sure I hurt her a lot.

59
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,617
But earlier, you said, you liked her.

60
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,663
I liked her face.

61
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,665
It was the type of face I wanted to have.

62
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,711
That’s all it was, now that I think about it.

63
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,425
I see...

64
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:04,804
Oh no! My eyelashes look like Hijiki seaweed!
Look!

65
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,516
You're right! They do!
- Take it off!

66
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,893
Take it off!
- How would I know?!

67
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,854
(Hijiki seaweed)

68
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:17,942
Ugh! Cough cough... Huh...

69
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,319
Mom, your cold’s not gone yet?

70
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,323
No, no. Almost choke on a grain of rice.

71
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:28,369
Cough cough! Thanks.

72
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,371
Ahem, ahem...

73
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,793
Ahem, ahem... Oh...

74
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,508
Heh. Crap, I’m late.

75
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,219
Ahem, ahem...

76
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,887
Thanks for making breakfast.

77
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:50,474
You always make lunch for me even though I told you it's fine.

78
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,268
Just let me make you a bento at least.

79
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,478
I'm actually looking forward to it.

80
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:55,938
If that's the case, then it's fine.

81
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,360
Haaa... Hmm, hmm.
- Mom...

82
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,405
What did you like about Dad?

83
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:08,451
Why you asking so sudden in the morning?
- His face?

84
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,829
His face, but also...

85
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,831
Everything.
Everything?

86
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,878
He’s super handsome, and...

87
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:23,924
he was strong, and kind...

88
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:26,969
but above all...

89
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:31,015
he left you with me.

90
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,683
Hehe...

91
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:36,729
Even now, I still love your dad.

92
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,733
And I’m sure he’ll always be the one for me.

93
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,821
Alright! Thanks for the meal.

94
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:49,533
Ah, I’ll do it.
- Really?

95
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:53,579
Yeah.
- Thanks. Hehe.

96
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,581
Sigh...

97
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,626
Ah, today...
I might be a little late.

98
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,295
Yeah.
- After the factory...

99
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,005
I’ll go straight to the field,
then to the roadside station...

100
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,757
to deliver the edamame.

101
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,384
Don’t overdo it, okay?

102
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:10,054
I get it, I get it! Hehe.

103
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,097
I'm off!
- Take care.

104
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:58,185
To Mishima-kun, I’ll be waiting for you after school behind the school building.

105
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:02,147
Is this really for me, Fujii-san?

106
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:03,607
Of course, it is. That letter,...

107
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:05,609
I wrote it

108
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:08,654
Ohh come on!
What did you think it was?

109
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,656
Ah, I thought it was a prank...

110
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,367
Because, it mentioned Fujii-san,

111
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,369
the cutest girl in the school.

112
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,414
“The only girl who can rival my look.”

113
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:22,126
Thanks.
Mishima-kun, you got a haircut recently, right?

114
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:26,839
Not long ago,
I thought you were gross and scary like sadako...

115
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,884
But now I see, you're actually really pretty!

116
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:33,887
Sadako? Gross?

117
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:38,267
I’m not really good with cool guys.

118
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:42,313
You know, a lot of cool guys are kind of insensitive.

119
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:47,318
Mishima-kun, you’re cute and kind of girly.....

120
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,405
"She’s so cute..."

121
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,407
"But it's a shame..."

122
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,120
"The mascara on her lashes is a bit clumpy."

123
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:05,544
"And she overdone it with the lip gloss..."

124
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,546
"Perhaps more like..."

125
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,591
Mishima-kun?
Hey, are you listening, Mishima-kun?

126
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,969
Uh... yeah, I'm listening, I'm listening.

127
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:18,015
As I was saying, go out with me.

128
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,018
What!?

129
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:28,067
“If I sleep with her, my world will completely change.”

130
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:32,488
My world will completely...

131
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:52,341
Ah, yeah.

132
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,343
Hehehe! I’m so happy! Hahaha.

133
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:59,973
I’m so happy! Hahaha.
Then...

134
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:05,437
Let’s go home together today. Hahaha.

135
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:14,571
Hmm!

136
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:17,950
He treated me horribly. He look so cool, though...

137
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,285
What are you doing, Yumeno?
- What!?

138
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:23,288
Hide and seek?
- Huh? No...

139
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:31,713
Heh...

140
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,554
“Wow... Fujii-san's room is super cute."

141
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,182
"Everything I like is all here."

142
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:49,064
This teddy bear is so cute!

143
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:55,445
Oh... your room is really nice.
- Hehehe.

144
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,868
Mom and Dad will be home late today because of work.

145
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,286
Is that so?

146
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,913
My dad is a prefectural assembly member, and

147
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:07,958
my mom is the PTA chairwoman.

148
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,628
Heh...
- So today...

149
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:14,006
we can take our time...

150
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,008
Hehehe.
- Huh?

151
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,724
Mishima-kun, I like you.

152
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,812
Ah... Thank you.

153
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:33,525
Hehe, how about you?

154
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:36,528
Do you like me?

155
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:42,618
Rinka?
- Ah...

156
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,621
“Crap, what's the right answer in this situation”

157
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:51,668
“I really like her face”

158
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:55,756
Yeah, I like you.

159
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,757
Hey! Wait?!  Wait?!

160
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,760
Huh? Huh? What!?

161
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,851
Ah... but

162
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:10,562
I’m totally fine.

163
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:14,274
I can totally do this...

164
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,792
My world is completely changing...

165
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:36,171
My world is completely...

166
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:38,131
Ah, Fujii...

167
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:52,312
What are you doing?

168
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:54,314
Go strip too.

169
00:12:57,692 --> 00:12:59,694
I see... I see.

170
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,058
Mishima-kun, this is my first time.

171
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:32,060
So...

172
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,729
Please be gentle.

173
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:38,733
And... here. Use this.

174
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:51,580
Ugh!
Mishima-kun?

175
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,957
Blegh!
- Huh? Mishima-kun!?

176
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:59,170
You’re the worst! Get out!

177
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,511
Huh? You puked too?
- Yeah.

178
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:10,515
And it was before...
- Before you did it?

179
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:17,230
I also felt that something was wrong.

180
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,607
You’re worse than me.

181
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,277
I feel bad for Fuji-san...

182
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:24,988
Fuji!? Fuji as in that Fuji? From our class?

183
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,990
Yeah, that's right. Fuji.

184
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,035
No way!
- What? What happened?

185
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,413
My ex was also Fuji!

186
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:35,415
What!?

187
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:39,461
but she said it was her first time.

188
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,464
She told me the same thing.

189
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,178
Sigh...
What?

190
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,224
I don't get it...

191
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:07,739
Hmm, is Uekusa-sensei living in a farm?

192
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,783
He’s the second son, so he doesn’t have to inherit it,

193
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,785
but he always tries to emphasize that.

194
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,787
Hahaha

195
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:23,588
So do you have a girlfriend in Tokyo?

196
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:28,259
What? What’s with this good atmosphere here?

197
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:30,303
So, are you two on a date today? Hahaha!

198
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,638
Come on now, don't disturb the young ones.

199
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,015
What’s with you?
- Yes. Um...

200
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:38,061
I was just talking with Sawada-sensei about how it feels lonely being just the two of us.

201
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:39,396
- Oh my oh my...
- Huh? Huh?

202
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,440
She’s sulking, isn’t she? Hahaha.
- Wait a sec...

203
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,820
is Yanagida-sensei single?

204
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,822
- Single?
- Exactly!

205
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,993
Don’t you have a girlfriend?
- Hahaha

206
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:55,537
No I don’t have a girlfiend.

207
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,913
Woahhh! Then

208
00:15:56,913 --> 00:15:58,581
isn’t that just perfect?
- Perfect?

209
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:01,292
Sawada-sensei has also been single for a while now.

210
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:02,669
What are you talking about?!

211
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:06,673
Yanagida-sensei, why don’t you go out with Sawada-sensei?

212
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:09,342
Whoo! Whoo! Clap clap clap...

213
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:13,388
No, no, she’s way too good for someone like me.

214
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:16,099
That’s not true. Right...?

215
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:20,103
Okay, okay, okay...
Let’s go, gentlemen.

216
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:21,479
Let’s go drink over there.

217
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:24,482
but we’re having a good conversation...

218
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,610
By the way, Yanagida-chan.
- Yes?

219
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,573
I’ve also been single for a long time.

220
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,199
Really?

221
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,661
Come on, Mama, that’s enough!
Hahaha.

222
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,846
You know... I’ve actually been

223
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:57,849
feeling a bit tired of work lately.

224
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:03,605
But ever since you came to our school

225
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:08,985
I feel like my world has changed.

226
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:10,987
I’ve started looking forward to coming to school.

227
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:21,122
I think I’ve started to like you,

228
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:24,125
Yanagida-sensei.

229
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:48,566
My world didn’t change at all...

230
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:54,322
Will my world stay the same forever?

231
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:56,991
Ah, that’s hot!

232
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,993
Geez!

233
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,415
What’s wrong? Futoshi.
- Whoa! You surprised me.

234
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,417
Got something on your mind?

235
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:13,174
Yeah…

236
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:17,887
Um, Mom…

237
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:22,266
What should I do if I really hurt someone?

238
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,310
Huh?

239
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,270
Hmm… hmm.

240
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,120
Well, you have to apologize.

241
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:46,165
That’s true.

242
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:51,212
Yeah.

243
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:53,214
That’s right.

244
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:07,061
Oh!

245
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:09,397
Um… uh…

246
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:11,774
Sorry bout the other day.

247
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:14,694
Huh? What? What?

248
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:18,823
Ah... I really made you upset.

249
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,867
I think I hurt you real bad...

250
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,536
Can you not misunderstand?
- Huh?

251
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:26,581
Why would I be hurt?

252
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:29,584
I’m not interested in you anymore.

253
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:33,629
Ah, yeah.
- Well then, I'm going now.

254
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:35,631
See you later. Hehe.

255
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:53,858
What ya’ lookin at? Move it!

256
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:56,861
Ah!
- Ah, sorry! I went a bit too far.

257
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,619
Mishima?

258
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:06,579
Yumeno...

259
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:09,665
Do you like me?

260
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:11,375
Huh?

261
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,045
No way! That can’t be true!

262
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:17,048
Don’t touch me!
You... homo freak!

263
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:21,093
Ouch...

264
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:29,560
Globalization creates convenience

265
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,564
but widens the gap between rich and poor countries.
- One body.

266
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:36,609
International cooperation is necessary...
- Two bodies.

267
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:37,568
Three bodies.

268
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:41,656
As the number of foreigners grows in Japan

269
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:49,080
We are seeking a society where people respect cultural differences and coexist with each other.

270
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,082
Does anyone have any questions so far?

271
00:21:13,312 --> 00:21:16,315
Huh!? Again?

272
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:33,833
What’s up Mishima?

273
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:39,171
Last summer, I secretly took a picture of Edogawa-sensei.

274
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:42,216
I really don’t want to give it to you,
but it's special.

275
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:45,219
I hope this helps you feel a little better.

276
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:52,017
Pshhh!

277
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:01,777
Thanks, Kirino!

278
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:08,534
Come on, please, please!

279
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:12,913
Just for a moment,
could you take off your glasses?

280
00:22:12,913 --> 00:22:15,916
Huh... If I take off my glasses,

281
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,960
I can't see at all...

282
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,963
Just for a bit. Okay?

283
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:29,388
Ah~! Machida-san, you’re so pretty!

284
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:33,768
Come on, let’s go home together. Okay? Hehe.

285
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:47,573
Ah~...
