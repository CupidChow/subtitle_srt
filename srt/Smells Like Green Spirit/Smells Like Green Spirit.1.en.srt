Mishima!

00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,650
(Kirino Makoto)
Wait! Hey, stop!

4
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,406
Stop!
(Takada) Yumeno, catch him quickly!

5
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,075
(Mishima Futoshi) Let me go!
(Yumeno) Huh? What are you saying, you freak?

6
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:21,372
We finally caught you,
no way we’re letting you go. Hey.

7
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,882
Wait, seriously? You’re really gonna do it?

8
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,592
Wait, what do we do? Seriously?

9
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,303
Hey, are we really doing this?

10
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,306
Really? Seriously?

11
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,645
- Haha!
- Ahhh!

12
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,398
Say bye-bye to your gross long hair, freak!
Whoa!

13
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:51,110
You seriously cut it off! Haha!

14
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,488
No! Don’t…

15
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,490
If you cut any more...

16
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:03,581
Good job growing it this long,

17
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,919
it’s so gross!
- Cut more, Yumeno!

18
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,923
If you cut it any more...

19
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,265

episode 01

26
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,523
(Sensei) "Confidently." Right? Yeah.

27
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,655
"Mishima-kun? Mishima-kun!"

28
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,159
What?

29
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:26,539
What do you mean “What?” you long haired freak,
sensei is calling you!

30
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,332
Sorry.

31
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:32,628
You're always daydreaming. That's not good.

32
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,964
Well, but Yumeno, calling your friend...

33
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,008
'long-haired freak' is a bit much, don't you think?

34
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,011
Huh? I'm not even friends with this freak.

35
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,389
Besides, isn't Mishima’s long hair gross?

36
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,557
- Totally gross.

37
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,852
Guys shouldn't have hair like this.

38
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:51,189
Hey, freak go shave your head!

39
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:55,193
If you don't want to shave it then wear the girls' uniform instead!

40
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,528
Ok, ok enough already...

41
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,239
Sensei!
- Yes, what is it?

42
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,618
Mishima keeps staring at me with a longing look...

43
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,621
...and it's making me uncomfortable.
- What?!

44
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:11,000
Huh? That’s so creepy...

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,044
Alright, let's end today's class here.

46
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,092
(Fujii)
Why?

47
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:21,135
Fujii-san...

48
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,471
You’re always staring out the window,

49
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,474
even during class. Why?

50
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,852
Is there something out there?

51
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,944
- Dead bodies...
- Huh?

52
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,322
Look, those mountains over there.

53
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,324
There could be bodies buried...

54
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:47,036
...that haven't been discovered yet.

55
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:51,082
One body... two bodies...

56
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,751
- What?
- Hey, Fujii-san!...

57
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,795
Is this creepy long-haired freak really your type?

58
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,796
No way...

59
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,840
But, even though he might be a creepy long-haired guy...

60
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,843
If you look closely, his hair is actually pretty. Heheh.

61
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:04,845
Ew! Eugghhh...

62
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,935
"Pretty"...

63
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,785
For a guy, you're acting all delicate.

64
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:32,164
Guys like you piss me off the most in this world!

65
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:35,501
I hate those dead fish eyes of yours too!

66
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,877
"Dead fish eyes"... Haha!

67
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:39,880
Hey, freak! Why don't you flop around like a dead fish!

68
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,591
Ahh~ Flop, flop, flop, flop!

69
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:44,593
Flop, flop, flop, flop, flop!
Wait, but if it's dead

70
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:47,638
It can't flop, right?
Haha! Oh man, that's crazy! Haha!

71
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,348
Move aside.
Ah, let's go!

72
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,018
Go for it!!!

73
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,020
Ohhh... Hey!

74
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,109
Even you...

75
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,111
You've got dead fish eyes too.

76
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,155
Speak louder!
I can't hear what you're saying!

77
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,824
You keep glancing at guys, huh?

78
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:10,536
You must be a HOMO!

79
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,871
Ho no ji no ho! Ho no ji no ho! Ho! Ho! (homo chant)

80
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:22,965
Ho no ji no ho! Ho no ji no ho! Ho! Ho!

81
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,051
(Yanagida) Go ahead.

82
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,055
Thank you so much. It was scary patrolling the school building alone.

83
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,098
No problem. Just ask me anytime.

84
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:34,435
I'm really glad you started working here, sensei.

85
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,146
You see,
There's no other teacher close to my age,

86
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,148
so it's hard to ask for things like this.

87
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,192
Bang! Oh!

88
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:48,574
You’re a Ho no ji no ho! Ho no ji no ho! Ho! Ho!

89
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,284
Hey!
Don’t fall asleep on us

90
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,287
Horumon Mishima~!
Is someone still here?

91
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,290
Oh crap.
There’s still a sensei around?

92
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,377
You know what’s going to happen, right?

93
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,806
It’s pitch dark, Yanagida-sensei.

94
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,564
(Sensei) Ah, you guys!
What are you doing here this late?

95
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:21,899
Club activities finished a long time ago, right?

96
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,611
Sorry.
We didn’t feel like going home yet

97
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,655
- We were just playing around, right?
- That's right

98
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,990
- We were just playing.
- What do you mean just playing?

99
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,492
You guys...

100
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:36,831
Oh, we were just talking about various things regarding the future of the basketball club.

101
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,082
Sorry for causing you concern.

102
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,125
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,796
Oh... Oh, really?

104
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:48,175
Well, if Kirino says so...

105
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:50,719
- Just be careful from now on.
- Yes!

106
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:51,887
Thank you very much.

107
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:55,558
Come on, hurry up and go home.
Your family will worry about you.

108
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:09,738
Well then, shall we head home too?

109
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:11,740
How about dinner as a thank you for today...?

110
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,786
Ah...

111
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,831
Ahh, that was close!
That was really close!

112
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,834
- It really was close, huh?
- Yeah, for real.

113
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,877
After this, wanna go to that place?

114
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:25,879
- What place?
- Yamashita Cement, of course.

115
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,923
Ahh, sounds good!
That's a good idea, good idea!

116
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:29,925
- Do you think we’ll see them there?
- Sorry, I'm heading home first.

117
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,927
- Huh?
- Huh?

118
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,689
Mishima!
you're not in the basketball club.

119
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,820
Are you okay?
Shall I walk you home?

120
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,822
No, I'm fine.

121
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:56,535
If you're ever in trouble,
I'm always here to listen.

122
00:08:56,535 --> 00:09:00,247
Thank you. But really, I'm fine.

123
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:02,207
Ok.

124
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,010
"Mmm~ mmm~ mmm~..."

125
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,388
"Hehehehe... Hehehehe..."

126
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,390
As I thought, there they are. At this time,

127
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,392
I knew they'd definitely be here.

128
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,815
(Guy) "Hmm! So cute!"
(Girl) "Ah~!"

129
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:29,860
"And you're so cool too!
Mmm~ thank you."

130
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,862
"So cute!"

131
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,908
Ahaha...

132
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,951
Shhh.
Be quiet...

133
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,667
Hey, it would've been nice if Kirino is here too.

134
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,377
He probably made it on time.
Well, that guy's popular.

135
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:51,757
Here we go, here we go!
On the count of three...

136
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,425
It's Tashiro, the old man! Ahh!

137
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,136
What the hell, you guys?!
Oh no! Oh no!

138
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:58,806
Run! Run!

139
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,224
"I'm gonna kill you!"

140
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,310
You idiot, you said you wanted to do it here...

141
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,895
Pervert!

142
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,607
Hey I’ll get you!

143
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,568
Hey!

144
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:36,510
(Mom) Ahh, hahaha.
Welcome back, baby.

145
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,220
Mom.
Hehe.

146
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,265
But you're late,
you lazy bum!

147
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,601
Yeah... I was playing basketball.

148
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:48,313
Huh? Jeez...
Don't stay out too late.

149
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:51,358
You little brat! Hehe.

150
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:53,026
Alright, let's go home.
Yeah.

151
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:56,071
Hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi.

152
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:59,074
Ready, set, go!

153
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,928
Dad, I’m home.

154
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:28,729
Go take a bath first.
Today's dinner is mackerel miso stew.

155
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:50,917
Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles...
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm...

156
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:54,963
Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles...
Mm, mm, mm...

157
00:11:54,963 --> 00:12:00,344
Bubbles, bubbles... bubbles...
Mm, mm, mm...

158
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,347
Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles...
Mm, mm, mm...

159
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,666
Mom, I’m sorry.

160
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,268
Cute...

161
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:37,858
In the dead of night, when mom and the whole world is asleep…

162
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,695
I transform

163
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,740
No offense but

164
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,744
I’m cuter than any girls in my class.

165
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,876
I want to make my hair a bit fluffier.

166
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,546
I need a curler or a curling iron.

167
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:03,592
This feels like a tranquilizer that calms me...

168
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,594
I can…

169
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:22,777
Ta-da!

170
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:27,824
I wonder what am I going to do with this?

171
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:31,202
Are you really going to do it? For real?!

172
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:34,247
Huh? Huh, seriously?!
Are you really going to do it?

173
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:37,250
Huh, really? Huh?

174
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,006
Ahahaha!
Ahh~!

175
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:46,676
- Say bye-bye to your gross long hair, freak!
- No way!

176
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:50,055
You really cut it.
Yumeno is the best.

177
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,098
Cut more Yumeno!

178
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:54,100
Here we go.
Go, go! Oh~!

179
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,227
Don’t!

180
00:14:56,227 --> 00:15:00,482
If you cut anymore...

181
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,573
Good job growing it so long!

182
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:12,285
- It’s so gross!
- Cut more Yumeno!

183
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:16,665
If you cut anymore...
If you cut anymore...

184
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,714
I won’t be able to crossdress…

185
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:27,425
Crap!
Hey!

186
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:29,469
I totally save you the haircut fee

187
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:32,138
you should be grateful, you long-haired freak!

188
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:37,519
For real, you should pay him some money, you freak. Haha.

189
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,562
Alright, I’ll let you off with this much.

190
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:42,232
Sounds good.
No…

191
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,234
Huh?

192
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:46,945
That’s not enough.

193
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:47,987
Huh?

194
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:56,371
Hey!
Oh!

195
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:59,374
Of course.
It’s fake, it’s fake.

196
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,461
Nice!
Haha!

I… I’m home.

199
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:29,320
Ah, welcome back, baby.

200
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,323
Did you go to the hair dresser?

201
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:35,326
Looks really good.
Huh?

202
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,792
Huh… What’s this?

203
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:48,173
What do you mean?
Didn’t you look in the mirror at the hair dresser’s?

204
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,217
I look so cute…

205
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:55,597
That stylist got taste.

206
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,558
They did such a great job.
Hehe.

207
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:02,645
No... not yet.

208
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:08,735
No, no, no, no way...

209
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:11,738
Futoshi?

210
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:18,119
Alright, let’s eat.

211
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,123
Today, we’ll have dried daikon and shishamo.

212
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:29,923
Kirino-kun drinking water look so cool

213
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,676
This is crazy!
he’s just drinking water, and he look so cool~!

214
00:17:33,676 --> 00:17:34,636
What should I do?!

215
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,512
Isn’t he amazing?

216
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:39,349
Hey, Kirino! that play earlier was great.

217
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,727
Here you go! Hahaha!

218
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:45,730
That was awesome!
Great job! Nice play!

219
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,774
Thank you, Edogawa-sensei.

220
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:49,776
(Edogawa) No, no, no,
it was wonderful, right?

221
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:51,819
Yes!
That’s right!

222
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:53,821
That’s because of Kirino!
Yes!

223
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:03,957
Hahaha,
Mishima, isn’t my chest hair painful?

224
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,959
Edogawa-sensei...
Hmm~?

225
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:11,005
No, it doesn’t hurt at all.
Actually, it feels nice.

226
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:13,716
You little cutie!

227
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:20,431
Hahaha!

228
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:30,858
Let’s go.
Yes!

229
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,948
Hey, Mishima!

230
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:38,950
Why you’re creeping at Kirino like a pervert.

231
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,995
I wasn’t creeping at him...

232
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:46,374
Huh? Stop lying! You were looking at him, Homo-jima!

233
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:49,293
Hey! Are you listening?

234
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:55,091
Hey, Yumeno!
Why are you yelling by yourself?

235
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:58,094
Oh, crap.
It’s Yanagida.

236
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,229
Are you alright, Mishima?

237
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:11,232
That guy's mouth is a problem, too.

238
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:16,320
You got a hair cut, huh?

239
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,367
It really suits you. You look cute.

240
00:19:33,754 --> 00:19:34,755
Of course I do.

241
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:43,473
Hehe, hmm.

242
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:47,518
Heh… hehe, hmm.

00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:51,189
Hahaha… hehe.

244
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,441
Sorry, Futoshi,

245
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:57,195
can you go to Yamano Electric later and
pick up some AA batteries?

246
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,322
We have a harvest after this.

247
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:02,325
Sure. Batteries, right? I’ll go get them.

248
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:05,328
Thanks. Hehe.

249
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,041

I thought I left my pink lipstick here…

Hmm…?

253
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:29,477
I was planning to wear it
as a joke for the ladies' reunion.

254
