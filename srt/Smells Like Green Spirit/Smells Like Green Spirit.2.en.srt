00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,363
Get off! You’re good now.

3
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,409
You did something messed up.

4
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,499
Thank you...

5
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,501
for helping me.

6
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,215
You have something on your lips?

7
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,927
Why take it off?

8
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,930
It looks good on you.
- Huh?

9
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,351
For a homo freak like you, of course!

10
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:05,064
Don’t get the wrong idea! I absolutely hate homos like you!

11
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:08,818
You make me sick!
I hate them more than anything in this world!

12
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,778
You little shit!

13
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:12,780
Little shit…

14
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,158
If I could, I’d wrap you up
and lock you in a box...

15
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,535
lock it up
and sink you underground!

16
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,872
Wrap me up… in a box…

17
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:24,584
and lock… underground…

18
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,628
Move!

19
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,344
Sorry, I'm going home...

20
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,346
How dirty...

21
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,324
Araki Towa

28
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,994
Alright... Haa...

29
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,037
Haa... Haa...

30
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:46,082
I'm kinda tired...

31
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,752
Haa... Haa...

32
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,754
Haa...

33
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,224
(Yanagida) Excuse me.

34
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,268
Excuse me.
Are you alright?

35
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,270
Excuse me.

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,406
- You are?
- Oh, good! You’re awake.

37
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:22,452
Oh! Haha... Sorry.

38
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,121
When did I fall asleep?

39
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,498
You were sleeping, huh?

40
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:32,170
Crap… How long was I asleep?

41
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,214
Sigh
Thanks for waking me up.

42
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,216
Sure, see you around.

43
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:43,639
Hey, I haven’t seen you before.

44
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,684
You from around here?
- Ah…

45
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,980
I just moved here this spring.
I’m teaching at a school…

46
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,065
A school? Oh, really?

47
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:55,443
Then you must be Futoshi’s teacher.

48
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,736
Futoshi?

49
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,112
Oh, my son, my son.

50
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,823
His name is Mishima Futoshi.

51
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:05,203
My husband’s like, "He’ll grow up to be a strong man!"

52
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,537
Mishima-kun, huh?

53
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,915
I know it’s biased since I’m his parent, but

54
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,918
he’s really such a good kid.

55
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,172
He’s my treasure.

56
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,509
Treasure…
- Yeah.

57
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,888
So, no matter what kind of life he chooses to lead

58
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,932
I’ll always be on his side…

59
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:30,186
I’m just grateful that he’s alive.

60
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,440
Crap, that’s embarrassing.

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,193
No, I’m actually jealous.

62
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,862
Crap! Futoshi will worry.
Got to get home.

63
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,574
Really, thanks a lot.
- No worries.

64
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,910
Take care.
Okay!

65
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:57,046
(Yumeno) 144, 145,
146, 147, 148, 149...

66
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,381
Hiyaaa!
- 151 seconds!

67
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,425
(Saeki) Dividing 151 by 60, that’s 2 minutes and 31!

68
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:05,471
Just 2 minutes and 31 seconds?!
- Come on, you can do better!

69
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,474
You can easily go for 3 minutes!

70
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,518
Get up, Homoshima!
One more time!

71
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,938
Haha, I just thought of something awesome!

72
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,730
What, what, what?

73
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,357
How about we insert some “fight” into him?

74
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,483
Insert some "fight"?

75
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,945
Let’s strip Homoshima naked

76
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,781
and stick this in his ass...

77
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,449
That’s hilarious! Oh man!

78
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:27,159
You shithead! The hell you’re thinking!

79
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,161
Are you crazy?!
- Why not?

80
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:32,290
It would be hilarious, right?

81
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,126
No, that's just too tasteless.

82
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,169
He’s right. If Kirino says so, then...

83
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,505
it’s a stupid idea!

84
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,715
Even you, Takada...

85
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,217
Huh, really...?
- Of course!

86
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,219
Right? Kirino.
That’s just bad taste.

87
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,264
I don't want to see something that gross. It'll make my eyes rot.

88
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,267
Seriously, that's true.
- Yeah.

89
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,737
Sigh...

90
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:07,116
You look pale.
You okay?

91
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,118
Can you keep going with the test?

92
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,830
I'm fine.
- I see...

93
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,919
Actually, can I go to the nurse's office?

94
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:20,880
Sure.

95
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,063
Ya’ think that thing earlier really mess him up?

96
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,864
Cough cough...

97
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,910
Cough cough... grunt...

98
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,579
Sigh...

99
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,957
Cough cough... grunt...

100
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:59,960
Crap, I'm in terrible shape.

101
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,962
Guess I'll have to cancel the reunion.

102
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,717
Phew... Cough cough...

103
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,720
Cough cough... grunt grunt grunt...

104
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:12,097
Nurse’s office

105
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:14,099
Mishima, how are you feeling?

106
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,328
My first time was almost with a marker pen?

107
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,663
You gotta be kidding me

108
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,459
Huh? That’s my...

109
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:25,754
I mean my mom’s lipstick

110
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,551
What? What’s he doin with it?

111
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,929
Oh, an indirect kiss?
So Kirino actually likes me...?

112
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,266
What!? Whoa!

113
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,976
Huh, huh, what, what, what!? What, what!?

114
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,312
What, what, what!?

115
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:46,025
Ah... you... oh, you!

116
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,028
You creep! Were you there the whole time!?

117
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,452
Ugh... what a jerk...

118
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:00,539
I hate you! I hate you so much!

119
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,499
I hate you!

120
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,545
Okay...

121
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,633
The Pandora's box inside me...

122
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:14,011
"Pandora?"

123
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,014
I know...

124
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,059
that you and I have the same look in our eyes.

125
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,062
Why do you have to be in the same class as me!?

126
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,439
Why do you keep showing up in my sight!?

127
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,775
With that cute face like a girl!

128
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,777
Don't fuck with me!

129
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,531
It's not like I can help it!

130
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:35,991
Huh?

131
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:40,245
I can’t help that my face is cuter than most girls

132
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:42,956
...and my graceful body’s like Snow White's...

133
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:46,627
It’s not on purpose!
I just can't help it!

134
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,670
Uh... I didn’t go that far...

135
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:52,508
Why can't you just leave me alone!?

136
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:56,887
Im desperate to stay hidden,
but you guys keep grabbing me by the neck!

137
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,890
It’s too much!

138
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,936
But when I realized this is who I am

139
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,938
I can’t help it

140
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,652
Isn't that right? For you too.

141
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:18,408
Me too... sigh...

142
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:20,410
By the time I realized
I was already like this.

143
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:25,165
When I realized it
this is who I am.

144
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,504
Sigh...

145
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,024
Sigh...

146
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,405
Look over here.

147
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:59,783
Huh?
- Hold this.

148
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:17,634
Looks good...

149
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,104
I'm sorry...

150
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:45,912
Hahaha! Hahaha!

151
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:47,956
Boss, here's a get-well gift.
Ohhh!

152
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:50,292
Ya’ kay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."

153
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,210
Things ain’t fun without you around, Boss.

154
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,672
Okyo, can you stop calling me 'Boss' already?

155
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:57,716
But you are the Boss, right?

156
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:01,428
I'm back.
- Welcome back, baby.

157
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:05,098
Welcome back, Futoshi. Sorry we're intruding.
- Good evening.

158
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:07,142
You ok Mom?

159
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:10,145
I thought you’re gonna have a biker gang reunion today...?

160
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:12,189
Are you feeling unwell?
- No, it's just that—

161
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,567
I feel like I've caught a cold, so I decided not to go,

162
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,236
but then these guys snuck out and—

163
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:21,948
came to our place, and in front of a sick person

164
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:25,327
they’re puffing like crazy!
- But Mom, you're smoking too!

165
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,704
Hahaha!

166
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:29,748
Hey, Futoshi, it's been a while.

167
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,083
You’ve gotten even cuter

168
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,544
Being cute isn’t enough, Futoshi.

169
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:38,548
You’ve got to become a man among men like your dad

170
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:41,927
and protect the Boss.
We're counting on you! Got it?

171
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,638
Ha ha, got it, got it.
Hey, hey, that’s no good.

172
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,517
Idiots! What are you saying? I don’t expect that from him.

173
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,186
Boss, you’re trying too hard!

174
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:55,565
Ever since Takeshi-san passed away,
the Boss has been...!

175
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,943
All alone... ugh... sob...

176
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,945
Futoshi...!

177
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,988
Why are you crying?

178
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:06,034
The boss, who was all alone in the world, finally found happiness, and now...

179
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:09,037
The boss, who was all alone...

180
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:12,749
Ahhh... come on, you guys, every single time...

181
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:15,418
Stop crying.
Instead of worrying about me...

182
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:17,462
worry about your own life first.

183
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:21,174
ob... Ahhh! Haha!

184
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:24,553
What the heck!

185
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,889
Come here, here!

186
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,934
Kirino residence

187
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:32,936
You don’t have to force yourself to come back.

188
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:38,692
Makoto?
He’s doing just fine!

189
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:42,362
I’ll raise him to be someone
I’m proud to show off anywhere!

190
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:44,406
I guarantee it!

191
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:55,834
Here you go!
Please, enjoy!

192
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,836
Shall we have a toast?

193
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,880
Yes!
- Alright, cheers!

194
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,882
Cheers!
Yes, let's drink!

195
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,260
Who is that?

196
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,639
Whoa, looks like a pretty boy I haven't seen here before.

197
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,350
Heard he's a teacher who started last April.

198
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,062
His name is Yanagida.
He's so charming, right?

199
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:19,065
What’s with you, Mama, at your age?

200
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:21,109
You guys, at your age too

201
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:24,112
aren't you all drooling over Kaba-chan from the Mishima family?

202
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:26,489
Well, I can’t help it.
Haha, right?

203
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:28,158
If I could get with a pretty boy like that

204
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:32,871
I’d even let him burn me with a cigarette.
Oh man!

205
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,582
Yanagida-sensei, have you gotten used to things around here yet?

206
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:36,833
Yes, quite a bit.

207
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:40,962
But compared to Tokyo... it’s pretty rural, right?
- Yeah, right?

208
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:42,964
Compared to a school in Tokyo

209
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:44,674
our students here are practically like mountain monkeys.

210
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:46,009
Mountain monkeys! Haha.

211
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:50,347
Yeah, seriously, those kids their behavior in class is terrible, right?

212
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,140
No, no. That’s not true at all.

213
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,434
Huh? What? What?

214
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:57,103
What do we have here?
No, no, you don’t need to come over here.

215
00:14:57,103 --> 00:14:59,147
Is this the teacher from Tokyo?

216
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:01,149
Yes.
The name is Yanagida.

217
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:05,528
I moved here from Tokyo this spring.
- Oh, Tokyo, huh!

218
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:07,906
No wonder you look so cool.
- Sorry bout that.

219
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:11,284
Honestly, I wanted to live in Tokyo too.

220
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:14,954
But my parents were like, 'What will happen to the fields?'’

221
00:15:14,954 --> 00:15:17,999
Ah, if I had gone to Tokyo back then...

222
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:21,378
I might have become a refined man like you sensei.

223
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,381
No way, no way. Not with you.

224
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,091
What are you talking about?
But, sensei...

225
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,760
Why did you come to a place like this?

226
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,470
Hmm? Did you get sent here?
No, of course not!

227
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,472
No, I came here by choice.

228
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,516
Oh, you chose to come here?
On purpose?

229
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,518
Really? Why?

230
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:41,564
I’ve always wanted a peaceful life... something like that.

231
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:43,942
Oh...

232
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,277
But if it's too quiet...

233
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:48,988
That can be unsettling.

234
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:52,992
Yeah, that's true!  It's unsettling.
I'm really...

235
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,887
What d’ya mean you’re gonna stop?
- I'm bored.

236
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:14,889
Huh? Wasn't it you who suggested it in the first place?

237
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:16,933
Cuz ya think Mishima’s a disgusting homo?

238
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:20,603
Anyway, I'm out.
- Hey, Kirino!

239
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:24,315
Anyway, Im gonna stop too,
Mishima ain’t making any noise at all...

240
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:26,693
It’s getting boring...

241
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:29,028
That's true. Well, I'm leaving too.

242
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:33,074
Hey, hey...
The hell’s wrong with those idiots?

243
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:46,880
Um...
Huh?

244
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,257
I've been wanting to ask you for a while...

245
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:53,303
Did you cut this on purpose?

246
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,639
I thought I was about to get a buzz cut...

247
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,350
Rather, it's like I've become cuter.

248
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,020
Not that it was on purpose...

249
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,442
Sometimes, when I look at you, a little kindness creeps in me for a moment.

250
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:11,112
It's weird cuz I really hate you tho.

251
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:13,489
Well, having a buzz cut with that cute face

252
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:17,202
wouldn't do...

253
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,204
Really, you have a cute face.

254
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:25,293
So cute...it pisses me of sometimes.

255
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:28,296
Oh, no...

256
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:33,593
But back then,
I wasn’t the one who decided not to shave your head...

257
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:36,054
it was him.

258
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:39,390
Huh?

259
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,100
Where the heck did Kirino go?

260
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,102
Probably got asked out by some girl or something.

261
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:45,146
That guy's way too popular.

262
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:48,816
Hey, do you know where Mishima went?

263
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:50,860
Fujii-san...
Now that you mention it, he’s not here.

264
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,863
He might be in the nurse's room.

265
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:58,242
He’s always alone, so I thought about eating lunch with him.

266
00:18:00,286 --> 00:18:03,998
Huh? Why would Fujii-san would wanna be with Mishima?

267
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:05,667
I want to eat lunch with Fujii-san!

268
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,710
That creep is so annoying. Seriously...

269
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,380
Should we just bully him again?
Right, Yumeno?

270
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,757
Yeah!
- Let’s quit it.

271
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,759
We decided to stop already.

272
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:18,471
That was Yumeno, for sure.

273
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:20,807
He said, “Don’t shave his head."

274
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:24,811
Yumeno? No way...

275
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:28,231
Yeah!

276
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:32,276
I’ll let you off with this much.
- Yeah, that's true.

277
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:37,323
But this is just my intuition, but...

278
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:40,326
I think he likes you.

279
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,414
Huh!?
Look...

280
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,374
there are guys who like to bully the ones they like, right?

281
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:50,461
But if you say it like that...

282
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:54,841
It means you like me too?

283
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:58,553
Ha ha... Me?

284
00:18:58,553 --> 00:19:02,557
You’re one of those...

285
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:04,267
dense people.

286
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,269
Dense?

287
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:14,360
Mishima, are you free later today?

288
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,194
Huh?

289
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:20,074
You didn’t finish the test yesterday. You need to re-take it.

290
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:22,118
Ah... Got it.

291
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:24,120
Then let's meet in the preparation room.

292
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:29,959
Kirino.
Huh?

293
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:33,546
Where were you at lunch?
- Nowhere in particular.

294
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:36,257
Huh? Cuz Mishima wasn't here either.

295
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:39,260
Mishima?
Why you bringing him up now?

296
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,972
Why? Because you

297
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:46,684
suddenly said you were gonna stop…

298
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:48,686
Could it be…?

299
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:54,734
Never mind!
Let’s go to the club!

300
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:28,059
Sigh...

301
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:35,483
Alright, good work today.

302
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:38,486
Thank you very much.
Well then, please excuse me...

303
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:43,908
Oh, Mishima, should I walk you home?

304
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:45,618
Huh?
It’s already getting late...

305
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:48,287
Im about to go too so...

306
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:51,332
Oh... I’m on my bike.

307
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:55,336
Then, I’ll take my leave.

308
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:02,593
No way, no way!
That can't be true!

309
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:06,013
It’s like I thought!
He definitely likes you!

310
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:09,684
I... my instincts are usually pretty spot on.
(Kirino almost used the she pronoun)

311
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:12,061
Enough about that already.
Huh?

312
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:17,108
Because he’s super rough and has a foul mouth.

313
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:20,152
So what kind of guy do you like?

314
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:23,864
Huh, me?
Yeah.

315
00:21:23,864 --> 00:21:25,825
I like...

316
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:29,912
Eh!? Wait! No way!

317
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:31,914
Edogawa-sensei!?

318
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,084
Psssh!

319
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:39,797
My first love was my elementary school teacher.
And he’s still my ideal type.

320
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:42,842
Manly, muscular, and hairy

321
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:46,554
A mature man that is manly muscular...

322
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:51,267
but as pure as a boy on the inside...

323
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:54,645
Whoa, that’s just like Edogawa-sensei!

324
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:55,646
Right? Right?
Yeah!

325
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:58,983
Actually, I... me too!
(Kirino with the girl pronoun again)

326
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:00,693
I really like. Edogawa-sensei too!

327
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:04,029
For real!?
Yeah! Hahaha!

328
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:07,074
Really?
Yay! Hahaha!

329
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:10,453
He’s pretty spot-on, right?
Yeah, exactly!

330
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:14,165
Say, Kirino...
Hm?

331
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:18,169
It’s alright if you talk like a girl while we’re on the roof, right?

332
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:21,881
Huh?

333
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:24,175
Just be your true self.

334
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:27,970
Look, not many people come here anyway

335
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,973
It's just you and me, Kirino.

336
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:34,477
(For context: Ore—guy “I”, Atashi—girl “I”)

337
00:22:34,477 --> 00:22:35,728
I see...

338
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:41,150
Just you and me...
(He used atashi)

339
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,735
Yeah.

340
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:50,826
Atashi...Atashi...

341
00:22:53,537 --> 00:22:57,708
Atashi...
Yeah, that’s it!

342
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,961
Atashi...Atashi... right! Atashi...~!

343
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:03,297
More, more! How does it feel?

344
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:06,342
This is so fun!
Atashi! Hahaha!

345
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:09,386
More! One more time, one more time! Atashi!

346
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:12,723
One more time! Atashi~!

347
00:23:12,723 --> 00:23:14,725
This is the best! Hahaha!

348
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:17,353
Atashi! Yay!

349
00:23:17,353 --> 00:23:21,398
It was my first time laughing like this with a friend.

350
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:25,778
This is... kind of fun!
