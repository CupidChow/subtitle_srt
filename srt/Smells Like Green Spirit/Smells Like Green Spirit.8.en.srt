This fictional drama is set in the 1990s and contains outdated language that may be deemed inappropriate today.

00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,610
Wandering in this deep and green world

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,970
Whew! Melancholy and

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,360
Thrilling spiral, OH NO!

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,400
WHERE'S WAY OUT,

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,430
WHERE'S MY WAY

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,790
WHERE'S WAY OUT,

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,160
WHERE'S MY WAY

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,190
To the other side of the wind! WOO!

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,210
Oh, I see you haven't heard from them.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,580
I'm sorry to bother you so late at night.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,620
It's because I said that.

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,010
I shouldn't have... given birth to you!

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,370
Ma'am?

15
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,370
What... Have I done...

16
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,460
Makoto! Makoto!
- Ma'am?

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,460
Ah! Ah, Ma'am! Ma'am! Ah!

18
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,690
You're still worried? About your mom?

19
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,720
Hmmm?

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,080
Nope.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,100
When we get to Tokyo,

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,120
I'm just thinking where we should go first.

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,140
Well, of course, it has to be Ni-chome.

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,490
Actually, I wasn't even thinking about anything else.
- You're right. Yeah.

25
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,520
But, you know, that place...

26
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,880
Is it okay for minors to go there?

27
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,910
You should be fine.
I'm not sure myself, though...

28
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,910
Well, you look mature for your age too.

29
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,310
I'm sure there'll be all kinds of people.

30
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,330
People like us.

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,740
Hehe.
What are you talking about?

32
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,740
It's hot, huh, boys?
Where are you heading?

33
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,130
Tokyo!
- Tokyo? Haha.

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,220
Here, eat this to cool down.

35
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,250
Wow!
Thank you so much!

36
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,990
Mmm! Tasty!

37
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,070
Hey, wait a sec

38
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,810
What's wrong?

39
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,870
Sorry. Can I call home real quick?

40
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,260
I left without saying anything.

41
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,020
Yes? This is the Kirino residence.

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,380
Hello?

43
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,090
Dad?
- Makoto?

44
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,440
Why are you there at this hour?

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,800
Where are you now?

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Your mother has collapsed.

47
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Makoto, Are you listening?

48
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,920
Mother ...Has collapsed...

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,290
They think it's probably from stress.

50
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:39,680
Makoto, what happened between the two of you?
Makoto!

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,710
Makoto...

52
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,710
I'm sorry...

53
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,630
Did something happen?

54
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,630
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,670
I... can't go to Tokyo.

56
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,750
It seems like I'm no good.

57
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,750
If my mother isn't smiling, then I'm no good.

58
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,150
I can't go to Tokyo.

59
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,250
I can't go...

60
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:15,180
Smells Like Green Spirit
raw by Magicstar, english subbed by paprikart

61
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,690
When I was little, my mother and I

62
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,690
went on a trip to the hot spring up ahead.

63
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,110
I was so happy and excited...

64
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,110
But around us, there were families who looked so happy...

65
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,830
Then mother's face slowly darkened...

66
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,250
But when I got worried

67
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,280
and held her hand tightly.

68
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,280
She squeezed my hand back and smiled.

69
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,010
We have always lived like that.

70
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,730
That's why...

71
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,450
Let's go back.

72
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,410
Kirino...

73
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,410
When we get back...

74
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,450
I'll have to be strong... right?

75
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,880
Because I chose this path myself.

76
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,250
I'll never break like Yanagida.

77
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,250
Never.

78
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,290
I'll be strong. Try to make an effort.

79
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,140
For now, I might think of it as a huge effort

80
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,540
but there might come a day that it'll no longer be.

81
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,910
Maybe I'll even have a happy marriage.

82
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Yeah.

83
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,250
You see, my hands...

84
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,620
the joints are starting to stand out.

85
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,050
My voice is getting deeper,
and my leg hair is getting thicker.

86
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,050
My height also grew relentlessly.

87
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,440
It was so painful.

88
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,190
So, that's why it's okay.

89
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,190
I'm glad it happened now.

90
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,410
This...

91
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,410
Sorry.
I had been holding onto it all this time.

92
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
I'm giving it back to you.

93
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,290
I had completely forgotten.

94
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,670
That lipstick is the key to my Pandora's Box.

95
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,730
Now, I'm entrusting it to you.

96
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,170
Before I started talking to Kirino

97
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,170
I could only open mine secretly at night...

98
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,940
Our Pandora's Box, we could only open it on the rooftop

99
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,940
and showed each other its contents.

100
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,340
Just one summer.

101
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,710
Only for a brief moment.

102
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,080
Our treasured time.

103
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,360
It was fun... really fun...

104
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,440
Yeah.

105
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,800
It was fun.

106
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,390
They said it's a corpse.
- What?!

107
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,090
A dead body on that mountain?

108
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,110
Hey, could it be Yanagida-sensei?

109
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,140
He's been missing since then, right?
- Nah, that can't be him.

110
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,160
They said it was already just bones.

111
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,520
That's right. Plus, I heard there were two bodies.

112
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,210
Two bodies?
- Suicide? Or maybe a forced double suicide?

113
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,240
I don't know, but it's disturbing.

114
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,260
But mountains like these, I'm sure there's
still plenty of bodies lying around, right?

115
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,620
Isn't he just going round and round?

116
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,990
Everyone will only be talking about that for a while...

117
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,030
Maybe they'll forget about us?

118
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,030
I hope so.

119
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,420
Well then...
I'm this way...

120
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,810
Thank you, Mishima.

121
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,220
Kirino...

122
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,930
I'm going this way.

123
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,930
Yeah... see you.

124
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Mishima!

125
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,150
Do your best!

126
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,590
You too, Kirino!

127
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,590
Do your best, Kirino.

128
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,490
I made a decision, and so did Kirino.

129
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,530
We chose the path each of us will take.

130
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,570
It was a decision made to find happiness.

131
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,660
His eyes no longer showed defeat.

132
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,700
But my tears keep coming because...

133
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,730
I knew this was going to happen.

134
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,730
That our path will never...

135
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,460
cross again.

136
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,060
Hey, Kirino!
Hey, hey. Hey, Kirino.

137
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,880
(Book - Basic Knowledge for Understanding Homosexuality)
I think I've understood it in my own way...

138
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,880
though maybe that's just what I believe.

139
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,270
Your choice is the right one.

140
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,730
No, honestly... I don't know.

141
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,450
Which is right anymore

142
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,160
but, as your parent

143
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,200
when I think about your happiness

144
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,200
I'm sorry... I can't help but feel that way.

145
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,050
Thank you...

146
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,790
and I'm sorry.

147
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,540
Haah... That's great.

148
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,240
So cool!
- "Cool"?

149
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,610
I mean, it's really cute, but

150
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,300
It's cool too! Haha.

151
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,990
Crap... Sorry.

152
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,020
All I have is a mourning dress.

153
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,060
I wish I had a cuter dress or something.

154
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,060
But hey, they say black brings out your beauty the most, right?

155
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,850
Hey! Look!

156
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,850
Isn't he beautiful? Our Futoshi. Haha.

157
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,310
No matter what happens,

158
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,340
no matter what kind of life you live,

159
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,030
I'm on your side.

160
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,400
What are you saying, Mom?

161
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,430
Living in a countryside like this,
you'd probably feel suffocated, right?

162
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:06,480
It's okay if you go.
To Tokyo, or anywhere

163
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,180
to find your own Shangri-La.

164
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:18,260
Hehehe. So cute.

165
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,290
It look so pretty on you!

166
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,060
Hmm...

167
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,300
Mishima!

168
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,760
You know...

169
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
I'm really stupid.

170
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,850
My report card, except for P.E....
I only got "C"s and "D"s.

171
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,550
Even though my father's a foreigner,

172
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,570
I can only speak Japanese.

173
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,570
So, I don't really have the brains to think things through, you know.

174
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:05,270
I've been thinking about you all this time.

175
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,380
Ah.

176
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:26,200
This...
I bought it and I thought about a lot of things.

177
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,580
About you, and about Kirino.

178
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,580
About what kind of feelings you've had

179
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,640
and about how you've been struggling, all this time.

180
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,390
The more I thought about it,

181
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,090
the more I realized how stupid I've been.

182
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,800
The more it becomes hard to talk to you too...

183
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
All this time...

184
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,530
You're such an idiot.

185
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:02,230
That's why I'm telling you, I'm an idiot.

186
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,920
But I

187
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,950
I want to keep thinking about you

188
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,950
from now on...

189
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,340
Is that no good?

190
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,140
"Graduation Ceremony"

191
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,510
Sensei!
- Haha. Oh, Kirino.

192
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,530
Congratulations.
- Sensei.

193
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,570
Give me the second button of your suit.
- Oh... Huh?

194
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,590
Why the hell are you saying girly stuff?

195
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,620
I like you, sensei.

196
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,310
Oh?
- I probably thought of you like a father.

197
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,690
I wish someone like you were my dad.

198
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,720
Kirino... You...

199
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,420
You're saying some touching stuff!

200
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,120
I'm so happy!

201
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,150
I'm going to be so lonely without you!

202
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,520
Why are all your buttons gone?

203
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,220
Congratulations, Kirino.
- Sensei!

204
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,240
What's up with you all?

205
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,790
Mishima!

206
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,740
Let's go home together!

207
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,030
Since that day, I never saw Kirino again.

208
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,140
It's not that I hated that place.

209
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,850
But, as my mom said

210
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,880
I always felt suffocated.

211
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,240
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

212
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,590
Alright, go home early. Hehe.

213
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,680
Even now, I sometimes think...

214
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,080
about those days...

215
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,140
about Kirino...

216
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,070
After graduating from a beauty school in Tokyo

217
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,070
I got a job as a makeup artist.

218
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,500
I met many different people.
People, who, like me...

219
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,540
used to secretly put on their mother's lipstick.

220
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,590
People who take great pride in being gay.

221
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,970
People who laugh and say that gender doesn't matter.

222
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,970
Futoshi!

223
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:21,720
Are you coming home late today?
- I don't think so.

224
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,100
Really? Then I'll make paella and wait for you.

225
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,100
Really? Yay.
- I'll make the best one for you.

226
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,480
Take care.
- See you.

227
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:41,910
In the end, Shangri-la was different from what Kirino had imagined.

228
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,970
Personally, to call Tokyo "Shangri-La"

229
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:51,020
would be too unrealistic since there's no end to worries and anxieties.

230
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,060
But... I can live in this society as a man

231
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,430
and love another man as I truly am.

232
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,100
At times, when I feel like losing...

233
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,840
With this feeling, I become something more dazzling.

234
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,590
This is who I am...

235
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,590
Mishima Futoshi

236
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,320
Papa, look!

237
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,350
A big red dragonfly!

238
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:28,350
That's probably an Akiakane dragonfly.

239
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,110
I guess summer is ending.
