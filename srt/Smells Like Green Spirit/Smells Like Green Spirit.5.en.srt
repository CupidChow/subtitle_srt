3
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,524
Good morning.
- Hey, good morning.

4
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,569
- Good morning, Yumeno.
- Good morning.

5
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,362
Yanagida, yesterday...

6
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,407
You didn’t even greet us, you're also calling your sensei without prefix?

7
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,951
Edogawa, good morning!
Edogawa, Edogawa!

8
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,328
Stop calling me without prefix!
You brats!

9
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,663
What's up, Yumeno?

10
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:42,375
Ah... Never mind.

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,377
Good morning, Mishima.

12
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,089
How are you doing?

13
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,181
Oy, Yanagida-sensei is greeting you!

14
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,225
Mishima!
Hey, Mishima!

15
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,561
Haha. It’s ok, Uekusa-sensei.

16
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,563
Everyone has off days sometimes.

17
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,984
Mishima!

18
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,652
Did Yanagida do something to you yesterday?

19
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,366
Sensei...
- 100!

20
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,410
What?
It was just a normal punishment...

21
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,413
Really?

22
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,459
Actually, it’s none of your business.

23
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,460
Yeah ‘course not!

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,839
Like it’d be any of my business what you do, Homoshima
Idiot!

episode 5

32
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,638
Oy, Yumeno, let's play dodgeball today!

33
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,935
Yanagida!

34
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,937
Huh?

35
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,064
What ya doin’ here?

36
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,692
A kitten wandered in.
It's gone now, though.

37
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,904
A kitten?
- Yeah, it was really cute.

38
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:36,739
Yanagida.

39
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,741
You wanna play dodgeball with us?

40
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,867
Ah, sorry, can't.

41
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:43,454
I have to grade your tests.

42
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,082
Yanagida, gimme some bonus marks.

43
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,544
Idiot, you wanna get me fired?

44
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:53,214
Come on, Yanagida.
- No way.

45
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,216
I’ll do it another time.

46
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,177
What the hell!?
That's gross!

47
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:03,558
A hard-on...while spanking you!?

48
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,602
Ohhh...
He actually got a hard-on?

49
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:09,981
Ugh, stoppp! Let’s just stop!

50
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,151
But now, it's clear.

51
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,153
It’s just as I thought.

52
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:22,243
Hmm hmm hmm...

53
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,245
Yanagida is gay too.

54
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,997
Hmm hmm hmm...

55
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,249
It was hard to tell but

56
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,377
his eyes...

57
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,380
I felt something deep within his eyes

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,382
Its almost similar to ours...

59
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:42,764
Similar, but incredibly twisted somehow...

60
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:46,476
It’s like a bottomless pit.

61
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,811
Hmm hmm hmm...

62
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,857
Yes.
- Oh, Yanagida-sensei

63
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,901
Would you like some?
It was given to me, but

64
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,570
I don't drink, so...
- Really?

65
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,572
Thank you very much.

66
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:02,950
Ah, just leave it somewhere.

67
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:09,665
Good work.
- Thank you.

68
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,420
Were you humming just now?

69
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,131
Huh? Oh

70
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,133
Did you hear it?
- Haha, yes.

71
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,135
It was pretty loud. Haha.

72
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,513
Did something good happen?

73
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,848
Maybe a little.

74
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,892
A little. Haha.

75
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,228
Thank you.

76
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,231
Well then.

77
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:50,414
Maybe he got a girlfriend.

78
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,126
Huh?

79
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,885
Well, even so, he's still a sensei, so

80
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,595
He won’t force you

81
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,265
to do anything overboard

82
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,735
Anyway...

83
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:22,113
You're a little dense, so

84
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,115
Be more careful.

85
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,117
Yes.

86
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,119
Hehe.

87
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,542
It was scary, wasn’t it?

88
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,580
Let’s go!!
Yes, last one, last one, last one.

89
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,623
Yes, Kirino, nice!
Okay, good!

90
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:16,959
Yes, keep going, keep going!

91
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,962
Come on, don’t give up just yet.

92
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,763
Huh, what?
But, this morning...

93
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,808
Huh? What’s wrong, Homoshima?

94
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:36,145
Pfft! Didya get a flat tire?

95
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,855
That’s so lame! Hahaha!

96
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,903
Be careful going home!

97
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,330
Because Takada was slow, everyone has to run one more lap!

98
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,041
What!
Im kidding.

99
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,043
Come on, let’s head back to the gym.

100
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,754
Mishima’s got a flat tire?
- Hah, yeah.

101
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,756
That idiot is such a klutz, right?

102
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,466
If he walk home...

103
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,468
It’ll take him two hours!

104
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,428
Seriously?

105
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,514
Huh?

106
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,893
What's wrong?
- Ah, no... By the way, earlier

107
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,895
I saw Yanagida at the bike parking area...

108
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,274
I ain’t sure, but...

109
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,652
he said something about a kitten being there...

110
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:28,030
But there wasn't any kitten, though...

111
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:40,459
Yanagida you here!?

112
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,838
What’s with you guys?
You're so noisy.

113
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,174
If you're looking for Yanagida-sensei,
he already left a while ago.

114
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,595
Huh, wait a minute...

115
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,314
Where did Kirino and Yumeno go?

116
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,735
Oyy! Kirino, Yumeno!
We're still in the middle of practice!

117
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:09,113
Sorry!
Ah, sorry, Edogawa!

118
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,116
Kirino and I are have period cramps!
- cramps?

119
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,827
We're leaving early!
- I... Idiot!

120
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:45,941
Huh? What a coincidence.

121
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,485
I'll give you a ride.

122
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:58,704
Kirino.

123
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,522
That’s…

124
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:27,941
Mishima’s bike…

125
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:31,987
Oh no… This is seriously bad!

126
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,081
You mind if I smoke?

127
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,644
You know I cant do it…

128
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,647
unless its a boy, right?

129
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:13,403
My first love was also a boy classmate.

130
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:20,494
Strangely sexy,
and his eyes always gazed somewhere into the distance…

131
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,454
Just like you, Mishima.

132
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:28,210
On the same boarding house,

133
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,922
We got close and we did naughty things, and then

134
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,634
the sensei found us and called my parents.

135
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:40,639
And from then on...

136
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:50,107
For example, when comedians mock gays on TV,

137
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:54,152
My mom would panic and cut off our cable.

138
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:57,155
Hahaha!

139
00:10:57,155 --> 00:11:00,200
And if I made friends with another boy,

140
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,203
She’d always suspect something was going on.

141
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:07,291
So, in order to please my mother, I forced myself to date women

142
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,294
I forced myself to have sex with women

143
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:14,006
But I never felt fulfilled, not even once.

144
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:20,345
I just kept thinking how those squishy and gross breasts were in the way.

145
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:21,430
And in the end

146
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,433
I married a woman with good credentials, but

147
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,811
They really are sharp, huh?

148
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:30,188
Even though I hid it really well,

149
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:36,903
She fucking found my DVD stash of pretty boys…

150
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:40,616
In the end, we got divorced.
And ya know what my mom said?

151
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,619
“It’s because of your illness, isn’t it?”

152
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:47,080
“You still haven’t been cured yet?”

153
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,043
Hahaha!

154
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,420
Haha, haha…

155
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,423
Hehe...

156
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,181
You're the same, right?

157
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,561
Huh?

158
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,605
What will your mother do?

159
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,566
When she finds out.

160
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:23,033
She treasures you.
No matter what kind of life you live

161
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,411
She’ll always be the one person who’ll stand by you

162
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:29,748
I wonder what kind of face will she make…

163
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:35,504
I really want to see it! Hahaha.

164
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:39,174
It's locked, so it's useless.

165
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:46,264
I need to pee.

166
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:50,310
Then you can do it here.
I'll drink it for you.

167
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,312
It subsided.

168
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,116
It's your fault.

169
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:11,498
It’s not like I was expecting anything.

170
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:14,209
I thought a shitty school in the sticks

171
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:19,256
would be just full of piss ass brats.

172
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:23,635
I thought I could live peacefully.

173
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:26,638
That's why I came here!

174
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,394
Why?

175
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:36,690
Why, how did…
I end up in a place like this?

176
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:39,609
Why…?

177
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:45,240
So, it's your fault, Mishima.

178
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:58,503
Mishima? Open your mouth.

179
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:00,505
Stop it!

180
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,069
Which way did they go…?

181
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:25,780
This way!
- Huh? How do you know?

182
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,198
I ain’t sure but

183
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:29,159
if the adults wanna do some pervert stuff,

184
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,120
they go to Yamashita Cement!

185
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:46,968
Mishima!

186
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,348
It hurts, stop!

187
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,103
Please, Mishima..., Mishima...

188
00:14:57,103 --> 00:15:00,774
It's impossible!

189
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,777
Please... Mishima!

190
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:09,491
Let me in... please accept me...

191
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:18,625
Mishima~!

192
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,673
Mishima~!

193
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:30,720
Mishima~!

194
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:40,146
Ugh... it hurts...

195
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:47,570
Yanagida! You bastard!

196
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,572
Mishima!

197
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:59,040
Ugh!

198
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,085
That hurts...
What the fuck were you doing you rapist!?

199
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:04,087
Ugh! Shut up!

200
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:07,132
You carefree brat!

201
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,134
Die!
Everyone... it's your fault!

202
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:13,138
All of you, should die!

203
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:37,078
We gotta contact the school.

204
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:41,124
It's fine... don’t!

205
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:44,169
But...

206
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,881
I'll be fine.

207
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:54,262
So please don't tell anyone about this...

208
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:56,264
Please.

209
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,066
Yanagida-sensei left behind a clichéd farewell.

210
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:09,068
and never showed up to our school again.

211
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:17,160
He completely disappeared from that moment on.

212
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,829
Before we start, everyone...

213
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:24,542
A while later, the school received a call from Yanagida-sensei...

214
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,921
Yanagida-sensei has decided to leave the school.

215
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,633
Why...?
- Well, it's for personal reasons...

216
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,635
Due to personal reasons.

217
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:37,680
That’s all he said.

218
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,724
Sawada-sensei...

219
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:50,151
Futoshi

220
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:54,530
How long are you going to stay in there? Hurry up and come out.

221
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:15,385
Kirino residence.

222
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:33,236
Pandora's box.
- Huh?

223
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:36,239
The thing you said before.

224
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:45,289
Each of us has one

225
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:51,087
The size is different depending on the person but

226
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:55,466
Yanagida-sensei

227
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:57,468
Was very similar to us.

228
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:04,559
It was something he couldn’t show to anyone,

229
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,561
something he should never open.

230
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:14,652
But the contents feel like they’re about to burst out

231
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:17,655
So he desperately held it down like this...

232
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:26,456
That’s how you and I have been carrying ours too.

233
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,459
Yanagida-sensei

234
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:36,215
he was also...

235
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:39,218
carrying it all along

236
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:43,598
but for a much longer time...

237
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:45,600
Are you sympathizing him?

238
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:55,067
It’s true, he was carrying a box similar to ours.

239
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:58,112
But what he did is unforgivable

240
00:19:58,112 --> 00:20:01,449
whether he is one of the same kind, as a sensei, or as a human being.

241
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:04,493
But if I...

242
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:08,206
If I had accepted him

243
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:10,208
Yanagida-sensei wouldn’t...

244
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,585
Stop it.

245
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:16,964
Stop thinking about stupid things...

246
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:28,392
Huh? Is it true about Yanagida-sensei?
- Yes, it is.

247
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:30,436
I heard it too.
- Me too.

248
00:20:30,436 --> 00:20:34,815
I heard the school can’t get in touch with him~.
- Really~!?

249
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:37,818
I heard Yanagida-chan quit school.

250
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:40,529
No way~?
- Really?

251
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,531
Who is that?
- The pretty boy!

252
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:44,575
The one from Tokyo.

253
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,577
He just came here recently?

254
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:48,621
That's right. He already quit.

255
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:50,623
Why?
- I don't know.

256
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:53,751
Sup.

257
00:20:55,878 --> 00:20:57,880
Yumeno, are you skipping practice today too?

258
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,259
Yeah. Edogawa was so pissed though.

259
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:05,638
Even though, I said
I had cramps

260
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:08,641
He just shouted, "Just quit already!"

261
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,522
Uh wait that’s not why I’m here for.

262
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:18,567
My old hag told me to buy batteries at Yamano Electric
so I got no choice, y’know.

263
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:23,948
Didn’t ya buy batteries there yesterday and the other day too?

264
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:27,326
I mean, your house is the opposite direction of mine?

265
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:31,706
Plus, there's a huge supermarket near yours too?

266
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:32,832
Shut up.

267
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:36,043
The batteries from Yamano are better.

268
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:40,840
Hahaha! What do you mean by better batteries?

269
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,509
Huh? Better batteries are kind of

270
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:46,220
like... shiny and...

271
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,556
really strong...

272
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:50,599
Strong? Huh?

273
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,601
And the current is really strong, like zapping...

274
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:55,604
Yumeno.
- Huh?

275
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:58,315
Thank you.

276
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:02,987
Let’s go.

277
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:15,791
Yamano store

278
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,547
Hmm... Well then.

279
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:23,549
Yeah.

280
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:26,927
Ah~ I guess I can go a little further.

281
00:22:26,927 --> 00:22:28,262
Geez Im fine.

282
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:32,975
Mishima...

283
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:35,686
Oh, sorry!

284
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:39,899
You probably don’t wanna be touched by a guy right now.

285
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:43,903
Sorry. I... I’m going home.

286
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:48,449
No.

287
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:54,497
It might even be the opposite.

288
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:58,209
Actually, I...

289
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:04,965
still get

290
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:09,345
a little scared on the way home.

291
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:18,145
Thank you... really... Yumeno...
