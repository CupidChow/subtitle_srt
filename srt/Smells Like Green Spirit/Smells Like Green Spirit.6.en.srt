1
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:13,763
Hmm... Well then.

2
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,765
Yeah.

3
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,184
Ah~ I guess I can go a little further.

4
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,186
Geez Im fine.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,564
Mishima...

6
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,652
Oh, sorry!

7
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,905
You probably don’t wanna be touched by a guy right now.

8
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:35,326
Sorry. I... I’m going home.

9
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,040
No.

10
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,129
It might even be the opposite.

11
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,176
Actually, I...

12
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,598
still get

13
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:00,059
a little scared on the way home.

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,361
Thank you... really... Yumeno.

15
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:27,212
This fictional drama is set in the 1990s and contains outdated language that may be deemed inappropriate today.

16
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,215
Hahaha! Hahaha!

17
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,635
So goood!!!

18
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,971
The boss's vegetables are the best, right?

19
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,681
So wild!
- Wild?

20
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,475
Ah, wild, huh?

21
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,352
Hey, Futoshi!

22
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,436
You’re one hella lucky kid,

23
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,064
getting to eat such delicious veggies every day.

24
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,774
Wild vegetables, right?
- Yes.

25
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:52,487
Hm? You look glowing today.

26
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,822
For real you're really glowing.

27
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:57,533
Could it be our boy is in love?

28
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,118
Woo! Woo!

29
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,578
No Im not, really!

30
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,829
Just take your time, kay?

31
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,915
If ya get a girl, introduce her to us.

32
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,959
Little Futoshi used to be so small...

33
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,628
Boss! You've come all this way...

34
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,340
Since Takeshi-san passed away,
you've taken care of Futoshi all on your own...

35
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,719
Why are you the one crying?

36
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,721
Boss, who was all alone in the world...

37
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,100
finally found happiness, but now...

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,811
Boss, who was all alone in the world...

39
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:31,192
Ok! You guys...

40
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,237
Every time, without a fail!
Stop crying!

41
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,037
I don’t get it?

42
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,665
Yanagida just quitting like that.

43
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,043
I always thought that sensei from Tokyo would...

44
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,045
leave sooner or later.

45
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:56,384
Street says there was a love triangle between Sawada, Yanagida, and Uekusa.

46
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:02,557
Actually, I happened to see Sawada and Yanagida kissing.

47
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,182
Huh? Where?

48
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,852
Right here.
- What!?

49
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,229
Ya two were there and ya didn’t even notice.

50
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,231
No way.
- That’s crazy!

51
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,943
But actually!
Just now...

52
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,987
I saw something incredible...

53
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,699
I wanna tell someone about it soon!

54
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,992
Something incredible?

55
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,702
Mishima’s...

56
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,746
You know, Kaya’s son... what’s his name, um...

57
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,748
her son... Futoshi?
- Ohh...

58
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,460
Futoshi, and... um, you know...

59
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,295
that foreigner’s son,
Yumeno!

60
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,464
And?
- Him and Yumeno's son...

61
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:41,888
Were ho...
- Ho?

62
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,225
Araki Towa

63
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,353
Sono Shunta

64
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,774
Fujimoto Kodai

65
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,443
Sakai Wakana

66
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,154
Abe Alan

00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,699

00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,452
episode 6

69
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:08,164
How do I say this, your lunch is always pretty unique.

70
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,875
Even though I keep saying Im fine cuz I can make one myself...

71
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,545
my mom always makes one for me.

72
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,923
That LABE supposed to be LOVE, right?

73
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,967
Hahaha.
Hehe.

74
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:23,930
Well your lunch is always super fancy too.

75
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,767
Well, yeah...

76
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:34,398
Yumeno can be pretty stupid, and immature, but

77
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:37,443
he has his good points too.

78
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,153
Huh? What ya sayin all of a sudden?

79
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,489
On that day...

80
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,324
Mishima!

81
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,993
You bastard!

82
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:50,206
He was kinda cool.
I almost fell for him.

83
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,671
So what ya gonna do bout it?

84
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,632
What am I gonna do...?

85
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,764
Nothing.

86
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,766
Because...

87
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,479
Guess you’re right.

88
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,148
There’s nothing you can do bout it.

89
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:17,525
Yeah.

90
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:21,529
Besides, his eyes are totally different from ours.

91
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,285
Oh right,
I brought something pretty!

92
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,788
What? What is it?
- Ta-da!

93
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,666
I found it inside my mom's vanity.

94
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,043
This is, um... eyelashes curler!

95
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:39,088
Yeah, I’ve always wanted fake lashes, though...

96
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,548
I want to use it, I want to use it.
How do we use this?

97
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,092
Nope, I’m first!
Hey... wait!

98
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,138
Watch, okay? Yeah.

99
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,852
Ah, ouch! Ah...

100
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,270
I pinched my eyelid.

101
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,521
Give it! I'll do it for you.

102
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,898
Huh?
- Over here. Ready?

103
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,610
Look up a little.

104
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,367
So cuteee!
- Really?

105
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:13,414
It curled up.
Lets do the other side too!

106
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,457
Ouch!

107
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,958
Hey… you pinch my eyelid!

108
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,127
Sorry! sorry!
- You did it on purpose!

109
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,176
Heya!

110
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,219
Yumeno, what about club practice?

111
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:29,555
Oh shit, Edogawa!

112
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,932
Hey, Yumeno!

113
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:33,934
Hey! I told ya, if you skip club practice today, you’re out.

114
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:35,978
The match is coming up. What the hell were ya thinking?

115
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,104
I told you, I have a stomachache.

116
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:40,357
You said that last time, too.
Come on, stop making excuses.

117
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:43,360
Just trust what your student says for once.

118
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,737
Let’s go, Mishima!
- Oy, Yumeno.

119
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,074
Oy, your teammates… Oy, Yumeno! Wait!

120
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,117
Ugh, my stomach hurts.
- Your teammates need you too!

121
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:52,119
Shut up!

122
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,709
By the way,
when did you and Kirino start getting along?

123
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,543
Huh?

124
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:02,588
Oh…

125
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,592
Maybe we have something unexpected in common.

126
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,427
Something in common?
- Yeah.

127
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,638
Like what?

128
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,766
Hmm… it’s a secret.

129
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,351
What?

130
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,353
Tsk… What the heck?

131
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:23,692
Say Yumeno,

132
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,111
Didn’t ya hate me?

133
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,493
Here, Kaya.
- Ah~

134
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,870
Thank you, Thomas.

135
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,872
My son loves corn.

136
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:38,374
Same here!

137
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:43,254
Thank you very much for the generous amount of cucumbers.

138
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,840
My idiot son, Taro, also loves cucumbers!

139
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,509
That’s great.
No matter how wild our cucumbers are

140
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,219
eating only that would get boring,

141
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,596
so it’s a good trade!

142
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,598
Lets always trade!

143
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:56,600
Mmm! Mmm~ Haha.

144
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,312
These wild cucumbers are so good!

145
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,314
Mmm! Haha!

146
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:16,287
You were always

147
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,290
daydreaming right?

148
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:25,045
Even in class, you’re always staring outside,

149
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:29,758
It’s hard to know what you’re always thinkin bout.

150
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:33,762
and I’ve never even seen ya smile...

151
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,563
Even though you have those big eyes...

152
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:49,987
it feels like nothing is reflected in them.

153
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,989
That’s how I see it...

154
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,787
y’know how your seat is in front of mine...

155
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:13,886
when your hair fluttered in the wind...

156
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,888
you almost look surreal.

157
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,600
So I wanna know

158
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:25,647
if you really exists.

159
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:33,405
Even if I reach out my hand,

160
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:37,409
I feel like I still wouldn’t be able to touch you.

161
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:44,833
That’s why you’ve always been on my mind.

162
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,545
Cuz of that I’ve always wanted to touch you... to talk to you.

163
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:56,303
I feel kinda embarrassed.
- Huh?

164
00:09:56,303 --> 00:10:00,349
Ah, sorry...
So then Kirino was like...

165
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,018
"Isn’t Mishima seriously gross and creepy”

166
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:05,062
“let's mess with him a bit," he said

167
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,064
and I went along with it...

168
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,444
And that’s why you bullied me?

169
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:13,821
Ah, sorry!

170
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,865
I thought that I finally get to touch you

171
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:18,867
and get closer with you...

172
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:27,960
I wanted to touch your hair...

173
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:34,800
Oh, I really think we got too far when we cut it,

174
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,343
I'm really sorry!

175
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,103
Yumeno, you know...

176
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,815
Huh?

177
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:10,419
you’re kinda nice, y’know?

178
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,046
You’re nice.

179
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:17,426
Huh? Haha... huh?

180
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,137
Really?

181
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:24,182
Haha... hehe...

182
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:26,184
Haha...

183
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,565
I probably...

184
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:42,367
I... I like you...

185
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,369
So...

186
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:52,794
Even though I like you, I still bullied you.

187
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:54,796
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,266
Haha, hahaha! Haha!

189
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,268
It's so hot, damn it.

190
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:16,777
Ah...
How about we try going to the stream?

191
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,488
It’s so cool.
- It’s really cold, yeah?

192
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,490
What?
- Woo!

193
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,200
Oy... you...
- Whoa... cold!

194
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,912
It’s cold!
Ah, it’s cooler in the shade.

195
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,581
Ah, hey,...
Watch your step.

196
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:31,625
Im fine.
- It’s slippery.

197
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,002
It’s fine.
Whoa!

198
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:36,004
Watch out!

199
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,639
Mishima...

200
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,728
Can...

201
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:55,399
Can I kiss you?

202
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,531
Huh? Mishima’s son, Futoshi?

203
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:06,910
Yes, that’s right.
He was with that foreigner’s son, and...

204
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,287
they were hugging tight on the street.

205
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:11,289
Huh? Wait,
You mean they were holding each other?

206
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:15,293
No way, two boys hugging!

207
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,099
Wh-why didn’t ya closing your eyes?

208
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,101
Well you didn’t either!

209
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,150
Can I do it again?

210
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:42,195
Yeah.

211
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:03,383
I can’t breathe...

212
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:06,761
Breathe through your nose.

213
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:13,560
One more time.
Huh, wait...

214
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:31,036
Shit... Shit... I can't stop.

215
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:38,126
What should I do, Mishima?

216
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,553
Wait...

217
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:50,555
Wait... Yumeno...

218
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:55,268
You’re salty.

219
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,979
You’re sweaty too.

220
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:00,023
Shut up.

221
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,968
Wai...

222
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:41,398
Hey, hey, did ya hear? Did ya hear?
- What?

223
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:45,318
About Mishima’s son?
- It’s amazing, two boys...

224
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:49,531
hugging each other naked,
rolling around, panting like crazy!

225
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,573
“Ha... ha...”!?

226
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,332
Yumeno...

227
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:06,131
Oh... I just remembered, my dad asked me to cut the grass.

228
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:09,717
Huh?

229
00:16:09,717 --> 00:16:12,679
I gotta go home.

230
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:16,474
Huh...

231
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,994
Hot! It’s so hot.

232
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:43,418
Alright...
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

233
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:44,794
Ugh! Hot!!!

234
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:49,841
Oh, come on... haha.

235
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:57,640
Futoshi~ your favorite corn is ready.

236
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,352
From Thomas-san.

237
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:03,354
From Yumeno Farmers.

238
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:10,987
Futoshi~?

239
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:18,912
Mmm, so good!
It’s definitely wild, isn’t it?

240
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:22,624
Kayo’s cucumber.
- Mmm, for sure.

241
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,252
It’s so delicious.
- Hey, Taro, have some too.

242
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:28,671
You liked salted cucumbers, right?

243
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:31,674
These are Mishima’s cucumbers.

244
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:33,968
Thanks for the meal.

245
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:37,555
Wait, what’s wrong?

246
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,891
You haven't eaten at all yet.

247
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:41,893
Im not that hungry...
- Huh?

248
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:43,603
Taro, come back! Come back, Taro!

249
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:46,940
If you eat a wild cucumber, you’ll feel better.

250
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,983
Oy, Taro! Oy!

251
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:51,986
Come back! Here’s a cucumber! Oy, Taro...

252
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,870
Dad, I’m counting on ya.

253
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:08,586
Mmm… mmm…

254
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,860
Oyy, Mishima!

255
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,862
Aren't you going to eat?

256
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:41,953
My head hurts...

257
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:52,380
Did something happen with Yumeno?

258
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,841
Hey, Mishima!

259
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:03,349
I want you to tell me properly.

260
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:07,061
Um…

261
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:10,356
What should I say…

262
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:12,775
I want you to properly say

263
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:14,902
that you like me.

264
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:21,451
Um…

265
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,536
Uh, um… uh…

266
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:35,339
I like you, Machida-san

267
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:40,928
I mean…Machi-chan, I like you.

268
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:41,846
Hehe.

269
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,811
Ah!

270
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:50,605
Fu… Fujii-san, my glasses…

271
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:58,196
I confessed to Mishima.

272
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:02,366
Then I asked if I could kiss him...

273
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:09,373
So we kissed, and then…

274
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:15,796
I… couldn’t stop, and then…

275
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:20,384
I… took off his pants.

276
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:23,512
And then…

277
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:25,681
I ran away.

278
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:29,810
Huh!?

279
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,605
Because Mishima has a dick…

280
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:34,607
Obviously!!!

281
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:42,031
I’ve imagined Mishima doing lewd things a lot of times.

282
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:45,743
But in my fantasies, Mishima didn’t have…

283
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:48,079
any breasts...

284
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:53,125
He didn’t have a dick either.

285
00:20:57,505 --> 00:21:02,218
I’ve called Mishima “homo ” a lot of times…

286
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:06,931
I should’ve known…

287
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:13,980
Of course, its not like I thought he was a girl...

288
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:19,402
But when I saw Mishima’s dick,

289
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:22,446
I felt my excitement fade.

290
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:26,242
I thought, “Oh, this isn’t right”

291
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:27,827
Huh?

292
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:31,205
Ugh... Ugh...

293
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,541
Why’re you cryin, Kirino?

294
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:39,964
Ugh... Ugh...

295
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:44,635
But, we were just calling him homo to bully him...

296
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:47,638
It’s not like he’s actually a homo, right?

297
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:57,773
You’re hopeless!

298
00:21:57,773 --> 00:22:01,485
I knew it...

299
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:03,487
That's why I didn't want this to happen!

300
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,533
Kirino?

301
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:09,535
You’re...

302
00:22:10,244 --> 00:22:12,288
Me too...

303
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:15,249
(He used “Atashi” = girl “I”)

304
00:22:22,381 --> 00:22:24,383
Mishima~!

305
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:37,521
I’m totally fine.

306
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:42,234
Its not like l have feelings for him.

307
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:45,237
He’s not even my type anyway.

308
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:52,620
The kiss was just spur of the moment.

309
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:56,707
I’m totally fine.

310
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:05,090
I also did the same thing to Fujii-san...

311
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:12,181
But when its between guys...

312
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:20,940
it's only natural to be faced with rejection

313
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:27,696
I’m totally fine.
