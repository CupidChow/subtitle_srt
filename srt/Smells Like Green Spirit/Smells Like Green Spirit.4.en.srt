(Yanagida’s ex-wife)
I’ve prepared the divorce papers.

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,592
You’re just going to apologize?

3
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,928
No excuses at all?

4
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:14,639
At least make one.

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,017
I'm really glad we didn't have kids.

6
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:21,688
Hey, why did you even marry me?

7
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:30,113
I badly wanted to believe that it was possible for me.

00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,083
Balancing work and childcare,

16
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:11,130
along with people marrying later in life
contributes to a lower birthrate

17
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,175
This leads to a society with fewer children
and more elderly people

18
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,178
known as a "low birthrate and aging society.”

19
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:21,224
Mishima, you're staring out the window again

20
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,269
You do daydream a lot.

21
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,271
Sorry.

22
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,650
Do it again and I’ll have to punish you.

23
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,652
What?!

24
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,129
Sensei!

25
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,881
We made madeleines in cooking class today!

26
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:55,258
Wow, that’s amazing!

27
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,260
Don’t they look nice?
- They look good enough to sell!

28
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,262
No, they’re definitely better than the store-brought ones!

29
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,305
Try one, sensei!
- That's impressive.

30
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:05,351
Ah…

31
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,353
Still hung up on it?

32
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,065
Huh? Hung up on what?
- From Fujii.

33
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,401
Ugh!
- You’re the worst!

34
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:18,156
Oh, that…
No, maybe at this rate…

35
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,826
You’re frowning your eyebrows.

36
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,203
Don’t overthink it.

37
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,205
Mishima and Kirino are being friendly…

38
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:30,585
Mishima and Kirino are being friendly!
Mishima and Kirino are…

39
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:34,630
Homos!
Mishima and Kirino are dating!

40
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,677
Hey! Mishima and Kirino are dating!
Hey, Mishima and Kirino…

41
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,053
Fuck this!

42
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:44,390
I knew it!

43
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,998
Futoshi.
Welcome back, baby. What's up?

44
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,335
I thought I’d give you a hand.
- It's fine, you'll get dirty.

45
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,713
It’ll be faster if I help, right?

46
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,424
You’ve grown into such a cool guy… Ugh…

47
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,426
Come on, let’s get this done quickly, mom.

48
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,804
Okay.

49
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:25,806
Put it here when you’re done harvesting.
- Got it.

50
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,898
Kaaayo chan!

51
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,567
Ah, Ohkubo-san, hey there!

52
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,445
That compost you gave me the other day was fantastic.

53
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,613
Thanks a lot.

54
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,323
Ah, I’m glad to hear that.

55
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,326
If you run out again, just let me know. I’ll give you more.

56
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,328
You’re a lifesaver, Kayo-chan. Hehe.

57
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:54,085
Next time, I’ll help with the harvest, so um,
if it’s okay, well, uh…

58
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,462
Hey!
We’re going to be late!

59
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,464
I get it!

60
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,842
Sorry. We're going to the roadside station now,
so see you later. Okay?

61
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:02,510
Okay, see you later.

62
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,222
That old hag...
You're seriously annoying.

63
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,982
Kayo-chan is so gorgeous after all.

64
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,651
Stop drooling over her.

65
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,028
But who’s that?
That... pretty girl.

66
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:22,697
Huh? What are you talking about?

67
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,825
Look! Next to Kayo-chan.

68
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,077
That’s her boy, Futoshi.

69
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,247
What?
Eh?

70
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,207
Is that Futoshi?!
- Yeah.

71
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,168
Coulda sworn that was a girl...
- You're such an idiot.

72
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,628
He's wearing a boy’s uniform, ain’t he?

73
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,047
I only knew him when he was still a kid.

74
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:42,591
Geez!

75
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:44,927
He's a hundred times cuter than my old hag.

76
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,930
If ya don't stop, I'll rip ya ears off!

77
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,182
Kirino residence

78
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,687
Welcome home, Makoto-san.

79
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,731
I'm home.
How's mom?

80
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,734
Well, she has a bit of a fever and

81
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,445
Her appetite hasn't come back, but

82
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,780
she only ate about half of her meal...

83
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,491
She might be under a lot of stress.

84
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,202
because your dad is like that.

85
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,538
Honestly, when I think of the burden on you,

86
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,583
I just feel so sorry for you.

87
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,918
Fumi-san, I’ll take care of her.

88
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,922
Thank you so much.
- Ah, oh no! Look at the time...

89
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:26,343
I need to stop by the supermarket

90
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:28,054
and go to the cleaners too.

91
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,390
I always end up staying so late...

92
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,436
It’s not really about time

93
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,813
It’s about the feelings, you know.

94
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:40,816
I’m old-fashioned, so I just can’t help it. Hehe.

95
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:44,862
Fumi, you better get going, hurry!
- Ah, yes, yes.

96
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:50,242
Alright then, madam!
I’m heading out!

97
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:52,620
Alright, please excuse me!

98
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,622
Okay, okay, okay.

99
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,048
Mom?

100
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:09,261
Welcome back, Makoto.

101
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,680
It’s fine, please lay down.

102
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,183
How are you feeling?

103
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,186
Somewhat better than this morning.

104
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,563
The key? Did you lock the door?

105
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:22,900
Not yet... Oh, then go lock it.

106
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,277
Why?

107
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:28,280
He probably won’t be coming home today either...

108
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,286
He’s probably with her again anyway

109
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,961
I never thought my life would turn out like this...

110
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,673
I didn’t expect much.

111
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:52,096
Just... a simple...

112
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,431
simple...

113
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:57,476
Mom?

114
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:00,479
Hurry up and lock the door.

115
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,360
Makoto

116
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,363
Don’t become like him.

117
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,407
Huh?

118
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,742
Someone who betrays people’s trust...

119
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:16,453
and brings misfortune to those around them...

120
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:18,789
You mustn’t become like him.

121
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,261
Hey, where are we going today?
Want to go check out the town?

122
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,639
Huh? Are you stupid?
We finally have a break from training, and...

123
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,349
You want me to ride my bike for an hour?
Idiot!

124
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,351
Then let’s go to Yamashita Cement..

125
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,020
Takada, you really love it there, huh?

126
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,397
Huh? Where’s Kirino?
- What’s up with him lately?

127
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,400
He hasn’t been around much.

128
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,402
Wait a sec!

129
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,158
Huh?

130
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,202
It’s this way!
- What is?

131
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:58,537
Shangri la!
- Shangri la?

132
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:01,582
A paradise that will welcome us...
- Haha...

133
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:05,961
Thai, right?
- Yes, Thailand.

134
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:09,631
One day, I want to go on a journey with you
to reach shangri la.

135
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,719
Just like YajiKita, on their jouney to Ise?

136
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,097
Yes, exactly,
except by the time we came back...

137
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:19,808
We’d become girls...
or something like that.

138
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,987
I figured out I’m no good with girls...

139
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:34,573
confirmed I’m 100% gay...

140
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,575
and interested with cross-dressing...

141
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:44,333
But if you ask me if I want to become a girl...

142
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,001
I’m not sure.

143
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:49,713
You don’t even use atashi even if it just us here, right?

144
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:52,758
Like I use it.

145
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,094
I still...

146
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,096
don’t really know myself yet.

147
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:04,520
Well... people lump us together so roughly, but...

148
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,898
everyone is different, you know. Same goes for us.

149
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,900
Yeah.

150
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,946
But...

151
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:20,035
I hope there comes a day when I can proudly say,
"This is who I am."

152
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,545
That's what I think.

153
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,845
After all, it's just a dream, right?

154
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:44,268
Yeah, that's right.

155
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:09,877
Hurry, hurry, hurry... come on.

156
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,211
Mmm! Mmm!

157
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:14,590
Ahh, ah, ahh... mmm...

158
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,258
Ahh, ahh...

159
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:20,304
Masa-chan, hehe.
- Eiko, I love you...

160
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,681
Oh man, it's them again.

161
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,683
It's the old couple from Tajiri, right?

162
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,728
This is messed up.
Those two are perverts!

163
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,730
Oh, but I got a little excited.

164
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,818
Seriously? But I'd rather see a normal couple...

165
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:37,779
Right? Yumeno.
- Huh? Oh...

166
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,534
Whoa!!
- Whoa!

167
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:44,578
Ahh!
What's the hell! It's you boneheads again!

168
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,580
This is bad, this is bad!
- Hey!

169
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,582
I'll tell your parents, you hear me!

170
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,960
Hey! Come back here!
- Uhh... uhh...

171
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,341
Hey!
Hey! Where are you going?

172
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,343
Hey!

173
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:04,097
I was born late in my mother's life.

174
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:07,142
Of course, I don't have any siblings.

175
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:11,146
So you can imagine my mom’s affection for me is

176
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:13,190
Incredibly strong.

177
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,903
You must be loved.
- Huh?

178
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,906
Heh... Yeah, I am.

179
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,909
I do love my mom.

180
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:26,328
But...

181
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,330
I hate my father.

182
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:32,376
My mother really wanted a child.

183
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,419
But my father didn't.

184
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:38,423
He was fed up with things like fertility treatments.

185
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:43,470
As soon as I was born, he ran off to his mistress.

186
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,182
They're still together even now.

187
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:49,226
That's the kind of man he is.

188
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,896
Why don't they divorce?

189
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:56,608
I wonder too, but... it's no use.

190
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:59,653
Mom cares too much about social appearance.

191
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,655
social appearance...

192
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:06,034
That’s why I’ve already given up.

193
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:13,083
I love my mom.

194
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:20,841
I don't want to make her go through any more pain.

195
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,884
I absolutely cannot be someone who

196
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:27,931
causes my mom any more suffering.

197
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:29,933
Me too.

198
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:35,689
My Dad died, the same year I was born.

199
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:40,652
Since then, my mom raised me all by herself.

200
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:45,073
My mom was an orphan.

201
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,164
So... All I have is her,

202
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,166
and all she has is me.

203
00:13:57,544 --> 00:14:01,256
Hahaha. This is the first time I've told anyone this.

204
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:03,258
Yeah.

205
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:12,642
I want to live life by my mom's side, supporting her.

206
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,773
I’ll get married like a normal person...

207
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:20,775
have kids like a normal person...

208
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:23,820
and expand my family

209
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,823
just like a normal person...

210
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:38,960
Hey, have you gotten a look at Mishima's boy,
Futoshi lately?

211
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,005
I saw, I saw!
He’s just like a girl!

212
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,007
Yeah! My boo even said

213
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:47,052
He's a hundred times cuter than me.
- What?!

214
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,054
Isn’t that rude?
- But, you know

215
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,097
Your husband has always been

216
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:53,099
so infatuated with the mother, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

217
00:14:53,099 --> 00:14:54,851
Really, that idiot!

218
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:59,856
But even if Futoshi is a boy, there’s no way he’d make a pass at a boy, right?

219
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:00,899
Well you never know...

220
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,235
Futoshi, has that same lewd scent as his mother...

221
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:07,238
Ahh!
- Right~.

222
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:09,240
What were you saying about my Futoshi?

223
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:12,577
Mi… Mishima-san…

224
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:14,996
I don’t care what you say about me, but

225
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:17,374
I’d like you to stop using my son

226
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,710
as your subject for your idle gossip, ‘kay Grannies?

227
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,087
Granny?!

228
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,423
Aren’t you a granny too?

229
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:28,134
Anyone who only gossips
about silly rumors

230
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:32,514
is an old hag regardless of age.

231
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,516
You think I’m lewd?

232
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,518
What in the world did you even see?

233
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,520
It’s probably from your stupid gossip, right?

234
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:49,656
Huh? Wha... What?

235
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:52,033
What was she trying to say?
Geez...

236
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:55,036
She's such a crude woman!
- Right~!

237
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:08,508
He’s late... way too late.

238
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:10,510
I'm baaack~.

239
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,264
Whoa!
- You're late, Taro!

240
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,266
You're way too late, Taro! Hmph!

241
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,977
What were you doing out this late?!
- That hurts...

242
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:23,690
Shut up, you old geezer!
I had club activities!

243
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,402
What did you call me?!
Old geezer, huh?!

244
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:29,737
Hiya!
Welcome back Taro~!

245
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:32,782
Look, Taro, your favorite spare ribs!

246
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:36,161
Oh, your spare ribs are the best honey!

247
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,164
Come on, Taro, say your thanks!

248
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,209
Alright, let's dig in.
- Thank you for the meal.

249
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:50,300
Wow, delicious! So good!

250
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,970
As expected of my honey!
You’re truly the perfect Japanese woman.

251
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,014
Spare ribs isn’t even a Japanese dish?

252
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,223
Like damn, you old geezer!

253
00:16:57,223 --> 00:16:59,350
Talking to your parent like that...

254
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,729
What the hell, you fucking shithead!

255
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,772
Ah! Hey!
Hehe. Ahaha.

256
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:08,109
Wait, wait!
Hey! Taro! Taro!

257
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:11,821
Wait, Taro! Taro!

258
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:15,533
It's lively here.
- Taro!

259
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:18,578
Hahaha! Haha.

260
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,580
I'm home!

261
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,207
Oh, welcome back.

262
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,168
Sorry, baby.

263
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:27,962
I went shopping and got home late.

264
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:31,341
Oh you made dinner already!

265
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:35,053
Oh, thank you.

266
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,346
Dad, I'm home.

267
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,766
Today, your son made dinner for us.

268
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:42,810
Can’t wait to eat it.
- It's just a simple stir-fry.

269
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,812
Hmm?

270
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:48,191
Alright! Let's eat!

271
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:50,902
Wow, delish!

272
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:54,238
Regarding the challenges of the information age

273
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:57,951
the rapid growth of information and communication technology

274
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,996
has made it easier to quickly process large amounts of data

275
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:06,042
and access essential information through the internet

276
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:10,088
improving efficiency and skills in handling information

277
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:13,758
In other words, the means and skills to handle information...

278
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:15,802
Mishima.

279
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:18,846
I told you the next time you're spacing out
I’d have to punish you, right?

280
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:21,516
Hehe.
- Sorry.

281
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,518
Alright, penalty it is.

282
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:25,561
After school,
come to the social studies prep room.

283
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:29,607
What?! Wait, sensei,
what kind of penalty is it?

284
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,984
Hmm... 100 butt slaps.

285
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:33,986
Hahaha!
Oh crap!

286
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:35,988
Spanking?
That's like punishment for kids.

287
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:38,032
Im sure homos would probably

288
00:18:38,032 --> 00:18:40,034
enjoy spanking, right?
- True!

289
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:43,413
Hey, Yumeno stop it!
Alright, let's continue the class.

290
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,416
Uh... uh... where were we?
Uh...

291
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:51,212
Mishima.
- What?

292
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:53,172
Are you going to the prep room now?

293
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:56,551
Well...
I can't really skip it.

294
00:18:56,551 --> 00:19:00,221
Be careful.
- Huh?

295
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:04,308
Ah, no, it's just...there's something about Yanagida's eyes...

296
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:06,644
Hey, Kirino!
What are you doing?

297
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:07,812
Hurry up, we're doing training!

298
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:11,023
You homo couple can't seem to be apart, huh.
- Tch!

299
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:14,026
You're being too loud!
- Wait! Whoa!

300
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:25,121
Ok, stick your butt out and put your hands here.

301
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:30,209
Huh? You’re really going to spank me?

302
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:33,212
Of course.
What? You thought that was a joke?

303
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:36,299
Hands here, now.

304
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,904
"One."

305
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:04,202
Why did you become friends with Mishima?

306
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:07,121
We're not, really.
- Don't lie.

307
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:10,249
You actually like Mishima, don't you?

308
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:11,918
That's you, isn’t it?

309
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:14,253
Idiot!
There's no way that could happen!

310
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:16,297
Yumeno!
- You're being called.

311
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:18,299
Alright, one point!

312
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:22,345
Its your fault.

313
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:28,059
93.

314
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:31,103
94.

315
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,730
S-sensei...
- 95.

316
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,814
(he got a boner)

317
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:42,531
96.

318
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:44,533
97.

319
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:50,289
98.

320
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,338
99.

321
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:02,385
Mishima...

322
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:07,807
100!

323
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:13,145
Hey, Mishima!
Did the butt spanking feel good?

324
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:18,567
Hey, Yumeno! We're in the middle of practice!

325
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,569
What?
Stop ignoring me, Mishima!

326
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:23,280
Don't ignore me too, Yumeno.

327
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,282
Geez... Hurry back!
