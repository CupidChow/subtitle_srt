1
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,666
CJ ENTERTAINMENT and OPUS PICTURES present

2
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,969
a ZIP CINEMA production

3
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:53,971
Father...

4
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,893
Do they really exist in our world?

5
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,270
Who are you referring to?

6
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:06,942
12 demons, the manifestations.

7
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,986
Don't you see?

8
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,906
They are hiding in plain sight.

9
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,619
Then, what are they doing?

10
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:25,628
As noted in Revelation, they're at the core of wars, and all tragedies.

11
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,881
Then why do they hide?

12
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,675
When their existence is revealed,

13
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:35,346
even the unbelievers will praise the Lord.

14
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,893
A call came from the Rosicrucianism.

15
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:47,108
One of the manifestations was reported in Korea.

16
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:52,363
I cannot get a hold of Father Jung in Korea.

17
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,160
You mean, we must do it ourselves?

18
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:05,668
Seoul

19
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:20,933
I got him!

20
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,352
Let's go! There's no time!

21
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:24,937
Hurry up!

22
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:46,959
Turn it around!

23
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,148
Lord... Don't forsaken us...

24
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:19,301
Exorcism: religious practice of evicting demons from a person

25
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:26,767
Magnus Exorcimus: Exorcism ritual permitted by church according to Canon Law 1172

26
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:50,624
PRIEST: a person authorized to perform the sacred rituals.

27
00:04:55,004 --> 00:05:01,677
Assistant Deacon: Priest's assistant

28
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:12,229
Possessed: The host of evil possession

29
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:21,530
12 manifestations: Forms of evil that is tracked by the Rosicrucianism

30
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:31,040
Written and directed by JANG Jae-hyun

31
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,426
THE PRIESTS

32
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,269
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seoul

33
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,984
His name is Father Kim Bum-shin,

34
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,071
he conducted exorcism with Father Jung,

35
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:05,532
who's retired now and hospitalized.

36
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:10,079
He's been uncontrollable even in the seminary.

37
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,459
- Isn't he known in the Order too? - He's a hooligan.

38
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:21,048
I demoted him to province, but he's back now...

39
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,385
He's absolutely careless!

40
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,053
I see.

41
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:32,726
So he requested Vatican's authorization before consulting us.

42
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:39,108
The possessed is a high school girl named Lee Young-shin.

43
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:43,529
Exorcism is required in such case.

44
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,700
Father Jung normally conducted the ritual,

45
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,495
and I was his assistant.

46
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,002
You've put us on the spot, Father Kim.

47
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,380
Father.

48
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:05,342
You should've at least come to me first.

49
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,344
How could you do this?

50
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,640
How many times have I come to you?

51
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,352
You always said this wasn't important.

52
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,146
How many times have you cried wolf?!

53
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,691
And imagine the backlash

54
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:23,318
when your exorcism goes public!

55
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,279
I'm told you know the patient.

56
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,283
Yes, she was part of my Seoul congregation,

57
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:33,245
she showed signs of demonic invasion.

58
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:38,250
Can't you just pray for her, and some psychiatric therapy?

59
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,712
Sure, diagnosis is part of it.

60
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,673
After making contact, I'll diagnose her,

61
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,801
and figure out if she requires psychiatric therapy.

62
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,974
I can't sleep, Father. I hear weird noises.

63
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,436
- What kind? - Everything.

64
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,481
Even the bugs talking outside.

65
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,406
Deciding factor is the animals' reaction to the possessed.

66
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,327
If it's a minor demonic interference,

67
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:17,164
it can be expelled with a simple procedure.

68
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,250
If it's not a minor interference?

69
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,463
That's very unlikely in our country.

70
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,843
Then it could be one of 12 manifestations

71
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,346
that is tracked by the Rosicrucianism.

72
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,768
I know.

73
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,146
I do.

74
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:48,487
Humans are... creatures of duality.

75
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,699
We all celebrate birth of Jesus on Christmas,

76
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,828
but when things like this happen, we bring up logic and reason.

77
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,457
Even us, who lead a life of faith...

78
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,545
Watch it! The bishop is present.

79
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,715
I don't know what you're all afraid of,

80
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,093
but a child is in great pain.

81
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,844
Will you look the other way?

82
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,933
I hear you loud and clear.

83
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,772
You know what'll happen when this goes public.

84
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:27,359
So I officially renounce your actions.

85
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,821
Do you understand? OFFICIALLY.

86
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,365
I must be on my way. Continue your meeting.

87
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,502
My Lord...

88
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:52,509
As noted on this authorization form, you'll need a doctor and an assistant.

89
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,137
Do you already have someone in mind?

90
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:59,016
I'm in talks with Catholic U's Dr. Park Hyun-jin.

91
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,812
Even though assistant deacon will assist with the ritual,

92
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:09,943
his role is so crucial that he'll be my equal.

93
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:15,365
Picking the right candidate is decisive for this reason.

94
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,785
We'll complete this in a week.

95
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,955
She's a child, there won't be a problem.

96
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:23,248
Young-shin.

97
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,626
Don't do this, please open this door.

98
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,920
It's me. Young-shin?

99
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,946
6 months later

100
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,534
Why bring up her suicide attempt now?

101
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,580
We're not affiliated with that priest.

102
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:08,752
If there was an exorcism, probably a cult. Right?

103
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:14,257
We cannot reveal a list of graduates for privacy reasons.

104
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,218
It's a matter of the Order.

105
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:24,601
You're barking up the wrong tree here.

106
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,396
I'm hanging up now.

107
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,648
Student Records

108
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,859
How did you end up here at the seminary?

109
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:37,739
The Order was a dead-end, so I had to come here.

110
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,370
Assistant for exorcism...

111
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,622
Shall we get started?

112
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,624
Let's see...

113
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:52,796
The assistant must translate words of the possessed,

114
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:56,508
so he should be fluent in Latin, German, and Chinese.

115
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:06,727
Since he has to face demons, he must be courageous and bold.

116
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,396
So someone with balls.

117
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,779
He must be able to resist the temptations of demons.

118
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,495
He must also have endurance to last prolonged ritual.

119
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,378
Heaven-born, huh.

120
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:38,592
If he was in Father Jung's 'Totemism and Freedom' class,

121
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,760
he should know the basics of the ritual.

122
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,387
...with God at times...

123
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,556
Son of a bitch!

124
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,435
Demons will possess your body while you sleep!

125
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,729
Demons?!

126
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,023
I'm sorry.

127
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,777
Lastly, born on the year of tiger, as referenced by the Orders.

128
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:01,698
Year of the tiger? So... born in 1986...

129
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,574
Choi Joon-ho DOB April 15, 1986

130
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,660
Born with an innate link to the afterlife.

131
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,872
Why him...

132
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,085
Slow down, abbess, you look tired.

133
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,754
This is slow.

134
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,758
Is the dean really mad?

135
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:23,678
I prayed too hard, so this semester's grades...

136
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,389
Sounds like the birth of an ordained minister.

137
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:30,644
So the last'll be first, and the first'll be last,

138
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,313
Matthew 20:16.

139
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,652
7th year, Deacon Choi Joon-ho.

140
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:39,611
Yes.

141
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,696
Born in 1986, the year of tiger, right?

142
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:45,116
Your parents didn't mess with your birth records?

143
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,327
Of course not.

144
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,538
All right...

145
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,082
How's your life here?

146
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,961
Very well, thanks to the Lord's grace.

147
00:13:56,294 --> 00:14:02,008
Only Lord's grace would've gotten you this far, right?

148
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,846
Now...

149
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,306
There's good news and bad news.

150
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,766
Take your pick.

151
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,853
The good news, of course.

152
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,729
Good news is,

153
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,941
the Pope is visiting us next month.

154
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:23,697
So, our choir will practice during summer vacation.

155
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,869
That is indeed great news.

156
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,497
And the bad news is,

157
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:36,126
you won't be in the practice.

158
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,378
Why me?

159
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,885
Father Kim Bum-shin from the Order of Friars Minor,

160
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:50,682
he and Father Jung were unofficially part of Rosicrucianism.

161
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:56,563
He's been exorcising a girl since last winter.

162
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,233
But she recently attempted suicide,

163
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,277
and she's in coma now.

164
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:09,951
Some of us have been unofficially assisting him.

165
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:18,084
But his assistant from the Order recently backed out.

166
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,338
You don't mean...

167
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,174
It's no big deal, just follow him around.

168
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,717
As his assistant.

169
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,345
Why me?

170
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,263
Let's drop this nonsense.

171
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,224
Just focus on the choir practice.

172
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,896
I'm perfect for this.

173
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:47,864
Father Kim left this for you, read it carefully.

174
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,659
Tight lips.

175
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,786
Holy tongue.

176
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:57,207
There's an address of his last assistant.

177
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,376
Go talk to him, he'll fill you in.

178
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,212
He supposedly went dark,

179
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,881
but maybe he'll meet his successor.

180
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,468
Go find out what happened.

181
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,178
44 Jangwui Street, 2nd floor

182
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,877
Deacon Park?

183
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,963
Who are you?

184
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,799
I was sent by the dean.

185
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,885
Why would he?

186
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,889
I'm Father Kim's new assistant.

187
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,566
The front door was open, so I just walked in.

188
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:08,028
Sorry for interrupting your lunch.

189
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,696
Seminarian?

190
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,032
Deacon, sir.

191
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,827
Now they're sending in little children.

192
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,914
I'm not one, I'm almost 30.

193
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,960
If you're also a tiger, then...

194
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,255
You're 54?

195
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,923
I'm 42.

196
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:39,976
This is the notebook, kept by the assistant.

197
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,937
For recording...

198
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,650
the ritual.

199
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:53,823
Deacon, why did you quit your position?

200
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,909
I... wasn't feeling well,

201
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,746
and had family issues to attend to.

202
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,332
What's the family issue?

203
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:06,044
What's it to you? What're you really asking?

204
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,879
I'm sorry.

205
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,220
Boy.

206
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,182
Listen to me very carefully.

207
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,476
If you get involved...

208
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,067
Deacon Park, open this door.

209
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,698
Let me see you, come on out.

210
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,168
Hey, I can see you sitting there.

211
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,087
Come on out.

212
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,006
I won't, Father.

213
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,176
You've reached the head church this time.

214
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,137
They'll send you someone.

215
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,680
I'm out of this now.

216
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,099
This isn't right.

217
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,060
How can newbies take on this work?

218
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:08,189
It's almost finished, let me in, moron!

219
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,607
This isn't a joke!

220
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,068
Do you honestly believe that?

221
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,653
You should wake up too.

222
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,530
One last time!

223
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,031
Don't you feel sorry for her?

224
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,033
No! Just let me be!

225
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,435
Did he do something wrong?

226
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,895
Go away.

227
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,981
I'm sorry.

228
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,149
I'll be on my way.

229
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,069
- Deacon Park... - What?

230
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,741
Is there really something?

231
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,329
Yeah, of course.

232
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,247
That crazy bastard.

233
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,379
Rosicrucianism...

234
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,124
What? "Epilepsy"?

235
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,212
I saw it on TV. I know myself the best.

236
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,341
I heard I can get better with a brain surgery.

237
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,721
What's that in your pocket?

238
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:27,889
Huh?

239
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,224
It's a tape recorder.

240
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,186
Huh? Why's this here?

241
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,196
Young-shin, are you itchy?

242
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,656
Why do you keep scratching?

243
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,410
You touched me, Father.

244
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,287
Like you did before.

245
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,874
I really liked you, why're you doing this to me?

246
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,209
Please don't.

247
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,962
But I haven't told my dad yet.

248
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,885
- No... - Opus est ire ab hic!

249
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,727
Escape...

250
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,397
'Must escape'?

251
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,150
Speak some sense!

252
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:25,321
The deaths of our 2 priests

253
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,282
and this girl must be linked somehow.

254
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,869
The Lord tests us like this.

255
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,288
Maybe this is good.

256
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:21,502
Look at me!

257
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,921
- Remember my voice. - Don't look at her!

258
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,424
I'll turn your mother's tits into stones!

259
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:27,258
Deacon Park!

260
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,687
Who's there?

261
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:47,862
Hall director? I'm sorry. I'll go to bed.

262
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,686
Had a nightmare?

263
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,439
Yes...

264
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,109
What was it about?

265
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,906
I killed a dog.

266
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,580
Good. You'll have to help me.

267
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:16,510
Today is July 15 in lunar calendar,

268
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,805
known in Buddhism as 'Festival of Hungry Ghost.'

269
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,767
Yin energy is at its strongest,

270
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:26,479
and the spirits perform acts of charity.

271
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,484
Our only chance to save her.

272
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,627
Hop in, I'll take you to the subway.

273
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,300
I almost missed you.

274
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,302
Why head out so early?

275
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,139
Gotta pick something up from Catholic Archdiocese.

276
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,600
Making you jump through hoops.

277
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:50,688
The primary exorcist is already exposed,

278
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:54,358
so all prep must be done by his assistant.

279
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,694
You studied quite a bit.

280
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:01,741
So it'll be first time meeting Father Kim?

281
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,785
Yes, we only talked over the phone.

282
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:06,537
Nervous?

283
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,874
I'm sure there's nothing.

284
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:11,917
But I'm curious.

285
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,670
Curious, eh?

286
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:20,926
Remember what the pope said during his inaugural address?

287
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,555
It was, uh...

288
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,938
'With man's brilliant intellect and reason.'

289
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:38,903
Catholicism is a logical and mainstream religion.

290
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:45,284
We fought against superstition and irrationality,

291
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:48,746
and built a reputation that fits modern world.

292
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,585
You're going on your free will,

293
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,797
but not on an official capacity.

294
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,799
Yes, I understand.

295
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:05,679
And you won't be just assisting Father Kim.

296
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,365
Italian priests' accident Young-shin's hit-and-run

297
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:30,704
I am the light of this world

298
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:35,751
Leading the people,

299
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:40,756
out of darkness

300
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,676
Lives of!

301
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:44,885
Young-shin.

302
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:50,558
Let's find another way. Choir is not the way for you.

303
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:52,685
Father!

304
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,728
I'm really good!

305
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,900
Snap out of it!

306
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,927
And I got a call from Deacon Park.

307
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,723
He says Kim's been molesting the child.

308
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,184
Film the ritual secretly.

309
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:38,814
The bishop'd like to know what's going on over there.

310
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,776
Keep taps on everything he does.

311
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,697
He must be stopped.

312
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,897
Even news, variety shows and dramas are 3D-capable.

313
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,442
If you press this button, 3D comes alive.

314
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,945
And to heighten the 3D effect...

315
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:28,822
Father Monsignor, I'm Deacon Choi.

316
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,991
Father Kim sent me.

317
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,826
Father Kim?

318
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,120
Father Kim Bum-shin...

319
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,289
Father Kim Bum...

320
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,670
You sent it 2 weeks ago?

321
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,922
Then why isn't it here yet?

322
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,841
Contact the courier at once,

323
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,762
and find out if it arrived in Korea.

324
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,473
God bless.

325
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,729
Do you need it today?

326
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:04,191
Yes, Father Kim really needs it...

327
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,986
- Yes? -today...

328
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,655
They said they sent it.

329
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:22,876
Father!

330
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,170
Father Kim!

331
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,589
Father Jung... he's...

332
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:31,010
Give him a good send off. He went through so much.

333
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:34,555
- I got other matters... - That's not it.

334
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,683
He came out of the coma.

335
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,397
It'll arrive tomorrow or the day after.

336
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,607
I'll give you a call as soon as it arrives.

337
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,693
You moron!

338
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,069
That's their problem.

339
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,364
This is nonsense, I requested it so long ago!

340
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:55,200
There's nothing I can do, they didn't...

341
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,994
I don't care, whatever.

342
00:33:56,994 --> 00:34:00,497
Fly to Italy and steal or make one.

343
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,791
You only told me about it today...

344
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:03,751
Shut it.

345
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,128
Go pray until it arrives.

346
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,964
So, why ask me to do it...

347
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:11,091
Moron, then is it my fault?

348
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,552
Youths nowadays have no persistence.

349
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,765
Please... please... please...

350
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:18,891
Please!

351
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:24,813
There's no point in begging to me!

352
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,148
I'll call you back.

353
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,193
What a fruitcake...

354
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,574
- How is he? - It's still bad.

355
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:40,496
That's weird, why does he smell so bad?

356
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,082
What smell?

357
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:49,463
Ever since he came to, there's strong rotting odor.

358
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:57,596
Agnes, go take a break. I'll go inside alone.

359
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,599
- I'll call when I need you. - Okay.

360
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:35,259
Look who it is! Bum-shin's here.

361
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:39,138
Do you know how much I missed you?

362
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,307
You don't look so well.

363
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,813
Is something the matter?

364
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:51,775
You know exactly why.

365
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,620
I'm heavy, aren't I?

366
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:07,374
Indeed, like I'm lifting several people.

367
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,673
Bum-shin.

368
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:20,053
I dreamt about heaven last night.

369
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,307
You should have stayed there.

370
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,184
When I was there,

371
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:31,732
a huge white spider slowly crawled over to me.

372
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:33,984
A Spider?

373
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:36,904
When it was near me,

374
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:45,078
the scent was mesmerizing, that in itself was heaven.

375
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:46,288
Then?

376
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,461
I stood there, and the spider bit my leg.

377
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:55,130
That must've hurt.

378
00:36:55,589 --> 00:37:01,887
But instead of pain, my mind became clearer.

379
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:06,058
And I suddenly thought of you.

380
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,144
You scolded me so much when I was a pupil.

381
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:14,650
You mustn't say that, I care deeply for you.

382
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:20,489
Bum-shin, could you stay with me today?

383
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,659
I don't have much time now.

384
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,912
Let go of my hand, you know how busy I am.

385
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,080
Where you going?

386
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:32,668
Will you refuse your mentor's last request?

387
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,796
How dare you!

388
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,423
A petty demon will not stop my divine work!

389
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,721
Who else is with you?!

390
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,668
Where is he?!

391
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:19,589
Expel all evil spirits and demons that wish us harm

392
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,133
back to hell.

393
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,217
Where is he?!

394
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,409
Deacon Park!

395
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,245
What do you need him for?

396
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:58,253
- It's... nothing... - Who are you?

397
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,301
Father Kim sent me.

398
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,011
Father Kim?

399
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,186
Park's already gone to his parents'.

400
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:16,271
Then!

401
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:18,982
What about the piglet?

402
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:20,525
Piglet?

403
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:27,366
- Park's piglet? - Right.

404
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,163
I was getting fond of him.

405
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,335
Deacon.

406
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:42,214
He gets diarrhea when he eats spicy food.

407
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:46,593
And he's potty-trained if you keep the door open.

408
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:55,477
Son!

409
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:58,855
Come here for a sec.

410
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:09,366
So you're Park's replacement?

411
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,244
- Yes, that's right... - What for?

412
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,790
The dean asked me to...

413
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,042
Know how many there were?

414
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:21,378
Pardon?

415
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:24,214
Over 10 deacons went there to assist him.

416
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,174
Go home.

417
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,969
Who'll you go with today?

418
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,682
Where is he now?

419
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,727
Please tell me, Bum-shin.

420
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:40,856
I need to know where he is!

421
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:42,899
I have to stop you!

422
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,277
Tell me...

423
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:49,656
Who's the male accompanying you?

424
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,076
I'm going alone today.

425
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,162
That's why I must go!

426
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:00,250
Dean asked me to find out.

427
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:05,714
I'll uncover the truth, find out what is going on.

428
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:11,470
I wasted a life away.

429
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:18,685
I wasted all my energy on a useless cause.

430
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:22,606
'Yet what is due me is in the Lord's hand,

431
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,233
and my reward is with my God,'

432
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,402
Isaiah 49:4.

433
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:32,407
It's your favorite passage.

434
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,917
Till the end...

435
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,611
Known as the bell of St. Francis,

436
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,825
monks rang the bell as they walked past the demon forest.

437
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,537
St. Francis made it himself.

438
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,542
It's one of Assist's most prized artifacts.

439
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,087
I guess he really needs it for the ritual.

440
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,255
Hey!

441
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,384
You be careful.

442
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,554
You know what I mean?

443
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:51,486
Our Father in heaven, shelter us from evil.

444
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:56,449
Protect me, Lord, from the power of the wicked;

445
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,660
protect me from evildoers...

446
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:21,516
Yes, I'm here.

447
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:23,685
The moon?

448
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,521
No, it's not up yet.

449
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:30,358
Yes, across the street.

450
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:31,735
Okay, I'll be there shor...

451
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,450
It's like he's training a mutt.

452
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:39,659
Let's go.

453
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:51,338
Her father sued, but they settled out of court.

454
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:55,258
Keep taps on everything he does.

455
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,219
He must be stopped.

456
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:10,065
Evening!

457
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,401
I'm Choi Joon-ho.

458
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:17,572
Go tie the pig outside. This is a pork restaurant!

459
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,158
Where's basic decency?

460
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,081
I'm sorry.

461
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,172
I don't even know him.

462
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,801
The Order and the Catholic church...

463
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,304
He sounds so natural, right?

464
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,978
You look like a mormon.

465
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,105
What?

466
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:53,566
I get that sometimes.

467
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,612
As green as it gets.

468
00:44:58,446 --> 00:44:59,531
Sit down.

469
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,913
- Where do you live? - Yong-in, near Seoul.

470
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,958
- Hometown? - I was born and raised there.

471
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,043
House value must've shot up.

472
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:15,880
- Parents' occupation? - They're both educators.

473
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:18,508
- Both Catholics? - No, just mother.

474
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,634
Siblings?

475
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,597
Had... a younger sister...

476
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:28,601
Car accident?

477
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,105
Well, something like that.

478
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:33,648
Suicide?

479
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,527
No, it was an accident.

480
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:38,862
What kind?

481
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,823
Spit it out.

482
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,243
Don't answer, if you don't want to.

483
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:49,706
Mauled by a dog when she was 9.

484
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,584
Seriously? This is amusing.

485
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:55,336
Tell me in detail.

486
00:45:57,756 --> 00:45:59,632
Why is that so amusing?

487
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,676
You know...

488
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:06,431
Why are you so worked up? It's all in the past.

489
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,601
Let's see...

490
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:14,189
When killed by an animal, you're stuck in purgatory.

491
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:16,941
What a pity...

492
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:19,569
I'm getting teary.

493
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:28,703
Coming from a family of educators, you had to become a clergy.

494
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:35,168
You're torturing yourself to get through the seminary.

495
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:40,590
They've no idea that you want to be a priest

496
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:46,304
to allow your sister to move on in the afterlife.

497
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,144
Amusing, indeed.

498
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,688
Not even close?

499
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:59,359
You must know a lot, since you're an exorcist.

500
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:02,028
We all got a sob story, you're no different.

501
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:05,782
What about you then? What's so special about you?

502
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:10,870
Am I too green to know?

503
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:23,633
- Want a drink? - I don't drink.

504
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,635
Whatever.

505
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:30,306
Why did Deacon Park quit?

506
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:34,477
He was a chicken shit, and we didn't get along.

507
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,983
Everyone's mincing words.

508
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:41,734
Demons are like criminals.

509
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:45,321
They hide if they're exposed.

510
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,033
Exposing them is half the battle.

511
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:53,955
This is only possible because it possessed a female.

512
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:57,792
It must've been desperate, and lucky for us.

513
00:47:58,251 --> 00:48:00,044
Then why not just capture it?

514
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,090
Yeah.

515
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:07,510
Just like that.

516
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:16,227
Come by often, I miss you around here.

517
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,771
Hold still, it's moving!

518
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,858
Was that the foot?

519
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,028
Take care of yourself!

520
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:38,541
I'm due next month. Come see your nephew!

521
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:44,797
He looks skinnier. Is he the right one?

522
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,341
Yes, I confirmed it.

523
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:50,345
- Park filled you in? - Yes.

524
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:52,555
He didn't say anything else?

525
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:55,224
He said there's nothing to it.

526
00:48:58,770 --> 00:48:59,771
Buddy.

527
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:04,067
We're on our way to meet a 5,000-year old bastard.

528
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,819
Stay alert.

529
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:21,417
Be gone!

530
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:51,489
Did you study properly?

531
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:53,658
'The demons begged Jesus,

532
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:55,910
If you cast us out, send us into that herd of pigs.'

533
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:58,037
Matthew 8:32.

534
00:49:58,246 --> 00:49:59,747
I know all about it.

535
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:28,151
We're here.

536
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,153
Top floor.

537
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,488
Let me have a smoke first.

538
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,663
Scared?

539
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:43,041
No.

540
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,917
Exorcism is a battle of the will.

541
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,546
Think of ourselves as a hired gang.

542
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:53,468
The residents refuse to leave, so we must kick them out.

543
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,720
I'll take care of everything,

544
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,431
if you stick to the manual, you won't be exposed.

545
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:04,270
Don't ever look at it, reply, or listen.

546
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,273
Use the language I assign...

547
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:08,858
once we get a reaction...

548
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:19,494
Did you see something?

549
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:23,039
No, Father.

550
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:25,833
We got ourselves a sensitive one.

551
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,794
Am I not allowed to be?

552
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,047
Always getting the last word, eh?

553
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,592
Tell me about its attributes.

554
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:37,887
Manifestations are divided into lion, snake and scorpion forms,

555
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:41,307
Nanjing, China was first place to discover this demon in 1941...

556
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:43,935
Okay. Our objective and expulsion methods.

557
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,979
The objective is forcing it to say its name.

558
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:48,940
We then transfer it to a new host, we...

559
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,365
They must feel you.

560
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:59,367
Let's head up.

561
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:22,807
Talk to me, you brat!

562
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:25,226
It's not biting?

563
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,104
No... I'm sorry.

564
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:35,528
Goddammit. What the hell!

565
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:41,742
Hey! Don't look! Are you nuts?

566
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,710
Let's switch it up.

567
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,550
This is all part of the process. Today's the last session.

568
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:02,263
- I signed the organ donation form. - You know that he's trying!

569
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:04,390
- And who made her like that?! - But we settled.

570
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:08,769
- You can't do shit with $20,000! - Today really is the last session.

571
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:20,990
Sounds like a shaman ritual.

572
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:24,035
That's Shaman Jechun, he's actually pretty good.

573
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,331
He's going all out today.

574
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:03,491
The host must be holding the demon inside.

575
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,661
Lead her to heaven.

576
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:09,288
So you're instructing me to kill her?

577
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:12,500
Don't think of it as murder.

578
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:17,296
If you capture it now, you'll prevent future possessions.

579
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,674
This is absolutely nuts!

580
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:22,969
We are talking about a high school girl!

581
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:25,972
You're doing your job.

582
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:12,184
Father, you're back again.

583
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:16,689
Yes. I came today to kill you.

584
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:51,515
What did you see?

585
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,642
Yeah, blood!

586
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,979
Nothing works. It's a snake.

587
00:55:57,396 --> 00:56:01,150
- It's a male. - No such a thing in our country.

588
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,944
Is she your daughter? Didn't she run away?

589
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,324
What can she do? She's born to be a shaman.

590
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:11,077
Yeah, it's her destiny.

591
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,578
Holy Communion is ready.

592
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,080
Okay, I'll be right up.

593
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:16,832
You got a real tiger this time.

594
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,334
But much too young.

595
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,170
Young, and pain in the ass.

596
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:34,392
- Your Christian name? - Agatho, Father.

597
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,019
Who gave it to you?

598
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:39,688
I picked it myself, I didn't want a common name.

599
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:53,828
Could've bought a better wine.

600
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,134
Leave that and face me.

601
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:10,594
What is that?

602
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:12,513
It's...

603
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:14,765
women's secretion.

604
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:18,436
It doesn't exist in our clergy world.

605
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:20,271
Turn around.

606
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:25,234
Think of it as a disguise.

607
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:27,653
Male gains strength from male energy.

608
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,031
So we disguise ourselves with that.

609
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,370
Dr. Park went out of his way to obtain it.

610
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,126
That's enough.

611
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,337
This is toothpaste, rub it under your nose.

612
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,276
Dr. Park, let's get to work!

613
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,486
I'm coming!

614
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:14,992
Be professional, guys.

615
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,664
Be professional!

616
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:50,903
Known as 'malodor',

617
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:53,572
the host secretes rotting meat stench.

618
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:57,034
Heard about her fall from her hospital room?

619
00:58:57,493 --> 00:58:59,537
Attempted suicide on February 10th.

620
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,539
Suicide my ass.

621
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,707
It tried to escape.

622
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,504
It tried to find a new male host by killing her.

623
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:13,509
Here, sign it.

624
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:21,308
Go on, get ready.

625
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:28,250
Bask in the full moon.

626
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,503
This happens once a year.

627
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:45,726
Spray it well. That's your lifeline.

628
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,228
Yes, Father.

629
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,107
Stay a meter behind the salt,

630
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:54,443
prepare the notebook and manual.

631
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:55,444
Yes.

632
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:58,489
Begin with St. Michael's prayer, in Korean, English and Latin.

633
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,948
Okay, I got it.

634
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,493
Freedom prayer for protection.

635
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:03,702
Okay.

636
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,084
I will now begin recording.

637
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:12,628
Begin the prayer.

638
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:17,508
Blessed Michael, Archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.

639
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:21,512
Protect us against the snares of the devil.

640
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:24,556
Speak in the name of the Lord.

641
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:29,561
Gihon Araxes Arakhtu,

642
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:31,563
Jukha.

643
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:43,951
Gihon Araxes Arakhtu Jukha.

644
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:56,630
You are the light that shines all evil.

645
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:09,017
Expel all evil spirits and demons that wish us harm back to hell.

646
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:12,646
Amen.

647
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:15,190
Take it out.

648
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:40,716
Tell them everything that happens here firsthand.

649
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,431
No one will believe you, though.

650
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:53,395
Father...

651
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,400
I...

652
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,029
think I'm okay now.

653
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,619
I feel so much better.

654
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:12,623
Thank you, Father.

655
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:18,378
Could you untie me?

656
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:21,673
Defend us in the hour of conflict.

657
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:26,094
- Shield us from evil... - It's me, Young-shin.

658
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:30,808
I'm all better now.

659
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,773
Could you call mom and the doctor?

660
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:45,197
If anyone's there, please stop this man.

661
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:49,493
...expel all demons back to hell.

662
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:53,664
Mom, dad... Help me.

663
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:58,377
He touched me...

664
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:02,172
- Blessed Michael... - Anyone there?

665
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:08,846
I said he touched me.

666
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,764
Help me...

667
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:17,020
Stop it! You adulterer!

668
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,533
Bach...

669
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,285
Bach!

670
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:50,924
Open your eyes.

671
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,468
The Lord is calling you.

672
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,031
Damn Bach.

673
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:03,038
I convinced him to rape his sister-in-law.

674
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:08,376
He was a pussy.

675
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,546
The father of lies, and the first murderer.

676
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,928
The father of lies, and the first murderer.

677
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:21,932
In the name of the Holy Spirit, where did you come from?

678
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:24,726
In the name of the Holy Spirit,

679
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:27,270
where did you come from?

680
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:31,650
We are everywhere, here and elsewhere.

681
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:34,569
We have travelled everywhere.

682
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:38,740
We have possessed 2,430 people.

683
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:43,578
How long have you been here?

684
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:46,957
How long have you been here! Speak!

685
01:08:53,964 --> 01:08:57,092
When there were only

686
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:02,973
3,254,630 of you apes.

687
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,308
How long will you stay?

688
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,936
How long will you stay?

689
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:10,814
Speak!

690
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:12,899
How long will you stay?

691
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,986
Speak! How long will you stay?

692
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:20,824
You have been exposed.

693
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:21,950
There's nothing but suffering here.

694
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,702
You have been exposed.

695
01:09:23,702 --> 01:09:25,829
There's nothing but suffering here.

696
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,124
Suffering?

697
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:37,924
Pain, plagues, famines, wars, peace,

698
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:41,428
I've been with you all.

699
01:09:43,555 --> 01:09:45,682
Just look at the history.

700
01:09:56,318 --> 01:09:59,029
In the name of the Holy Spirit,

701
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,488
why have you come?

702
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:03,909
In the name of the Holy Spirit,

703
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:05,702
why have you come?

704
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:10,373
Listen, enlightened one,

705
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:14,502
walk away and live a blissful life.

706
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:17,130
Homo sapiens pests!

707
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:19,090
- Speak, you beast. - Speak!

708
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:22,052
- Why have you come? - Why have you come?

709
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:27,807
We came to prove that you're nothing but monkeys.

710
01:10:28,225 --> 01:10:30,936
Homo sapiens! Sapiens!

711
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:35,232
Who is the one you serve?!

712
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:39,277
You cannot hear the voice of the Fallen Star.

713
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:46,952
He has already won! Why have you come?

714
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:50,121
We are just hiding.

715
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:52,707
We will not be exposed again.

716
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:57,128
I need a male...

717
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:06,471
You are not listening to me!

718
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,101
This rotting piece of meat is keeping us here.

719
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:13,270
We will find a safer place!

720
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,647
This whore will not let us go!

721
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:19,067
How many are there?

722
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:20,819
4 languages so far.

723
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:23,989
They're out in the open. Get Holy water and red blinder.

724
01:11:24,114 --> 01:11:25,407
We will prove it.

725
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,909
You are nothing but apes.

726
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:32,080
We must get it to say its name.

727
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:35,041
- Bring the package. - Okay.

728
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:47,512
Lord please watch over us and protect us from evil...

729
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:51,016
Protect us from evil...

730
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:56,062
Lord please watch over us...

731
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:04,195
Francis...

732
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:25,842
Darkness will subside and He will come!

733
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:30,764
Darkness will subside and He will come!

734
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:37,687
Hear ye, to the voice that calls you!

735
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:51,326
In the name of living saints, be gone, demons.

736
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:53,471
Mom!

737
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:58,601
Mom...

738
01:14:03,398 --> 01:14:05,275
Mom...

739
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:13,491
Father...

740
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:27,714
In the name of Archangel...

741
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:35,346
In the name of Archangel Michael and the angels in heaven...

742
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:36,764
Help me...

743
01:14:58,286 --> 01:14:59,454
Agatho...

744
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:02,749
Snap out of it, Agatho!

745
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:26,689
Are you new?

746
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:33,404
Male...

747
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,615
Male!

748
01:15:41,663 --> 01:15:42,705
Don't look at it!

749
01:15:43,248 --> 01:15:44,916
In the name of the Lord, answer me.

750
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:48,044
Beast of 10,000 years, reveal yourself.

751
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:52,340
Father...

752
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:57,971
You'll spit blood and die in prison in 4 years,

753
01:15:58,179 --> 01:16:01,766
and we'll suck out your newborn nephew's eyes!

754
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,226
St. Francis...

755
01:16:04,519 --> 01:16:05,311
The bell!

756
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:06,688
The bell...

757
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:16,990
We will cut out your sister's uterus.

758
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:28,418
Look at me.

759
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:33,381
You wanted to see me.

760
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:43,224
I'm sure there's nothing. But I'm curious.

761
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,270
I'm sure there's nothing. But I'm curious.

762
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:55,778
Deacon Park, is there really something?

763
01:16:57,614 --> 01:16:59,574
Be afraid...

764
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:01,743
Be afraid!

765
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,068
Walk away.

766
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,155
Look at your arm.

767
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:43,618
Rotting like syphilis.

768
01:17:48,915 --> 01:17:50,375
Go and tell the others.

769
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:54,587
You saw nothing here.

770
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:59,175
Only a mad priest.

771
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,779
Brother... Don't go...

772
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:22,990
Help me...

773
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:25,868
Brother!

774
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:57,734
Run away.

775
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:00,737
It's what you do best.

776
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:04,824
Go!

777
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:45,753
Why didn't you go further?

778
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,674
I left my shoes.

779
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,391
Those who return are chosen.

780
01:23:01,227 --> 01:23:02,979
I have a debt.

781
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:05,648
I couldn't...

782
01:23:07,108 --> 01:23:09,068
come back to my sister.

783
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:17,743
I was so scared of the dog. It was much too big.

784
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:19,996
It wasn't your fault.

785
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:24,750
She was a smaller target.

786
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:28,421
Animals never attack larger foes.

787
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:33,092
And evil seeds despair in us the same way.

788
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:36,846
That we are no different than animals.

789
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:40,016
But God didn't create humans that way.

790
01:23:42,977 --> 01:23:44,020
Right.

791
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:50,651
An old priest said the same thing before.

792
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:56,032
Agatho.

793
01:23:58,993 --> 01:24:00,745
Yes, I'm right here.

794
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:10,421
You've crossed the line.

795
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:16,844
I know.

796
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:20,806
You'll be haunted for the rest of your life.

797
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:23,684
I understand.

798
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:26,604
There's no reward and nobody'll recognize your work.

799
01:24:28,606 --> 01:24:36,030
'Son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words.'

800
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:41,911
'Though briers and thorns are all around you

801
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:44,914
and you live among scorpions,

802
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,959
do not be afraid of what they say

803
01:24:49,877 --> 01:24:52,338
or be terrified by them.'

804
01:24:57,134 --> 01:25:01,222
There is no problem. Her vitals are normal.

805
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:02,973
She's fine.

806
01:25:03,349 --> 01:25:05,184
I'm the doctor here, ma'am!

807
01:25:06,936 --> 01:25:09,271
Why? What's wrong with you.

808
01:25:09,355 --> 01:25:13,692
Who gave you the right?! It's not fair!

809
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:16,946
You son of a bitch!

810
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:21,867
She loved you like her father.

811
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:29,083
It's absolute chaos here. Send us some officers.

812
01:25:34,922 --> 01:25:36,423
Please stop.

813
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:41,428
Do you know who's helping us by clinging onto her life?

814
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:44,682
We're not the only ones fighting here.

815
01:25:50,938 --> 01:25:53,232
Out of time, straight to summon and expulsion.

816
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:56,610
- Got myrrh and sulphur? - Yes, I brought them.

817
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:59,363
You're not an assistant anymore.

818
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:03,242
Together, we must bring out the final beast.

819
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:04,952
Okay.

820
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:04,762
Lord, have mercy on us.

821
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:31,223
Beast of thousand years, reveal yourself!

822
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:33,225
What are you?

823
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:44,194
A bridge collapses in 342 days, killing 78.

824
01:28:44,278 --> 01:28:48,282
Day 7,803, 5,680 die in 5-building collapse.

825
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:51,994
Day 6,682, humans artificially create its own!

826
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:56,290
- In the name of the Holy Spirit! - Why have you come?!

827
01:28:56,332 --> 01:28:58,542
I despise you.

828
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:02,421
Day 40,275, no more drinkable water.

829
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:05,549
Day 85,938, black balloon will burst,

830
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:08,385
killing 7,284,430.

831
01:29:08,594 --> 01:29:10,804
Ozone depletes.

832
01:29:11,347 --> 01:29:16,268
Day 93,025, half of you will burn.

833
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:22,066
I came to put out the light in the world.

834
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:24,777
Us humans affirms fellow humans!

835
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,404
Go back to where you came from!

836
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:36,330
Speak, what is your name!

837
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,375
I despise you!

838
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:42,336
I came to put out the light in the world.

839
01:29:43,379 --> 01:29:50,219
I despise you! I despise you!

840
01:29:58,769 --> 01:30:01,271
What is your name!

841
01:30:08,362 --> 01:30:10,531
Malbeth...

842
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:19,832
Father...

843
01:30:22,418 --> 01:30:24,586
I'll hold onto him tight.

844
01:30:27,673 --> 01:30:33,762
I'm okay, Father. I'll hold onto him.

845
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:54,783
In the name of the Holy Father, Son, and Spirit,

846
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:59,580
Malbeth, remove yourself.

847
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:01,183
I'm sorry, Young-shin.

848
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:13,028
Fly to heaven...

849
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:19,493
I'm sorry...

850
01:32:26,959 --> 01:32:28,752
Young-shin, I'm sorry...

851
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:48,981
You did your part. You did it all!

852
01:33:25,559 --> 01:33:27,686
This is the most important step.

853
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:30,897
Toss the piglet into a river over 15m wide.

854
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:34,443
It must be done within an hour.

855
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:47,164
We've received a report.

856
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:50,834
- Keep him here. - Yes, sir.

857
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:53,337
I must leave now.

858
01:33:55,714 --> 01:33:56,757
Come over here.

859
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:58,634
Stand right there!

860
01:34:02,012 --> 01:34:04,806
We'll let you go once he checks upstairs.

861
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:07,476
- I must really go. - Father!

862
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:09,603
We got a murder!

863
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:17,736
What is that?

864
01:34:19,488 --> 01:34:21,156
- I have to go! - Don't move, stop!

865
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:25,952
We got a body. 2 suspects in custody.

866
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:27,913
Requesting backup, requesting backup.

867
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:28,955
What the hell?

868
01:34:45,931 --> 01:34:47,307
Stay back, be careful!

869
01:34:48,684 --> 01:34:49,893
What the hell?

870
01:35:09,538 --> 01:35:10,747
Stop right there!

871
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:18,213
Freeze! Stop!

872
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:20,382
The path will be dangerous.

873
01:35:20,799 --> 01:35:22,050
May God be with you...

874
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,218
Watch out!

875
01:35:25,345 --> 01:35:26,388
Stop!

876
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:42,446
She was already brain dead.

877
01:37:58,290 --> 01:37:59,833
This is only for suburb.

878
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:02,878
Sir, to the closest river please.

879
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:08,758
Father, you should go to the ER.

880
01:38:09,509 --> 01:38:10,760
Please hurry.

881
01:38:57,891 --> 01:38:58,725
Is it busted?

882
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:18,870
Father...

883
01:39:19,913 --> 01:39:21,247
Your face...

884
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,791
If it's too late,

885
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:08,294
the exorcist will be the new host.

886
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:11,423
In other words, you'll be in danger.
