00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,160
Hello.

2
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,360
Babe.

3
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,840
Are you free tomorrow?

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,520
Why?

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,920
I'm free in the afternoon.

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,360
I want you to go have meal with my mom

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,640
on her birthday with me.

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,040
I'm going to tell her about us.

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,760
Really?

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,080
Sure. Thank you for doing this for me.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,960
Of course I will.
I'm totally in love with you.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,880
If my mom say yes,
I'll ask you to marry me tomorrow.

13
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,040
You are taking a cab tomorrow,
so don't dress too revealing.

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,720
I'm jealous.

15
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,200
Wakey wakey.

16
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,960
Babe, wake up.

17
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,600
Wake up.

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,720
I'm already awake.

19
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,320
You're so cute.

20
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,095
Can I go back to sleep?

21
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,760
No. It's late.

22
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,280
10 minutes. 10 more minutes.

23
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:50,049
"The Greatest Love."

24
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,520
Hello.

25
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,600
Take a seat.

26
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,320
Hello! Taew.

27
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,320
What?

28
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,160
Your son is back?

29
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,240
That's great.

30
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,040
My daughter is a grown up now, you know?

31
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,720
Beautiful too.

32
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,480
So two kids can meet.

33
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,640
We might have a good news.

34
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,800
Mom.

35
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,400
I have an important thing to tell you.

36
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,320
I'll call you back.

37
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,240
Let have a meal together sometime.

38
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,960
What is it?

39
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,040
I don't want to know
your friend's son or whoever.

40
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,080
Have you ever asked me
if I want to know him?

41
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,440
Mom.

42
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,456
The reason I bring Jane here today...

43
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:46,015
Is I want to tell you that...

44
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Jane and I, we love each other.

45
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,360
Of course, you do. You're friends.

46
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,840
It's not that kind of love.

47
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,360
Food is getting cold.

48
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,040
Finish your food.

49
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,520
Jane.

50
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,840
Jane.

51
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,480
Jane. Listen to me.

52
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,800
What?

53
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,840
You want me to listen to something
you can't do for me?

54
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,040
Jane. Please stop.

55
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,200
I need more time.

56
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,320
More time?

57
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,760
What am I waiting as?

58
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,720
You want us to hide like this forever?

59
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,520
How can I trust you?

60
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,600
Let talk later.

61
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,400
Babe, can I post this?

62
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,040
Can you change it?

63
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,480
(I had a fight with Por. Again.)

64
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,720
(What is it this time?)

65
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,320
(Old stuff.)

66
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,680
(I'm so tired.)

67
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,680
(Let's go out tonight.
Maybe you'll feel better.)

68
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,560
(No.)

69
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:05,760
(My Por calling)

70
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,560
(Let's go out tonight.
Maybe you'll feel better.)

71
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:18,280
(My Por calling)

72
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,520
(No.)

73
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,200
(Okay. I'll go.)

74
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,840
(See you there.)

75
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Is your friend here yet?

76
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,440
Is your friend here yet?

77
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,120
No. She's on the way.

78
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,520
You've got a call.

79
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,440
Forget about it. Let's drink.

80
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,720
Bottoms up.

81
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,040
Don't get drunk to day.
I don't want to drag you home.

82
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,600
Don't worry. I won't.

83
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:34,080
(Should we stop
if there is no path ahead...)

84
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,920
I'll go look for my friend outside.

85
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,720
Okay.

86
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,760
Is she here now?

87
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,720
I guess. I'll go check.

88
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,960
Your friend ditch you too?

89
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
Yep.

90
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,880
Cheers.

91
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,880
Do you often go out?

92
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,840
Sometimes.

93
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,120
May I dance with you?

94
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,080
Por, are you awake?

95
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,960
Come out. I need to talk to you.

96
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,840
What you told me yesterday
about you and Jane,

97
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,680
you were just kidding, right?

98
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,880
No, I wasn't.

99
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,840
Jane and I are together.

100
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,360
Por. I've been raising you my whole life.

101
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,720
Have you ever thought about
how I would feel?

102
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,040
Which mother can see her daughter
with another woman?

103
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,160
Por.

104
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,960
I had so many mistakes in my life.

105
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,120
I don't want you to end up like me.

106
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,400
I want you to have a good life.

107
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,880
But what you are doing
doesn't make me happy.

108
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,280
Have you ever thought about wat I think?

109
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,080
How I feel?

110
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,520
What will other people think?

111
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,880
If they know you are with another woman?

112
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,600
They will think you are a freak.

113
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,880
They'll think you are a queer.

114
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
I don't care about what they think.

115
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,760
Now I know

116
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,600
that you're no different from those people.

117
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,480
You also think I'm a freak.

118
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,280
I don't think that you are.

119
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
Mom.

120
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,440
Mom!

121
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,040
(I love you, Jane.)

122
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,320
(I want everyone to know that
we love each other.)

123
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,640
(I want to post our photos.)

124
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,280
(I want to hold you hands
without thinking about anything.)

125
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,600
(Without having to care about
what others think.)

126
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,680
(Can you please give me
one more chance.)

127
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,400
(Please wait for me.)

128
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,200
Sir?

129
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,640
How is my mother?

130
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,200
Your mother's never had
a health check up before?

131
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,360
No. She hasn't.

132
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,360
Your mother has a heart disease
known as Angina.

133
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,080
This is caused from stress.

134
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,800
I don't know, if she is having a stress
about anything lately.

135
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,160
I want you to keep a close eye on her.

136
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,920
Don't let her be to stressful.

137
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,440
I have to go now.

138
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,920
Thank you so much.

139
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,040
Hello.

140
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,440
Natty, it's me.

141
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,920
Have Jane contacted you?

142
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,680
No. I can't call her neither.

143
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,840
Can you let me know
if she call you, please.

144
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,360
She's been gone for 2 weeks.

145
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,680
I'm worry about her.

146
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,280
Okay. I'll tell you when I can reach her.

147
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,480
Thank you.

148
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,440
Let sit here.

149
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,320

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,120
(I'll always wait for you.)

175
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,920
Let's go, mom.

176
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,720
Take it slow.

177
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,840
Por.

178
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,280
Hi.

179
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,120
Por.

180
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
I need to talk to you.

181
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Mom, let’s go inside.

182
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,040
Mom, get some rest.

183
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,840
Why didn't you pick up my call?

184
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,120
Why didn't you return my text?

185
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,520
I am sorry.

186
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,040
I've never thought this will happen.

187
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,800
Jane, what's wrong?

188
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,720
Jane.

189
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,480
Please don't get mad if I tell you.

190
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,800
Are you breaking up with me?

191
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,800
No.

192
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,960
Then What is it?

193
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,840
Is it because of my mother?

194
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,240
I'm sorry.

195
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,480
Please give me a chance.

196
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,360
My mom will eventually understand.

197
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,280
Please Jane.

198
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,080
I'm sorry.

199
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,360
It's not about your mother.

200
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,600
What is it then?

201
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,720
Are you seeing someone else?

202
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,880
Are you?

203
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,640
Are you, Jane?

204
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,240
Jane.

205
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,800
I love you.

206
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,760
Can we get back together?

207
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,600
I love you so much.

208
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
I'm begging you.

209
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,920
Please give me a chance.

210
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,800
Por.

211
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,880
Don't you love me anymore?

212
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,440
Por.

213
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,840
Please Jane.

214
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,280
Por, I'm pregnant.

215
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,080
Pregnant? How?

216
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,960
I don't know.

217
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,680
I was so drunk.

218
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,120
I didn't want this to happen.

219
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,760
Por.

220
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,040
Por.

221
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,640
I'm sorry.

222
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,600
Por.

223
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,880
Do you still want to be with me?

224
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,600
Por.

225
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,720
Por,

226
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,560
please, come back to me.

227
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,400
I will do everything.

228
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,480
I can get rid of this child.

229
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,960
Por.

230
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,440
Please, come back to me.

231
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,480
I can do anything.

232
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,880
I love you.

233
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,840
I can't live without you.

234
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,280
I will get rid of this child.

235
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,400
I won't let us be like this.

236
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,680
- Please.
- Jane.

237
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,360
Jane, I love you.

238
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,040
I don't want you to do that.

239
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,400
But I don't know what to do.

240
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,160
Jane.

241
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,480
Keep the child.

242
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,840
I also made a mistake like you.

243
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,200
Hey.

244
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,080
I'm pregnant.

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,120

246
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,240
(Abortion service for woman
who are not ready to have child.)

247
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,360
If I've decided

248
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,040
to take Por out that day,

249
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,720
I will never be happy.

250
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,280
And Por will not be here today.
