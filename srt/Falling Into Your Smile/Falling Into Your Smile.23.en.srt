1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,400
I'm not young anymore
in this industry.

2
00:00:04,627 --> 00:00:06,355
I've been playing professionally
for many years.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,790
I've seen a lot too.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,240
In that case, Cheng has no
objection to players falling in love?

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,750
If it's not over the top,

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,023
then I'm not against it.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,830
I've heard the legendary story
of a boy and a girl

8
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:20,195
getting into Tsinghua University
and Peking University together.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,760
Do you want to do the same, Cheng?

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,710
I already have someone I like.

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,030
Cheng has someone he likes?

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,516
I can't believe the E-sports
Industry Farm didn't catch the news.

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,516
(E-sports Industry Farm:
That's impossible, fake news)

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,030
There's actually something
you don't know about for once?

15
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,340
=Falling Into Your Smile=

16
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,100
=Episode 23=

17
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,866
I know that being forced to
make up a couple should be condemned.

18
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,196
But I still want to say when Cheng
was saying those last few words,

19
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,760
he put his right hand under the table.

20
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,280
At the same time,
Smiling's hand was also under the table.

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,866
Cheng's hand moved.

22
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,680
So, what did you do?

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,150
I already have someone I like.

24
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,023
What's wrong?

25
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,080
Are you shy?

26
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,150
Look at this.

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,120
Look at the details of Cheng's hand.

28
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,520
I bet 5 cents on that
they were holding hands.

29
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,353
Good for her.

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,590
What the hell is with your reaction?

31
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,590
This person was so observant
that she almost discovered us.

32
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,633
Hey.

33
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,240
What are you so nervous for?

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,080
Back in the time when the E-sports were
going on, I knew they could be a couple.

35
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,156
What's the hell?

36
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,786
Cheng wouldn't fall for her.

37
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,150
She's just a gaming slut.

38
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,470
Cheng is giving up on himself.

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,240
I'm afraid she's just trying to
steal Cheng's thunder.

40
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,945
I don't care.
I won't agree with them to be together.

41
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,876
If they're together,
how could they play games in the future?

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,009
I won't watch them anymore.

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,240
Now you know why I covered it up.

44
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,590
Once exposed,

45
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,840
Your Majesty,
you'll lose half of your popularity.

46
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,226
And do you know
why I agreed to cover it up?

47
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,516
It's for the sake of half
of your popularity.

48
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,710
Do you dare say that again?

49
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,240
I wouldn't dare.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,240
I'm afraid those crazy people
will make a slander on you,

51
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,240
saying you didn't show your best in
the games because you were in love,

52
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,998
and questioning your motives
for being a pro or something like that.

53
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,120
I don't care.

54
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,190
I do care.

55
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,106
It's true.

56
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,600
It may not happen, though.

57
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,600
Even if it does, I'm confident that I can
prove them wrong with my gaming results.

58
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,915
But I don't want you
to think about those things.

59
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,425
You're a person who likes to
see gossip on the internet.

60
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,680
I'm sure you'll be affected.

61
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,830
It was also because of ,

62
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:50,834
that I was hesitant about
whether we should be together.

63
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,596
After all, if a male member
of another team came after you,

64
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,430
I'd definitely be the first
to come up and say no.

65
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,720
I would warn that person
not to bother her.

66
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,430
She needs to focus on her profession.

67
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,680
Then what?

68
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:09,633
What are you laughing at?

69
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,240
Leave me alone.

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,193
And then?

71
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,186
To celebrate winning the game, I'll
treat you guys to breakfasts tomorrow.

72
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,830
KFC or anything you want.

73
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,036
I'll have the pork tenderloin
with cheese and panini latte.

74
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,956
-Grilled Chicken Panini.
-Thank you. Love you.

75
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,510
And a cup of soy milk.

76
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,156
And I'll have the beef congee.

77
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
-Thank you.
-Okay.

78
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,360
What are you having, Cheng?

79
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm not eating.
I'm a little sleepy. I'm going to rest.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,680
Why am I a little hungry now?

81
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,663
Tong Yao.

82
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,771
Did you leave something in my room
during the past several days?

83
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,120
No.

84
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,920
I'll also have a tea egg, please.

85
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,120
You're a good eater.

86
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,488
(A new message from a contact)

87
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,480
Are you sure
you didn't leave anything in my room?

88
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,160
I think I did leave something
in Cheng's room.

89
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,950
I think it's my mobile power source.

90
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,190
Don't be nosy.

91
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,040
Where is he?

92
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,680
Cheng.

93
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,800
Do you want some breakfast?
I can order it for you.

94
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,680
Panini or congee?

95
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,240
I want to eat you.

96
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,663
Captain.

97
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,510
I'm not flexible enough.
My waist is going to be broken.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,950
What are you hiding?

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm not going to do anything bad to you.

100
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,510
You're dangerous.

101
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,270
Do we have to stay
in this position talking?

102
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,750
You can lie down too.

103
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,360
Bastard.

104
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,156
I just wanted to thank you.

105
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
You worked so hard
to play the four-preserving-one tactic,

106
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,070
showing a textbook-style performance
in an inferior game.

107
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,956
And thank you for saying
in front of the whole country,

108
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,750
that you're already in love with someone.

109
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't feel your sincerity.

110
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,433
Then,

111
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,920
are you free tomorrow?

112
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,873
Yes.

113
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,950
Let's go on a date then.

114
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,023
Sure.

115
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,433
But,

116
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,560
before the date,
shouldn't we kiss first?

117
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,953
No.

118
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,360
See you tomorrow.

119
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,080
Chubby, I'll bet with you for a panini.

120
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,840
In less than three seconds,
Cheng will appear.

121
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,750
Where are you going?

122
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,790
There's KFC breakfast
on the table for you.

123
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,426
You guys eat first,
I'm going out for shopping.

124
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,790
I'm going shopping with her.

125
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,586
Why do you always look like
you're going to the Civil Affairs Bureau

126
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,670
every time you go out alone?

127
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,840
I look like this every day.

128
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,790
-So do I.
-Forget about it.

129
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,996
The last time I saw you
go out dressed up was,

130
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,270
when you went out to the pet market
to buy goldfish with my brother.

131
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,405
And it seems to me
there was no time before that.

132
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,036
What's wrong?

133
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,516
People from the countryside have to
dress up when they go to a big city.

134
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,433
What's wrong?

135
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,030
When did you two get together?

136
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,630
I've been cheated on?

137
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,756
The shooter I raised up for so long,

138
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,782
actually left me
and went to the middle lane.

139
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,080
I'm just kidding.

140
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,826
But I can't accept my brother's
future son is as short as his mother,

141
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,450
who'll be ridiculed
for the rest of his life.

142
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,433
Shut up!

143
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,863
Don't laugh.

144
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,033
Let's go.

145
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:23,960
Normal people like us can only
grasp metal shafts all by ourselves.

146
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,360
What's wrong with you, all blue?

147
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,103
Lu Sicheng.

148
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,870
Why didn't you refute him just now?

149
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,840
Do you also think he has a point?

150
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,030
I'm so angry.

151
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:02,756
The perfect genes of your Lu family are
about to be tainted by my inferior genes,

152
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,066
of "five feet tall".

153
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,080
Come and taint them.

154
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,826
He was teasing you.
You're of the same height as my mother.

155
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,600
Neither of her sons are five feet tall.

156
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,531
When our son plays basketball
in the future, he'll grow taller.

157
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,630
Don't worry about it.

158
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,550
Who will have a son with you?

159
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,910
A daughter is also good.

160
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,840
Just like you.

161
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,066
Then she'll abduct a tall boy.

162
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,983
Perfect.

163
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,960
I actually like girls.

164
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,120
Boys are too naughty.

165
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,743
Shut up.

166
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,236
Can't I even fantasize about it?

167
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,000
No. Can you fantasize
about something normal?

168
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,270
Why do I feel that
you sound like you're laughing?

169
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm not.

170
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,623
Captain.

171
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,600
Do you feel that your persona has
been crumbling tremendously lately.

172
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,673
Why?

173
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,320
As far as I remember,

174
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,150
Chessman is a calm and collected person,
sharp and wise.

175
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,466
I didn't expect you to be a shameless
and glib-tongued old rascal.

176
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,670
I'm very sad.

177
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,916
Do you still remember what
you thought when we first met,

178
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
I took you for a delivery girl
and shut the door in your face?

179
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:18,946
You were retarded.

180
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,750
At that time, I was already far
from the persona you thought I was.

181
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,318
But being retarded
is not the same as being a hooligan.

182
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,240
I'm a decent guy
in front of the other girls.

183
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Isn't that nice?

184
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,910
You can enjoy my inner personality
alone without restraint.

185
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,720
Rascal.

186
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,750
Yes, yes, yes.

187
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,383
That's it.

188
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,066
-I tried everything.
-Almost there.

189
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,080
I missed it.

190
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,390
That one.

191
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,720
Forget it, I don't want to play this.

192
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,480
The money I spent here has been enough
to buy a bunch of the same toys online.

193
00:13:00,901 --> 00:13:01,786
That's right.

194
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,636
But this one is really cute.

195
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,960
-I want it so bad.
-I want this one.

196
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,510
Let's buy ten of this.

197
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,200
I want the beige one.

198
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,910
I've made up my mind.

199
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,756
-So handsome.
-He's so cute.

200
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,150
So hot.

201
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,390
Which one do you want?

202
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,480
Don't we have one already?

203
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,703
This one with the hat, okay?
It's not the same.

204
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,036
-The rabbit is difficult to clip.
-That's right.

205
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,706
We had played for so long
and still couldn't even get it.

206
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,480
Yes, it's too hard.

207
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,916
Oh, my God.

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,150
That's amazing.

209
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,960
-He got it.
-He got it.

210
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,080
-Good, good.
-Awesome.

211
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,360
Another one.

212
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,480
-That's terrific.
-That's so cool.

213
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,150
So cool.

214
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,786
-I want that doll too.
-Which one is cuter?

215
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,756
That doll is so cute.

216
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,200
I also want it.

217
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,360
The one in the middle.

218
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,360
What?

219
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,720
-I'm so jealous.
-It's okay.

220
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,306
I want to fall in love.

221
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,240
So romantic.

222
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,872
In the past when I was duped...

223
00:14:26,956 --> 00:14:28,466
by all kinds of doll machines
at the amusement park, I was thinking,

224
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,826
"I must find a capable boyfriend
in the future who will come back

225
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,756
and get them all, until they go bankrupt."

226
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,673
You did it.

227
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,916
-What?
-Found a capable boyfriend.

228
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,356
Which amusement park is it?
Let's go buy tickets.

229
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,480
I'll go make them closed down.

230
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,000
Tokyo Disneyland.

231
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,510
What do you want to eat later?

232
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,720
The ice cream store down there is not bad.

233
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,030
Ice cream for lunch?

234
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,630
-Why can't we have ice cream for lunch?
-Are you three years old?

235
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,276
Am I not three years old in your mind?

236
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,390
You must love me,
pamper me and not cheat on me forever.

237
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,960
You guys go over there, we'll go this way.

238
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,720
Bye, we'll see you next time.

239
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,036
I want to go to the bathroom.
See you at the cinema later.

240
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,953
I'm going.

241
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm going. Bye.

242
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,440
Bye, bye-bye.

243
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,463
Bye-bye.

244
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,390
No, nothing. Let's go.

245
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,390
Why didn't you wait for me at the cinema?

246
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,910
Why did you run away?

247
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,200
I saw our fans
in front of the sushi restaurant.

248
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,910
That's why I shook off your hand.

249
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,033
I see.

250
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,870
What are you doing?

251
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,320
What's wrong with you?

252
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,150
Why did you buy a mask?

253
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,720
For being considerate,
I can't reveal myself to others.

254
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,200
Lu Sicheng, say something.

255
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,307
What on earth is wrong with you?

256
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
Because I'm ugly
and don't deserve to show my face.

257
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,670
Lu Sicheng, don't be upset.

258
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,200
I didn't mean that just now.

259
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,670
What?

260
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,946
Okay, okay.

261
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,480
I'm sorry, okay?

262
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,320
Can you let me go this time?

263
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,870
The fans were there.

264
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,649
If they see us walking around hand
in hand like that, what will they think?

265
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,790
Remember when I showed you those
fans' comments?

266
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,706
They don't accept
that you have a girlfriend.

267
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,511
-They don't accept.
-I don't care.

268
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,310
Give me back my mask.

269
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,200
You don't care, but I do.

270
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,720
I'm not afraid of them
treating me like they did to Chen Jinyang.

271
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:18,116
And I'm not afraid that they'll say
I don't focus on my career,

272
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,790
and all I care about
is seducing their idol.

273
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,000
I just know that
since you played as a professional player,

274
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,310
no one has ever said
anything bad about you,

275
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:27,506
even the E-sports Industry Farm,

276
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,502
which specializes in
digging out scandals of the players.

277
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,793
So?

278
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,750
So, I will not allow myself to become
an excuse for others to condemn you.

279
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,480
You are.

280
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,790
Everyone has his own weakness.

281
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,943
Me too.

282
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,033
It's you.

283
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,590
I don't care what people say about me.

284
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,720
If they say something positive about me,
I'm happy about it.

285
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,510
But I won't act differently because of
their moral abduction.

286
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,400
"Word of mouth"
is generated by my actions,

287
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,396
and it not because I generate
the corresponding behavior for it.

288
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,680
Do you understand what I mean?

289
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,960
I just fell in love with a little girl.

290
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,880
I'm not doing anything wrong.

291
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,920
Why are you always so concerned
to protect me?

292
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,183
Let's go.

293
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,750
That was too fast just now.

294
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,510
I didn't get to savor it.

295
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,790
Why don't we do it again?

296
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,270
What's with your reaction?

297
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,000
Expressing my disappointment.

298
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,350
I should tell you
Xiamen is a really good place.

299
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,916
We have so much time to play
and so little time to work.

300
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,186
There are big waves, and gyms,

301
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,355
where you can take great pictures,
and there is even spa.

302
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,590
Really, that's terrific.

303
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,916
You two went to Las Vegas
to get married, right?

304
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
You're back so late.

305
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,550
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

306
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,706
Since you two are back,
I have to tell you something.

307
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,396
The club has arranged for us
to attend an event.

308
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,746
It's very simple.
It's just a fan meeting.

309
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,783
Just take a video
and regard it as a kind of entertainment.

310
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,226
If you don't want to go,
I'll have to cancel our tickets to Xiamen.

311
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,550
-Canceled.
-What?

312
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:16,796
Where to?

313
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,920
Xiamen?

314
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,200
If we don't go,

315
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,946
we will miss out on a chance to
get in touch with the great food,

316
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,270
and to
have close contact with a beautiful city.

317
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,960
What a pity!

318
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,160
Such a pity.

319
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,030
No, no.

320
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,110
Is our hotel far from the night market?
Did you get the event schedule?

321
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,026
What time is the meeting?
What time do we get off work?

322
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,480
It's not good if the night market
closes before we get off work.

323
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,830
Don't drag on when we are there.

324
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,156
Say whatever you want,

325
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,880
it's up to Cheng
to decide whether to go or not.

326
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,200
Cheng, are we going?

327
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,033
Yes.

328
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,356
It looks really good.

329
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,720
-That's right.
-Why can't we go?

330
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,903
K.

331
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,076
Hurry up, don't indulge in playing.

332
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,226
-I see.
-I wonder when the afternoon activity

333
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,680
-will end.
-Let me finish this game first.

334
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,226
You suck at it.

335
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,350
Not as much as you do.

336
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,943
Listen.

337
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,750
My playlist?

338
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,836
There's a problem with the club booking.

339
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,641
The room will not be ready
until eight o'clock.

340
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,200
Don't worry, guys.

341
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,830
I just read the reviews.

342
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,266
The restaurant at this hotel
is of a very high rating.

343
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,920
How about we go get something to eat?

344
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:18,556
Yeah, sure.

345
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,636
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

346
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,000
-Good idea.
-Let's go.

347
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,750
Come on, let's go.

348
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,116
Cheng.
Take my suitcase upstairs for me.

349
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,991
I'll go make a phone call
to my mom saying I'm safe.

350
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,920
Say hello to mom for me.

351
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,680
Hello, Mom?

352
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,200
Yes, we've arrived in Xiamen.

353
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,680
It's fine.
It's just a bit rainy.

354
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,663
You don't have to worry.
I have to go now.

355
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,000
Miss, are you Smiling?

356
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,310
Yes, you are?

357
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,680
It's really you.

358
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,880
I'm a fan of yours, a fan.

359
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:07,226
Before you played
as a professional player,

360
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,070
I already liked
your live streaming so much.

361
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,316
I also play midsolo.

362
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,880
I've learned a lot of skills from you.

363
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,310
My current ranking is not bad.

364
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,916
If it gets a bit higher,
I think I may run into you in the game.

365
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,510
My dream is to play a game with you.

366
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,550
Miss, can I get your autograph?

367
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,753
Sure.

368
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,350
Yang.

369
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,830
You wandered off again in my negligence,
and talked to people you don't know.

370
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,510
Can't you just let me rest assured?

371
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,030
I didn't wander off.

372
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,920
I didn't talk to a stranger either.

373
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,000
She is my favorite e-sports player.

374
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,160
What player?

375
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,200
E-sports player.

376
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,440
Okay, okay. What e-sports?
It's just playing games.

377
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,680
You kids are not only get addicted to
games and lag behind in your studies,

378
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,750
but also make high-sounding excuses.

379
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,880
Let's go.

380
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,076
Smiling.

381
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,356
I also want to play pro
and want to win the championship.

382
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,400
I'm counting on you for this year's
national finals championship.

383
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,746
See you later, Smiling.

384
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,880
All right, let's go.

385
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,640
All right, don't wander off anymore.

386
00:25:16,555 --> 00:25:17,625
Why are you here?

387
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,440
You have disappeared for 30 minutes.
I thought you'd been kidnapped.

388
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,310
I don't have any money.

389
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:25,666
I've just played professionally
for three months,

390
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,440
with three months' salary deducted.

391
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,880
I have a debt.

392
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,270
I have money.

393
00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:32,156
What if you're kidnapped
and I'm being asked for the ransom?

394
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,828
I'd have to pay
even if it's five million yuan.

395
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,830
Who was that kid?

396
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,480
A little fan.

397
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,110
What did he say?

398
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,160
He wanted an autograph.

399
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,030
He said he wanted
to play professionally too.

400
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,480
But his career was ganked by his mother.

401
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,550
Let me ask you a question.

402
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,664
Do I pass my probationary period?

403
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,426
I'm just having a yogurt
and taking a walk.

404
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,666
Why do I have to reveal the mystery
of the century, so unprepared?

405
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,400
What's wrong with you guys?
I'm just a cute, fat guy.

406
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,920
What?

407
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,240
You want to kill me?

408
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Actually, I don't have anything to ask.

409
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,000
How long have you two been like this?

410
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
For a while.

411
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,110
You've been hiding it well.

412
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,270
No one has found out.

413
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,110
So, who escalated
your pure friendship first?

414
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,793
Me.

415
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
I threatened her.

416
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,680
If she didn't accept,
I would throw her cat away.

417
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,920
So she gave in.

418
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,400
Are you satisfied with my answer?

419
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,110
That's not right.

420
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,350
She's the only girl on the team.

421
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,550
We pamper and protect her.

422
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,946
As the captain of the team, you just
came onto her alone behind our back.

423
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,162
Should I leave her to you instead?

424
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:14,116
You…

425
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
I am the captain, not Lei Feng.

426
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,640
And you, Tong Yao.

427
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,156
I thought you agreed to
focus on your professional career,

428
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,706
not to fall in love with
a professional e-sports player

429
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,310
and accused all professional players
of being scumbags.

430
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,880
You just go back on your word like this?

431
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,720
Captain is not Jian Yang.

432
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,110
He doesn't lie.

433
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:38,350
Usually, he just watches game videos
and plays rankings or something.

434
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,240
Now I can feel more and more
public display of affection atmosphere.

435
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,480
How did you two fall in love?

436
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,033
I don't know.

437
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,750
Just started to feel good about
each other while cursing at each other.

438
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,830
Have you heard of the Stockholm syndrome?

439
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,160
It was cute when you stood on your
tiptoes to hide water in the supermarket.

440
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,200
It's cute when you play games.

441
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,116
It was cute
when you sat alone, crying all night,

442
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,753
and practiced the Shikigami all night long

443
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:11,473
after you were defeated by
Tai's Tamamo-no-Mae.

444
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,720
It was cute when you talked
nonsense to Yang rudely,

445
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,793
after winning the game.

446
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,510
It was even cuter when you beat me
in the Solo game and looked arrogant.

447
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,830
I'm just asking.

448
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,400
I can list many more.

449
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,070
Save it for your officiant
in the church.

450
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,070
Don't you want to hear it?

451
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,480
One last question.

452
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,550
How intimate...

453
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,680
have you gotten?

454
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,440
Just a kiss as you saw, nothing more.

455
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,510
What else do you want to ask?

456
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
I'll tell you everything.

457
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,960
No more, no more.

458
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,880
Leave me alone for a while.

459
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,663
Go, go, go.
You guys go first.

460
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,960
Go far away.

461
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,666
By the way, I've run out of spray.
I'm going to buy some spray.

462
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,583
No way.

463
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,310
From now on,
if you want anything, just tell me.

464
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,480
I'll go buy it for you.

465
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,876
I've been your support for two years.

466
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,350
You didn't even buy me a face cleanser.

467
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:20,750
-Don't be late tomorrow morning.
-I'll go to my room first.

468
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:21,986
-Okay.
-Don't be late in the morning.

469
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,036
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

470
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,116
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

471
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,316
Where are we going to play
after the video shooting tomorrow?

472
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Where do you want to go?

473
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,583
-Let's go eat some nice food.
-Sure.

474
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,960
Tong Yao.

475
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,750
Are you going to share one room tonight?

476
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,980
(Lu Sicheng)

477
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,473
What's wrong?

478
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,833
What are you doing?

479
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,550
I just finished applying a facial mask.

480
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,830
I have to get up early tomorrow.
I'm so sleepy.

481
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
I feel like I'm going to
fall asleep any minute.

482
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,830
Lock the door.

483
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,310
Put a stool at the door.

484
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Is it to protect against thieves or you?

485
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,830
Against me.

486
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,270
All right, I have to go.

487
00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:23,226
Bye-bye.

488
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,116
My private life is entirely filled
with your public display of affection.

489
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,720
I'll just eat my dried pork.

490
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,270
Are you done?

491
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,550
Thinking of...

492
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,110
the scene that shocked my heart
today in the hotel lobby,

493
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,550
I couldn't calm down for a long time.

494
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,000
I can only take it out on you.

495
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,680
I regard Tong Yao as my teammate,

496
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,388
while you want to take her
as your girlfriend.

497
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,313
Cheng.

498
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,310
Tong Yao is a good girl.

499
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,746
Look at Yang,
Guang and Lee Hang Suk.

500
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,510
They all like our midsolo.

501
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,356
If they didn't want to win the game,

502
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,000
they probably wouldn't have even come
to gank.

503
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,270
If you don't treat Tong Yao right,

504
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:58,466
half of the twelve teams' junglers
in the Onmyoji Arena Pro League,

505
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,920
will live in our bottom lane.

506
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,550
It doesn't matter if they hurt you.

507
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,830
Don't forget that there's a cute me
in the bottom lane as well.

508
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,350
Two lives lost at one time.

509
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,310
What are you trying to say?

510
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,510
Cheng.

511
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,550
You have a lot of competitors.

512
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,400
Don't become arrogant
just because you're handsome.

513
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,000
I wouldn't.

514
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,310
When we first got together,
I wanted to tell the world that...

515
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,550
I already have a girlfriend.

516
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,590
But she wouldn't let me.

517
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,270
Why not?

518
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:33,395
At first, I thought it was better
not to make it public.

519
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,857
I was afraid that it would affect
her performance in the game.

520
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,350
But then I realized
her skill has been recognized.

521
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,880
Now if someone comes out and says
she can't do this or that,

522
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,310
that'll be a slap in his own face.

523
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,070
The record of winning
all the group matches so far,

524
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,876
means that Tong Yao is perfectly
qualified for our midsolo position

525
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,510
and has kept up with our pace.

526
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,680
However, while I was wondering
how to make the story public,

527
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,876
there was an accident between
Ai Jia from next-door's team and Jinyang.

528
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,920
It was quite severe,

529
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,880
so severe that my fans,

530
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,030
also went to the E-sports Industry Farm
to join in on the fun.

531
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,270
And she saw it.

532
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,110
Now she always thinks
if I announce our relationship,

533
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,310
I will have no fans.

534
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,590
Young girls love to think wildly.

535
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,240
Does the new face cleanser work well?

536
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,313
Yes, it works.

537
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,590
You're even jealous of the face cleanser?
You jealous husband.

538
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,440
It was sent to me for you.

539
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,000
Cheng.

540
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,270
What do you really like about Tong Yao?

541
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,030
Frankly speaking,

542
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,790
Tong Yao
is only average looking,

543
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,550
compared to your pretty fans
who could form a company of their own.

544
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,110
Because she is capable.

545
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,720
Perfunctory.

546
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,270
She is also very cute when she cries.

547
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,030
Pervert.

548
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,880
And?

549
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,760
I'll definitely try my best.

550
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,030
So can I call you Cheng?

551
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,880
Who are you thinking of?

552
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,670
That's the smell.

553
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,480
I don't know where it comes from,

554
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,320
but I'm deep in love.

555
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,820
(Roly Poly)

556
00:35:29,062 --> 00:35:31,426
The sound of your man evaluating you.
Listen to it.

557
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,360
It's very flirty, thank me now.

558
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,114
(Recording)
I don't know where it comes from,

559
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,070
but I'm deep in love.

560
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,630
I don't know where it comes from,

561
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,676
but I'm deep in love.

562
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,700
(Amao's mom)

563
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,190
You're really getting up?

564
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,110
Make me look around your room.

565
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,760
Let me see if there's anyone else.

566
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,070
No, no.

567
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,440
I'm all alone.

568
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,191
Then why is your face
looking so flushed and soft?

569
00:36:03,276 --> 00:36:04,630
It's like you've got something going on.

570
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,630
What? That's because of the
facial mask I put on last night, okay?

571
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,880
You look radiant because you're in love.

572
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,030
Keep it up.

573
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,280
Aren't you going out with Ai Jia today?
Why aren't you dressed up?

574
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,833
I'm not going.

575
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,150
Why?

576
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,670
Well, actually I've been
thinking about it a lot these days.

577
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,880
I think what they said about this problem
is actually correct.

578
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,110
Which one?

579
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,360
Who do you want to mock at and attack?

580
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,066
No.

581
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,190
I'm serious.

582
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,150
I'm really not as good as you are at
being on the same page with the boyfriend.

583
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,066
In the eyes of the fans,

584
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,880
I'm just a character to Ai Jia
with no support functions.

585
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,320
Support?

586
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,546
Do you even play the game?

587
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,920
What kind of support are you?

588
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,760
Forget about playing games.

589
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,030
But I can do something else.

590
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,550
For example?

591
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,320
For example, buy his team for him.

592
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,840
Give him a salary increase or something.

593
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,230
Then when his fans
see him, they will think,

594
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,030
even the shampoo for each strand
of such a handsome man's hair,

595
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,960
is bought with his salary
paid off by that annoying woman.

596
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,710
But he can't live without the salary.

597
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,150
What can they do?

598
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,440
They can't help it.

599
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,280
So angry.

600
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,030
I don't deserve to experience
rich people's happiness.

601
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,000
I just like this kind of feeling,

602
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,550
that they hate me
but can do nothing about me.

603
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,000
You can't be serious.

604
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,070
Maybe.

605
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,676
By the way,
aren't you going to make a vlog today?

606
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,676
Go get dressed up.

607
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,626
Don't make me look bad.

608
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,670
Okay, okay.

609
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,030
Bye-bye.

610
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,710
We just finished the fan meeting.

611
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,280
The fans in Xiamen
are really enthusiastic.

612
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,480
Now we're on the food street.
We're going to eat.

613
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,110
I don't know where they all went.

614
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,550
Let me look for your favorite Cheng.

615
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,710
Where's Cheng?

616
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,110
Where's Cheng?

617
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,480
Our Cheng is…

618
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,110
It smells so good.

619
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,800
What's that smell?

620
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,110
It's dried pork.

621
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,110
Chubby shot us. What should we do?

622
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,000
It's not a live stream, don't worry.
I'll have him delete it later.

623
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,463
Delete it.

624
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,030
Delete what?

625
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,840
I'll keep it for myself, won't I?

626
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,150
Tell me, how are you going to shut me up?

627
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,919
What do you have up your sleeve this time?

628
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,920
I think it's not going to pass
without dried pork.

629
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,710
Welcome.

630
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,920
Hundreds of high-end snacks for you
to choose from.

631
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,320
What would you two like to have?

632
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,400
We'll choose ourselves.

633
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,343
Okay.

634
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,920
This one.

635
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,236
-Get it, get it.
-Get it, get it.

636
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,666
We're here to buy snacks for Chubby.

637
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:13,110
Aren't you afraid
you're going to get fat from this?

638
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,626
Don't worry, sir. Our snacks are
all made from the best ingredients.

639
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,025
They're tasty
and won't make you gain weight.

640
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,960
Did you hear that?

641
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,070
Get us two boxes of dried pork, please.

642
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,313
Okay.

643
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,800
Dried mangoes.

644
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,233
I want some.

645
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,000
You're like a rabbit.

646
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,960
-Give it to me.
-I won't.

647
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,630
-Give it to me.
-I won't.

648
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
You're a bully because you're tall, right?

649
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,480
A rabbit bites when it's desperate.

650
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,590
-No.
-Give it to me.

651
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,030
-I won't give it to you.
-Give it to me.

652
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,986
-I won't.
-Lu Sicheng.

653
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,903
No.

654
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,550
Well.
Here's the dried pork for you two.

655
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,030
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

656
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,796
Then take your time.
Call me if you need anything.

657
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,713
Okay.

658
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,593
Give it to me.

659
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,590
Mind your appearance.

660
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,760
See? They're coming out.

661
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,630
Hello, who are you looking for?

662
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,548
-Is he the one?
-We're looking for him.

663
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,230
Bastard.

664
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,590
Get your ass over here.

665
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,396
Why didn't you answer your phone?

666
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,676
How dare you not answer my call?

667
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,880
I've called you so many times.

668
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Where are you going?

669
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:29,915
-Why are you running away?
-You dare run away?

670
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,070
-Uncle, aunt.
-Did you hear me? Come back here!

671
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,396
-Calm down.
-I told you to come back to me.

672
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,880
Get in first, uncle.

673
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,360
-I'm so pissed.
-Let's go.

674
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,840
