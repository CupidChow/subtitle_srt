1
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:04,510
Whether it's e-sports or her,

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,800
I just want to love what I love.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,670
You executives
can let the ZGDX players down.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,186
But I can't.

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,426
Because I'm the captain.

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,570
Hey, tell me.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,695
What have I done wrong?

8
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,180
=Falling into Your Smile=

9
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,940
=Episode 28=

10
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,950
During the whole game,

11
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,512
YQCB's flawless defense and zero turnovers
are the reason for their victory.

12
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,282
On the other hand,
there were frequent errors in positioning,

13
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:06,349
bad coordination,
and slow support efficiency in our team.

14
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:08,083
The main problem is condescension.

15
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,117
Youko can't be the best choice
in that game.

16
00:02:11,677 --> 00:02:13,437
But this is also my problem.

17
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:15,424
I shouldn't have connived at you guys.

18
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:17,220
The next game is crucial.

19
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:18,488
Cooperation.

20
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:21,024
We can't lose any of the three lanes.
Take defense as attack.

21
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:23,864
If they want to keep it steady,
we have to keep it steadier than them.

22
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:28,048
Cheng, pay attention to the development
and lead the line in the early stage.

23
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:29,927
Don't let Hierophant take advantage of it.

24
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:37,772
Cheng.

25
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,014
I know Lee Gun-hyeok very well.

26
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:42,575
If we don't restrain him
in the early stage...

27
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:44,107
to prevent him from developing,

28
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:47,445
it'll be incredibly tough for us
to fight in the late stage.

29
00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:50,635
This is why you chose Youko?

30
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:55,164
Youko can easily beat up Chin
in the same line...

31
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:56,838
before reaching level 6.

32
00:02:57,397 --> 00:02:59,600
As long as he's not with high-burst-of
damage equipment in the late stage,

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,360
we can easily crush him in team fights.

34
00:03:02,277 --> 00:03:04,035
So we must make the fight a quick one.

35
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:18,238
You're all silent now?

36
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:47,873
Welcome back.

37
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:52,367
This is the gaming scene of the
second match between ZGDX and YQCB.

38
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:54,670
-I'm Fan, the commentator.
-I'm commentator Chen Yao.

39
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,484
We now see the players of both teams
are ready to play.

40
00:03:58,564 --> 00:04:03,501
YQCB first banned Kosodenote,
Yamakaze and Tamamo-no-Mae...

41
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:07,605
while ZGDX banned
Aoandou, Yama Usagi and Shuten.

42
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:11,673
Then let's see what
midsolo will Smiling choose?

43
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:14,053
I guess basically
she will choose Ootengu again.

44
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,077
Yuki Onna?

45
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:17,318
Oh, my God, she chose Yuki Onna.

46
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:18,553
Is this the time to play
four-preserving-one tactics?

47
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,782
Yuki Onna.

48
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:22,966
To be honest, I don't get
why she chose Yuki Onna now.

49
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:24,888
She should know their opponent is YQCB.

50
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:26,362
Can the tactics work?

51
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:27,946
I don't understand it either.

52
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:28,952
Cheng.

53
00:04:29,032 --> 00:04:29,917
Hannya.

54
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:31,003
Okay.

55
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:33,669
What?

56
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:37,497
After Smiling chose Yuki Onna,
ZGDX actually picked Hannya!

57
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,963
What kind of lineup is this?

58
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:41,916
According to the current lineup,
I think this should be the case.

59
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:43,981
Hannya and Ibaraki Douji
go to the bottom lane.

60
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:46,083
And the midsolo is Yuki Onna.

61
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:47,608
The topsolo would be Onikiri.

62
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,028
Onikiri as midsolo?

63
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:51,143
What in the world is this?

64
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:52,811
I'm a little baffled now.

65
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:54,647
The players in this season
are too unpredictable.

66
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,480
Everything I say may be refuted.

67
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,698
I am a bit autistic and
don't want to talk anymore.

68
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,567
Okay, now we see that...

69
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,009
it's been 13 minutes
since the match started.

70
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:18,205
In ZGDX…

71
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,758
YQCB is too patient.

72
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:23,358
It's been over ten minutes.
They have just hit and lead the lines.

73
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:24,918
I'm even not used to the fact
that no one has ambushed me.

74
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:26,444
We have similar gold and equipment.

75
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:27,897
They are now waiting for their chance.

76
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:29,949
Now it depends on who'll slip up.

77
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,168
Plus the lineup is very confusing.

78
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:34,257
Chubby, go make me a vision.

79
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:36,107
-I'll come over.
-Okay.

80
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:37,182
K is here.

81
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:38,630
I'm coming too. I'm coming too.

82
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:39,710
Me too.

83
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,883
Get in.

84
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:43,994
What?

85
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:45,389
Where is the promised
friendly development?

86
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:46,809
Four people actually came.

87
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,752
I can't hold my Barrier for long.
Cheng has only half of blood now.

88
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:49,819
I'll be right there.
I'll go around the back.

89
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,655
Wait for me, don't be impulsive.

90
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:53,487
Okay, now we see...

91
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,790
Yuki Onna made
an ultimate skill to stall for time.

92
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,266
Onikiri and Ibaraki Douji used Shift.

93
00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:58,192
Retreat.

94
00:05:58,272 --> 00:05:59,275
Lu Sicheng is not full-bloodied.

95
00:05:59,355 --> 00:06:01,269
You want to be killed under the turret
in the bottom lane by Smiling?

96
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:02,917
I don't want to sacrifice my ad.

97
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:07,696
Tong Yao.

98
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:08,770
Are they afraid of you?

99
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,568
Why did they retreat as soon as you came?

100
00:06:12,397 --> 00:06:14,179
They left the moment I came. Shoot.

101
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:16,039
Then my gold was wasted all the way here.

102
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:18,409
YQCB team is so restrained.

103
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:20,103
If they wait another half second
when my barrier vanishes,

104
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:22,467
they can totally kill captain
with several hits.

105
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:24,905
YQCB is now playing differently
than before.

106
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,699
They want to fight a long battle
with us now.

107
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:29,294
So when it comes to late team fights,
we must be cautious.

108
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:31,688
On the contrary, ZGDX players...

109
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,318
are famous for quick reaction,
strong positioning...

110
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:34,670
as well as stronger awareness to support.

111
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,679
It's still a familiar playing style.

112
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,250
It doesn't look good now.

113
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,986
It depends on who has more stamina
in the following match.

114
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,552
However, it seems to be
the other way around...

115
00:06:44,632 --> 00:06:46,369
in today's game.

116
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,182
Ai Jia. Come and stall with me
in the middle lane...

117
00:06:58,262 --> 00:06:59,729
to cover Hierophant
and others over Orochi.

118
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:00,757
Okay.

119
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,877
They'll come steal it.
Yasha is not as fast as me.

120
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:04,241
I'm saving my ultimate skill for Smiling.

121
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:05,548
As soon as she comes, I'll kill her.

122
00:07:05,628 --> 00:07:07,620
YQCB's ad and jungler
are both hitting Orochi.

123
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,683
We can't let them have it.

124
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,235
Doumeki and Youtou Hime
are too fast hitting Orochi.

125
00:07:10,315 --> 00:07:11,437
I may not be able to steal it
even if I enter with Subdue.

126
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:12,794
Yeah, let's lead the line separately.

127
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:15,479
No, we can't let them have it.
Cat, pick up a team fight.

128
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:18,026
I'll flank it and kill Menreiki first.

129
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:21,215
You have to slap my face like this?

130
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:22,248
They got me killed in a second.

131
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:23,566
They came for Orochi in a hurry.

132
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:25,451
Watch your positions!
Rong, you stop Hannya.

133
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:26,555
Make sure Hierophant will get Orochi.

134
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:28,047
K will definitely come to reclaim it.

135
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:29,308
Kim Eun-seok, use Subdue first.

136
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:30,479
K, come for it.

137
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:31,722
Okay.

138
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:34,117
Unstoppable
K jumps into the snake pit for Orochi.

139
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:36,528
Youtou Hime has Orochi. Retreat!

140
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:38,024
They have Kirin with them.
We have no advantage.

141
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:40,036
(Successfully sealed)

142
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:42,731
They didn't get it.
YQCB already got Orochi.

143
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:44,753
We're all dead, go back!

144
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,531
Youtou Hime is out of blood.
Onikiri, come and get it.

145
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,307
(Double Kill)

146
00:07:50,623 --> 00:07:52,397
Let's go. We can't fight this.

147
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:54,903
We can't even touch the back row.
Besides, Doumeki has tremendous damage.

148
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:56,711
Retreat,
Tong Yao is running out of blood too.

149
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:57,962
Retreat! Retreat!

150
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:59,413
Let's go.
Cheng, we don't have enough blood.

151
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:01,105
Let's go. I can't protect you.

152
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:02,225
I can fight.

153
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:03,578
I can fight.

154
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,054
I can fight.

155
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:09,511
-I can fight.
-Yes.

156
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:10,981
If they don't retreat and got aced,

157
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,347
the result of this match
would be obvious.

158
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,912
I can fight.

159
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:03,817
Bravo!

160
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:07,047
Chessman and Smiling worked together
to kill Rong in seconds.

161
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:00,917
Smiling was killed
by Hierophant's set of skills.

162
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:02,037
Chessman is still holding on.

163
00:11:02,117 --> 00:11:06,408
Hierophant! Hierophant! Hierophant!

164
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:12,203
Hierophant! Hierophant! Hierophant!

165
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:35,999
Ace!

166
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,486
Pushing up to the base turret.

167
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:39,119
ZGDX base has exploded.

168
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:43,176
Let's congratulate YQCB
for winning the game!

169
00:13:00,357 --> 00:13:02,051
Congratulations to YQCB.

170
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:03,301
Nice!

171
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:05,839
♪If I'm pressed, I'll make them pay♪

172
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,856
That was a great play by us.

173
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,294
♪Yeah, if you push me, I'll make you pay♪

174
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,166
We won.

175
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:14,884
♪We better move. Move♪

176
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:16,652
Ai Jia,
do you think I played well just now?

177
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:17,978
-Yes.
-Nice, nice.

178
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:19,542
Good for you.

179
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:20,870
That's a must.

180
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:23,134
Let's go, let's go.

181
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:25,738
Let's go.

182
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:05,277
Thank you for your hard work.
Thank you for your hard work.

Thank you for your hard work.

Thank you for your hard work.

185
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:08,566
Thank you for your hard work.

186
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,216
Come on, thank you.

187
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:12,279
Congratulations.

188
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,358
Good job.

189
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:15,007
-Go for it.
-Cheng.

190
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:22,833
Good job.

191
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:26,628
It's amazing that a girl can do like this.

192
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,629
Thank you.

193
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:32,047
Chessman is suffering
from his hand injury?

194
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:35,989
Smiling.

195
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:37,673
Take good care of him.

196
00:16:07,597 --> 00:16:08,540
All right, all right.

197
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,186
Don't look like it's the end of the world.

198
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:12,416
It's just a loss in the regular season.
It's nothing.

199
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:14,285
Winning and losing
is a common thing, right?

200
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:16,123
Even though we lost this game,
as long as we win the next game,

201
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:17,604
we're still able to make it, right?

202
00:16:25,637 --> 00:16:28,428
Really. Respond to me. Look at me.

203
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:30,267
One game is really nothing.

204
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:31,781
What does that say about us?

205
00:16:31,861 --> 00:16:34,352
It's just that we'll be watching less
Weibo and do less live streaming.

206
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:35,285
Right?

207
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:41,502
Ming.

208
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:45,493
Let's put our minds at ease for a while.

209
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:47,829
Tomorrow we can analyze
the reasons why we lost the game.

210
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:49,100
The reason for the loss.

211
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:53,435
Before we split the blame today,
shouldn't we settle some other stuff?

212
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:54,434
Cat.

213
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,201
What's wrong?

214
00:16:57,521 --> 00:16:58,617
I can't talk?

215
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:08,902
Rest early today.

216
00:17:08,982 --> 00:17:09,963
Prepare for the game tomorrow.

217
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:11,348
Prepare for the game?

218
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:13,234
Captain.

219
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,730
That's it, right?

220
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,930
Don't you have anything
you have to explain to us?

221
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:20,847
What do you want me to say?

222
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:22,235
Cat, calm down.

223
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:25,206
Then I'll say it.

224
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:26,895
You've been out early
and back late these days.

225
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:27,929
What are you doing?

226
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:29,509
You're distracted.

227
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:30,936
When Ming was talking about the tactics,

228
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,898
was your soul here
though your body was here?

229
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:34,980
How much of the tactics have you heard?

230
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,480
And what the hell happened today?

231
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,772
Why didn't you do what we had trained for
to take Komatsumaru?

232
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,438
Why did you take Youko?

233
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,002
Why did you change Ming's tactics?

234
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:45,091
We're so confused.

235
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:47,047
Aren't you going to say anything?

236
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:50,845
Don't tell me you took Youko
just to show off to Hierophant.

237
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:52,523
Before the game I was in the hallway.

238
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:54,144
I heard you said that to Ming.

239
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,230
Cat.

240
00:17:59,197 --> 00:18:00,176
Cheng.

241
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:02,097
I just need an explanation.

242
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:07,032
Before the race,
Cheng came to see me alone.

243
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,347
Ming.

244
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:09,986
I can't take Komatsumaru in this match.

245
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:11,071
Let me take Youko.

246
00:18:11,151 --> 00:18:13,186
We don't have time now
to train new tactics.

247
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,556
-At least you can tell me why.
-No reason.

248
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:18,506
It's because I don't want to
take a shikigami for a long battle.

249
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:20,599
Youko can contain Hierophant
in the early stage.

250
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:22,139
If I don't let him develop well,

251
00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:23,974
we might be able to finish the game
as soon as possible.

252
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:26,214
Why do you want to finish the game
as soon as possible?

253
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:28,335
I thought I told you before.

254
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:30,371
It's a tough fight. It's a long battle.

255
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:31,649
We need to compete in
endurance and physical strength.

256
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:32,569
Ming.

257
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:34,645
I can't fight a long battle.

258
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:35,720
Give me an explanation.

259
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,796
There is none.

260
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:38,944
Hierophant is my corresponding opponent.

261
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:42,959
Before the game, Cheng told me
he wanted to take Youko.

262
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:45,292
But Cheng,

263
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,156
I need an explanation.

264
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:56,258
You've all got him wrong.

265
00:18:56,338 --> 00:19:00,070
Cheng actually had a relapse
of his hand injury.

266
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:01,654
Your hand is injured?

267
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:03,711
That's why Cheng wanted a quick fight.

268
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:08,816
Cheng.

269
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:11,580
Say something!

270
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,858
What did you do?

271
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:15,134
Why did you hurt your hand
before the game?

272
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:18,665
Yesterday's training match
was not so good.

273
00:19:18,745 --> 00:19:20,624
Cheng played ranking overnight.

274
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:25,214
Played ranking overnight
just because a bad training match?

275
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:26,147
Captain.

276
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:28,736
The whole world knows
your hands can't take this.

277
00:19:28,816 --> 00:19:30,620
Have you forgotten how Ming retired?

278
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,299
You felt guilty?

279
00:19:32,725 --> 00:19:34,011
Then what had you done?

280
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:37,188
You thought the short training time
affected how you performed.

281
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:40,472
Here is the question.
What have you been doing all this time?

282
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:42,146
Cheng went to solve
what happened to Tong Yao.

283
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:44,152
Solve what happened to Tong Yao?

284
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:45,793
How? How to solve it?

285
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:50,523
Cheng seeked a relationship
in the police...

286
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:52,605
and found out about
the background of "Momo is a big devil".

287
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:54,841
It turned out this person is in Shenzhen.

288
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:55,832
What's the result?

289
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:58,717
The result is
the same as Cheng predicted.

290
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,293
She is a specialized troublemaker.

291
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:02,935
She didn't commit suicide at all.
She's not a junior either.

292
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:04,483
Now she's at the police station.

293
00:20:04,563 --> 00:20:06,195
Be prepared, Tong Yao.

294
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:08,031
We'll go to the police station
in several days...

295
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:09,239
and confront this girl in person.

296
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,198
I...

297
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:13,370
I was ready to apologize.

298
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,549
Captain.

299
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,091
Is it true that
if Rui hadn't got this call,

300
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:27,028
you'd have planned to
hide for the rest of your life?

301
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:28,661
What the hell is wrong with you?

302
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:30,701
You didn't tell us about your hand injury.

303
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:32,073
You solved what happened
to Tong Yao alone.

304
00:20:32,153 --> 00:20:33,349
You didn't tell us either.

305
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,418
Are you worried that
we wouldn't let you go?

306
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:37,458
Or are you worried that we had to
ask you to take the Komatsumaru shit...

307
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,263
regardless of your hand injury?

308
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:43,642
Why didn't you talk with us
about this in advance?

309
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:46,633
Is it you wouldn't want to talk about it
or you just didn't trust us,

310
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,337
didn't trust your teammates at all?

311
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,929
That's right.

312
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,078
Tong Yao is your girlfriend.

313
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:56,827
But have you ever thought
she's not just your girlfriend,

314
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,702
but also our teammate.

315
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:00,595
She's been wronged by the public.

316
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:02,431
She has been treated unfairly.

317
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,728
Would we ignore it?

318
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:05,108
Would we not let you go?

319
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,014
That's right.
We just lost one game today.

320
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,727
But do you know I'm upset?

321
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:15,833
It's not because we lost today.

322
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:19,960
It's because I found out that you,
Lu Sicheng, all this time,

323
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,349
you don't trust your teammates at all.

324
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:35,401
If you don't need your teammates,

325
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:39,795
then I would like to say,
we don't want a captain like you at all.

326
00:21:42,111 --> 00:21:43,154
Cat.

327
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:52,836
-Cat.
-Cat.

328
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,205
-Hurry up!
-Cat!

329
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:55,757
What are you doing?

330
00:21:55,837 --> 00:21:57,007
What are you doing?

331
00:21:57,087 --> 00:21:58,980
-Cat!
-What else can I do?

332
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,077
Let's all go home
and find our own mothers.

333
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:03,629
-You just said this because you're angry.
-It's not like that.

334
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:07,103
You should know I'm almost
going to retire after this year.

335
00:22:07,183 --> 00:22:09,307
If I'm not going to get
a World Championships ticket this year,

336
00:22:09,387 --> 00:22:11,604
there is no hope for my e-sports career.

337
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:13,767
You know what?

338
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,789
My parents don't even agree with me
playing e-sports.

339
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,252
If I don't get any accomplishment
this year,

340
00:22:18,332 --> 00:22:20,487
how am I going to face my family?

341
00:22:21,486 --> 00:22:22,621
In this case,

342
00:22:23,163 --> 00:22:24,487
will we be forced
to withdraw again this year...

343
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,807
like what we did
because of Ming's hand injury last year?

344
00:22:27,572 --> 00:22:28,762
Are you afraid?

345
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:31,086
Are you afraid?

346
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,625
You're not afraid, I am.

347
00:22:33,294 --> 00:22:34,462
Don't go, Cat.

348
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:35,613
Cat.

349
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:36,737
Cat.

350
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:38,282
Cat.

351
00:22:38,362 --> 00:22:42,558
These are words out of anger.
No one said we'd withdraw.

352
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:44,755
Cheng is just having a relapse
of hand injury.

353
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:47,434
It's not like it's broken.
Why do you think it's so serious?

354
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:49,381
I sat next to him at the game today.

355
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:50,822
I observed it the most clearly.

356
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:54,733
It was only in the late stage
that he slipped up a little.

357
00:22:54,813 --> 00:22:56,826
If he didn't tell you,
you wouldn't have noticed it, would you?

358
00:22:56,906 --> 00:22:57,842
Right?

359
00:22:58,183 --> 00:23:00,381
So, take it easy.

360
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:01,777
Love and peace.

361
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:05,108
The most important thing now is to
face it together and solve the problems.

362
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:07,967
How can we face it together
after all this?

363
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:11,317
Does he ever want to take us with him?

364
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:12,457
Cat.

365
00:23:13,437 --> 00:23:16,002
You are playing games for yourself,
not for others.

366
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:17,827
That's what you said yourself.
Have you forgotten?

367
00:23:17,907 --> 00:23:21,799
My dream is to win every game
on the field with my bros.

368
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:23,122
It's not like this now.

369
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:29,443
That's what I want, too.

370
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:31,324
Yes.

371
00:23:31,404 --> 00:23:33,249
I'm also pretty mad today.

372
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,839
Cheng didn't even tell us
before he made the choice alone.

373
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,290
But if you think about it
from another angle,

374
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,286
isn't everything he's been doing
for the team?

375
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:42,488
He's been the only one
to suffer all the pressure.

376
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:46,096
He is used to bear the burden himself.
That's why he felt he must carry.

377
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,897
He doesn't trust us at all.

378
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:51,777
How can we work together in the future?

379
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:19,917
Sometimes,

380
00:24:20,778 --> 00:24:22,176
I wonder...

381
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:26,541
did we choose the wrong person
from the beginning.

382
00:24:26,621 --> 00:24:28,079
You mean Tong Yao?

383
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:31,255
I don't think so.

384
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:33,993
She proved to be very good.

385
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:38,664
I'm not saying
she's technically challenged.

386
00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:40,365
I'm talking about...

387
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:45,021
the effect she's had on other people.

388
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:50,765
The club was looking for big news before.

389
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:54,637
And now there's a lot of news
coming on us.

390
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:00,922
Tong Yao does have an effect on us.

391
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,987
But I think
she is the one who made the whole team,

392
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:08,249
and Cheng become better.

393
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:13,547
It's just that they probably
haven't even realized it yet.

394
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:21,385
Cheng.

395
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:27,967
Cheng.

396
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:33,285
Cheng, does your hand still hurt?

397
00:26:36,587 --> 00:26:37,949
Open the door.

398
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,424
Let me apply the medicine for you.

399
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:42,739
Cheng.

400
00:26:43,377 --> 00:26:44,623
Tong Yao.

401
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:45,993
I want to have some quiet time.

402
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:48,525
Okay.

403
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:52,818
Then open the door
when you've figured it out.

404
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:54,958
I'll be here with you.

405
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:22,565
Come on, come on. Catch up.

406
00:27:22,645 --> 00:27:24,458
-Come on.
-Destroy the turret.

407
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:26,820
Keep up, keep up.

408
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,418
-Break down the turret.
-Break down the turret.

409
00:27:28,498 --> 00:27:29,788
-In one breath.
-Hurry up.

410
00:27:29,868 --> 00:27:31,357
In one breath.

411
00:27:31,437 --> 00:27:33,003
-Nice.
-Nice.

412
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,854
Guys!

413
00:27:38,621 --> 00:27:40,536
-This is a good one.
-Yes.

414
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:13,202
Cheng.

415
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,899
When I first came to the team,

416
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:19,807
and officially met you,

417
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,566
you shut me out.

418
00:28:23,352 --> 00:28:24,844
At that time, I was thinking,

419
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,306
"oh, no."

420
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,330
The captain is so bossy.

421
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:31,603
What if we don't get along well
in the future?

422
00:28:32,287 --> 00:28:34,290
If I don't perform well in the future,

423
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:36,528
you must judge me every day.

424
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,661
Later, as expected,

425
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:42,110
you judge me every day.

426
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:48,251
But I seem to be used to it
because what you say is right.

427
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:51,611
No matter if you call me a loser,

428
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:54,068
or criticize me for beating the girl.

429
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:55,474
The truth is...

430
00:28:56,877 --> 00:28:58,128
you are right.

431
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,188
So I seem to have gotten used to it.

432
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:05,326
I'm used to listening to you,

433
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,431
used to relying on you,

434
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,197
thinking you can do anything.

435
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:16,567
You've always been the captain of ZGDX,

436
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:19,917
the top three ad in the world.

437
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,577
You're competent.

438
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:26,437
It's like you can solve everything
by yourself.

439
00:29:28,397 --> 00:29:29,522
But...

440
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,378
I still have to nag around you.

441
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:34,722
Although you are the captain,

442
00:29:35,303 --> 00:29:38,369
don't be like a hen protecting her chicks,

443
00:29:38,449 --> 00:29:41,048
protecting everyone under your wings.

444
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:44,765
You are a human being, not a god.

445
00:29:45,256 --> 00:29:47,522
There will always be things
that you can't bear...

446
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:49,561
or are difficult to solve.

447
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:52,497
You said before...

448
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:56,929
you were afraid that you were no longer
the perfect man I thought you had been.

449
00:29:57,698 --> 00:29:59,331
Actually, it's not like that.

450
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:04,366
Although I've seen you in cheap T-shirts,

451
00:30:04,446 --> 00:30:06,801
without shaving and cutting your toenails.

452
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:08,807
You are...

453
00:30:09,597 --> 00:30:13,196
still irreplaceable in my heart.

454
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,637
There is one more thing...

455
00:30:18,837 --> 00:30:20,247
I didn't tell you.

456
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:27,047
It's about
when you made the love affair public.

457
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:30,493
As your girlfriend,

458
00:30:31,173 --> 00:30:32,767
I'm really touched...

459
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:38,637
because you ignore the judgments
of the world.

460
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,421
It proves that you care about me.

461
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:43,001
You love me.

462
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:45,306
I'm really happy.

463
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:50,529
You know what?

464
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:57,027
I'm really grateful to you
for helping me find that girl...

465
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:58,671
and find out the truth.

466
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:05,285
In fact, Rui told me in secret
what the club planned to do.

467
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:08,253
I said it's okay.

468
00:31:08,654 --> 00:31:10,433
I have to take care
of the overall situation.

469
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:15,073
I was ready to be scolded
and apologize on the internet...

470
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:19,466
because there are always
so many people telling me...

471
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,643
you are a public figure.

472
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:26,552
When you enjoy the glory of the spotlight,

473
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:29,749
you have to learn to bear
the dark side behind the light...

474
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:32,711
no matter how much you've been wronged,

475
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:34,769
how much accusations you've suffered.

476
00:31:36,076 --> 00:31:37,247
But you...

477
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:40,487
gave me a different answer.

478
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:45,117
You tell me
I don't have to be so aggravated...

479
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:48,200
because you got my back.

480
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,904
Ming.

481
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:03,456
You know what?

482
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:07,820
I feel bad.

483
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:12,297
I feel bad.

484
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:16,967
I can't do anything...

485
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:21,727
about what's going on.

486
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:25,299
I know.

487
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:30,156
I know I'm just a housekeeper.

488
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:31,804
Manny.

489
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:35,871
But I still believe...

490
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:40,517
I still believe that
we can win the championship.

491
00:32:40,597 --> 00:32:41,733
You know what?

492
00:32:48,327 --> 00:32:50,397
I don't care what pressure
the company puts on me.

493
00:32:54,087 --> 00:32:56,327
And I don't care what people say about me.

494
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:01,503
You know what I care about?

495
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:06,246
I care about you guys.

496
00:33:09,677 --> 00:33:11,367
I care about you.

497
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:20,146
I don't want to lose
each and every one of you.

498
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:24,305
Do you understand?

499
00:33:35,935 --> 00:33:37,051
Lu Sicheng.

500
00:33:38,354 --> 00:33:40,626
If you don't pull yourself together,

501
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:46,056
I will blame myself so much
and feel so guilty.

502
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:51,475
If Cat is disappointed because of this
and left,

503
00:33:52,374 --> 00:33:54,647
I will feel that it is my fault.

504
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:59,616
I don't seem to be able to
handle this well.

505
00:34:00,227 --> 00:34:02,673
I easily get vulnerable.

506
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:05,468
If something really happens to the team
because of this.

507
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:08,020
-I...
-Will you blame me?

508
00:34:14,697 --> 00:34:15,804
Yes.

509
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:19,347
I would probably go nuts.

510
00:34:22,317 --> 00:34:24,684
And I'm a very resentful person.

511
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,764
Maybe...

512
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,413
I'll hate you for the rest of my life.

513
00:34:31,009 --> 00:34:33,554
I can imagine your face through the door.

514
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:39,927
I used to think...

515
00:34:41,404 --> 00:34:43,796
I could handle everything.

516
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:46,150
I didn't care what anyone thought.

517
00:34:49,117 --> 00:34:50,432
Cat was right.

518
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,116
I was wrong.

519
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:56,816
I thought I could handle everything.

520
00:34:57,576 --> 00:34:58,677
I was wrong.

521
00:35:01,117 --> 00:35:02,785
I'm not fearless.

522
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:06,635
I can be scared too.

523
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:11,162
I hesitate too.

524
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,372
I guess...

525
00:35:17,717 --> 00:35:19,163
this day will come.

526
00:35:22,157 --> 00:35:23,539
I need you.

527
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:35,399
I need you.

528
00:36:59,277 --> 00:37:02,349
Base, 2:00. See you there.

B(est ADC Lu Sicheng)

531
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:03,637
About the ban in the previous game,

532
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:08,362
I didn't think it through to pick Youko.

533
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:13,819
I hadn't discussed with you
before I changed Ming's tactics.

534
00:39:14,424 --> 00:39:15,509
It's my fault.

535
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:18,922
I apologize.

536
00:39:23,637 --> 00:39:25,278
You don't have to indulge me like this...

537
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:27,447
in the future.

538
00:39:28,277 --> 00:39:29,956
If I have done something wrong,

539
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:31,815
just tell me.

540
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:34,839
I will correct it.

541
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:43,107
As the team captain,

542
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:45,350
it's my fault for leaving the team
without permission.

543
00:39:45,752 --> 00:39:50,057
I just hope you can give me a little time
so that I can slowly learn...

544
00:39:50,442 --> 00:39:52,842
to correct my series of problems
such as assertive character,

545
00:39:53,284 --> 00:39:54,338
team bully,

546
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:59,315
ego and caprice.

547
00:40:01,197 --> 00:40:02,482
The team is a whole.

548
00:40:03,264 --> 00:40:04,820
I can't fight alone,

549
00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:08,292
not to say do everything all by myself.

550
00:40:08,912 --> 00:40:10,024
I admit...

551
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:12,258
I need you guys.

552
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,964
I hope you can accept my apology.

553
00:40:22,732 --> 00:40:24,169
From now on,

554
00:40:25,776 --> 00:40:28,856
I hope we can face whatever
we may encounter all together.

555
00:40:30,377 --> 00:40:33,483
I will focus on the following games
and trainings.

556
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:36,087
ZGDX...

557
00:40:37,317 --> 00:40:38,947
isn't my team alone.

558
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:42,380
It's a team for all of us.

559
00:40:46,637 --> 00:40:48,637
I hope we can fight to the end...

560
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:53,207
with no regrets...

561
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:55,709
and no grudge.

562
00:40:59,277 --> 00:41:00,477
I'm sorry.

563
00:41:01,864 --> 00:41:03,887
I apologize again to you...

564
00:41:05,717 --> 00:41:07,065
for my ego and caprice.

565
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,809
Our Cheng.

566
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:28,631
I don't know why I feel very scared now.

567
00:41:30,307 --> 00:41:31,991
Forget it.

568
00:41:33,467 --> 00:41:34,452
Cheng.

569
00:41:34,532 --> 00:41:36,716
I never thought I'd see
you apologize in my lifetime.

570
00:41:36,796 --> 00:41:39,273
My life is worth it. I have no regrets.

571
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,011
Cheng.

572
00:41:42,091 --> 00:41:43,364
Do you want to apologize
for getting me killed...

573
00:41:43,444 --> 00:41:45,582
just because you didn't cure
me to save your skill by the way?

574
00:41:45,662 --> 00:41:47,177
Chubby, don't go too far.

575
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:48,555
Let go of Cheng. You want to strangle him?

576
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:50,523
He should apologize.

577
00:42:01,567 --> 00:42:03,573
Cat, why are you acting like a statue?

578
00:42:03,653 --> 00:42:06,714
Who woke up early in the morning,
saying Cheng wouldn't call you?

579
00:42:10,344 --> 00:42:12,092
Cheng, you scared me.

580
00:42:15,288 --> 00:42:17,781
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you.

581
00:42:17,861 --> 00:42:19,613
I'll never yell at you again, Cheng.

582
00:42:19,693 --> 00:42:21,052
Don't cry anymore.

583
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,819
I'm not crying.

584
00:42:27,858 --> 00:42:29,955
You didn't cry? Then I feel at a loss.

585
00:42:30,035 --> 00:42:32,044
My brother doesn't cry.

586
00:42:32,124 --> 00:42:33,535
Think about it.

587
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:38,287
-This is nice.
-That's right.

588
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:40,148
A family should be in one piece.

589
00:42:40,228 --> 00:42:41,577

00:43:04,637 --> 00:43:06,325
-Hello.
-Here we are. Let's get in.

594
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:07,939
Let's go.

595
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,157
Are you nervous?

596
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,518
Don't worry, I'm here. Let's go.

597
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:20,027
(Mediation in accordance
with the law, fair and just.)

598
00:43:20,797 --> 00:43:23,165
You both know the details of the matter.

599
00:43:23,245 --> 00:43:26,522
We arranged you to meet today
to solve the problem.

600
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,208
Lin Mo...

601
00:43:28,288 --> 00:43:30,924
is the holder with the Weibo ID
of "Momo is a big devil".

602
00:43:31,004 --> 00:43:32,159
This is her parents.

603
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:34,013
After our investigation,

604
00:43:34,093 --> 00:43:37,441
the delivery of the razor blade
is indeed sent by Lin Mo.

605
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:41,290
Young people today do things
without caring about consequences.

606
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:44,359
We deal with about one or two
prank delivery cases like this...

607
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:46,245
every month.

608
00:43:46,325 --> 00:43:47,765
Have you examined the injuries here?

609
00:43:47,845 --> 00:43:48,971
Please take a look.

610
00:43:58,087 --> 00:44:01,020
Usually it ends
with an amicable settlement.

611
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,206
After all,
the child is young and acts wild.

612
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:04,734
She's been scolded.

613
00:44:04,814 --> 00:44:07,926
I think she's pretty scared too
and has learned a lesson.

614
00:44:08,006 --> 00:44:09,824
She probably doesn't dare
to do so anymore in the future.

615
00:44:09,904 --> 00:44:11,014
That's true.

616
00:44:11,094 --> 00:44:12,640
She's young and she acts wild.

617
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,270
My daughter is only 18 years old.

618
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,841
She is re-enrolling this year, preparing
to take the college entrance examination.

619
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:17,925
Yes, yes.

620
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:21,290
We'll teach her well when we get back.

621
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:24,808
We'll cover all the medical expenses.

622
00:44:25,106 --> 00:44:27,856
It's a shame
to take what happened online into reality.

623
00:44:27,936 --> 00:44:28,874
Right?

624
00:44:28,954 --> 00:44:32,406
And our child
came crying all the way here today.

625
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:34,453
She was called out
of her school like this.

626
00:44:34,534 --> 00:44:37,999
When she gets back, her classmates
may say something bad about her.

627
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,372
And her father and I
still have to go to work.

628
00:44:40,452 --> 00:44:41,560
No reconciliation.

629
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,494
Your kid is in her early 18s.

630
00:44:44,574 --> 00:44:46,271
My girl is only in her early 20s too.

631
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:49,314
If we're going to let it go just
because your kid is young and acts wild.

632
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:51,622
What about the injuries
and grievances my girl has suffered?

633
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:53,906
She not only posted hater posts
on the Internet to spread rumors...

634
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:56,421
but also sent a razor blade
and make up her misery on the internet,

635
00:44:56,501 --> 00:44:58,731
saying she was depressed and
wanted to commit suicide out of nowhere.

636
00:44:58,811 --> 00:45:02,028
This has brought more insult and trouble
to my girlfriend.

637
00:45:02,108 --> 00:45:03,257
How can we settle this?

638
00:45:03,685 --> 00:45:05,362
So, we don't want to reconcile.

639
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,985
Apologize now!

640
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:14,600
I... I didn't mean it.

641
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,257
I was wrong.
I won't dare to do it again.

642
00:45:18,205 --> 00:45:19,928
Please forgive me.

643
00:45:22,339 --> 00:45:23,472
Don't be nervous.

644
00:45:24,032 --> 00:45:25,467
It's not a controlled blade.

645
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:27,237
And you can only be locked up
for a few days...

646
00:45:27,317 --> 00:45:28,452
for lying
and spreading rumors on the Internet.

647
00:45:28,532 --> 00:45:30,623
It's just you'd have a stained document.

648
00:45:30,703 --> 00:45:33,402
We will educate you and have you
compensate for her moral damages.

649
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:36,391
She just messed around on the internet.
Is it that serious?

650
00:45:37,054 --> 00:45:38,064
It's not so serious.

651
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:41,449
Well, if I break your daughter's hand
before her college entrance exam,

652
00:45:41,529 --> 00:45:42,668
is it not so serious either?

653
00:45:42,748 --> 00:45:45,461
-After all, you can take it next year.
-What are you talking about?

654
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:47,004
We didn't mean to do it.

655
00:45:48,501 --> 00:45:50,588
Watch out.
This is the Public Security Bureau.

656
00:45:50,668 --> 00:45:53,075
-No more nonsense.
-That's right, no more nonsense.

657
00:45:53,155 --> 00:45:54,318
I'm talking about you.

658
00:45:55,847 --> 00:45:57,828
Our opinion is not to reconcile.

659
00:45:58,285 --> 00:45:59,244
Let's go.

660
00:46:01,087 --> 00:46:02,530
Why are you so unreasonable?

661
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,283
Why did they leave?

662
00:46:06,002 --> 00:46:07,092
Comrade police.

663
00:46:07,172 --> 00:46:10,087
If they don't reconcile,
will our kid have a stained document?

664
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,205
That's right.

665
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:13,210
Then, if there are too many such records,

666
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,406
will it affect her college entrance
examination?

667
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:18,403
What does she mean
by too many such records?

668
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:19,843
You feel sorry for the little girl?

669
00:46:19,923 --> 00:46:21,205
I'm a little girl too.

670
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,845
You're the only girl in our family.

671
00:46:25,787 --> 00:46:26,933
Detention?

672
00:46:27,013 --> 00:46:28,603
How can she be detained?

673
00:46:28,683 --> 00:46:31,359
She can't be held in custody
for even a day, let alone five days.

674
00:46:31,439 --> 00:46:34,564
My child still has to go to school.
Last time it was fine.

675
00:46:34,644 --> 00:46:37,856
How come she has to be detained this time?
It's obviously the same thing.

676
00:46:37,936 --> 00:46:40,349
Madam, how can you say that?

677
00:46:41,021 --> 00:46:43,728
As a parent,
you didn't properly educate your children.

678
00:46:43,808 --> 00:46:44,905
The first thing you think of...

679
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:47,981
is how to avoid punishment irresponsibly
in face of a problem.

680
00:46:48,061 --> 00:46:50,403
This is not the first or second time
she did this kind of thing.

681
00:46:50,483 --> 00:46:53,330
Three months ago, she wrote
a threatening letter to someone,

682
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,136
just for dissing her idol.

683
00:46:55,598 --> 00:46:56,627
Does that make sense?

684
00:46:56,707 --> 00:46:58,422
No, it's just a letter.

685
00:46:58,502 --> 00:46:59,845
What can she threaten?

686
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:01,355
What can she threaten?

687
00:47:01,435 --> 00:47:03,055
You have no sense of law at all.

688
00:47:03,355 --> 00:47:04,888
You're afraid that
your child will be detained.

689
00:47:04,968 --> 00:47:06,470
Doesn't the other kid have parents?

690
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:09,582
Last time, they didn't hold you
accountable and let you pay for it.

691
00:47:09,662 --> 00:47:11,423
But it doesn't mean
that she is not at fault.

692
00:47:14,956 --> 00:47:18,360
I don't think I can mediate
with this kind of attitude of yours.

693
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,911
Let's go through the procedure next.

694
00:47:21,663 --> 00:47:22,728
You have worked hard.

695
00:47:22,808 --> 00:47:24,118
We'll contact you later.

696
00:47:24,198 --> 00:47:26,143
How can they do that?

697
00:47:26,223 --> 00:47:28,816
No way. I don't believe it.

698
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:30,831
She'll be detained like this?

699
00:47:31,645 --> 00:47:32,624
How is it?

700
00:47:32,704 --> 00:47:34,068
What a surprise.

701
00:47:34,148 --> 00:47:37,774
This little girl was sued before
for sending threatening letters to others.

702
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,982
This time,
I'm afraid that she will be detained.

703
00:47:40,062 --> 00:47:42,148
According to Article 20 of the Public
Security Management Punishment Law,

704
00:47:42,228 --> 00:47:43,401
anyone who violates
public security management...

705
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:45,278
in one of the following circumstances
shall take heavier penalty.

706
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:46,596
Those who have been
previously punished...

707
00:47:46,676 --> 00:47:48,031
by public security management
within six months.

708
00:47:48,111 --> 00:47:50,390
Article 42,
anyone with one of the following acts...

709
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,795
shall be punished by detention
for less than five days,

710
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:53,404
or a fine of less than five hundred yuan.

711
00:47:53,484 --> 00:47:54,700
Which in more serious cases,

712
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,018
shall be detained for more than five days
or less than ten days...

713
00:47:57,098 --> 00:47:58,841
with also a fine of less than 500 yuan.

714
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:02,021
One of them, write a threatening letter
or by other means...

715
00:48:02,101 --> 00:48:03,971
threaten the personal safety of others.

716
00:48:05,075 --> 00:48:06,747
She has reached eighteen years old...

717
00:48:06,827 --> 00:48:08,164
with a previous conviction
within six months.

718
00:48:08,244 --> 00:48:10,122
Just deal with it the way it should be.

719
00:48:10,903 --> 00:48:13,434
You memorized it from Baidu last night?

720
00:48:13,514 --> 00:48:15,024
How do you know
she has a previous conviction?

721
00:48:15,104 --> 00:48:17,246
-How would I know?
-Then how come you memorized it so well?

722
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:19,726
I graduated from the University
of Political Science and Law.

723
00:48:20,328 --> 00:48:22,581
I heard it from Lu Yue before.

724
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:24,183
But I didn't buy it.

725
00:48:24,263 --> 00:48:25,415
How good am I?

726
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,241
Our kid is young. What should we do?

727
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:30,857
All right, stop it.

728
00:48:30,937 --> 00:48:33,040
It's all your fault.
You spoil her so much.

729
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,467
Why are you yelling at me?
Hurry up and find a solution.

730
00:48:35,547 --> 00:48:36,477
It's all because you've spoiled her.

731
00:48:36,557 --> 00:48:38,100
Let's go. We're done with the show.

732
00:48:38,447 --> 00:48:40,241
-What should we do?
-I don't know.

733
00:48:40,321 --> 00:48:43,023
You troublesome kid.

734
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:47,054
ZGDX e-Sports Club solemnly declares...

735
00:48:47,134 --> 00:48:49,956
the user whose Weibo ID
is "Momo is a big devil",

736
00:48:50,036 --> 00:48:53,567
posted "How Tong Daji is made"
in the forum before...

737
00:48:53,647 --> 00:48:56,265
and sent
a malicious package to Ms. Tong Yao,

738
00:48:56,345 --> 00:48:58,648
causing Ms. Tong Yao to cut her finger.

739
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,668
ZGDX e-sport club
has been actively cooperating...

740
00:49:01,748 --> 00:49:03,734
with the police
to investigate and collect evidence.

741
00:49:03,814 --> 00:49:05,235
The police have now closed the case.

742
00:49:05,315 --> 00:49:07,998
Now the police investigation results
are announced as follows...

743
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:11,575
"Momo is a big devil" has become an adult
and doesn't suffer from depression.

744
00:49:11,655 --> 00:49:13,591
The suicide thing is not true.

745
00:49:13,671 --> 00:49:16,088
In order to protect
the legal rights of Ms. Tong Yao,

746
00:49:16,168 --> 00:49:18,199
the club solemnly declares the following.

747
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:20,114
One, we ask "Momo is a big devil"...

748
00:49:20,194 --> 00:49:22,639
to immediately delete
the above false information...

749
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:25,266
and publicly apologize to Ms. Tong Yao.

750
00:49:25,346 --> 00:49:28,275
Second, we ask the relevant
network users and platforms...

751
00:49:28,355 --> 00:49:29,464
to immediately stop reprinting...

752
00:49:29,544 --> 00:49:31,368
and commenting on the
corresponding inaccurate information.

753
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:33,060
Honey, what are you looking at?

754
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,497
-Look.
-We hereby remind...

755
00:49:34,577 --> 00:49:36,726
Lawyer's statement
all the Internet users, cyberspace…

756
00:49:36,806 --> 00:49:37,933
This is resolved?

757
00:49:38,013 --> 00:49:40,617
Don't be a rumor spreader.
Respect others.

758
00:49:40,697 --> 00:49:43,858
You know what?
That's called getting what she deserves.

759
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:46,421
No one can stay
at the altar of God forever...

760
00:49:46,501 --> 00:49:48,985
and no one will be in the swamp forever.

761
00:49:50,197 --> 00:49:52,077
Be bold and love what you love.

762
00:49:53,677 --> 00:49:55,091
What's wrong with that?

763
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:57,427
