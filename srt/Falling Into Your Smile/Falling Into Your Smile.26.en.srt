1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:01,897
-How Tong Daji is made?
-Well done.

2
00:00:01,977 --> 00:00:04,937
Now Lu Sicheng has begun to deceive
the girls who met them at that time...

3
00:00:05,017 --> 00:00:06,905
under the guise of staff.

4
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:08,109
This is Tong Daji.

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,552
On the first day
she came to the ZGDX base,

6
00:00:11,632 --> 00:00:15,259
she actually asked the captain to
drive an Aston Martin to the supermarket.

7
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:16,723
She really knows how to seduce men.

8
00:00:16,803 --> 00:00:17,970
Someone must have played the game for her.

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,503
What a bitch!

10
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:21,490
Back then, I thought
she had some ulterior motive...

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,361
for flattering Cheng in such a calm manner
in front of Yang.

12
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,476
Yeah! Yeah!

13
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:28,066
She's too disgusting,
as she's unfaithful to her ex-boyfriend.

14
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:30,620
She ran into Yang in a ranked match
just a few days after she joined the team.

15
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,780
The cat is obedient. So am I.

16
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,887
About how Tong Daji flattered Lu Sicheng.

17
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:36,020
She and the noble consorts of...

18
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,571
ancient China are on the same level
in winning men's favor.

19
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,106
Don't blame all the faults on women.

20
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:42,631
-Both she and he are to blame.
-Yeah.

21
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:43,917
One is flirtatious
and the other is shameless.

22
00:00:43,997 --> 00:00:45,679
So naturally they meet each other's needs.

23
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,877
-If Lu Sicheng was a gentleman...
-Yeah.

24
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:50,249
Tong Daji couldn't have pressed
his head to make him kiss her.

25
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:52,048
...and made him fall
in love with her gradually.

26
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:53,520
Tong Daji finally achieved her goal.

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,526
Since then, Lu Sicheng has cared about
nothing but her.

28
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:56,875
Double Carry players
are in a relationship.

29
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:58,768
The jungler is not getting along
with the topsolo.

30
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:02,560
Can ZGDX still go all out in
the national final this year?

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,831
ZGDX will be doomed.
This post can be used as evidence.

32
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,167
After Tong Daji joined the team, the
level of ZGDX has fallen significantly.

33
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:10,167
Sure enough,

34
00:01:10,247 --> 00:01:12,336
it was actually defeated by Alpha
for the first time.

35
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,575
At this rate,

36
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:16,094
ZGDX is unlikely to win
the championship this season.

37
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:18,466
Everyone,
you may as well support other teams.

38
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:19,946
There's no need to follow a team...

39
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:22,947
where the shooter and midsolo value
their relationship more than anything.

40
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:24,905
(Love between Team Leader and Tong Daji)

41
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,334
(ruins the good reputation
of ZGDX for years.)

42
00:01:26,414 --> 00:01:28,062
(I wish Tong Yao never joined ZGDX.)

43
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,140
=Falling into Your Smile=

44
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,820
=Episode 26=

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,100
(Lu Sicheng and Tong Yao
behave like a prima Donnas.)

46
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,155
I'm gonna try to persuade the company
to delete these negative posts.

47
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:42,375
And you'd better not
play with your phone these days.

48
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:45,863
Don't look at Weibo,
E-sports Industry Farm or forums.

49
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,889
It's for your own good.

50
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:50,427
Surf the Internet less
and concentrate on the competition.

51
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:52,029
Don't look at those imaginary things.

52
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:53,865
Otherwise, your state of mind
will be affected during the competition.

53
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:55,538
It doesn't matter
whether you look at your phones or not.

54
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:57,762
It's okay if you can win
the next competition.

55
00:02:57,842 --> 00:02:59,406
They will close their mouths then.

56
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:00,917
You win the e-sports competition
with your hands,

57
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:02,226
not your mouths.

58
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:03,417
Clear?

59
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,594
Kubinashi is not on the line.

60
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:19,702
Tong Yao, after you clear the line,
go to the top jungle opposite.

61
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,923
Roger.

62
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,867
Now the score is 1-0.

63
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:27,769
Can ZGDX that has won the first round
strike while the iron is hot...

64
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,362
and win the competition directly?

65
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,404
At the moment,

66
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:32,336
both sides are exhausting
each other's blood volume in their fight.

67
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,183
In this round, ZGDX plays more
steadily than the previous round.

68
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:37,489
-Yeah!
-I wonder how FNC will respond to it.

69
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:41,374
In the previous round,
Smiling really did a good job.

70
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,235
She defeated the opponents easily.

71
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:44,799
Before they have time to react,

72
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,859
the four of FNC has exhausted
most of their blood volume.

73
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:49,062
She's worthy of the nickname
"Queen of Mage".

74
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:51,051
She's likely to dominate the competition.

75
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,279
-Yeah.
-Gather together.

76
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:53,429
Lets' pick up a small team fight.

77
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:54,589
-I'm coming.
-OK. Roger.

78
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,710
Gather. Get started.
Chubby, put up with the damage.

79
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:00,994
(Shield Disappeared)

80
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:01,983
(Rampage)

81
00:04:02,313 --> 00:04:03,349
Good job!

82
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:05,004
Withdraw.

83
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:05,979
Chase.

84
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,266
-Chubby, follow me.
-I'm coming.

85
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:09,368
(Perfect Power)

86
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:10,399
(Killingspree)

87
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,326
(God's Envoy)

88
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,116
(Perfect Power)

89
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,383
I was right.

90
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:22,986
Sure enough, Smiling has dominated
the competition today.

91
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,906
In the last ace,
she not only protected Chessman,

92
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:27,346
but also got rewarded
by killing the hero of the opposition.

93
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,810
Well done. Let us congratulate ZGDX...

94
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,580
on winning the competition immediately
after their previous success.

95
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,026
Thanks to the Double Carry players
of ZGDX for their perfect cooperation.

96
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:45,856
Thanks to them for bringing us
such a wonderful competition.

97
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:47,816
Exactly. Besides,
the use of Triple Kill at the beginning,

98
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,261
definitely didn't let us down.

99
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:52,620
Congratulations to ZGDX again
on winning the competition.

100
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,810
Congratulations.

101
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:04,505
Let's go.

102
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,053
Let's go.

103
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:18,013
(ZGDX_Smiling MVP)

104
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:22,080
Congratulations to ZGDX
on winning the competition successfully.

105
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,276
Congratulations to Smiling on securing
the MVP award in two successive rounds.

106
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:26,201
Thanks.

107
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:29,509
So what's it like returning to the team
again and playing with your teammates?

108
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:31,486
Good.

109
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:33,893
There were many rumors about us.

110
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:36,642
So we were all a little depressed
and nervous.

111
00:05:36,722 --> 00:05:39,431
I believe we will be relieved
after this competition.

112
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:43,986
We have seen that ZGDX's tactics
were actually adjusted a little this week.

113
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:46,200
And it seemed Cheng was not the only one
to take command of the situation.

114
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,525
Were there some adjustments
in this aspect?

115
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:50,401
Yeah.

116
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,215
We are adapting to it now.

117
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:53,868
Everyone is very active.

118
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:56,904
Are you going to
get someone to replace Cheng to command?

119
00:05:57,335 --> 00:05:59,726
He's always been our best choice.

120
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:03,022
He won't be replaced,
unless over his dead body.

121
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:06,706
Recently,

122
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:09,583
as for the captain's response
to the fans online,

123
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,204
we know many people have doubted you.

124
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:15,456
Is there anything you want to say
to your teammates and fans?

125
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,140
I have secured the MVP award twice.

126
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,117
Is that what you have doubts about?

127
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:22,333
-Smiling, come on!
-Come on!

128
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:23,661
-We're always with you.
-You're the best.

129
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:25,770
Come on, Smiling.
You've got our strong support forever.

130
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,106
-Way to go! You're the best.
-We'll be by your side forever.

131
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,010
-Smiling, cheer up!
-You're the best.

132
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,804
I don't know
what identity I should use...

133
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:34,467
to answer this question.

134
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:37,936
I have played in competitions...

135
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:40,082
and have been Lu Sicheng's teammate
for half a season.

136
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:43,304
I suppose I know...

137
00:06:43,384 --> 00:06:46,200
what he and ZGDX actually want.

138
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:50,446
I believe all of you know too.

139
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:55,585
He hopes someday that he can drape the
Five-Starred Red Flag over his shoulders,

140
00:06:55,675 --> 00:07:00,118
stand at the top of the global arena
and raise the trophy we are dreaming of.

141
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:01,224
Before that,

142
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:03,463
it's ok even if he has thistles and thorns
draped around his shoulders...

143
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:05,148
or treads on the burning hot sand.

144
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:07,536
As the captain of ZGDX,

145
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,557
everyone expects too much from him.

146
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,222
He's willing to accept this fact.

147
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:14,395
He should,

148
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:16,773
and also must accept it.

149
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:19,323
So for some of his fans,

150
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:22,301
we can understand that
you want to protect him.

151
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:26,195
But performance
is actually what e-sports is all about.

152
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,176
Is the player you admire
someone who shines at the arena...

153
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:35,398
or someone who's just tall
and a little handsome?

154
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:37,170
You should get it straight.

155
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:42,027
I know
girls in the industry of e-sports...

156
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:43,878
have always been treated badly online.

157
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,391
So many of them
are trying to correct the situation.

158
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:48,335
But I want to ask you.

159
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:50,940
When we're trying hard
to practice in the ranked contests,

160
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,919
watching the competition
and analyzing the situation,

161
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,309
what are you doing?

162
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:59,475
That's all.

163
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:01,679
I'll get put down if I continue.

164
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:05,095
But for what I have just said,
I won't regret it...

165
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:08,055
if it offends you.

166
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:09,977
Thanks.

167
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:13,254
She really has the guts.

168
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,142
I think her words make sense.

169
00:08:24,456 --> 00:08:25,845
What are you doing here?

170
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,330
You scared me to death.

171
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,964
You tell me what I'm doing here.

172
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:33,739
It's so sweaty.

173
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:35,349
Don't say those words
if you're not brave enough.

174
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,070
Now you're afraid after you've said them.

175
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:38,749
I noticed that you almost
couldn't walk properly when you left.

176
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:40,101
Enough.

177
00:08:40,181 --> 00:08:41,522
Who did I do that for?

178
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:48,698
Actually after I finished
at the platform,

179
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,311
I was worried that you would scold me.

180
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:51,388
Why?

181
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:53,298
Since the model incident
at the exhibition,

182
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:54,885
I promised you I would be a good person.

183
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:56,170
But I'm not good now.

184
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,546
You have become mature.

185
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:00,226
-Yeah.
-This time...

186
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:02,939
I'll forgive you.

187
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,986
It's not easy for a girl...

188
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,091
to play professional competitions
in the industry of e-sports.

189
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:30,125
Smiling, way to go!

190
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:32,094
Everyone, you should be tolerant of her.

191
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:33,055
Guang.

192
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:35,715
Recently many people
have doubted Smiling online.

193
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:37,624
How do you feel about it?

194
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:39,731
Smiling is a very good person.

195
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:42,173
Those who criticized her probably
will never know her good qualities.

196
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:43,445
They don't want to know either.

197
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,711
Smiling is
a wonderful professional player.

198
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,119
Pay attention to my wording.
I said "professional player".

199
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:50,213
Who's bad-mouthing Smiling?

200
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:51,416
What should I say?

201
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:52,517
There's nothing I can say.

202
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:53,576
Everyone, I advise you...

203
00:09:53,656 --> 00:09:55,494
not to judge unfairly a noble person
with your own despicable minds.

204
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:57,168
Don't defame Smiling and mislead others.

205
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,403
Everything is not absolute.
in my live room,

206
00:09:58,483 --> 00:09:59,776
or any one's live room on my team.

207
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:00,800
For those
who can't understand the competition,

208
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,226
please don't talk nonsense
and disgrace yourselves.

209
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:04,466
Unpleasant things about Smiling
are forbidden in my room.

210
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:05,873
It's not interesting since
those unpleasant remarks will be blocked.

211
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:07,967
Smiling, you're shameless!
No! Forbid those remarks!

212
00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:10,216
My support for her
doesn't have anything to do with the past.

213
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:11,828
It has nothing to do with her gender.

214
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:14,329
Mind your own business
before worrying about others'.

215
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:17,095
If you treat her as your enemy,
then you don't need to follow me anymore.

216
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:18,759
Her achievement today...

217
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,409
results from her consistent hard work.

218
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:23,190
You could dislike her,
but most people in our team...

219
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,614
respect such a rival like her.

220
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:26,458
Even if you dislike her,
please respect her.

221
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:29,171
PRespect everything
she has done for her dream of e-sports.

222
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:30,535
It has nothing to do
with any other reasons.

223
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:33,703
He hopes someday
he can stand at the top of the arena...

224
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:36,189
and raise the trophy we are dreaming of.

225
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:37,861
Before that,

226
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,491
it's okay even if he has thistles
and thorns draped around his shoulders...

227
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:41,093
or treads on burning hot sand.

228
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:43,323
As the captain of ZGDX,

229
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:46,862
everyone expects too much from
and trusts him.

230
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:48,075
He's willing to accept the fact.

231
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:50,327
He should and must accept it.

232
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:54,678
What nice words!

233
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,141
So moving.

234
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:57,526
I'm deeply inspired by them.

235
00:10:58,089 --> 00:10:59,119
Don't worry.

236
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,240
Although it's a shame ZGDX
didn't win any prizes,

237
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,486
in the national final.

238
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:05,324
But keep in mind...

239
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:08,342
that I will raise the championship trophy
for Cheng.

240
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:10,010
Jealousy can't cause
one to make progress.

241
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,051
If you have time to have a chat,

242
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:13,207
you may instead spend some time
improving yourselves.

243
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:14,298
See?

244
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:17,102
My wife made unpleasant yet wise remarks.

245
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:19,860
Interview?

246
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:21,795
I've looked at it.

247
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:24,456
Smiling is a very attractive woman.

248
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:29,010
So luck...

249
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:31,226
How to say that phrase?

250
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:33,054
Luck was on Lu Sicheng's side.

251
00:11:33,134 --> 00:11:34,236
Right.

252
00:11:34,316 --> 00:11:35,474
That's exactly that phrase.

253
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:36,735
Luck...

254
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,245
Exactly.

255
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:43,233
Guys, we get along quite
well with one another.

256
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:45,096
So you don't need to worry about it.

257
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:47,612
What Tong Yao said
is just the official attitude.

258
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:49,208
She even used the same punctuation.

259
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:51,903
If you still think we don't get on well,
it doesn't matter...

260
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:53,964
and won't have any effect on us.

261
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:56,867
Whether you're our fans or haters
who know what they said is false,

262
00:11:56,947 --> 00:11:59,810
we are sure to give you a satisfying
answer at the national competition.

263
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,861
Yeah.

264
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,583
We've said what we should say.

265
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:05,332
The hardships we experienced will all
become the light for the road ahead of us.

266
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:07,101
ZGDX, come on!

267
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:08,441
Come on!

268
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:09,660
Let us drape thistles
and thorns around our shoulders...

269
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,849
and tread on burning hot sand.

270
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:12,609
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

271
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,076
How about taking a photo of all of us?

272
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:15,620
-Okay.
-Make space for me.

273
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,033
ZGDX, come on!

274
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:22,544
Cheers!

275
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:24,162
Cheers!

276
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:25,945
K.

277
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:28,456
How about having a chat with them?

278
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:29,936
Who is it?

279
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,554
-Don't care.
-I'm getting it.

280
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:36,643
Recently, many people have said
I don't get along well with K.

281
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:38,425
Come on. Cheers, bro.

282
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:39,577
Cheers.

283
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:42,598
Hello, you've got a package.

284
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,909
Could you please sign for it?

285
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,814
-I'm done.
-Thanks.

286
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:48,927
Thanks.

287
00:13:11,028 --> 00:13:11,972
You and I...

288
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:14,541
What's going on?

289
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:15,819
Let's go and check it out.

290
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:17,562
Wait a minute, guys.

291
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:31,363
Stand up.

292
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:45,324
It's so disgusting.

293
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:47,275
A roach was actually sent here!

294
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:48,516
That person must be abnormal.

295
00:13:49,343 --> 00:13:50,917
He actually used such a lowdown trick!

296
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:51,906
So catty.

297
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:57,993
Guys.

298
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,619
There is a letter here.

299
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,003
What is written on it?

300
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:05,940
What does it say?

301
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,632
This is just a little punishment.

302
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:09,807
You're so arrogant.

303
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:11,766
You'd better not take part in
any competitions later.

304
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:14,687
It's only a short distance from
the spectator seats to the player seats.

305
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,075
-Obviously, it's against Tong Yao.
-I'm gonna hurry and take it away.

306
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,465
-Wait a moment.
-So disgusting.

307
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:19,818
I'm gonna take some photos first.

308
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:21,218
-Yeah. It's evidence.
-Evidence.

309
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:26,572
And this one.

310
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:28,333
Take a photo of it too.

311
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:38,749
Hello, sir.

312
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:39,957
I want to report something.

313
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:43,250
This person must be insane.
What feud does he have with Tong Yao?

314
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,544
He has gone too far.

315
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:46,745
He couldn't have done such a thing
if he's not insane.

316
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,367
It's all right. Hold it in.

317
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:07,188
Okay.

318
00:15:20,906 --> 00:15:23,521
There's also a roach in that box.

319
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:26,977
Blades are a good match for the dead mice.

320
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:28,484
But they changed the mice to roaches.

321
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:31,545
I must have said I'm afraid of roaches
in the live room.

322
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:34,586
Why didn't I say
I had a phobia for diamonds and gold?

323
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:38,606
Don't talk so much,
your tears are coming out.

324
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,979
It's because of the pain.

325
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:43,348
You almost poured
a bottle of rubbing-alcohol on my hand.

326
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:44,863
Do you know how painful it is?

327
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:47,048
It's not as painful as my heart is.

328
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:19,695
Is she all right?

329
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:20,698
Leave them alone.

330
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:22,181
She should be all right.

331
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:23,916
Let's go.

332
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:25,188
Go.

333
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:26,588
Get some rest.

334
00:16:37,616 --> 00:16:39,204
-Cheng.
-What?

335
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:42,103
There was also a threatening letter
in that box.

336
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,799
It reads they will make trouble for us
in the competition the day after tomorrow.

337
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,199
I've called the police.

338
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:48,959
I've also contacted the organizers and
asked them to tell their security guards,

339
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,628
to intensify the inspection
of certain people.

340
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,255
But it may not work.

341
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:53,387
So?

342
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,684
We mean, since Tong Yao's hand is hurt,

343
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,109
for security reasons,

344
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:59,520
she'd better not play the competition
against Red Arrow the day after tomorrow.

345
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,308
Lu Yue can just take this opportunity
to practice playing the competition.

346
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,065
If he always plays training matches,

347
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:04,590
I'm afraid he won't be able
to keep up with us...

348
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,760
when he takes turns
to play the competition.

349
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,460
No. We have no reason
for not having her play the competition.

350
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,265
Safety first.

351
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:13,765
Although her hand wasn't hurt badly,
it's her hand after all.

352
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:44,929
(Shield Disappeared)

353
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,150
(God's Envoy)

354
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,117
The mages and supporters of
Red Arrow like to follow junglers.

355
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:51,620
Then when they reach the sixth level,
they will watch for shooter.

356
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,600
You and Cat's tactics
have almost been studied completely.

357
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,301
So next time use some new tactics.

358
00:17:57,088 --> 00:17:58,466
-Okay.
-Okay.

359
00:18:07,562 --> 00:18:08,727
I've got something to say.

360
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:12,042
Because of what happened just now,
the club has noticed that...

361
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:16,614
Tong Yao won't take part in...

362
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,277
the competition against Red Arrow tomorrow
for the time being for security reasons.

363
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:20,758
Lu Yue will be the starting player.

364
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,833
Tong Yao, you agreed?

365
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:28,183
I think it's okay.

366
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:30,448
Lu Yue can take this opportunity
to practice new shikigamis.

367
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:32,447
It may be useful in the competition later.

368
00:18:32,897 --> 00:18:34,805
Besides, the club made this decision
for safety concerns.

369
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:37,305
Since she's at the eye of the storm,
there's no need for her to save face...

370
00:18:37,385 --> 00:18:38,882
without regard to her own safety.

371
00:18:38,962 --> 00:18:40,975
Besides, I've discussed with Rui
about this matter.

372
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:45,295
We plan not to announce this
for fear that others will follow suit.

373
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,733
Then I'm not the only one
who has hard luck.

374
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:49,907
Moreover, I don't want my fans
to worry about me either.

375
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:52,228
Then there will be inevitably
many rumors about me again.

376
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:04,667
Why did Cheng leave?

377
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:06,410
What's going on?

378
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,890
He's angry.

379
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:13,653
Are you all right?

380
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:15,791
Although this decision upsets you
very much,

381
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:17,272
there's nothing else we can do now.

382
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:19,059
I also understand the management.

383
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:20,430
Don't blame them for it.

384
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,257
You're just a little girl.

385
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:24,079
If something really happens to you,

386
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,679
we will be too embarrassed
to explain the matter to your family.

387
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:27,963
Don't worry.

388
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,211
I'm all right.

389
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:43,955
Where are you?

390
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:45,230
Come back.

391
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:48,570
I'm all right.

392
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,505
I'm just taking a break
from the competition.

393
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:52,083
It's not a ban.

394
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,879
It's ok if I can't take part in it.

395
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,880
There's nothing for me
to have a grievance about.

396
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:01,104
Although I'm a professional player and
my only job is to play in the competition,

397
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:04,530
fans are inevitable accessories.

398
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:07,906
Sometimes you'll find them annoying.

399
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:09,792
Why don't they just disappear?

400
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:13,962
But sometimes, if we are at
the lowest point in our career,

401
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:16,775
our fans will happen to
support us from places...

402
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:19,351
where we don't necessarily see them.

403
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:23,417
There's no real all-or-nothing situation
in this world.

404
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:34,379
For example,
when I was given an interview that day,

405
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,230
it's just because my fans were with me
that I had the guts...

406
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,105
to say those things.

407
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:42,583
I don't regret it now either.

408
00:21:44,424 --> 00:21:45,434
Just forget it.

409
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,772
I don't know
what the hell I am talking about.

410
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:27,235
I want to ask you something.

411
00:22:27,315 --> 00:22:28,337
Say it.

412
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:30,905
Who on earth was Cheng angry with when
he slammed something down this afternoon?

413
00:22:30,985 --> 00:22:32,095
Figure it out yourself.

414
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:34,689
I'm asking the wrong person!

415
00:23:30,146 --> 00:23:31,323
Sorry,

416
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:34,503
the number you just dialed
is not available.

417
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:44,103
Why are you upset? (Sent to Lu Sicheng)

418
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,543
I don't want to see the headline
on the newspaper...

419
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:50,417
that some professional player
leap the sea level in a luxury car...

420
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:53,023
and sank it to the seabed in anger,
and in the end, he became fish's food.

421
00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:54,918
Can you come back or not?

422
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,766
(Jinyang)

423
00:25:41,155 --> 00:25:42,875
Tong Yao,
you haven't gone to sleep, have you?

424
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:43,984
How's your hand?

425
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,808
I've just come back from home
in the morning.

426
00:25:45,888 --> 00:25:47,870
I thought you were dead since you hadn't
taken my calls for such a long time.

427
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,348
I'm all right.

428
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:51,869
I just went to fetch my cat's nest.
So I didn't see your call.

429
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:53,539
Cat's nest?

430
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:54,670
What for?

431
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,806
To let them sleep with me.

432
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:58,269
The last time you slept with the cats
can date back to that evening...

433
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,001
when you and Jian Yang broke up.

434
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:03,115
No more pretending to be strong. You
think you are the heroine in a K-drama?

435
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,112
I'm really fine.

436
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:06,674
So don't worry about me.

437
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:09,170
Okay. I'll chat with you when I go back.

438
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,736
Stop!

439
00:26:17,816 --> 00:26:18,941
Don't fight.

440
00:26:35,914 --> 00:26:37,057
I'm sleepy.

441
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:38,766
But my hand hurts.

442
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,416
I want you to hug me while I'm sleeping.

443
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:36,919
What time is it?

444
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,230
3:00 AM.

445
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:40,934
Why are you back so late?

446
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:45,504
I was worried about you.

447
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,694
Just sleep.

448
00:28:13,265 --> 00:28:16,028
Everyone, we welcome you
to the second round of ZGDX vs. Red Arrow,

449
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:19,772
in the National League
of the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

450
00:28:19,852 --> 00:28:22,235
-Now the score is 1-0.
-Chase him! Chase him! Well done.

451
00:28:22,315 --> 00:28:24,600
-Today ZGDX has a new midsolo, Lu Yue.
-We still got the opportunity.

452
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,845
They also have a new commander K.
He's gonna lead the team.

453
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:29,174
Chessman, however, is playing so cruelly.

454
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:32,002
He's either striking someone suddenly,
or on the way to do that.

455
00:28:32,082 --> 00:28:33,466
Yeah! Ares, retreat!

456
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,759
But Chessman didn't give him the
opportunity and killed him right away.

457
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,037
Good job.

458
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:40,421
Lu Yue, never use the second skill
too often to clear the line.

459
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:42,317
You'll be defeated
when the jungler opposite attacks you.

460
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:44,286
What the hell! I got beaten up so badly.

461
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:46,144
I don't even have time to clear the line.

462
00:28:46,915 --> 00:28:48,509
The jungler opposite is gone.
Lu Yue, watch out!

463
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:50,592
I'm stressed out because of Shiro Douji.

464
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:52,130
After you pull down the enemies' defense
turrets, hurry to come to me.

465
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,404
Then the enemies will be scared.

466
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:54,556
The captain is pulling down
the enemies' defense turrets.

467
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:56,123
So we can't come to you.

468
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:58,327
K, call the jungler.
Cat, watch for someone on the middle lane.

469
00:28:58,407 --> 00:28:59,377
Watch for someone on the middle lane?

470
00:28:59,457 --> 00:29:01,701
-Lu Yue, you sell it. Not too deep.
-Okay.

471
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,760
Why is the jungler opposite ready to
attack us since we've changed the midsolo?

472
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,349
Cat, what do you mean?

473
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:11,601
(Invincible Warrior)

474
00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:13,789
Chessman directly killed
two people at the bottom lane.

475
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:15,501
He really did a good job today
in the bottom lane.

476
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:18,150
Lu Yue. Pay attention to your Teleport.
Try to deceive Shiro Douji.

477
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,830
-Okay.
-There's no need to rush.

478
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,108
Let's just wait for him
to come up a little.

479
00:29:21,188 --> 00:29:22,300
Come up a little.

480
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,849
He deliberately went forward
to be attacked by Shiro Douji.

481
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,315
Sure enough, after he took the bait...

482
00:29:25,395 --> 00:29:26,680
-I can't move.
-Steady yourself.

483
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,823
I can't move.

484
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:29,230
Shiro Douji still insists on killing Lv.

485
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,221
Come back. Retreat.

486
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,169
They deliberately tempted the
three people of Red Arrow to chase them.

487
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:34,255
-Attack.
-Sure enough, Red Arrow is deceived.

488
00:29:34,335 --> 00:29:35,538
The three of them are fought back
by the three people of ZGDX.

489
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:36,706
ZGDX's score has changed
to three points successfully.

490
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:37,983
-Yes.
-Yes.

491
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:39,705
Well done.

492
00:29:39,786 --> 00:29:42,213
You did a really good job.

493
00:29:45,397 --> 00:29:47,727
Now the competition
has been going on for 30 minutes.

494
00:29:47,807 --> 00:29:49,669
ZGDX has the upper hand.

495
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:50,945
It will all depend on the team fight.

496
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:52,541
The topsolo and shooter opposite
are going to support on the middle lane.

497
00:29:52,621 --> 00:29:53,930
You hide yourselves well.
I'm gonna come from the jungle.

498
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,244
Why must all of us
help Lu Yue with the team fight

499
00:29:55,324 --> 00:29:56,696
when he's guarding the middle lane?

500
00:29:56,776 --> 00:29:58,550
I'm the core. So you should protect me.

501
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,699
Chubby, you attack first.

502
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:00,923
Okay.

503
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:04,300
I've joined the team fight
and have attacked.

504
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:08,710
Captain, don't go forward.

505
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,506
Chessman's tactics are so wonderful.

506
00:30:11,586 --> 00:30:12,919
He killed one of his enemies instantly.

507
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,430
Double Kill.

508
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:17,682
Triple Kill.

509
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,743
Anything else?

510
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,860
-Quadra Kill.
-Ultra Kill. Can he get penta-kill?

511
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,873
He has good performance.

512
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:24,021
Can he get penta-kill?

513
00:30:26,646 --> 00:30:29,566
(Penta Kill)

514
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,385
Penta Kill.

515
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,913
Penta Kill Ace.

516
00:30:35,993 --> 00:30:37,442
Chessman did a very good job.

517
00:30:37,522 --> 00:30:39,626
Chessman is awesome!

518
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,385
Cheng is so amazing.

519
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,425
We finally are going to
pull down the base turret.

520
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,769
ZGDX is working together
to pull down the base turret.

521
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:47,591
Chessman stands a little forward.

522
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:50,206
(Defeat)

523
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,052
Congratulations to Chessman.

524
00:30:53,132 --> 00:30:55,581
Congratulations to ZGDX.

525
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,583
Onmyoji Arena Pro League
Cheng played too aggressively just now.

526
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:08,978
He played so irritably.

527
00:31:09,058 --> 00:31:12,735
It seemed that somehow it looked
like he was going to eat someone.

528
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:14,932
I think he played in a bad mood.

529
00:31:15,012 --> 00:31:17,301
He attacked many times
when he shouldn't do it.

530
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:18,387
He's too impulsive.

531
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:19,991
It seemed that he was angry with someone.

532
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:21,369
What happened?

533
00:31:21,785 --> 00:31:23,526
They changed
the midsolo starting player today.

534
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:25,343
Does it have anything to with that?

535
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:26,645
Maybe.

536
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:29,809
Will he spill the beans later?

537
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:31,398
-Won't he retort...
-Good.

538
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:33,489
when answering
the host's stupid questions?

539
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:34,857
He can't.

540
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,801
He's not coming.

541
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,520
Everyone,
I'm very sorry to inform you that...

542
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,254
today's MVP interview is canceled.

543
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:52,042
The captain of ZGDX Chessman
refused our invitation.

544
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:53,116
Thanks.

545
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,221
-Why?
-Why did he refuse?

546
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:56,221
Could you tell us the reason?

547
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:57,566
-What on earth happened?
-Could you give us an explanation?

548
00:31:57,646 --> 00:32:02,421
(Onmyoji Arena Pro League)

549
00:32:03,368 --> 00:32:04,479
Here comes the bus.

550
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:05,997
Hurry up.

551
00:32:06,077 --> 00:32:07,198
-Come on.
-We must get the news source.

552
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:08,206
Hurry up.

553
00:32:08,286 --> 00:32:09,874
Rui, may I interview you?

554
00:32:09,954 --> 00:32:11,963
Excuse me.

555
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:13,777
Could you please say something?

556
00:32:13,857 --> 00:32:15,430
Chessman,
could you please give an interview?

557
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,861
Could you please say something?

558
00:32:16,941 --> 00:32:19,776
Today, in the arena, you played
the contest in a very bad mood.

559
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,953
After the contest,
you also refused the MVP interview.

560
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:23,470
-Could you explain it in person?
-Cheng.

561
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,110
I heard that you secured the
MVP reward twice in today's contest.

562
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,582
But you refused the interview
after the contest.

563
00:32:26,662 --> 00:32:28,288
No one has ever done that
like this before in the Pro League.

564
00:32:28,368 --> 00:32:30,311
Someone said
you were very emotional in the contest.

565
00:32:30,391 --> 00:32:31,262
Is that true?

566
00:32:31,342 --> 00:32:32,663
What's the point of these questions?

567
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:35,184
We all know that Smiling didn't
take part in the contest today.

568
00:32:35,264 --> 00:32:37,789
For this matter, there has been
no official explanation until now.

569
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:39,198
Why?

570
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:40,787
Which team have you seen...

571
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:42,612
sent a post on Weibo when
they intended to change their members?

572
00:32:42,692 --> 00:32:45,896
Did the club suspend Tong Yao temporarily
because of her sass last week?

573
00:32:45,976 --> 00:32:48,020
-Is this her punishment?
-No.

574
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,631
That Lu Yue replaced her
in today's contest...

575
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:51,586
is just to prepare for
the World Championships.

576
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:56,407
And Tong Yao has done well in everything,
until now as a professional player,

577
00:32:56,487 --> 00:32:57,634
except the time
when she fought with others.

578
00:32:57,714 --> 00:33:00,168
Whether I or the club,
we all have no reason to punish her.

579
00:33:00,716 --> 00:33:01,843
Explain it.

580
00:33:01,923 --> 00:33:03,135
Could you please say something?

581
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,352
Have you asked enough?

582
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:06,917
No one asks these kinds of questions
at the doors of the clubs.

583
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:08,099
Will you step aside?

584
00:33:12,318 --> 00:33:13,315
Everyone.

585
00:33:13,395 --> 00:33:14,971
I don't have a problem
with you writing a report.

586
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:18,968
But you should be careful
with the title and the content.

587
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:20,894
Especially for some e-sports media.

588
00:33:20,974 --> 00:33:22,677
Like the bloody E-sports Industry Farm!

589
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:25,980
If I see you make up things,
even punctuation,

590
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,983
to catch people's attention,
we'll sue you...

591
00:33:29,063 --> 00:33:31,063
to the extent that
you will lose all of your money.

592
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:32,723
How could he say that?

593
00:33:33,494 --> 00:33:35,205
They were not like this before.

594
00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:36,262
What happened to them?

595
00:33:36,342 --> 00:33:37,423
What's going on?

596
00:33:37,858 --> 00:33:39,530
Cheng, you're back.

597
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,727
Cheng.

598
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,118
Cheng.

599
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:44,892
I watched the contest.

600
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:46,634
Why did you play so aggressively?

601
00:33:46,714 --> 00:33:48,175
Were you possessed by Hierophant?

602
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:49,634
What's wrong with you?

603
00:33:49,714 --> 00:33:52,330
A headache, stomachache, or a cold?

604
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,543
No.

605
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:57,122
Then why didn't you accept
the MVP interview?

606
00:33:57,202 --> 00:34:00,818
Or did you look at the comments online?

607
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:02,094
What comments?

608
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:06,827
Someone says that you're dissatisfied
with the punishment the club gave to me.

609
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:11,899
So you played the contest angrily and
refused the interview after the contest,

610
00:34:11,979 --> 00:34:13,027
in protest.

611
00:34:13,107 --> 00:34:15,408
Of course I know it's not like that.

612
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:17,023
-You couldn't have...
-I'm dissatisfied indeed.

613
00:34:17,103 --> 00:34:18,716
But not with the club.

614
00:34:25,506 --> 00:34:27,401
Don't wait me for dinner.

615
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:43,631
Sorry, I was stuck in traffic.

616
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,651
It's for you.

617
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,837
What's wrong?

618
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:55,032
You're unhappy?

619
00:34:57,588 --> 00:34:58,549
Say it.

620
00:35:00,024 --> 00:35:02,937
Cheng has been acting
very strange recently.

621
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:06,255
You really observe keenly
as his girlfriend!

622
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:09,461
Love, even the journalists outside
know this!

623
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:12,238
Since he slammed the door and went out,

624
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,337
he's been quiet and gloomy.

625
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:19,386
Whatever I say to him,
he looks like he's not interested in it.

626
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:22,665
He even rarely spoke to me.

627
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,839
He was absent-minded even when
he put his arm around my shoulder.

628
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:28,339
I asked him the reason.
But he didn't say anything.

629
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,325
He just started playing games madly.

630
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:31,363
These days,

631
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:34,883
I have said "I'm all right" so many times
that I almost broke my lips.

632
00:35:34,963 --> 00:35:37,727
But it didn't work on him at all.

633
00:35:38,066 --> 00:35:41,194
I even began to suspect that
he was dissatisfied with me.

634
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:44,746
He was just silent, irritable and refused
to cooperate with me.

635
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:47,889
-That's indeed his way of behaving.
-I really don't know what to do.

636
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:51,363
He said in the morning
he was dissatisfied.

637
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:53,319
But not with the club.

638
00:35:53,714 --> 00:35:55,611
Could it be with me?

639
00:35:56,218 --> 00:35:58,093
It's difficult for us to read his mind.

640
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,840
He's never been like this before.

641
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,173
He just focused on the contest before.

642
00:36:04,735 --> 00:36:06,443
Now that you mention it, it's true.

643
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:09,442
It seems that after you joined the team,
he has changed indeed.

644
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:10,953
You think it's because of me too?

645
00:36:11,443 --> 00:36:12,812
Don't make any wild guesses about it.

646
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:14,869
You're doing the same thing again.

647
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:17,840
When you saw Jian Yang have fun in the KTV
and ignored you,

648
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,762
you proposed breaking up with him
since you couldn't bear it.

649
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:21,122
You're behaving like that again!

650
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,586
I can't be bothered to criticize you.
What a funny thing!

651
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:26,226
Jian Yang really
did something unpleasant to you.

652
00:36:26,306 --> 00:36:28,396
But what about Cheng?
He didn't do anything that shows...

653
00:36:28,476 --> 00:36:29,780
it's you who makes him unhappy.
It's all your imagination.

654
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,710
I'm just saying.

655
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,778
Cheng always focused on the competition.

656
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:37,228
It seems that I forcibly
pull him from the altar...

657
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:39,474
and let him experience
the unpleasant things.

658
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:42,488
At least those fan girls
are right about this.

659
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:45,323
Unpleasant things!

660
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,472
I'm really envious of
these young lovers like you.

661
00:36:47,552 --> 00:36:49,330
I'm also envious of the mentality
of you two flattering each other...

662
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,894
and loving each other.

663
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:54,084
I think Cheng
is just dissatisfied with himself.

664
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:56,064
So he is upset and avoids you.

665
00:36:56,144 --> 00:36:59,226
Sometimes men
are much stronger than we can imagine.

666
00:36:59,306 --> 00:37:02,600
But their mysterious self-esteem
is much weaker.

667
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,147
Maybe
he's hiding somewhere you can't see,

668
00:37:05,227 --> 00:37:06,365
hitting his head against the wall.

669
00:37:06,445 --> 00:37:09,669
He may blame himself
just for your little wound.

670
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:11,455
Little wound?

671
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:13,019
It's obviously a big wound.

672
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:16,320
I even got an injection against tetanus
for it and had a nightmare all night.

673
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,781
Are you a caring person or not?

674
00:37:19,078 --> 00:37:21,221
It's impossible for me
to break up with him.

675
00:37:21,312 --> 00:37:22,522
Besides,
I am no match for him at fighting.

676
00:37:22,602 --> 00:37:24,593
So I can only imagine things.

677
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,246
I'm too helpless.

678
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:29,758
You're quite aware of that!

679
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:32,485
It's all because he ignored me.
My hand hurts.

680
00:37:32,565 --> 00:37:34,103
But he didn't care about it.

681
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:36,062
He didn't know that it's painful?

682
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:40,031
By the way. One more thing.

683
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:41,564
He was missing for a whole day.

684
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:43,478
He didn't reply
when I sent him messages on WeChat.

685
00:37:43,558 --> 00:37:46,684
It turned out the next morning
that he secretly got into my bed...

686
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,165
and hugged me when he was sleeping.

687
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:52,247
You just complained about him, why
are you suddenly showing off your love?

688
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:54,114
Nonsense.

689
00:37:54,194 --> 00:37:57,128
He disappeared and reappeared
whenever he liked.

690
