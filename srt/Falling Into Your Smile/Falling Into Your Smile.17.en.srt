1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,600
There's never been fake news
from the E-sports Industry Farm.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,750
I'm your only diva of true news.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,880
There's a lot of news
in the e-sports industry lately.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,560
There is finally a rumor out
that the idol of the industry, Chessman,

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,080
-that he has a girlfriend now.
-Thank you.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:14,920
Smiling!

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,950
FNC's jungler Kun unexpectedly appeared
in the audience.

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,920
I'm thinking of the last time
when he kept ganking Smiling,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,560
we have every reason to suspect...

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,040
that there are some hidden secrets
between them.

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,870
You're cute, Smiling.

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,520
Of course, the biggest blockbuster...

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,190
is Cheng's amazing hug
at the scene of the match...

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,670
as well as the solo game
of the two center players of ZGDX.

15
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,070
Come on, Shorty, let's solo.

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,220
Excuse me.

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,840
Who will be the ultimate girlfriend
revealed in public?

18
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,100
=Falling into Your Smile=

19
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,990
=Episode 17=

20
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,070
What?

21
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,680
I just took a nap by accident.

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,120
How did I miss such a big solo game?

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,760
Oh, my God, Jinyang, I'm going deaf.

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,040
What happened then?

25
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,560
Did you win the solo against Cheng?
And then what?

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,240
Don't tell me you will chicken out.

27
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,440
I knew Lu Sicheng probably likes you.

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,240
He must have lost to you on purpose.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,910
You think so too?

30
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,950
In the eyes of romance novels and fans,
that's true.

31
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,750
He seems to have lost to me on purpose.

32
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,280
But here's the thing.

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,830
When I was playing against him,

34
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,600
I could feel
he wasn't going easy on me at all.

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,750
He really wanted to beat me.

36
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,640
Maybe I did win
because I'm more familiar...

37
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:33,670
with the middle lane routes
and terrain than him.

38
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,830
You're pretending.
You go on pretending, I'm hanging up.

39
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,720
No, it's true.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,640
And...

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,000
Forget it.
I don't know what's going on either.

42
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,920
I told you
not to put up "flags" so nonchalantly.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,230
Like you won't fall in love
with a professional player.

44
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,320
You'll always bite your own tongue
after saying that kind of thing.

45
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,710
What about Cheng?

46
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
What did he say?

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
You guys didn't ask him a single question
after the solo?

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,470
What should I ask?

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,880
We're all teammates.

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,800
What if...

51
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,390
I made an inappropriate action
and got rejected?

52
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,950
How could we play again in the future?

53
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,870
How embarrassing.

54
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,040
You were really thinking too much.

55
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,510
I didn't even think that much
with Ai Jia at the time.

56
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,320
We are teammates.

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,550
Compared to things with uncertain results,

58
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,560
I'd prefer to play well in the tournament.

59
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,600
And I don't want someone else to say,

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,470
"You girls came to play professionally
just to be famous or to find a man."

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,320
Okay.

62
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,120
I'm starting to feel sorry for you.

63
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,840
I didn't expect that our silly girl
would actually grow up some day.

64
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,040
Or what?

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,910
But I have to advise you
as someone experienced.

66
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,480
In this kind of situation,
women should not act rashly.

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,520
Men won't be able to hold back
if they really do like you.

68
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,870
Really?

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,920
But if he really takes his time
in making a move,

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
then it probably really
is just your fantasy.

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,430
Okay. Bye-bye.

72
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,510
Cheng, you haven't left yet?

73
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,310
Didn't you say your blind date
asked you to meet her one last time?

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,110
It's already late.

75
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,430
Why haven't you gotten ready to go?

76
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,440
What's wrong?

77
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,600
Are you not going?

78
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,920
Didn't someone say
she didn't want me to go?

79
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,630
Who is she to meddle with it?

80
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,280
You... You heard all that?

81
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,200
I'm not deaf.

82
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,480
Then why did you pretend…?

83
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,480
I care about dignity.

84
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,720
I... I was just saying it off handedly.

85
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,400
I was afraid that you would be distracted.
Think about it.

86
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,360
Our teammates, they all hope
to win the championship trophy this year.

87
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,560
As well as the championship skin,

88
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,190
"Revenge of Hierophant," or something.

89
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,400
Biscuit.

90
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,670
There you are. Let's go.

91
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,800
Let's go eat some canned food.

92
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,400
What's up?

93
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,840
What are you two talking about?

94
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,080
What about Hierophant's Revenge?

95
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,510
No, nothing.

96
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,310
I'm going back inside.

97
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,670
You're not going out?

98
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
I'm not going out.

99
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,950
You stood her up again?

100
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,990
I said we'd make it
at the entrance of the base...

101
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,600
so that I don't have to drive out.

102
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,110
There is no dating in e-sports.

103
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,190
Our goal this year
is to win the national championship.

104
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,960
Good that you know. Let's go, Biscuit.

105
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's go eat canned food.

106
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,590
Cheng.

107
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,680
You lost the solo on purpose, didn't you?

108
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,600
Why would I lose it on purpose?

109
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,240
Yang told me.

110
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,870
Then why did you lose?

111
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,110
Do you want me to explain
the reason for my defeat to you?

112
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,000
Do you want me to write
an 800-word review for you?

113
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,000
The whole world can see
that you lost on purpose.

114
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,080
No. I miscalculated the distance
of the lines.

115
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,280
She caught the opportunity.

116
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,950
You wouldn't make that kind of mistake.

117
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,640
At least I haven't seen it before.

118
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,280
I'm not an immortal
who doesn't make mistakes.

119
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,280
Besides,
why would I lose to her on purpose?

120
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,630
I don't know about you.

121
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,360
Anyway, I did see the tenderness.

122
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,590
You're blind.

123
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,080
Our team's mid solo can't recognize
that kind of tricky set up.

124
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,920
Besides, now that she's beaten me,

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,240
she's thinking about how to take my place
and take over the team.

126
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,201
To be gentle with her...

127
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,600
-is to be cruel to me.
-What? What's he saying?

128
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,310
He's saying yes and meaning no.

129
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,670
I don't understand you men.

130
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,190
Why do you all like to play
this kind of double-faced trick?

131
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,480
What's the difference
between your behavior...

132
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,920
and the boy in kindergarten

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,080
who likes to pull the pigtail
of the little girl he has a crush on?

134
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,030
I'm going.

135
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,440
Let's go.

136
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,190
What?
Is someone coming to see you later, too?

137
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,040
No. I'm here to check the weather.

138
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,190
Aren't we going out
for a late night snack later?

139
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,310
No, we'll just have it brought in.

140
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,590
Miss Su.

141
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,720
I already told you last time.
We're not a match.

142
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,600
Lu Sicheng.

143
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,190
Are you not happy that I went
to see you at the site of the match?

144
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,910
Do you think that I'm too high-profile?

145
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,840
I really didn't mean it.

146
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,510
I answered what they asked me.

147
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,280
I didn't expect you to be so famous.

148
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,230
And I didn't expect...

149
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,680
they would analyze what I said so deeply.

150
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,080
Now those fans of yours
are already in an uproar.

151
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,320
I'm really sorry.

152
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,990
They even found my Weibo account.

153
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,160
Some people are really nasty,

154
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,080
saying things like I'm shameless,

155
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,630
that I pretend to be your girlfriend.

156
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,830
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,600
Why are you apologizing?

158
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,950
It's not your fault.

159
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,230
It's your fans.

160
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,800
Although I don't know much
about the e-sports industry,

161
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,280
if it means that we can be together,

162
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,320
I am willing to learn and understand it.

163
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,440
It has nothing to do with this.

164
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,390
I don't know if Lu Yue told you
something that made you misunderstand.

165
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,000
Some nonsense such
as the rules of this industry.

166
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,950
You can ignore it.

167
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,870
The truth is that if I want someone,
I will protect her.

168
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,990
So it has nothing to do with this.

169
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,080
Then are you afraid
that your fans will be upset?

170
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,910
I'm not an idol
in the entertainment industry.

171
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,200
I'm an e-sports player, not a monk.

172
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,150
Then what is it?

173
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,070
We're not a good match.

174
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,230
In what way?

175
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,230
Family background,

176
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,830
appearance, IQ or height?

177
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,240
Give me a hug.

178
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,230
Even they can be together.

179
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,990
Isn't it good?

180
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,320
-Bye-bye.
-That little girl...

181
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,400
is young enough to be his daughter.

182
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,440
What kind of person do you like?

183
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,040
Someone who can play games better than me.

184
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Isn't that all just gimmick?

185
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,080
No, it's not.

186
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,520
But is there really such a person?

187
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,960
I heard you're a good gamer.

188
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,560
No one is better than you.

189
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,270
It's not necessarily
in terms of the Onmyoji Arena.

190
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,240
If she can play Tetris better than me,
that will work.

191
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,870
It's just that if it is in Onmyoji Arena,
then I'll go straight to marrying her.

192
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,790
Bye.

193
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,360
Why is Cheng not back yet?

194
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,480
The shop is very popular.

195
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:12,080
The crayfish will be all gone
if we're late.

196
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,030
Yeah, what's going on?

197
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,870
It's been 20 minutes.

198
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,750
That's right, I'm starving to death.

199
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,440
Screw this, I'm going to go check it out.

200
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,480
For what?

201
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,440
Your performance this month is in danger.

202
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,720
Ranking, ranking, ranking.

203
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,950
What?

204
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,840
-I can't do it.
-Don't.

205
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,390
It's your fault
for telling me to go to the gym.

206
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,870
We'll play ranked while we wait.

207
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,440
Why don't I go check it out?

208
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,800
Okay, go.

209
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,950
What are you looking at? Get logged in.

210
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,200
You two get on with the ranking,
I'll watch.

211
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,350
-No way.
-I can't do it.

212
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,160
What? Are you scared of ghosts again?

213
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,270
Chubby said he's hungry.

214
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,400
He asked me to rush you to buy crayfish.

215
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,720
Well...

216
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,200
Where's your blind date?

217
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,550
Is she gone?

218
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,710
She's gone.

219
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,550
Let's go.
Let's drive to get some crayfish.

220
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,960
We have to drive there?

221
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,400
The shop is in the south of the city.

222
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,870
If you had told us earlier,
I wouldn't have run out.

223
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,160
I didn't ask you to chase me out.

224
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,070
You...

225
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,630
Sir, you want so many crayfish at once.

226
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,590
Are you entertaining friends at home
with your girlfriend?

227
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,710
She is not my girlfriend.
She's my teammate.

228
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,120
Teammate? I see the way she looks at you.

229
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,480
That's either the way a girl
would look at a boyfriend...

230
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,960
or the way she would look at a husband.

231
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,750
The girl likes you, am I right?

232
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,870
If you don't like her, just say so.

233
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,590
Don't break her heart.

234
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,470
Let's go.

235
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,030
What did you say to the waitress?

236
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,160
You were smiling so sweetly.

237
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,840
What's wrong with your eyes?

238
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,000
Did she give you a discount?

239
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,920
No, she didn't.

240
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,240
Then why were you smiling so happily?

241
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,160
She said you look at me as though
you were looking at your boyfriend.

242
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,600
No way.

243
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,440
How can a waitress be that bored?

244
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,440
Take a break.

245
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,030
What's wrong with you?

246
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,080
Does your hand hurt?

247
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,520
Is your hand injured?

248
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,960
I've been playing professionally
for a long time.

249
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,080
And I'm a shooter.

250
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,681
It's normal to have a little hand injury.
It's just a strain injury.

251
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:27,160
As long
as I don't lift heavy things regularly, I…

252
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,590
What are you doing?

253
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,080
Why did you not say earlier
that you have a hand injury?

254
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,670
Why is that such a big deal?

255
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,600
I have a strain injury, not a disability.

256
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,240
-Give it to me.
-No.

257
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,960
I once carried gas tanks
for my mother at home.

258
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm not that delicate.

259
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,950
You just wait for me here.

260
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,310
Hey.

261
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,920
Lu Sicheng, open the door.

262
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,710
What a novelty.

263
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,270
What?

264
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,120
It's the first time for me
to be taken care of by a little girl.

265
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
But I'm not a little girl.

266
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,430
In other words,

267
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,240
thank you.

268
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,040
Let's go.

269
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,920
Seat belt.

270
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,710
Cheng.

271
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,080
Did you lose that solo game on purpose?

272
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,230
What do you think?

273
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,110
I don't think so.

274
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,150
It's not like you're a little girl
who needs to be coaxed like that.

275
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,200
You make it seem
as if you know the trick well.

276
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,760
You wouldn't get it anyway.

277
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,960
I can see it.

278
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,240
I'm a girl.

279
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,160
You're not.

280
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,360
You are.

281
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,560
Cheng.

282
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,030
What is it?

283
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,190
I…

284
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,750
I…

285
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,280
You have to arrange
your training time wisely,

286
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
so as not to aggravate your hand injury.

287
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,910
We have a physiotherapist
coming to our base every month.

288
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,190
Cheng.

289
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,040
I think...

290
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,240
Do you want to listen to a song?

291
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,600
No rush.

See?

301
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,150
At least five kilos are mine alone.

302
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,630
And this row of RIO
is our mid solo's favorite.

303
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,270
She once said RIO Light
and shrimp go perfectly together.

304
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,190
That's right.

305
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,920
Turn the camera around a bit
so that I can look at others.

306
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,590
-I don't want to look at you, you fatty.
-Fatty? Speak nicely.

307
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,040
This is how you expect me
to turn the camera for you?

308
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,190
You are a fatty.

309
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,390
Let me show you.

310
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,520
This crayfish is at the price
of 156 yuan a pound.

311
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,310
Before it's cooked,
they even spit out colorful bubbles.

312
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,280
Food poisoning, right?
It looks like hormones.

313
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,680
You…

314
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,470
Okay, okay. I won't talk to you.

315
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,270
Live streaming slows down my vigor
of eating crayfish.

316
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,720
Don't forget to give me gifts.

317
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,720
Why don't you eat?

318
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,040
He thinks it's too much trouble
and leaves a taste on the fingers.

319
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,070
The smell won't dissipate
for two whole days.

320
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:27,990
It's too unpleasant.

321
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,070
Look at his psychological burden.

322
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,910
Unless you peel the crayfish
and put it in a bowl for him.

323
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,400
You thought
you were eating Boston lobster,

324
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,920
expecting someone else to serve you?

325
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Here.

326
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,960
You watched me peel it.

327
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,320
I didn't put rat poison in it.

328
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,830
Forget it if you don't want it.

329
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,160
Have another sip of RIO.

330
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,080
Hurry up.

331
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,230
Hurry up.

332
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,670
What do you think? I told you so.

333
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,900
Why is Cheng so obedient?

334
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,270
Want some more?

335
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,030
You like to peel crayfish for people?

336
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,030
I was about to say, "I'm not going
to serve you even if you want more."

337
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,920
You paid for it.

338
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,270
So at least I should let you taste it.

339
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,390
That's being polite.

340
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,640
Rude.

341
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,880
You two played solo during the day...

342
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,160
while feeding each other shrimp
and flirting at night.

343
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,480
You two have gone conjugal!

344
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,400
Chubby, I dare you
to turn the camera around!

345
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,200
Let us see what's happening over there.

346
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,620
Turn what?
No, I can't turn it with a handful of oil.

347
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,750
-Who's feeding the shrimp to whom?
-You can slap me.

348
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,070
Who's conjugal with whom?

349
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,720
You guys, just look at me.

350
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,680
Who wants to see you eating shrimp live?

351
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,220
-Who wants to see you, chubby?
-Go away.

352
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,960
-No way.
-Shut up.

353
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,550
I just got a call from the club.

354
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,030
They want us to participate in an event.

355
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,000
There's a competition this weekend.
What's the event?

356
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,440
Cheng,
you've repeatedly rejected Su Luo lately.

357
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,880
Mrs. Lu is so angry
that she's taking it out on the club.

358
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,000
I've put off all the other events I could.

359
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,790
But I've already signed the contract...

360
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,400
for this Saturday's out-of-town event
for the Next Gen Anime Expo. So…

361
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
We have a full schedule
of competitions afterwards.

362
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,270
How can we go out of town this Saturday?

363
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,920
Are we gonna go
and come back on the same day?

364
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,350
What the club means is we'll go directly
to the airport after the match,

365
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,400
and then we can fly back
after the event on Saturday.

366
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,320
Can we not go?

367
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,280
Then you'll have to find Mrs. Lu.

368
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,390
Tell the club that this is the last time.

369
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,140
(Onmyoji Arena)

370
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,140
(Luyun Mountain Stream)

371
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,700
(With a song of confession,
the clouds fade away)

372
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,660
(Ping'an)

373
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,480
We left two hours early.

374
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,430
I didn't even eat breakfast. I'm starving.

375
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm really sorry.

376
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,680
It was because I was afraid
of traffic jams.

377
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,720
So the trip was arranged in advance.

378
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,630
Breakfast benefits.

379
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,240
Rui, you've finally become humane.
You knew I haven't eaten breakfast.

380
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,880
-I'm so hungry, brother.
-What are you talking about?

381
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,080
I'm telling you a truth
that the early bird gets the worm...

382
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,510
through my actions.

383
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,640
If I have a good panini
like this every day,

384
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,760
I guarantee that I can quit staying
in bed.

385
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,440
If one breakfast
can keep you guys from staying in bed,

386
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,350
I would really will be willing
to be your breakfast housekeeper.

387
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,830
Come, come, look over here.

388
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,390
One, two, three.

389
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,360
What are you doing?

390
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,400
Taking a picture
to send to the official blogger...

391
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,830
so that she can hook up
the KFC's breakfast sponsorship.

392
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,080
Rui is the best at stingy skills.

393
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,590
-What are you talking about?
-Rui.

394
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,960
What exactly is the event today?

395
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,110
I don't know. The club arranged it.

396
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,720
-Cheng!
-Sorry, sorry.

397
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,750
-Cheng.
-We're putting on makeup, sorry.

398
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,880
-Cheng.
-Sign this for me.

399
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,160
-Sorry, you can't go in.
-Sign this for me.

400
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,960
Please sign these for us, Cheng.

401
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,390
No, they're having their makeup done.

402
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,070
-Cheng.
-Sign for us.

403
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,750
-One autograph, just one autograph.
-Keep your voices down.

404
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,790
Okay, okay, okay.

405
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,910
Hurry up, everyone!

406
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,840
Cheng!

407
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,430
-Cheng.
-Cheng.

408
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,320
Cheng got up so early today.
I didn't think he'd be so patient.

409
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,240
Cheng is a veteran.

410
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,360
Does he want to be trolled
by his ignorant fans...

411
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,800
saying that he's too indifferent?

412
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,640
-Cheng, mine too.
-Thank you.

413
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,400
-I want a signature too.
-Sign here.

414
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,160
And mine.

415
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,110
This is mine.

416
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,720
-Tong Yao, please help me sign one.
-Thank you.

417
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,760
Thank you.
(Lu Sicheng)

418
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,160
Thank you, Cheng.

419
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,280
-Thank you.
-Mine too.

420
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,750
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

421
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,840
Thank you!

422
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,720
Cheng, it's done.

423
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,350
There's not much time left,
so try to hurry up.

424
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,990
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

425
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,150
Please sign it.

426
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,640
-Cheng.
-Cheng, sign for me.

427
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,510
-Smiling, please help me sign it.
-Here.

428
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,550
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

429
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,790
Please sign it here.

430
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,710
Thank you.

431
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,880
And this one too.

432
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,200
So handsome!

433
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,550
You are even more handsome
in person than in photos.

434
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,280
Thank you.
(Lu Sicheng)

435
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,240
Sign this for me, Smiling.

436
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,470
-And this one.
-Thank you.

437
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,670
Thank you, Cheng.

438
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,960
-Thank you, Cheng.
-Thank you, Smiling.

439
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,390
-Give me an autograph too.
-I want one too.

440
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,670
Can you sign for me too?

441
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,190
Smiling, please give me an autograph.

442
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,430
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Smiling.

443
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,390
You've been here three times already.

444
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,590
That was for myself just now.

445
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,390
-This is for my friend.
-Thank you.

446
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,830
It won't take you long anyway.

447
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,110
Just sign it.

448
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,470
Cheng.

449
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,000
Sign for me, Cheng.

450
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,880
Rui.

451
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,080
What's wrong?

452
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,790
She's been here three times already.

453
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,040
Is she done?

454
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,910
Okay, I'll take care of it.

455
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,440
Sorry.

456
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,960
We don't have time for the makeup.
Why don't you stop signing for now?

457
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,400
It's just an autograph.

458
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,510
So what?

459
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,110
Why are you so pretentious?

460
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,350
Good job.

461
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,760
These people just want
to show off to their friends,

462
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:37,680
like, "I can go backstage to see someone.
Do you want his autograph?"

463
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,590
And then they run over
to ask for an autograph.

464
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,680
In fact, maybe they don't even know
what you do.

465
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,630
They just know you're celebrities
who play games.

466
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,910
Your hair is done. I'll leave now.

467
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,510
Do you want to eat?

468
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,110
I'm on a diet.

469
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,030
I'll eat then.

470
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,080
(The girl from the e-sports team
is pretty arrogant.)

471
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:05,900
(Acting like she is a big figure.)

472
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,800
This girl is a professional?
She must be a staff member, right?

473
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,400
I think I know who you are talking about.

474
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,400
Making a fuss.

475
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,030
To be honest,
I've always had an issue with her.

476
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,800
I've always had a bias towards her.

477
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,550
Everyone, take a look.

478
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,110
This is the flow of our event,

479
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,030
including some interactive parts
in need of your cooperation.

480
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,190
-Thank you.
-Please prepare for the game too.

481
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,400
Let the team members hug the show girls...
(Event execution flow chart)

482
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,070
and run from left stage to right stage.

483
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,720
The first show girl
to hit the gong with a hammer...

484
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,910
will be the winner.

485
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,550
I see it.

486
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,800
It's completely pointless,
making a spectacle of ourselves.

487
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,190
Rui.

488
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,550
Have you seen this flow sheet?

489
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,110
Why is there such a game?

490
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,870
Don't worry, let me see.

491
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,360
This…

492
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:50,710
Don't look at it.

493
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,960
We're dressed like this.

494
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,790
It's not suitable
for being picked up, right?

495
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,110
Yes, that's right.

496
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,440
This skirt is too short.

497
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,240
We all live by our hands.

498
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,870
And we all have hand injuries.

499
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,120
This is not good, right?

500
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,270
This game is not good for us.

501
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,240
It'll cause bad influence.
Why don't we change it?

502
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,750
We have all the game props ready,

503
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,150
and the timing is just right.

504
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,080
Now you suddenly say
you want to change it.

505
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,920
-That's not appropriate, don't you think?
-No, look...

506
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,310
It's barely any time at all.
Just put up with it.

507
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,830
We have a game tomorrow.

508
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,680
What if someone gets hurt?

509
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,480
Who's going to play for us? You?

510
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,880
Miss, you've been staring at me like that
since the beginning.

511
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,320
You've been looking for a fight,
haven't you?

512
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,160
Didn't I just tell you
that the props are ready,

513
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,110
the timing is set.

514
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,080
I can't change it.

515
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,440
No. Listen to me.

516
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,510
It is true that our members
have injuries on their hands.

517
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,400
-If…-
We are all paid to work.

518
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,960
Don't make it seem
like you are more noble than us.

519
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,080
If you are really so unwilling,
then don't come.

520
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,480
Don't take money from the organizer
and at the same time pick a fight here.

521
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,240
Are you game players
all so high maintenance?

522
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,310
My boyfriend is also an e-sports player.

523
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,960
I don't see him
being so fragile like you guys.

524
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,200
You're all men.

525
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,510
It's like you're dying
just by carrying a girl...

526
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,830
weighing several dozen pounds
and walking across a stage.

527
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,240
Do you want me
to post a microblog saying...

528
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,880
your team members are the most precious?

529
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,000
Hey, what are you doing?

530
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,680
What are you talking about?
Who are you threatening?

531
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,110
-Okay, okay, okay.
-Who threatened you?

532
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,200
-Don't get upset.
-We don't have to…

533
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,121
Don't touch me.

534
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:23,121
-Cat.
-Are you okay?

535
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,920
Why did you hit him?

536
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,840
Miss.

537
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,510
-How could you hit me?
-Are you going to blackmail me?

538
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,720
How could you hit me?

539
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,000
Lu Sicheng, let go!

540
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,350
-Calm down, Miss.
-Let go!

541
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,200
How can there be
a professional player like you?

542
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,750
-What are you doing?
-You want to hit a woman?

543
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,270
-Did I hit you?
-Like you're the only woman?

544
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,680
With which eye do you see that I'm a man?

545
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,110
-Who are you?
-Tong Yao!

546
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,280
This room is full of people.

547
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Let go of me.

548
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,760
Don't stop me.

549
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,320
Are you done?

550
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,830
It's okay. It's okay.

551
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,550
We'll head out first.
It's okay. It's okay.

552
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:58,550
-Don't be upset.
-It's not worth it to be upset with her.

553
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,470
Except for Tong Yao,

554
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,430
everyone else
should go to the event immediately.

555
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,160
Take it easy.

556
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,160
Now, your favorite ZGDX
is starting the competition.

557
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,960
Are you two ready?

558
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,880
Yes, we're ready.

559
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,320
-Okay.
-Ready?

560
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,030
Go!

561
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,350
Go, handsome!

562
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,280
Come on!

563
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,150
Go, go, go!

564
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,720
Good! Cat wins!

565
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,070
Let's have Chessman,
Cheng, and K on stage.

566
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:40,150
Cheng! Cheng! Cheng!

567
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,660
(E-sports Industry Farm:
E-sports player Smiling acted like a diva)

568
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,740
(Refused to cooperate
with the event and injured someone)

569
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,480
It's okay.
(Kitten ow)

570
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,630
My friends have come to pick me up.

571
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,040
There are many people at the scene.

572
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,430
My wounds have been taken care of.

573
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,430
Thank you all for your concern.

574
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,960
A normal girl
can't possibly play professionally.

575
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,200
Either she is a transgender person…

576
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,920
-Make it clear.
-Or she is a psychopath.

577
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,400
-Why did he hit you?
-What did you say?

578
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,350
I...

579
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:27,190
I just wanted to emphasize
that the organizers paid them to perform.

580
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,480
The ZGDX mid solo
picked a fight at the drop of a hat?

581
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,200
-Is she crazy?
-Outrageous.

582
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,720
Female fights are particularly exciting.

583
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,440
No matter what the reason is,
she always crosses the line.

584
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,480
-Thank God you're okay.
-Jiaqi is so gentle.

585
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,040
I could tell Tong Yao was of bad quality
just from her looks.

586
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,520
With your concern and support,

587
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,750
I'll be fine soon.

588
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,350
Thank you all.

589
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,310
My God.

590
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,400
This is currently
the most popular e-sports Mulan,

591
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,000
with a very bad temper.

592
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,670
She just hit someone at the drop of a hat.
(Ning Jiaqi was injured)

593
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,790
Hard to hear some bad comments about her.
(Spoiled by you brainless netizens)

594
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,480
You told me it was a brawl.

595
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,300
-Before you start slandering her…
-Hey, Mr. Zhang?

596
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,000
-Let me laugh for a while first.
-It's me again, me again.

597
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,310
Could you help me block the keywords?

598
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,280
Yes, yes, about the fight.

599
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,190
-I'm really sorry.
-No problem, no problem.

600
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,190
I'll issue an official letter for you.

601
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,000
Thank you, thank you.

602
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,670
Mr. Zhang,
it's not like what the Internet says.

603
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,480
-This is all our responsibility.
-I'm sorry.

604
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,030
I'm really sorry.

605
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,030
We will definitely solve the problem
as soon as possible.

606
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:25,950
Please don't worry.

607
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,030
Mr. Li.

608
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,030
You're both here?

609
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,230
We are waiting for you.

610
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,150
Director Wang will be here soon.

611
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,670
You can talk to her yourselves.

612
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,510
Lu?

613
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,590
Director Wang herself came?

614
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,110
I thought…

615
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,280
Thought what?

616
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,150
Thought this was not severe enough?

617
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,070
No, no.

618
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,110
Director Wang.

619
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,030
Director Wang.

620
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,110
You're Tong Yao, right?

621
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,360
This is our first encounter.
I'll introduce myself.

622
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,270
My name is Wang Lan.

623
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,480
I am the executive director
assigned to ZGDX by the Lu's Group.

624
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,920
I have another identity they all know.

625
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,230
I am also the mother
of Lu Sicheng and Lu Yue.

626
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,960
Mrs. Lu?

627
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,630
Director Wang,
you go ahead, I'll go out first.

628
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,150
Director Wang, allow me to explain.

629
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,960
Really, you can't blame Tong Yao for this.

630
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,670
That woman was obviously there
to pick a fight.

631
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,190
And our competitions
have been very intense lately.

632
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,590
Cheng's hand injury also recurred.

633
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
If his hand injury worsens
due to running around...

634
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,110
lifting those girls,

635
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,590
and thus affects his performance
in the game, it'll be bad.

636
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,150
Tong Yao was concerned about Cheng.

637
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,280
-So she's…
-Someone said…

638
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,670
ZGDX's mid solo acted like a diva.

639
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,510
No, that's not the case.

640
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:58,150
Some people also said
ZGDX's mid solo was very arrogant...

641
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,480
just like a shrew.

642
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,670
Director Wang,
I am also responsible for this.

643
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,840
-She and Tong Yao actually…
-Of course you are responsible.

644
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,720
Two months of your salary
and bonus will be deducted.

645
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,840
Don't bargain with me.

646
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,150
It's really terrible
to have such a mother.

647
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,080
As for Tong Yao...

648
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,280
-How about this?
-Why are you here?

649
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,510
Cheng, Director Wang is inside.

650
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,760
You can't go in right now.

651
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,710
Cheng.

652
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,710
-Cheng.
-You're finally here.

653
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,230
You're not at
the ribbon cutting ceremony with Dad?

654
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,230
What are you doing here?

655
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,840
Why are you so rude?

656
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,150
You can't even call me mom, can you?

657
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,360
It's such a big deal.

658
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,190
Of course, I had to come
and take care of it personally.

659
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,960
It's a simple matter.

660
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,760
I've already figured out how to handle it.

661
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,070
It's true that Tong Yao started it.

662
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,560
So no matter what,
the club has to take a stand first,

663
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,230
issue a statement of apology and bump it
to the top to show our sincerity.

664
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,960
But no one can be free to speculate
the truth of the matter.

665
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,280
So, Rui,
go find some platforms and media...

666
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,070
that are in good relationship with us
to clarify the situation.

667
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,070
Yes, yes, I think Cheng is right.

668
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,670
Besides the media,
I will find some other buddy teams,

669
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,630
such as CK and YQCB,

670
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,520
to help us clarify it
when they are livestreaming.

671
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,400
And then?

672
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,150
And then…

673
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,150
Then what else?

674
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,150
You can't just only apologize
in an apology statement, no?

675
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,480
The club must give an explanation
for beating people.

676
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,310
Otherwise, it will seem insincere.

677
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,150
Then, Director Wang,

678
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,790
how are you going to make the punishment?

679
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,310
Ban Tong Yao from the competition.

680
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
Ban me from the competition?

681
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,430
But...

682
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,270
You don't want to take this
to Tournament Control, do you?

683
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,550
-Ban her for one match.
-That's fine.

684
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,280
But...

685
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,230
Rui, take Tong Yao out first.

686
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,360
I have to talk to my mother
about something.

687
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,630
Okay. Director Wang, we will go out first.

688
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,550
Go.

689
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,760
