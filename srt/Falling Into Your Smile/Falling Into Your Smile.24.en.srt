1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,876
People are always used
to judging new things by experience.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,590
And at first
my parents didn't agree either.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,716
The same with my parents.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,080
My parents also didn't quite agree.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,190
It's normal.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,473
Among us,

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,960
except for K
who has never mentioned his parents,

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,280
the parents of the others
are all quite assertive that...

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,543
they are against it.

10
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:21,266
What's so interesting about that?

11
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,075
Your parents aren't supportive
of you playing e-sports?

12
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,760
My dad is all right.

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,480
My mom...

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,146
Subconsciously accuse it.

15
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,466
What e-sports?

16
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,760
It's just playing games.

17
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,670
You kids are not only addicted
to games and lag behind in your studies,

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
but also find high-sounding excuses.

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,903
Refuse it.

20
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,386
Get your ass over here.

21
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,303
Bastard.

22
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,880
Few people believe in their passion,

23
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,390
nor do they understand...

24
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,150
what this love means...

25
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,520
to them.

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,000
How dare you not answer my call?

27
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,503
Come back!

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,520
-No, no.
-You come back to me.

29
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,620
=Falling Into Your Smile=

30
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:04,414
=Episode 24=

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,200
Come on, Auntie, Uncle.
Please have some tea.

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,030
You're here for…?

33
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,840
That brat.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,910
Pig brain.

35
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,590
He ran away when he saw me.

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,560
You go get that brat over here.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,960
Don't be angry.

38
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,680
What exactly do you want from K?

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,596
-Boss.
-No, no, no.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,520
-We.
-Rui.

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,680
Just call me Rui.

42
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,463
Boss Rui.

43
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,743
It's like this.

44
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,800
Nowadays, the national policy
is better for us.

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,800
Our township
has given us an extra piece of land.

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,960
This boy's brother just got married.

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,630
We are considering building a new house
for his brother.

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,590
He can't live with us all the time.

49
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,703
Don't you think so?

50
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,673
Yes, yes.

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,520
Young people do need their own space.

52
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,840
A few years ago, his father
injured his right hand at work.

53
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,750
Now he can't do any heavy work.
Can't find a job either.

54
00:02:52,268 --> 00:02:56,120
All kinds of things in the family,
big or trivial, all require money.

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,633
Think about it.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,280
Where can we get the money?

57
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:01,436
Yes.

58
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,870
We also know it's not easy for him
to work far away from hometown.

59
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,470
What's not easy for him?

60
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,470
His brother lives in the countryside.
How can he compare with him?

61
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,840
Now, his brother is desperate for money.

62
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,470
He wants to build the house.

63
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,483
We just wanted to borrow
some money from him.

64
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,842
Why wouldn't he want to help him?

65
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,400
He didn't even answer our phone calls.
Now he's not happy about it.

66
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,190
We can't even see him, think about it.
Who does he think he is?

67
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,786
We are his parents.
How could he not answer the phone?

68
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,120
-As soon as he saw me, he ran away.
-It hurts us!

69
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,150
But then again,

70
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,240
if we had choice,

71
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,120
I wouldn't have come here to find him.

72
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,654
You are the leader of my child, right?

73
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:41,710
-Kind of.
-It's good that you were there just now.

74
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,960
I just want to ask you,

75
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,080
how much money can he earn
from the games he plays?

76
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,263
Well.

77
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,150
We have signed a contract
with the players.

78
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:56,024
The salary is confidential to the public.

79
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,316
In theory, it should be him
to tell you that.

80
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,345
I'm not supposed to say it.

81
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,840
What's confidential?

82
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,560
I am his father.

83
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,276
Everything he owns is given
by me and his mother.

84
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,106
-That's right.
-I just want to know,

85
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,190
how much money can he earn
from the games he plays?

86
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,750
Well.
I'm really not supposed to say it.

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,510
Stop it.

88
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,582
This is all the savings I've had
since I started playing professionally.

89
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,190
In addition to the money I give you
every month and my daily expenses,

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,120
the rest is all here.

91
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,560
You can take it all.

92
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,120
Do whatever you want to do.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,360
Build a house for him.

94
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,830
Pay a bride price.

95
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,343
Go gambling.

96
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,463
Waste it all.

97
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:43,618
There is no need to make up
so many reasons.

98
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,510
Now all this is yours.

99
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,753
Dad.

100
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,463
Mom.

101
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,630
I really thank you for raising me.

102
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,190
But I ask you not to come
to the base anymore.

103
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,390
Don't bother me
and my teammates here again.

104
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,903
You brat.

105
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
What are you doing?

106
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,393
K.

107
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,703
Rui.

108
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:13,756
Please book tickets for their return trip.

109
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,496
Deduct the money
from my next month's salary.

110
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,950
This brat is becoming
more and more disobedient.

111
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,480
How can he do this?

112
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,630
Once you throw it away,
you may never get it back.

113
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,916
There are things that
you don't want to get back.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,870
Ever since I was a kid,

115
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,560
everything I do has always been wrong,

116
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,830
while my brother has always been right.

117
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,750
When I wanted to study,
he told me I wasn't cut out for it.

118
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
I was told to learn a trade
and work with my father.

119
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,753
I didn't want to.

120
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,310
I wanted to go to school.

121
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,040
That's when I developed
my game-playing skills,

122
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,000
making money by playing for others.

123
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,263
Tong Yao.

124
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,993
You know what?

125
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,190
In fact, at that time,
I didn't like playing games at all.

126
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,270
I thought it was just a tool
to make money.

127
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,630
If I hadn't met Ming later,

128
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,070
I might never have known
what e-sports was.

129
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,160
Then I got into it.

130
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,040
I understood it.

131
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,920
But to my parents,

132
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,190
it was still just a tool to make money.

133
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,240
Actually, it's understandable, right?

134
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,920
We just need to communicate more
with the older generation.

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,160
My parents are the same.

136
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,950
Haven't you seen them?

137
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,103
Tong Yao.

138
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,390
We're not the same.

139
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,600
How?

140
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,390
Your parents are good.

141
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,190
They love you very much,

142
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,193
while my parents…

143
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,950
So now I really have nothing...

144
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,870
except for e-sports.

145
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,070
You still have us.

146
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,143
Tong Yao.

147
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,703
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,790
I was against you before.

149
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,270
And what I said...

150
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,600
when your parents came to the base.

151
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,390
It's been so long.

152
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,720
Why do you still remember?

153
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
I've long forgotten it.

154
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,200
Let's go, K.
Let's go back to the base.

155
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,790
Why did you call me here so early?

156
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,960
Yao, I'm impulsive.

157
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,193
What's wrong?

158
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,080
Come, I'll show you.

159
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:42,851
Look at this.

160
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:44,446
(YQCB e-Sports Club
Equity Transfer Agreement)

161
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,503
What's this?

162
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,480
The Equity Transfer Agreement of YQCB.

163
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:52,443
(Assignee: Chen Jinyang)

164
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,200
Transferee, Chen Jinyang?

165
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,826
You really bought YQCB?

166
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,200
Of course it's true.
Could I forge that?

167
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,193
Boss, I bought the RIO you wanted.
What flavor do you want?

168
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,508
Peach flavor.

169
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:11,390
She... She really bought your team?

170
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,756
Of course she did.

171
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,270
She's now the owner
and manager of our team.

172
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,383
This...

173
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,870
Does this make sense?

174
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,480
Yes, it does.
I've thought about it carefully.

175
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,306
Although
I have no talent for games.

176
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,826
And I don't know anything
about this industry.

177
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,390
But no one can deny that I'm smart.
Everything can be learned.

178
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,550
And I also think
the e-sports industry is promising.

179
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,200
My dad also thinks
it's a very promising investment.

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,120
My honey is smart.

181
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,503
Of course.

182
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,030
I'll go back and digest the news first.

183
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,616
Don't go. I still have something
to discuss with you.

184
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,840
What is it?

185
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,120
Didn't you tell me last time
K's parents came to the base?

186
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,946
I found out later
many parents are just like his parents.

187
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,790
They think e-sports is just playing games,

188
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,720
through which they can make
a lot of easy money.

189
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,270
Ai Jia thought the same way before.

190
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,840
Don't mention me.

191
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,720
Although I used to love to play games,

192
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,630
ever since I've started
playing professionally,

193
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
I find it's too hard.

194
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,840
It is.

195
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,480
There is no such thing as playing and
making easy money at the same time.

196
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,670
Many people can't see the pain and
pressure behind professional players.

197
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,356
That's why there are so many parents,

198
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,390
who don't understand
their children playing e-sports.

199
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Bestie, you've grown up.

200
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,440
Of course.

201
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,000
Do you think I'm just a boss who would
have a relationship with the players?

202
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,630
And ever since I bought the team,
I've always had an idea.

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,480
I must do something for the team.

204
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,630
So I now have a great idea.

205
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,033
You,

206
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,200
you don't want to buy ZGDX too, do you?
And then unify the gaming world?

207
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,510
I'm not as rich as Cheng.

208
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,480
I'm planning to
hold a carnival for you and Ai Jia.

209
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,870
A carnival?

210
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,503
Why are we going?

211
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,186
We're going to the event
held by the next-door team?

212
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,270
Because that's me and Ai Jia's alma mater.

213
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,030
So I have to go.

214
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,910
Well.
That's not appropriate, is it?

215
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,756
-We have such a tight schedule these days.
-Carnival.

216
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,636
I told Cheng about the last event
and he didn't even agree.

217
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,150
-I'm sure he…
-Okay.

218
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,870
-Okay.
-Carnival?

219
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,720
Tong Yao, is the cafeteria
of your alma mater good?

220
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,360
Foodie.

221
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,840
University carnival?

222
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,630
Is that a show?

223
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,480
Douchebag.

224
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,480
This is a stage to show the charm
and ecology of e-sports.

225
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,320
Look at all of you,

226
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,960
staying up late every night for training.

227
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,510
Either you have dark circles
under your eyes or dry and rough skin.

228
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,910
Where's the charm?

229
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,630
Tong Yao.

230
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,910
Your recent skin condition
is also not so good.

231
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,156
I've recently been using a hydrating mask.

232
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,910
It's excellent for moisturizing.
Why don't you try it too?

233
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,033
Come on.

234
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,440
Try it yourself tonight.

235
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,840
Okay, I'll try it after I go back.

236
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,550
I'm sure you'll be able to face
everyone in your best state.

237
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,580
(E-Sports Carnival)

238
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,586
(Shen Gang University)
Today, we are honored to invite

239
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,750
two current members of...

240
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,946
(E-sports Carnival)
famous gaming teams, ZGDX and YQCB

241
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,270
to our event today.

242
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,240
And now let's give a warm applause...

243
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,000
to YQCB's manager
Chen Jinyang.

244
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,440
Ai Jia.

245
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,150
Tong Yao.

246
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,087
All right, please take your seats.

247
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,030
Okay, now it's time
for audience interaction.

248
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,916
Are there any students who want to
ask questions to your senior schoolmates?

249
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,200
You can raise your hand.

250
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,270
Okay, this girl.

251
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,840
Hello, Tong Yao.

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,870
I'd like to ask you a question.

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,466
Did you go into playing games
because of the games themselves,

254
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,440
or because of your boyfriend at the time?

255
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,630
It was indeed him
who brought me into the gaming world.

256
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,000
But it was me who took up
e-sports as a profession and a dream.

257
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,320
So in a relationship,

258
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:53,030
if one person likes to play games
while the other hates it,

259
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,600
does that mean
they are destined not to be together?

260
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
I'll answer this question.

261
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,390
I believe that in this world there are no
two people who are exactly the same,

262
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,030
especially between lovers.

263
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,120
Just like me and Ai Jia.

264
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,960
One of us is a professional player
who is expected to reach the Finals,

265
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,546
while the other is just a girl
spending money on game skins

266
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,750
who doesn't even know
what equipment to buy in a game.

267
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,480
I really don't like to play games.

268
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,006
Like many girls,

269
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:48,586
I don't understand the fun of sitting
in front of the computer for hours,

270
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,080
just tapping a few keys back and forth.

271
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,383
Of course.

272
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,630
Ai Jia doesn't understand
what I do either.

273
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,550
He doesn't understand
why I only have two feet,

274
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,510
but have two hundred pairs of shoes.

275
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,080
I only have one mouth,
but have 500 lipsticks.

276
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,120
And they look all almost the same.

277
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,120
But he still praises.

278
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,150
Even if he's in front of the computer
for ten hours a day,

279
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,080
he can still tell
I've changed my hairstyle and colored it.

280
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,270
My clothes look better today
than they did yesterday.

281
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,670
His attention to me
never gets taken away by the game.

282
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,320
So do I.

283
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
I don't know the game.

284
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,910
But I know
e-sports is a kind of sportsmanship.

285
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,240
It's not just about hiding in
the game, flaunting one's ability.

286
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,840
He has just changed a way
to prove his strength to the world.

287
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,073
Just like now,

288
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,440
Ai Jia's taste has improved dramatically.

289
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,666
And I have also found the direction
of my future career.

290
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,670
Okay, any more questions
from the students?

291
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,273
This female student.

292
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,426
I'd like to ask you a question,
Miss Tong Yao.

293
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,746
How did you manage to
become the Lord of Kyoto in the game

294
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,316
and at the same time,
still be able to balance your studies

295
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,790
and be an outstanding graduate?

296
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,110
I think it's a matter
of scheduling your time wisely.

297
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,070
Choose your priorities in accordance
with your status.

298
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,680
If you're a student,

299
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,550
you have to finish all your classes
before planning your time wisely.

300
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,110
Nothing can be an excuse.

301
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,030
So when I was a student,

302
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,550
I studied twice as hard.

303
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,200
Because I didn't want those
who knew little about e-sports to say,

304
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,030
playing games was just sapping my spirit.

305
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,713
Of course.

306
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,156
Now we have more or less
improved our understanding,

307
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,590
and reduced our misunderstandings of it.

308
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,920
According to the data,
in the last year,

309
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,440
the World Championships
have reached tens of millions of views.

310
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,946
And this figure
is actually bigger than,

311
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,110
that of many traditional
athletic projects.

312
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,556
We also know that nowadays
more and more universities,

313
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,396
for example,
Communication University of China,

314
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,440
have now created a major in e-sports
to provide professional talents,

315
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,920
for the future e-sports industry.

316
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,313
Yes.

317
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,750
So I'm very grateful to my bestie Jinyang
for proposing to hold this carnival.

318
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,000
We hope that you can understand
more about what e-sports really is,

319
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,680
through getting in touch
with professional players.

320
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,480
We will also try to
change your views on players,

321
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,510
make Chinese e-sports proud,

322
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,590
and let the world see
the power of our Chinese players.

323
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,310
Okay, this male student.

324
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,480
Hello, Mr. Ai Jia.
I'm a fan of yours.

325
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,440
I heard a lot about you
when I was enrolled.

326
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:55,397
I want to know
how did you persevere until now,

327
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,355
when the people around you
didn't understand e-sports,

328
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,310
or even rejected it?

329
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,680
When you were alone against everyone,
did you ever think about giving up?

330
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,750
I…

331
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,270
never thought about giving up.

332
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,350
But I did once hurt...

333
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,000
my family...

334
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,597
because of my love for gaming.

335
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,920
My experience, I guess
is like that of a little bastard.

336
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,440
Disobedient,

337
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,720
wanton, reckless.

338
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,070
Gave up on school.

339
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,030
Ran away from home.

340
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,400
Aren't you going to leave?

341
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,473
Go.

342
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,753
You've grown up anyway.
You're independent now.

343
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,640
You won't listen to anything I say.

344
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,793
All you do is play games all the time.
Playing games.

345
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,550
How many times have I told you?
Have you ever listened?

346
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,400
Tell me, what future can you have
by playing games?

347
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,200
What can you contribute to society?

348
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,750
This is what I like to do.

349
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,880
I won't give it up.

350
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,313
Mom.

351
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,000
Can't you understand me?

352
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,310
I understand you?

353
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,790
What can I understand about you?

354
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,720
I'm a teacher.

355
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,440
I can teach so many children well.

356
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,110
Why can't I teach you well?

357
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,350
Let me ask you one last time.

358
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,480
Do you still play games?

359
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,793
Yes.

360
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,793
Okay.

361
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,880
Get out of here.

362
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,160
After you leave,
don't ever come back.

363
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,903
So,

364
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,200
from the day I made this my career,

365
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,790
I told myself...

366
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,960
I would never go home
without accomplishing something.

367
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,920
I want everyone to know not everything
that goes against the norm is wrong.

368
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,830
I can be responsible for my own choice.

369
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,033
I'm aware that...

370
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,790
many people in real life
don't understand our profession.

371
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,240
They think that the e-sports industry is
just a way to mess around and play games.

372
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,664
It's no different from
being in an internet café.

373
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,440
People may just see the rewards
given in live stream,

374
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,510
the craze of fans,

375
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,720
and those millions of annual bonuses.

376
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,440
But I want to ask you,

377
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,550
is this all true?

378
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,110
Like all sports,

379
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,240
e-sports...

380
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,110
is a competition
between all the top players.

381
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,506
And the training and pressure resistance
that these top players go through,

382
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,880
are definitely not any easier
than athletic sports,

383
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,030
no worse than any of them.

384
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,680
A senior player once said...

385
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,350
our world
is as cruel as the other sports,

386
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,720
because there are so many cases
of failure.

387
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,400
Those who have talent
are not necessarily able to play well,

388
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,240
those who play well can not
necessarily be remembered.

389
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,680
Those remembered by people
don't necessarily have good results.

390
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,350
So those professional players
who have achieved success,

391
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,750
have put in more effort than others.

392
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,680
Their efforts determine
the ceiling of their success.

393
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,793
Just like all of you,

394
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,680
doing exercises, memorizing words...

395
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,030
and preparing for IELTS.

396
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,350
If you fail, will you regret
playing games in the first place?

397
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,110
Although e-sports is a game,

398
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,880
the process to its success is not a game.

399
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,993
I tried my best.

400
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,590
Even if I failed, I wouldn't regret it.

401
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,720
Youth is not an excuse
to cover up mistakes.

402
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,720
But we do have youth only once.

403
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,240
Once you decide to do it,

404
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,920
you must have the courage
to never look back.

405
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,310
Okay, classmates.

406
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,310
This year's championship competition
has already started.

407
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,680
The Final will be held in Shanghai.

408
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,960
This is a great honor.

409
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,920
Please be sure to cheer
for your schoolmates,

410
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,310
and for Chinese e-sports.

411
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,880
Go! Go! Go!

412
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,833
Where's Jinyang?

413
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,550
She's still busy.

414
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,833
Then let's go first.

415
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,226
What's the hurry?

416
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,030
Auntie, you're too kind.

417
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,880
Hello, Ms. Lin.

418
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,400
When you graduated, you said you
didn't know what was right for you,

419
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,680
and now you've become so good
within less than a year.

420
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,571
You were even invited back
to give a speech.

421
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,920
No.
It's all because of Jinyang and Ai Jia.

422
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,513
Ai Jia.

423
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,273
Mom.

424
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,030
I didn't expect you to come.

425
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,680
I was asked to come by Jinyang.

426
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,640
She and I had a long talk,

427
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,583
about you,

428
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,110
about e-sports,

429
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,750
about this business of yours.

430
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,400
I didn't think I would come either.

431
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,480
It was Jinyang who convinced me.

432
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,070
In fact, even up until now,

433
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,640
I still don't understand e-sports,

434
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,110
or clubs you're talking about.

435
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,640
But there is one thing I do understand.

436
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,640
My son has grown up.

437
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,920
He can also make
the right choice for his own life.

438
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,160
I believe he's growing up.

439
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,350
He will succeed.

440
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
I have a class to teach. I'll leave now.

441
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,316
Auntie.

442
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,233
Mom.

443
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,021
I haven't been back to school
for a long time either.

444
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,680
Why don't I
walk around with you?

445
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,750
Sure, sure.

446
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,863
Come on.

447
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,156
Let's go.

448
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,310
You go ahead.

449
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,550
I'll wait for you here.

450
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,550
If you're free tomorrow,
can you come back to visit your father?

451
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,590
Bring Jinyang with you.

452
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,920
Let's have a family dinner together.

453
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,440
Let's talk about that later.

454
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,830
You're that busy?

455
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,400
I have to make money, right?

It'd be wonderful
if I have my picture up there too one day.

(Yuan Shiren Secretary
of the Chinese Medical Association)

462
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,030
Explosive news!

463
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,310
There's big news!

464
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,640
-What's wrong?
-Hurry up.

465
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,270
Have ZGDX's Double Carry players
started a relationship?

466
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,396
I felt something wrong before.

467
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,400
As a girl, I think eyes can't deceive.

468

This.

470

Mentioning Tong Yao the first time
in the MVP interview,

471
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,720
Lu Sicheng praised her
as a very capable player.

472
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:33,000
Eyes down with tender expression
and a faint smile on his lips.

473
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,880
The classic motion picture is from when
Tong Yao's shoe was stepped on by Chubby,

474
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,356
and she was then lifted up by Lu Sicheng.

It is essential.

Look at this and this.

477
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,623
Look at this.

478
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,706
They were caught by the fans when they
went to the movies for the first time.

479

Tong Yao tilted her head
and looked at Lu Sicheng.

they were in love.

00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,107
This… How come such
a good thing as the carnival,

488
00:29:13,191 --> 00:29:15,070
hasn't gotten on the trending topic,
and this has?

489
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,240
When did the Double Carry players
in our team get together?

490
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,480
As our team manager, I should say
no one informed me of that before.

491
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,920
Tong Yao, what's going on?

492
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,026
Why do the people of our team
get to know it later

493
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,070
than the netizens
in E-sports Industry Farm?

494
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,510
When did you guys start
sneaking around in love?

495
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Traces can be hidden.

496
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,640
But the way they look at
each other can't fool anyone.

497
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,160
Can't fool anyone.

498
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,960
What look?

499
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,240
The netizens are like Sherlock Holmes.

500
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:43,046
(Sent to Lu Sicheng)
Downstairs.

501
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,946
Either they're
definitely together,

502
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,070
or Cheng is unrequitedly in love
with Tong Yao.

503
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,160
Tong Yao. We dare not
ask Cheng. You tell us now.

504
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,680
There are already netizens betting on
getting upside down to eat shit.

505
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,623
-Look at this.
-What is this?

506
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,836
This eye was almost completely filled
with water.

507
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,510
Oh my God!

508
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,796
It's a PS photo, right?
I'm going to throw up.

509
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,539
I have to send it to my mom
for her to appreciate.

510
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,986
Summer is here.

511
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,466
It's that time of year again when your
oldest son has his annual crush on girls.

512
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,070
In past years he hid it well. This year
he probably didn't manage to hide it.

513
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,796
What's all the noise in the middle
of the night? You won't let me sleep.

514
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,440
Someone at the e-sports industry farm
says you had a crush on Tong Yao.

515
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,960
It's obvious
they say we're having an affair.

516
00:30:26,035 --> 00:30:26,876
No.

517
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,076
The post initiator says,

518
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,510
she can see from your eyes
that you had a crush on Tong Yao.

519
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,110
Tong Yao was watching the game
while you were watching her.

520
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,070
Yes, I have a crush on her.

521
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,033
Boring.

522
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,506
It was just a joke.

523
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,453
It's not like anyone's
really saying you're together.

524
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,440
My Cat is hopeless.

525
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:03,943
(Lu Sicheng)
Don't worry.

526
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,273
I'm here.

527
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,830
Go get your brain changed.

528
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,004
(Onmyoji Arena)

529
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,746
Okay. The audience on site
and off the screen, hello!

530
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:24,706
This is the scene of the National
League 2020 of the Onmyoji Arena.

531
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,706
I'm Dudou.

532
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,200
I'm today's commentator Qiu.

533
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,116
Today we have CK versus Red Arrow.

534
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,033
A strong match.

535
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,590
Another exciting game.

536
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,310
We can look forward to
the fancy moves of Yang again.

537
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,510
Look, it's Cheng and Tong Yao.

538
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,160
Is there a sequel
to the "E-sports White Snake"?

539
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,553
This... this...

540
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,596
♪I'm afraid of the sudden silence
in the air♪

541
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,750
I forgot what I was going to say
with you singing.

542
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,666
But these people
are really good at making trouble.

543
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,506
-It's embarrassing.
-What are you embarrassed about?

544
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,505
Didn't you say that you don't read posts
on the e-sports industry farm?

545
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,746
I... well...

546
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,750
Well...

547
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,986
I definitely don't read them
after the game commentary,

548
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,356
just like many players who will also
uninstall the App on their cell phone

549
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,273
after losing the game.

550
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,313
-They're afraid of being scolded.
-Yes.

551
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,156
But if there's some big news,
I will still pay attention to it.

552
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,706
After all, as a commentator, I should
catch up with the latest news, right?

553
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,310
I really underestimated you.

554
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,116
While following the event…

555
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,796
It's too embarrassing to sit here.

556
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,310
How can I play games in the future?

557
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:37,746
Bear with it for a little longer.
It's about to start.

558
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,089
No one will say anything after it starts.

559
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,796
It seems that you are experienced

560
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
in reading posts
on the e-sports industry farm in secret.

561
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,510
Isn't that Lu Sicheng?

562
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,400
ZGDX also came to observe the game today?

563
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,310
Yang, that scene during the Spring
Playoffs is still fresh in my mind.

564
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,833
Yang.

565
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,350
I have to remind you today.

566
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,400
You have to hold on today.

567
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,110
The director is messing around again.

568
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,556
Recently the relationship
between Smiling and Chessman

569
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,836
has really drawn a lot of attention.

570
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,753
That's right.

571
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,946
They look like a perfect match
in appearance.

572
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,863
Wait a minute.

573
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,666
As I predict,
something big is going to happen today.

574
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,070
Beware of being beaten by fans
after the game.

575
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,160
Photographer.
You have a bone to pick with me, do you?

576
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,510
It seems I should not have come today.

577
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,510
What? The photographer
must be messing around.

578
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,750
What's he up to?

579
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,916
But today is special.

580
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,310
It's two contestants.

581
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,026
I wonder what they will do.

582
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,640
What are you looking forward to?

583
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,713
Kissing?

584
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,480
Are you stupid?

585
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:58,426
So stupid.

586
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:05,510
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

587
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,030
What's going on here?

588
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,760
You didn't report it to the club either.

589
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,030
Mom, look!

590
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,320
This love means...

591
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,466
Am I being cheated on?

592
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,800
I don't care about anything.

593
00:35:46,898 --> 00:35:47,626
Yang.

594
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,745
-You don't have to, Yang.
-Jian Yang.

595
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,466
-All right.
-Don't be angry.

596
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,840
Don't be upset, don't be upset.

597
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,590
(Live Stream)
Before the start of today's game,

598
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,946
we found that the camera has caught
ZGDX team's ADC Lu Sicheng

599
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,146
and midsolo Tong Yong kissing
openly in front of everyone's eyes.

600
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,538
They are already in a public relationship.

601
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,776
(Yao, are you going to play e-sports)

602
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,030
(or act in an idol drama?)

603
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,546
And CK's jungler Jian Yang
sitting on the game stage

604
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,760
was so pissed off
that he dropped his mouse.

605
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,400
Good for you, my bestie.

606
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,710
If it were me today,

607
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,392
I'm sure I'd brag about it
to my grandchildren.

608
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:30,760
Back in the day,
your grandfather and I kissed...

609
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,320
in front of everyone's eyes.

610
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,233
Are you being bombarded?

611
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,030
I guess my parents
will be coming to the base soon.

612
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,320
What did they say?

613
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,760
What can they say?

614
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,400
My mom is baffled,

615
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,426
asking me if I'm here
to play professionally,

616
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,920
or to star in an idol drama.

617
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,760
And my roommate of four years in college,

618
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,440
said she wanted to end the friendship
with me.

619
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,916
You're the one
who fell in love with the gaming idol,

620
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,110
while playing professionally after all.

621
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,760
And you didn't inform anyone of it.

622
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,590
Of course, friendships will be at risk.

623
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,710
You're still laughing?

624
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,920
What should I do?

625
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,800
What should you do?

626
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,110
Wait to marry into the rich family,

627
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,626
or wait for Mrs. Lu to make
an offer of five million yuan,

628
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,880
to get you to leave her son.

629
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,960
I didn't want to announce it either.

630
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,800
I knew I would be judged so harshly.

631
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,030
What if something goes
wrong during the future games?

632
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,230
What if I get beaten up again?

633
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,946
What if Lu Sicheng's fans
jump off a building?

634
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,946
Mind your own business.

635
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,110
Why do you worry about others?

636
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:33,177
It would be fine
as long as Cheng loves you.

637
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,760
I love you too.

638
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,590
See, you've got so much love.

639
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,670
I feel like I've been possessed
by their words.

640
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,590
I'm starting to wonder

641
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,760
whether e-sports players in a relationship
is a bad influence.

642
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,360
You didn't just fall in love today.

643
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,287
When you first started to fall in love,
there was no bad influence.

644
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:54,332
It was fine, right?

645
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,593
What? Are you going to let go
such a good man?

646
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,113
Get out.

647
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,193
Hit it.

648
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,153
You shut up!

649
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,800
Concentrate!

650
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,960
You're making a lot of noise.

651
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,510
You've been unginged lately, haven't you?

652
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,383
Wake up!

653
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,063
(Mrs. Lu)
I'm so annoyed.

654
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,463
Hello?

655
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,673
I was just playing a game.
I didn't see it.

656
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,480
I said I didn't.

657
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,000
You're just guessing.
And you blame me for your incorrect guess?

658
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,280
The little girl?

659
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,153
That's right.

660
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,510
That girl is Tong Yao.

661
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,716
Yes, yes, yes.
She looks quite young.

662
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,760
But she is 18 years old and an adult.
It's not illegal.

663
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,760
What was that noise?

664
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,360
I kissed her.

665
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,153
What?

666
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:14,426
You want to come to Shenzhen?
What are you going to do in Shenzhen?

667
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,800
Don't scare her.

668
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,070
What does her family do?

669
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,710
Can you not act like a noisy relative?

670
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,392
If you keep being so unreasonable,
I will hang up the phone.

671
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,543
Cheng.

672
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,633
It's mom, right?

673
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,946
Dad saw it too.

674
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,960
He said he couldn't
get through to you on the phone.

675
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,983
Go away!

676
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,506
My brother has been on the phone
for so long.

677
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,840
He must be thirsty. So am I.

678
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,710
Hurry up and fill us both a glass
of honey water.

679
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
You wish.

680
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,320
I'm your future brother-in-law.

681
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,836
If you don't please me now,

682
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,070
it won't be easy for you
when you marry into our family.

683
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,740
(Real Estate)

684
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,313
Rui.

685
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,463
What are you doing?

686
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,593
Selecting houses for Tong Yao
so that she can move out quickly.

687
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,590
Then you probably won't see
my brother anymore.

688
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,110
Then I'll give her a new security door.

689
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,236
It's useless even to install
a hundred doors.

690
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
The little girl will open the door
for my brother.

691
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,673
Will she?

692
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,113
I see.

693
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:27,943
What's wrong?

694
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,030
My mother insisted on coming to Shenzhen.

695
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,070
Mrs. Lu?

696
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,016
(Check: five million yuan)

697
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,540
(Payee: Tong Yao Purpose: to leave my son)

698
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,063
Five million yuan.

699
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,400
Leave my son.

700
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,150
Five million yuan.

701
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,280
Leave my son.

702
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,626
That bitch.

703
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,506
Who's she alluding to?

704
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,276
Shame on you.

705
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,146
Are you playing professionally
or finding a boyfriend?

706
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,146
The former poster is so jealous.

707
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,396
If ZGDX doesn't win the championship,
wait to be judged as a sinner.

708
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,276
Is Tong Yao bad?
How would she become a sinner?

709
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,986
Don't you see who pulled Chessman down?

710
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,316
Some damn girls making up
the CP of Chessman and Hierophant.

711
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,196
Why don't you accuse them
of distracting Chessman?

712
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,590
The "rotten girls" are harmless.
Who have they provoked?

713
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,356
Such dirty words.

714
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,590
Who first called whom shameless?

715
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,396
I am a man.

716
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,946
I also think that Cheng
has disappointed us.

717
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,586
I expected him to win
the national championship trophy.

718
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,506
I don't know what he is doing.

719
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,916
It's killing me.

720
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,586
Is Smiling Su Daji?

721
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,676
Though she's in a relationship
with Lu Sicheng,

722
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,916
they've only played one half of the league

723
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,586
and didn't lose a single game.

724
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,601
Has it already been decided

725
00:42:10,685 --> 00:42:11,545
that they won't win
this year's championship?

726
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,916
She is like Su Daji,

727
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,670
a selfish bitch who thinks of
seducing someone regardless of the team.

728
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,880
Disgusting, I want to vomit.

729
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,396
And you still want to
play professionally like this?

730
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,466
Make a little girl
suffer internet violence.

731
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,506
Good for you, Tong Daji.

732
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,426
Apologize to her now.

733
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,360
It's funny.

734
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,836
The victim hasn't yet said anything.

735
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,276
You guys jumped out
and blamed the victim first.

736
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,230
Are you still humans?

737
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,066
Take it easy.

738
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,796
I will first take the initiative
and admit my mistake,

739
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,000
as the team manager later.

740
00:42:59,293 --> 00:43:00,505
Then we'll play well with each other.

741
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,423
We'll be fine.

742
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,503
They're coming.

743
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,463
Mr. Li.

744
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,423
Director Wang.

745
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,000
You guys continue the meeting.

746
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,084
It was me who took the initiative
to go after her.

747
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,030
I also asked to make it public.

748
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,880
I will bear all the consequences.

749
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,480
Well. I just finished a meeting
with the PR department.

750
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,110
We have an emergency PR plan
for this incident.

751
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,480
There's a game coming up.

752
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,710
We promise the personal issue
will in no way affect the game later.

753
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,839
Please don't worry, boss.

754
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,440
Director Wang, Mr. Li.

755
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,800
You guys should come out and explain it.

756
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:54,056
I have never seen such
an irresponsible club,

757
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:54,946
Netizens are scolding
me on the official blog.

758
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,676
Look!

759
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,630
There are all sorts of curses.

760
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,550
I really can't stand it anymore.

761
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,066
Then get cracking on
issuing an official announcement.

762
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,070
What are you waiting for?

763
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:06,673
Director Wang.

764
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,840
In your opinion,
is it okay to deal with it this way?

765
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,193
Okay.

766
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,320
Let's do it this way.

767
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,590
You guys go out for a while.

768
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,030
-Okay.
-Okay, okay.

769
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,320
Come on, Mr. Li.

770
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,360
