1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,389
YQCB's strategy is different now.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,056
They're making this a drawn-out game.

3
00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:06,493
So, in the team fight during the
later stage, we must be cautious.

4
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,066
We've fed them intentionally. Leave, guys.

5
00:00:08,146 --> 00:00:09,654
Let's leave. Tong Yao's losing blood fast.

6
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:10,733
I can fight.

7
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,645
Let's go, Cheng.
Not a good state for a fight.

8
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:29,042
This thing.

9
00:00:29,122 --> 00:00:31,952
Why didn't you give us a little heads up
or discuss it with us?

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,681
Is it that you don't want to say
or that you don't trust us,

11
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:36,496
your teammates at all?

12
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:38,343
If you don't need your teammates,

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,988
then I want to make it clear
that we don't need a leader like you.

14
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:44,949
Cat.

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,395
ZGDX...

16
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:03,843
is not a team of myself.

17
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:07,825
It's our team.

18
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:09,962
I admit...

19
00:01:11,682 --> 00:01:12,891
that I need you all.

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,528
That's right. We're a family, united.

21
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:21,515
No one can be left behind.

22
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,820

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,580

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,969
Here.

25
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,900
(Results of the blade event on Smiling)

26
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:44,744
That's strange.

27
00:02:44,824 --> 00:02:46,587
Why am I on the trending searches again?

28
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,993
Out of sight, out of mind.

29
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:51,737
Take a bite.

30
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,220
(Mother)

31
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:05,149
Hello, mom.

32
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:06,135
Yao.

33
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:07,871
You wouldn't tell us
what happened to you recently...

34
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:10,267
if we don't call you, right?

35
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:11,932
I'm fine.

36
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:13,076
He…

37
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:15,162
has worked it out.

38
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:17,561
Yao, you are so calm.

39
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:19,254
Calm?

40
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:20,683
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:22,748
-We have been training recently.
-Recall the trending search.

42
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,355
We're very busy preparing for the match.

43
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:25,822
Still pretending?

44
00:03:25,902 --> 00:03:28,927
You and your team leader,
what's the matter with you two?

45
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,573
That…

46
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:34,151
That's enough.

47
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:36,640
Come home if you have time these days.

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,287
Take Lu back with you.

49
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:41,478
Like I said, he's a good kid.
Handsome and well-educated.

50
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:44,486
-I liked that kid when we first met him.
-What are you talking about?

51
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:47,129
Yao, I'm telling you,
if you don't come home ASAP,

52
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:50,236
we'll gank you in your base.

53
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:51,426
No. No. No.

54
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:54,507
We are preparing for a match.

55
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:57,799
I'll go home on the weekend, okay?

56
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,920
Good. Remember to take Lu with you.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,607
We'll make you nice dishes.

58
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,547
He's quite busy.

59
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:05,031
It's done.

60
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,314
I…

61
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:17,952
My mom asked me to go home this weekend.

62
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:20,344
This weekend?

63
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:23,650
You haven't been home for a while.
I'll let Rui know.

64
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:26,538
She also asked me...

65
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,195
to take you home with me as well.

66
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:30,240
Okay.

67
00:04:30,718 --> 00:04:32,811
Come on, eat up the rest.

68
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,223
Any more?

69
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:57,016
How about canceling it this time?

70
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,835
I'm too nervous. I'm not ready yet.

71
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:00,570
Next time. You can come next time.

72
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,844
They…

73
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:04,206
Mom.

74
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:05,426
Yao.

75
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,312
-Lu.
-Hello, aunt.

76
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:09,866
Yao, why are you just standing there?
Come on in.

77
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:11,392
Tong, they're here.

78
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:12,797
Come on inside.

79
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:20,133
Don't just stand there.
Change your shoes now.

80
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:22,455
It's Lu's first time coming here.
Be hospitable to our guest.

81
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,491
Fruits and snacks are on the table.

82
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:25,707
Make him feel at home.

83
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:27,312
Dad, I'm home.

84
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:29,349
Hello, Uncle Tong.

85
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,019
Hello.

86
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,216
Let's go.

87
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,816
Dad.

88
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:44,135
Did you buy this?

89
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,270
We should have bought a new computer.

90
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,232
Wow, it's Razer's.

91
00:05:57,312 --> 00:05:59,135
Dad, you're a real connoisseur.

92
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:05,828
What are you looking at?
You're not even listening to me.

93
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:08,468
Hold on. Wait.

94
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:09,777
Dad.

95
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:11,626
Are you watching game live streaming?

96
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:15,247
Yeah. To catch up with your mom.

97
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:17,951
Your mom is excellent now.

98
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:20,585
She's almost half professional.

99
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,509
Dad.

100
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:25,868
Did you buy this new computer
because of me?

101
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:27,293
You're over-thinking.

102
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:31,127
There was an old-for-new sales campaign
on the Internet.

103
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:34,442
So, I gave them our old computer
and added some money...

104
00:06:34,522 --> 00:06:35,981
to get a new one.

105
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:37,229
How is it?

106
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:38,706
That was cool.

107
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:40,130
Can you teach me about it?

108
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,916
I want a 5G mobile phone.

109
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,131
Look. This 5G mobile phone
is different from the previous one, right?

110
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,199
Dad,

111
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,742
why don't you set up the computer
and give it a try?

112
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:57,728
I was out on the day of delivery.

113
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,098
But I made an appointment.

114
00:06:59,178 --> 00:07:00,392
They'll come another day.

115
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,625
No need for another day.

116
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:05,153
Cheng, come on.

117
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:06,910
It's your time to shine.

118
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,468
Yao, come and help me wash the vegetables.

119
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:10,760
Come on.

120
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,274
Uncle, let me help you with the computer.

121
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,777
Mom, what do you want me to do?

122
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:23,692
What can you do?

123
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:25,170
I can't do anything.

124
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:28,981
Let me ask you.

125
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,849
You and Lu.

126
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:33,321
Did you guys fall in love
right from the beginning?

127
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:36,242
When we visited your base,

128
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,177
we knew that the way he looked at you...

129
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:40,947
was different from the other boys.

130
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,658
In what way?

131
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:45,171
Something like,

132
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:48,165
"this thing is mine".

133
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,972
Understand?

134
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,215
Thing?

135
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,676
But you didn't have much contact
last time.

136
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:55,134
How do you know?

137
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,939
Of course I know.

138
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,550
Your mom is experienced.

139
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,161
You can't hide this kind of thing from me.

140
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,771
Okay, okay. Mom, enough.

141
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:04,693
Well. Well.

142
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:06,005
Enough kidding.

143
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,154
Come here.

144
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,474
I'm serious.

145
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,055
Young people like you,

146
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:16,567
no matter how open-minded you are,

147
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:19,506
girls still need to look after themselves.

148
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:21,512
Before any bad things happen,

149
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:23,311
I'll keep nagging you.

150
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:26,669
But if something really does happen,
do tell me.

151
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:28,142
I won't blame you.

152
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:29,598
I'll help you.

153
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:32,136
So, never mess around by yourself, okay?

154
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:33,306
Promise me.

155
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:36,595
Okay. I promise, mom.

156
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,120
Oh, you're shy.

157
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,464
Go peel the garlic.

158
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:53,001
Have some tea.

159
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:54,106
Thank you, Uncle.

160
00:08:54,186 --> 00:08:55,297
Uncle, have a seat.

161
00:08:55,377 --> 00:08:57,151
It's done. Take a look.

162
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:58,347
It's so quick.

163
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,360
Good.

164
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,713
Good, good.

165
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,299
Is Yao's hand better?

166
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:12,591
Her hand has healed.

167
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:13,949
Don't worry, Uncle.

168
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,648
Our Yao seems to be an inattentive girl.

169
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:24,085
In fact, she is quite sensitive.

170
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:26,979
She can never tolerate something wrong.

171
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:28,680
It's either black or white...

172
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,984
when it comes to feelings.

173
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:33,876
Uncle, I know it.

174
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,711
I'm not against
that you two are together.

175
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,114
But as her father,

176
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:46,590
I have to confirm with you face to face.

177
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,034
Are you serious?

178
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:52,662
Have you seriously thought
about your future?

179
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,831
Or is it just a whim?

180
00:09:55,714 --> 00:09:56,879
I know.

181
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,298
Professional players,
especially those like you,

182
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:04,199
have many female fans.

183
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,251
If you acquire
the kind of indifferent attitude,

184
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:12,750
I don't agree with you two being together.

185
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,491
Let's both...

186
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,398
be frank.

187
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:22,383
Do you really like my daughter?

188
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:25,474
I must ask for a definite answer.

189
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:28,928
Uncle, don't worry.

190
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:31,490
I will take her to the end.

191
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,748
After all,

192
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:36,111
I'll never get to meet
another girl as good as Tong Yao.

193
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:41,361
Great.

194
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:56,907
Cheng, what did you say to my dad?

195
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:58,333
What do you mean?

196
00:10:58,413 --> 00:10:59,842
I heard everything.

197
00:10:59,922 --> 00:11:01,189
What did you hear?

198
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:04,815
I heard you say that
it's hard to find a girl like me.

199
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:05,866
And…

200
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:07,531
And what else?

201
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:08,792
And…

202
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:11,544
You said you'll take care of me forever.

203
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:14,446
What?
Come closer. I can't hear you clearly.

204
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:16,934
You said you would…

205
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,229
I will take care of you forever.

206
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:35,109
Lu Sicheng.

207
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:38,318
Even if I could find someone
better than you,

208
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,647
I wouldn't go looking for.

209
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:41,603
You want to find a better one?

210
00:11:41,683 --> 00:11:43,484
If you dare do that,

211
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:46,238
I'll get rid of your means
of finding a better one.

212
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:48,341
You're acting like a boss.

213
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:50,199
Yeah. Only for you.

214
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:29,833
Honey,

215
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:33,122
why don't you go to bed?

216
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:34,230
Go away.

217
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,374
It's still early.

218
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,642
Go practice your shikigami.
I'm still studying.

219
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:42,458
By watching the video of
the neighboring shooter?

220
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:46,840
Stop it.

221
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:49,189
I want to ask you something serious.

222
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,240
Are you still capable at your age?

223
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,620
Of course.

224
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,526
Look at you.
What are you thinking about?

225
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:58,249
What I mean is,
being a professional player at your age,

226
00:12:58,373 --> 00:13:00,615
are your reaction speed
and control ability,

227
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:03,566
any different from
those when you were a teen?

228
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,207
So that's what you were asking.

229
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,840
Differences do exist.

230
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:11,526
That's why professional players
practice more and more as time progresses.

231
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:14,512
After all, I'm not a puppy.

232
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,254
Yes, so I'm planning
to train another group of puppies.

233
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,792
What do you mean?

234
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,446
What's wrong with you?
Were you up all night?

235
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:24,197
I was looking up something last night.

236
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,485
Just now, I was waiting for a friend
to get over the jet lag.

237
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,551
And then…

238
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:31,043
I was inspired by an investor
who just came back to China.

239
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:34,680
I'm planning to make an e-sports
development plan for the young people.

240
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,892
I'll show you when I'm done.

241
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,058
What?

242
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:47,594
I didn't expect that
you were actually serious about...

243
00:14:47,674 --> 00:14:49,018
making e-sports into your career.

244
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,271
Of course.

245
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:53,392
This is good.

246
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:56,854
I've found that we've both changed
a lot in the past six months.

247
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,947
Yes, indeed.

248
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:02,958
Just over six months, and you've
made the e-sports star your boyfriend.

249
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:06,328
Who said she'd never have a relationship
with an e-sports player?

250
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:07,865
What a flag!

251
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:09,692
And you have the right to say that to me?

252
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:12,477
Who said she'd never reconcile
with the e-sports industry?

253
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:14,380
Now you're slapping yourself in the face!

254
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,192
Okay.

255
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:18,272
Come here.

256
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:23,104
Jinyang.

257
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,186
The knock-out match is coming.

258
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,005
We're about to meet CK.

259
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:29,706
Are you nervous?

260
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:31,058
No.

261
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:34,511
I just feel that
the past six months are like a dream.

262
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,063
A year ago,

263
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,863
I was sitting in front of
the computer watching professional games,

264
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:41,478
and sending bullet comments
to make fun of them.

265
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:42,873
Shortly afterwards,

266
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:44,857
I became the one who was made fun of.

267
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:46,214
Don't worry.

268
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:48,742
If anybody would send bullet comments
to make fun of you,

269
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,009
that person must be me.

270
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:52,909
Tell me.

271
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:55,354
If six months ago, I had treated Rui,

272
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:57,944
who invited me to play professionally
as a fraud,

273
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,297
would I still have today's achievement?

274
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:02,144
Yes. But it would just be in other ways.

275
00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:04,980
You're bound to shine in this industry.

276
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,332
Really?

277
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:09,743
Just like I had fantasized
about countless possibilities.

278
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:12,703
But, in the end, I'm still with Ai Jia.

279
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:15,787
You're right.

280
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,892
Life,
sometimes has countless possibilities,

281
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:23,167
but limited assumptions.
You chose your own way.

282
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:26,357
No matter if it's gain over loss,
or happiness over torture,

283
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:27,789
it all has its meaning.

284
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,868
So, what we can do is
to just have no regrets.

285
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:32,697
Wow, philosophical!

286
00:16:32,777 --> 00:16:34,148
Yes.

287
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:35,713
So, do you regret?

288
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:36,779
No.

289
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,142
CK's victory marked the end finalist
competition of the national finals...

290
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:49,236
of the 2020 Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

291
00:16:49,316 --> 00:16:53,459
Now, each team is actively preparing
for the coming match.

292
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,300
Based on the scores
of the finalist competition,

293
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:01,168
ZGDX, CK, and YQCB
are advancing side by side.

294
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:04,510
The tactics and the starting players
of the three teams...

295
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,450
are mutually balanced.

296
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,359
According to our previous
analysis and predictions,

297
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,431
the first round
will be easy for the three teams.

298
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:14,730
ZGDX can beat LAN easily.

299
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,586
Although CK met FNC,
the recognized strong team,

300
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,748
in the first round,

301
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:23,157
I bet CK will win considering Yang's
performance in this finalist competition.

302
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:25,862
If CK can beat FNC,

303
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:31,330
then ZGDX will meet their old opponent
CK at an earlier time.

304
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:39,452
CK, our old opponent.

305
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:42,199
You know their characteristics.

306
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,252
They're just as good as us,
especially Yang.

307
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:48,155
Since the knock-out match,
his state has been surprisingly good.

308
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,381
So.

309
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:50,545
Do you have confidence?

310
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,025
Yes!

311
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,169
I'm not sure.

312
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:56,101
Calm down.

313
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,340

Hello everyone.

333
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,512
Welcome to the game site of the National
League of Onmyoji Arena Pro League,

334
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:42,794
CK versus ZGDX.

335
00:19:42,874 --> 00:19:44,692
I'm the commentator, Heng.

336
00:19:44,772 --> 00:19:47,807
Hello,
I'm the handsome commentator, Shuo.

337
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,489
Now we can see
that both teams are ready.

338
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:53,356
Here comes the BP part of this match.

339
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:57,901
Ban Lord Arakawa, Tamamo-no-mae
and Shuten Douji.

340
00:19:57,981 --> 00:20:02,941
CK bans Lord Arakawa,
Tamamo-no-mae and Shuten Douji.

341
00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:04,662
It seems that
they are afraid of the middle lane.

342
00:20:04,742 --> 00:20:06,629
Yes. It seems that
the middle lane is relatively strong.

343
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:09,029
Cat. Let's ban Aobouzu and Satori.

344
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,251
Okay.

345
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:12,816
So does Yamakaze.

346
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:18,560
ZGDX bans Aobouzu, Satori, and Yamakaze.

347
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:21,441
Get Ubume.

348
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,030
Take umbrella as sword. (Ubume)

349
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,825
CK got Ubume first.

350
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:26,927
Jian Yang took Ubume.

351
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:29,578
Good. It shows his fear of death.

352
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,555
Did you write this down
in your girly notebook?

353
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,294
Could you please forget that for now?

354
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:38,297
There are occasions for jealousy, okay?

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,166
Tong Yao, they unbanned Susabi.

356
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:42,462
Should we choose it or not?

357
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,279
Susabi against Kiyohime, are you sure?

358
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,562
It seems difficult.

359
00:20:46,642 --> 00:20:49,593
I'm sure about that,
as long as Susabi's ID is Smiling.

360
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,638
Cheng, that's so proud of yourself.

361
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,692
Tong Yao,
you're pushed to revolt by Cheng.

362
00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:57,730
A Song called "Tough Guys" for you.

363
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,096
Come on. MC Cat, drop the beat.

364
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,625
Big river flows east.

365
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:06,426
All the stars follow the Big Dipper.

366
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:08,675
Follow the Big Dipper.

367
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:10,991
Everybody, follow me.

368
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:13,389
Roar when we see injustice.

369
00:21:13,469 --> 00:21:15,369
Do it when it's time to do it.

370
00:21:15,449 --> 00:21:16,290
With no fear…

371
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,211
Want to be in the game quotes again?

372
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,110
What a boring man!

373
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:25,602
Cheng and Chubby, choose
Hannya and Yasha for Cat and K.

374
00:21:25,682 --> 00:21:27,689
Hannya is the topsolo
and Yasha is the jungler.

375
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:28,989
Susabi is the midsolo.

376
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,592
The ADCs are Youko and Ichimoku Ren.

377
00:21:31,672 --> 00:21:34,198
As for CK, Ibaraki Douji is the topsolo,

378
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:36,925
Ubume is the jungler, Kiyohime
is the midsolo. Chin is the shooter.

379
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,859
-Kuro Douji is the support.
-Come on. Come on. Come on.

380
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:41,014
Come on, everybody.

381
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:42,210
Come on.

382
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,485
Ming, slow down
or you might fall down later.

383
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:55,649
Yang is at the top lane.

384
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:57,600
Top laner, be careful.
The jungler is coming.

385
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,129
Then why don't you come protect me?

386
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:00,988
What about roaring when we see injustice?

387
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:02,357
But there's no injustice.

388
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:04,965
Okay, I'm here, too.
Do it when it's time to do it.

389
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:06,989
Let's make a co-movement
among the top, mid, and the jungler.

390
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:08,654
K is the one who cares the most about Cat.

391
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:10,314
You can't escape, friends.

392
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,168
ZGDX's three-lane co-movement…

393
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,583
-Let's retreat now.
-Starts to attack Yang and Good Luck.

394
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:14,701
-I'll go.
-Get back.

395
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:15,895
I'll go.

396
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:17,525
Yang and Good Luck are dying…

397
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:19,008
-Escaped in Flash.
-The top jungler used Flash.

398
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,840
-You can go.
-Well done. That was fast.

399
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,320
It's a universal rule that
we don't kill those who used Flash.

400
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,785
Okay. He missed the minions.
That's a huge loss.

401
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:26,918
No Flash.

402
00:22:26,998 --> 00:22:28,781
No worries about Yang's gank for now.

403
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:30,688
Cheng can slay the Butterfly
as he pleases.

404
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:31,795
Good.

405
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,500
This makes me feel comfortable.

406
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:37,193
Focus on the game. Stop your dirty words.

407
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,340
I was talking as usual.

408
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,425
You should blame your hooligan face.

409
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:43,456
When talking, you look like a hooligan.

410
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:46,543
When not talking,
you are premeditating it.

411
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,635
-I'm at level six. I'm at level six now.
-Okay, I'll teleport to the bottom lane.

412
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:51,518
Kiyohime is at level six. Be careful.
Hua is at level six.

413
00:22:51,598 --> 00:22:53,399
Teleported to the bottom lane
to support them.

414
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:55,302
Go. Go. Go. Chubby, follow me.

415
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:56,390
Go. Go. Go.

416
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,548
Help me defend just a little.

417
00:22:57,628 --> 00:23:00,118
Yang is also here. Four versus two.
Chessman and Chubby are in danger.

418
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:01,820
Chubby helped Chessman block the damage.

419
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,261
He died immediately.
But at least they saved Chessman.

420
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,106
-Good job.
-That was close.

421
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:10,358
Hua's teleport was decisive.

422
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:11,479
Not a big deal.

423
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,716
Our midsolo is still alive
at the top lane.

424
00:23:13,796 --> 00:23:15,851
Chubby, nice consciousness.

425
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:17,395
It's okay, Chubby. We still love you.

426
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:18,803
Now, let's see the top lane.

427
00:23:18,883 --> 00:23:20,299
Smiling came.

428
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,065
She moved past he tower to kill.

429
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:25,371
-I'm dead.
-This revenge is worthy.

430
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:28,066
Great. We're even.

431
00:23:28,146 --> 00:23:29,632
Support for topsolo.

432
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:30,903
You didn't lose anything.

433
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:32,745
But my poor mid minions are gone.

434
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:34,293
It's so miserable for me.

435
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,220
Their midsolo is missing from the map.

436
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,566
Be careful about the bushes.

437
00:23:39,988 --> 00:23:42,174
-So is their ADC.
-I'll push forward with the mid minions.

438
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,424
Cat. Go.

439
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:44,430
Look what I found?

440
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,574
The remaining four members of CK
are at the top lane.

441
00:23:46,654 --> 00:23:49,461
Cat didn't notice at all
and got killed at once.

442
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,547
Nice!

443
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:51,832
Nice! Nice!

444
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:55,673
I'm handsome so they singled me out.

445
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,913
I'm afraid you have
some misunderstandings about yourself.

446
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:01,467
It was obvious, but he still got caught.

447
00:24:01,547 --> 00:24:04,790
As expected, Cat's reactions
slow down as his age grows.

448
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:06,852
I was not talking about you.

449
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:08,432
Let me have a look.

450
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:11,140
The score is 4-2 now.

451
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:14,668
We are two points ahead,
but our gold is less than that of CK.

452
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:16,059
What a big loss!

453
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:18,422
It would be great
if we can slay the Orochi now.

454
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:20,950
Come here. Let's ambush by the Orochi.

455
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,977
-I'm coming, Cheng.
-Cat.

456
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:24,039
Just use your ultimate skill.

457
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,582
-Okay.
-CK is losing the Orochi.

458
00:24:25,662 --> 00:24:26,822
Watch out! Watch out!

459
00:24:26,902 --> 00:24:28,380
Yang can't use any skills.

460
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,804
Yang. Yang. (Rampage)

461
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:31,347
Yang was slayed.

462
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:32,891
Now, it all depends on Wang.

463
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,248
Wang was slayed.

464
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:36,247
So was Hua.

465
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:37,563
What an excellent game!

466
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,835
Yes. That was amazing.

467
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:39,988
The Orochi. The Orochi.

468
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:41,979
(Double kill)

469
00:24:43,353 --> 00:24:44,878
ZGDX took the Orochi!
(Successfully sealed)

470
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,135
Good job.

471
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:50,429
That was the so called
teamwork of a first-class team.

472
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:54,270
Both CK's middle lane's tactic
and ZGDX's ambush...

473
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,400
were amazing. It's really amazing.

474
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,377
We can pick up a team fight.
Team fight! Team fight!

475
00:24:58,457 --> 00:24:59,953
Go! Go! Go!

476
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:01,877
ZGDX is pushing ahead at the middle lane.

477
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:03,958
CK seems to have no chance at winning.

478
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:06,308
It seems they are going to end the game.

479
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,047
Victory!

480
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:15,605
Congratulations to ZGDX
for winning this match.

481
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:18,069
Yes. Yes. Yes.

482
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,030
Okay, I got it.

483
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,965
I'm playing the game.

484
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,880
Okay, call you later.

485
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:54,215
Cheng, what a coincidence!

486
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:55,894
Last time,
you were also having a lollipop here.

487
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:56,860
Yes.

488
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,294
Last time, you were fighting
with my girlfriend.

489
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:01,643
If so, when we meet in game,

490
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:03,271
I will not show any mercy to you.

491
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,058
Okay. See you in game.

492
00:26:06,138 --> 00:26:08,627
I was thinking
where did this cool girl come from?

493
00:26:08,707 --> 00:26:10,544
Unexpectedly, she became my teammate.

494
00:26:10,624 --> 00:26:12,184
Moreover, she became my…

495
00:26:12,264 --> 00:26:14,136
I just knew that
she was going to be a professional player.

496
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:15,187
I was too shocked.

497
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:17,512
We haven't contacted each other
for a while since we broke up.

498
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:19,453
I never expected that
she would be a professional player.

499
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:21,721
I never really thought about
breaking up with her then.

500
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,844
So, thanks for fighting with her,
or else I wouldn't have had a chance.

501
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,386
Good luck in the next match.

502
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,174
I lost once in the Spring Playoffs,

503
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:36,134
but I don't plan to lose to you
the second time.

504
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:39,174
By the way,

505
00:26:39,254 --> 00:26:40,842
don't tell her I eat candies,

506
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:42,642
since this does not match
with my character.

507
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:46,685
I knew you still keep her
as a WeChat friend.

508
00:27:03,032 --> 00:27:04,302
Lu Sicheng, did you eat candy secretly?

509
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:05,447
No. Don't wrong me.

510
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:06,633
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.

511
00:27:06,713 --> 00:27:07,868
-You did.
-I did not.

512
00:27:07,948 --> 00:27:10,214
-You did.
-I did not.

513
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:11,786
Open your mouth. Let me smell it.

514
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:13,164
Your mouth smells like strawberry.

515
00:27:13,244 --> 00:27:14,799
-I smelt it.
-No. No. No.

516
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,904
This match, we'll focus on the co-movement
between the midsolo and the jungler.

517
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:20,371
When the top fights,
the midsolo and the jungler...

518
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:24,391
must offer support in time
as we're forming a power play situation.

519
00:27:24,471 --> 00:27:27,731
According to my tactic, we'll rock ZGDX.

520
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:28,734
-Okay.
-Come on.

521
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,598
Come on! One. Two. Three.

522
00:27:30,678 --> 00:27:32,072
Come on!

523
00:27:32,803 --> 00:27:33,739
Let's go.

524
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,510
Hua, you need to be careful.

525
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,186
Tong Yao may choose
Tamamo-no-mae to teach you how to behave.

526
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:39,726
Enough of Tamamo-no-mae.

527
00:27:39,806 --> 00:27:41,382
My head aches when I hear it.

528
00:27:41,462 --> 00:27:43,075
Next round, I'll ban it.

529
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,154
Yang, what will you pick?

530
00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:47,302
Ubume.

531
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,392
What should we ban?

532
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:11,896
Ban Youko.

533
00:28:11,976 --> 00:28:14,382
-Youko.
-Okay, Youko is banned.

534
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,047
Yes.

535
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,277
Youko was banned.

536
00:28:17,357 --> 00:28:18,725
Which one should Cheng pick?

537
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:20,108
Pick the frog.

538
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:21,633
Why the frog?

539
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:23,627
Or what?

540
00:28:23,707 --> 00:28:25,599
Doumeki, Chin or Komatsumaru?

541
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,550
Kubinashi.

542
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,351
A Liar is not qualified
to play these shikigamis.

543
00:28:28,431 --> 00:28:29,953
When did I lie?

544
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:31,562
You said you quit candy.

545
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,272
I didn't eat any candies just now.

546
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:35,066
Your mouth smells like strawberries.

547
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,914
It's too obvious.

548
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:39,692
When you went to the bathroom,
which beautiful lady gave you the candy?

549
00:28:39,772 --> 00:28:40,998
You'd better tell the truth.

550
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:43,466
I don't have diabetes.
Why are you so strict to me?

551
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:47,672
Mr. sound engineer,

552
00:28:47,752 --> 00:28:49,522
please don't put these
into the game quotes.

553
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,713
-Okay?
-Why?

554
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:52,103
I'm afraid about you,
the new king of the team,

555
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:53,593
will receive the blade again.

556
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:54,734
So sweet?

557
00:28:54,814 --> 00:28:56,066
Of course.

558
00:28:57,747 --> 00:28:59,639
K, choose Shuten Douji for Cat.

559
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:00,559
Okay.

560
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,437
I'll take Onikiri.

561
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:05,619
Sure?

562
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,477
(Onikiri)

563
00:29:10,557 --> 00:29:12,407
Cheng, they picked Onikiri.

564
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,710
They dare to pick Onikiri.

565
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,251
Isn't Good Luck
good at controlling tank-type shikigamis?

566
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:20,447
Why did he pick Onikiri to scare me?

567
00:29:20,527 --> 00:29:22,381
Lu Yue can choose Menreiki.

568
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,745
What's wrong with Onikiri?

569
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:27,003
Every time we laugh at Lu Yue,
Ming is the happiest one.

570
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,448
Suddenly I feel sorry for him.

571
00:29:29,528 --> 00:29:33,067
I bet ten hamburgers
that Lu Yue is rubbing the wall.

572
00:29:35,212 --> 00:29:36,938
Chubby, you need to get Kuro Douji.

573
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:38,027
Okay.

574
00:29:38,804 --> 00:29:40,827
Okay. They've decided their heroes.

575
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:42,484
The game starts now.

576
00:29:44,056 --> 00:29:46,358
K, focus on the top lane.

577
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:49,757
I feel like Good Luck must play Onikiri
on purpose.

578
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:50,803
Okay.

579
00:29:51,365 --> 00:29:52,390
Come on.

580
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,661
Slaying this frail Onikiri
is a piece of cake.

581
00:29:59,384 --> 00:30:00,312
Come on. Go.

582
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:01,432
-I'm coming.
-K's at the top lane.

583
00:30:01,512 --> 00:30:02,774
It's on. Two versus one.

584
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:04,778
-They can catch him this time.
-Wanna go?

585
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:06,075
Good Luck rushed to the turret.

586
00:30:06,155 --> 00:30:07,588
Knockup
and has gained controlled of Cat.

587
00:30:07,668 --> 00:30:08,849
(First blood)

588
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:10,302
You lost again.

589
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:11,382
They've turned the table!

590
00:30:11,462 --> 00:30:12,461
Mouse problem.

591
00:30:13,427 --> 00:30:15,114
-Yes.
-Who can stop me?

592
00:30:15,194 --> 00:30:17,107
Good Luck is in the bushes ready
to return home for restoration.

593
00:30:17,187 --> 00:30:18,572
Knockup K seems to have noticed that...

594
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:20,213
and is ready to slay Good Luck.

595
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:22,401
The table was turned again.
They slayed two and have lost zero.

596
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:23,657
Yes.

597
00:30:32,924 --> 00:30:33,900
(Rampage)

598
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,700
(Shield disappeared)

599
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,339
(Legendary)

600
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,547
(Defeat)

601
00:30:56,194 --> 00:30:59,928
Yang. Yang. Yang.

602
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:01,444
Aced.

603
00:31:01,524 --> 00:31:03,811
I have to say
Good Luck's Onikiri has been invincible...

604
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:05,912
Double kill ever since it showed up.

605
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,469
Yes.

606
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:09,530
ZGDX can't resist their attack at all.

607
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,693
The gold gap is wider and wider.

608
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:14,083
It's okay. Keep going.
We haven't lost this game.

609
00:31:16,238 --> 00:31:17,442
You…

610
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:19,793
You made the top laner a king.

611
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:23,414
Cat. K. Clear the top lane,
and get down.

612
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:24,581
Okay.

613
00:31:24,661 --> 00:31:26,763
-Tong Yao, get ready.
-I'll come when I clear the lane.

614
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,114
Chubby. Let's push forward
and take the Orochi.

615
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:30,127
Okay.

616
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:37,748
-GO. Go. Go.
-I'll protect you.

617
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:39,664
-GO. Go. Go.
-They're fighting at the Orochi pit.

618
00:31:39,744 --> 00:31:40,815
Attack Onikiri. Attack Onikiri.

619
00:31:40,895 --> 00:31:42,355
We see ZGDX firing at Onikiri.

620
00:31:42,435 --> 00:31:44,540
ZGDX all fires at Onikiri.

621
00:31:45,907 --> 00:31:47,692
But they got killed instead.

622
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,879
(Shield disappeared)

623
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:53,666
Double kill. Nice.

624
00:31:56,468 --> 00:31:58,547
It seems that they have no chance.

625
00:31:59,438 --> 00:32:01,491
Triple kill. Amazing!

626
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:02,996
Amazing!

627
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,069
(Killingspree Shield Disappeared)

628
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,129
To the core! To the core!

629
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:12,804
-Fire. Fire. Fire.
-Go. Go. Go.

630
00:32:18,365 --> 00:32:20,013
CK's winning is assured.

631
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:22,067
CK has pushed to ZGDX's base.

632
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:23,428
Victory!

633
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:27,100
Congratulations to CK
for winning this match!

634
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,077
Congratulations to CK!

I don't understand their Onikiri's damage.

645
00:32:56,532 --> 00:32:58,740
Enough. Stop thinking about it.
It feels unreal.

646
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:02,328
Cheng, what are you thinking?

647
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,977
I'm thinking
if I hadn't bluffed Jian Yang...

648
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:07,574
we might haven't lost this round.

649
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:11,058
I need to remind you
that we are one to one now.

650
00:33:11,138 --> 00:33:12,314
We haven't lost yet.

651
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:14,772
But what did you say to him?

652
00:33:14,852 --> 00:33:16,478
When did you meet Jian Yang?

653
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:19,646
When we were resting earlier
at the exit passage next to the bathroom.

654
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:21,266
And you said you didn't eat candy.

655
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:24,270
From now on you are not allowed to go
to the bathroom unless you are approved.

656
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,436
-Report?
-Report.

657
00:33:25,516 --> 00:33:27,159
-What?
-Urgent urination.

658
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,549
Good Luck's Onikiri pissed me off.

659
00:33:28,629 --> 00:33:29,573
You can't go.

660
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:31,031
Let's go over the last match.

661
00:33:33,962 --> 00:33:35,125
Cat.

662
00:33:35,624 --> 00:33:37,750
You said Shuten would be invincible
if it got strong.

663
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,329
Nonsense. Did you see Onikiri?

664
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:41,634
-I…
-Look at Good Luck's Onikiri.

665
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:42,777
Why can't you use it?

666
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:44,060
Why?

667
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,147
Tong Yao,
please let him go to the bathroom.

668
00:33:47,227 --> 00:33:48,686
Set this crazy man free.

669
00:33:52,423 --> 00:33:53,936
Didn't you want to go to the bathroom?

670
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:56,723
Let me check if you hide any candy.

671
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:58,067
Hands on the wall.

672
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:00,762
Open your legs.

673
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,071
Anything else in your shoes?

674
00:34:13,548 --> 00:34:16,688
How about coming with me
so that you can supervise me.

675
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,728
What a hooligan.

676
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,562
What are you looking at?

677
00:34:29,996 --> 00:34:31,896
Just now, I didn't dare to speak aloud.

678
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:34,202
When we lost before,
Cheng always had a poker face.

679
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:37,844
Anyone who spoke lacked self-reflection
and would be reproved.

680
00:34:37,924 --> 00:34:39,198
You don't need to be afraid this time.

681
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,472
He's in a good mood as if CK...

682
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:43,985
had remitted one million yuan
to his account for a fake match.

683
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:45,363
Thanks to you.

684
00:34:45,443 --> 00:34:46,868
Yes.

685
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,460
This is the game site of 2020 National
League of the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

686
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,112
Now we are at the third match
between CK and ZGDX.

687
00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:56,826
The ban pick part is over.

688
00:34:56,906 --> 00:34:58,974
We're about to start the game.

689
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:01,328
Both midsolos are fighting
against the line.

690
00:35:01,408 --> 00:35:05,228
Susabi may be suffering at the beginning
when confronting Tamamo-no-mae.

691
00:35:05,308 --> 00:35:07,659
But if Smiling
can get some advantages in gaining scores,

692
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,425
then Susabi Water carp
power will take control easily.

693
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:13,079
Yang is in the upper jungle.
Let's look at ZGDX.

694
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:15,024
K will reach level four
after killing this Kirin.

695
00:35:15,104 --> 00:35:17,038
Then, no matter whether he goes to
the middle or the bottom lane…

696
00:35:17,118 --> 00:35:18,498
K, how long do you need for the jungle?

697
00:35:18,578 --> 00:35:19,819
Come to the bottom lane.

698
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:21,240
I feel like Jian Yang's coming.

699
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,274
Okay.

700
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,684
K finished the jungle and is waiting
in the bushes at the bottom lane.

701
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:26,193
Chubby, go ahead.

702
00:35:26,273 --> 00:35:27,932
I'm coming!

703
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:30,058
-Yes. Yang's Yasha has been drained.
-Chubby.

704
00:35:30,138 --> 00:35:31,614
-Fire.
-K shows up.

705
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:33,143
K, take him down. Don't let him escape.

706
00:35:33,223 --> 00:35:34,859
K attacks by the way.

707
00:35:34,939 --> 00:35:36,338
Yang is slayed. (First blood)

708
00:35:36,418 --> 00:35:37,701
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

709
00:35:37,781 --> 00:35:39,391
Get back. Get back. Get back.

710
00:35:42,742 --> 00:35:44,087
Nice.

711
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:47,500
(Knockup)

712
00:35:48,086 --> 00:35:50,110
Smiling used a set of skills and Corrode,

713
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,759
Killingspree when Hua was
using his ult and knocked him down.

714
00:35:55,473 --> 00:35:57,047
This situation, I guess,

715
00:35:57,127 --> 00:36:00,493
is a relief to fans no matter
whether they are at the site...

716
00:36:00,573 --> 00:36:01,980
or on live streaming channel.

717
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,688
She hasn't taken part in the match
for a while,

718
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:06,028
but that hasn't affected her state at all.

719
00:36:06,108 --> 00:36:07,119
Wang, come with me.

720
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,184
Go to the middle lane first.

721
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:09,521
If we don't catch them,
it'll be hard to fight.

722
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,055
Each attacker scored one point.

723
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,943
They took up the whole Vision.

724
00:36:13,023 --> 00:36:14,992
Chubby. K. Try to get some for us.

725
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,019
-Okay.
-Quiet.

726
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,639
Let me finish collecting the gold
and experience.

727
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,651
They're afraid of being caught.

728
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:24,513
Or let K focus at the top
and not go to the middle lane.

729
00:36:24,593 --> 00:36:27,422
Yang is unwilling to catch you anyway.

730
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:31,813
Chubby, you're brave now.

731
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:34,520
Be careful, in case Cheng slays you, too.

732
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,418
You talk a lot.
Why don't you go take up the Vision.

733
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:40,442
No.
I'm poor. I need to go to the jungle.

734
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:42,785
You are so mean
when we're in a favorable position.

735
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:44,578
Then what about
being in an unfavorable one?

736
00:36:44,658 --> 00:36:46,947
You said Yang
wouldn't come to the middle lane.

737
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:48,679
I think he…

738
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:57,642
Yang has cleared the minions.

739
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,533
-Why are you laughing?
-Your scream.

740
00:37:03,613 --> 00:37:05,480
The audience heard it.

741
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,752
No way.

742
00:37:07,565 --> 00:37:11,788
In ZGDX's zone, there burst out
a lady's scream...

743
00:37:12,387 --> 00:37:14,775
which could shake the heaven and earth.

744
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:18,282
-No wonder they said ZGDX has a new king.
-Yes.

745
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:19,849
Okay. Let's attack the Orochi.

746
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:22,099
Cat and K,
wait at the top of the Orochi pit.

747
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:23,344
Tong Yao, on the left.

748
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:24,843
Chubby come with me at the middle.

749
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:26,065
Okay.

750
00:37:26,145 --> 00:37:28,520
-Go. Go. Go.
-ZGDX starts to attack the Orochi.

751
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:31,241
They are starting to attack the Orochi.

752
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:32,999
Don't rush.
They can't finish in a short time.

753
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,196
Assemble first.

754
00:37:34,276 --> 00:37:35,491
-On the way.
-Okay.

755
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:36,836
Yang assembles the team.

756
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:38,461
Watch out. They are coming.

757
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:40,152
Keep attacking? My Subdue is not ready.

758
00:37:40,232 --> 00:37:42,607
-It's such a loss if they get it.
-Let's go. Let's go.

759
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:43,807
Save your skills.

760
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,856
Let's wait in the bushes.
We'll wait for them.

761
00:37:45,936 --> 00:37:47,840
-Okay.
-The attacking is a little hasty.

762
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,187
No. They didn't return
but wait in the jungle.

763
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:54,317
But if they fight in this area,
CK will be at a disadvantage position.

764
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,050
The fight is on. Yang is buried.

765
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,378
I think I was buried! Butterfly.

766
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,020
I'm firing. I'm firing.

767
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:02,086
Smiling controls Wang.

768
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,611
I was cut out. Where are you, Wang?

769
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:05,035
I'm being controlled.

770
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:06,689
Instakilled.

771
00:38:07,174 --> 00:38:08,369
Hua, you're up. Go.

772
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:10,008
-Chubby, use your ultimate skill.
-Coming.

773
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:11,467
Butterfly is in danger. (God's envoy)

774
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:12,812
Double kill.

775
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:15,281
Surprise, friends.

776
00:38:16,286 --> 00:38:17,864
Good Luck has been slain.

777
00:38:17,944 --> 00:38:20,175
They're depending on Hua.
Let's see if Hua can escape.

778
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:21,724
-Cover us.
-Hua.

779
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,565
Hua has been slain, too.

780
00:38:23,645 --> 00:38:25,117
Yang, go away. Don't get caught.

781
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:27,044
That was an excellent cooperation.

782
00:38:27,124 --> 00:38:29,195
Stop chasing.
The middle lane still has minions.

783
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:31,053
-Push. One take.
-Okay.

784
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:32,346
One take. One take. Go. Go. Go.

785
00:38:32,426 --> 00:38:35,058
Now, we can see that
ZGDX is at the base.

786
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,883
CK only has Yang.

787
00:38:36,963 --> 00:38:38,028
It seems the game's ending.

788
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,862
(Destroy)

789
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,954
Yang can not turn the table alone.

790
00:38:42,034 --> 00:38:43,551
But Yang has come up.
He wants to give it a try.

791
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:45,419
-Go. Go. Go.
-Attack the base. Ignore him.

792
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:46,935
-Okay.
-Aim at the base.

793
00:38:47,015 --> 00:38:49,550
-The base. The base. Come on.
-Almost. Almost. Hurry up.

794
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,860
Victory! Congratulations to ZGDX
for becoming the national top four.

795
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,813
Congratulations to ZGDX.

796
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:55,999
Yes.

797
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:58,404
We made it. We won.

798
00:38:58,484 --> 00:38:59,635
Nice.

799
00:39:00,566 --> 00:39:03,428
We won! We won! We won!

800
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,612
The flash with the ultimate skill
was great.

801
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:08,750
Let's go.

802
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,528
Congratulations. Congratulations.

803
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:25,065
Congratulations. Congratulations.

804
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:26,795
Congratulations. Congratulations.

805
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,873
-Come on.
-Congratulations. Congratulations.

806
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,552
I finally know why you said
we were not suitable that day.

807
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:38,053
Hope you can be happy.

808
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:40,025
I said we would shake hands again.

809
00:39:40,105 --> 00:39:41,433
And here it comes.

810
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:42,444
Come on.

811
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:44,804
Hope we can meet again
at the World Championships.

812
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,368
Okay. See you at the World Championships.

813
00:39:46,448 --> 00:39:47,648
Deal.

814
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,867
