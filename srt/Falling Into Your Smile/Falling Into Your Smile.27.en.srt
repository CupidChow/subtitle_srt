1
00:00:01,648 --> 00:00:02,753
Cheng.

2
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:04,650
So you are such a person?

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,024
What?

4
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:07,756
Strong enough to be fearless.

5
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:10,781
I'm not.

6
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:14,137
There is time when I fear, hesitate,

7
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:16,488
and don't know what to do.

8
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:19,570
Cheng.

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,590
Are you really
strong enough to be fearless?

10
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,325
Yes, I am.

11
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:26,592
Because I have to protect you.

12
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:27,804
Cheng.

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,756
Cheng, did I really make a mistake?

14
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:40,373
Should we call off our relationship?

15
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:42,628
=Falling into Your Smile=

16
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:45,428
=Episode 27=

17
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:39,570
-Why are you crying?
-I'm not crying.

18
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,527
You're not crying?
Who was wailing like a wolf?

19
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:44,480
Do you think
this room is well sound-proof?

20
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,076
If you want to lie next time,
hide under the blanket and cry.

21
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:49,130
I'm sure I can't hear you
even you passed out for crying.

22
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,238
I'm not crying.

23
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:52,260
I don't want to ask
the same question again.

24
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:57,922
That's because
I was just washing my face...

25
00:02:58,326 --> 00:02:59,852
and my hand touched the water.

26
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:01,513
It hurts, so that's why I cried.

27
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,919
You wrap your fingers in an ugly way.

28
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:06,383
With only one hand,
can you wrap it beautifully?

29
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:08,550
Are you stupid?
Why don't you let me help you?

30
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,607
I don't need your help.
I can do it myself.

31
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:15,998
It will hurt a little.

32
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:32,034
It hurts just as much as before.
Didn't you cry so loudly just now?

33
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:33,060
What?

34
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,234
You become tough when I came?

35
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:37,017
I've cried enough.

36
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:38,250
What's wrong?

37
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:40,528
You wouldn't talk to me several days ago.

38
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,728
And now
you're coming all the way over here.

39
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:44,268
What's this about?

40
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,757
Are you looking for a joke?

41
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:47,599
Do you want to have a good laugh at me?

42
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,317
I came because I worried about you.

43
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,846
If you want me to leave,

44
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:53,335
either you don't cry
or you can deafen me.

45
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:06,258
The man in front of me
the king of Onmyoji Arena Pro League,

46
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:07,855
is the god of the fans.

47
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:09,678
Was it really me...

48
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:12,128
who dragged him down
from the altar little by little?

49
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,055
Am I really doing it for his sake?

50
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:16,809
Bear with it.

51
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,417
-Cheng.
-It will be fine soon.

52
00:04:18,497 --> 00:04:20,272
Did I really make a mistake?

53
00:04:44,894 --> 00:04:46,605
If I've done something wrong,

54
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:48,681
why don't you give me a scolding?

55
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,182
Beating me up is fine.

56
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,846
Ban me from the game.

57
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:53,539
Just let me play training match.

58
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:56,071
Make me absent from each game.
It's all fine.

59
00:04:56,151 --> 00:04:59,242
Why didn't you say anything
from beginning to end?

60
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:01,316
I could only watch you from afar.

61
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:04,513
You didn't even talk to me
and just ignored me.

62
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,746
I'm a human being, a living human being.

63
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,361
I'm not air.

64
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:13,329
Cheng.

65
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,385
Are we going to break up?

66
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:21,784
You want to break up with me?

67
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,605
Because I didn't do a good enough job
and made you cry,

68
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,839
you're breaking up with me?

69
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,878
That's what you just said.

70
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,876
I did. Why are you nervous?

71
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:35,581
How can I not be nervous
with you looking at me like that?

72
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:37,573
So now you're going to denounce me?

73
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,291
No, I'm not.

74
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:41,427
I'm just curious.

75
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:43,823
What makes you think like that?

76
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:45,554
You've always been great.

77
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,893
You're Lu Sicheng.

78
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,320
You're Chessman,

79
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:52,241
the god of shooter in their minds.

80
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:54,108
No one dared to scold you before...

81
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:56,998
until I appeared,

82
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,435
meddling around and making trouble.

83
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:04,593
If there is a troublemaker,
it would be me.

84
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:08,242
I'm just curious
what makes you think like that.

85
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:10,365
I'm not trying to break up with you.

86
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:14,087
It's because just that
you ignored me the other day.

87
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:15,911
I was wondering...

88
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,646
whether you were mad at me.

89
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,489
Or maybe you're tired of me?

90
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:23,807
That's why I couldn't help but ask you.

91
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:27,735
If that's really the case,

92
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:33,315
at least I can dump you first
so that it won't be so humiliating.

93
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:43,351
A lot of things have happened
in the past few days.

94
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:44,930
I was confused.

95
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,220
And then there was
the incident where you got hurt.

96
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,432
I was so angry.

97
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:51,916
But I didn't know
who was the man to be angry at.

98
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:55,948
-So you were angry at me.
-I wasn't.

99
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:58,631
I was just mad at myself.

100
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,077
It's not that
I didn't want to talk to you.

101
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:03,482
It's that I didn't know
how to talk to you,

102
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:05,117
to make you accept me as I was.

103
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:08,351
I'm not the perfect man atop of everything
in your heart.

104
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:12,029
I couldn't even protect you
in critical moments.

105
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:14,084
You thought too much.

106
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:16,507
What perfect man atop of everything?

107
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:17,696
Isn't that so?

108
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:20,061
I've seen you sloppy.

109
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:22,995
Is this the reason you broke up with me?

110
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,162
I told you. I didn't.

111
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:26,441
Why do you still…?

112
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:40,340
From now on, no matter what happens,

113
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:42,177
don't break up with me.

114
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:48,909
But I want to make a move
before you dump me.

115
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:50,167
That's not gonna happen.

116
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:52,347
Don't even think about it.

117
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,336
I will take care of you
for the rest of your life.

118
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,146
So I'll repeat the breakup thing.

119
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,893
Don't even think about it.

120
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,031
Hello?

121
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:38,650
Hey, Yao. Why are you still sleeping?

122
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,438
Look at the news link I sent you.

123
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,315
ZGDX e-sport club...

124
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:53,534
has indicated the reason for
Tong Yao's absence from the game...

125
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:56,055
is that her hand got cut
by a malicious package she received.

126
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:57,748
ZGDX condemns this kind of behavior.

127
00:09:57,828 --> 00:09:59,700
We hope that fans
will discipline themselves...

128
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,356
from acting aggressively.

129
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:05,491
In response to this situation,
ZGDX will take legal action if necessary.

130
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:10,495
Rui.

131
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:11,803
-Well.
-Wait!

132
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:14,655
What happened to your face?

133
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,993
Maybe I ate something bad last night.

134
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:20,383
It's an allergy.

135
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:24,587
Rui, is this you
who did the righteous thing?

136
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:25,694
This?

137
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:28,034
Cheng has pressured the club
to make the statement.

138
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:30,660
And we didn't say anything before
to calm the public opinion.

139
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,137
But if now
we don't reveal the truth to the public,

140
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,389
the public opinion will become
more and more outrageous.

141
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:37,158
This is even worse.
And this statement really works.

142
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:39,202
The person who sent you
the express delivery has been found.

143
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:42,068
She is the one who sent the post
"How Tong Daji is made".

144
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:43,469
And some fans found out...

145
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,294
she declared on another account that
she was going to send you a razor blade.

146
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:47,003
Oh, my God,
all your fans are cursing her now.

147
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,537
Her blogs are going to be trending.

148
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:51,608
Take this and put it on.

149
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:54,208
It'll make it look better.
Don't eat anything bad in the future.

150
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:55,929
And...

151
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:58,679
don't show off frequently.

152
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:01,930
Lu Sicheng.

153
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,578
Are you a stupid pig?

154
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:12,339
You came downstairs in your pajamas again.

155
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:24,533
The poster of "How Tong Daji is made",

156
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:26,596
you made hater posts,
and sent razor blades.

157
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:29,288
What's your grudge against Smiling?

158
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,162
How shameless.

159
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:33,169
What's your intention
in scolding Tong Yao?

160
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:34,564
And you even sent razor blades?

161
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:36,012
Are you out of your mind?

162
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:38,667
Are you very depressed in the real life?

163
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:42,081
Made hater posts and sent razor blades.
Blogger, the price of groceries...

164
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:43,630
must increase
when your mother goes out for shopping.

165
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,297
You must step on the stinky shit
when you go out.

166
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:47,276
You must forget to bring paper
when you go to the toilet.

167
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:50,715
All the Smiling fans,
don't make a scene here, okay?

168
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,250
Put internet violence on a blogger.

169
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,724
Are you humans?

170
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,957
Put internet violence on a little girl.

171
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:57,860
Good for you, Tong Daji.
Hurry up and apologize to her.

172
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,991
That's funny.

173
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:00,277
The victim hasn't yet spoken.

174
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:01,846
You guys came out
and blamed the victim first?

175
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:03,020
Does it make any sense?

176
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,663
(ZGDX midsolo Tong Yao's fans push
internet violence on an ordinary blogger.)

177
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:06,983
(As you wish I'm going to die
with recurring depression.)

178
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:08,868
Hello, everyone.

179
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:18,949
I am what you call
the unforgivable "Momo is a devil".

180
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:25,883
I posted "How Tong Daji is made".

181
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:34,638
I am just an ordinary person.

182
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:40,038
I'm just an ordinary
junior high school student,

183
00:12:42,518 --> 00:12:47,287
a loyal fan
who used to love ZGDX's Lu Sicheng.

184
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:53,355
I am also a depressed person.

185
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:21,384
This is the diagnosis of major depression
from the First People's Hospital...

186
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:24,336
in March this year.

187
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:30,009
From that time to now,

188
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:32,517
I've been taking medicines.

189
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:34,806
The situation was improving.

190
00:13:34,886 --> 00:13:35,956
But...

191
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:42,237
your internet violence
has interfered with my life.

192
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:46,625
From the moment I suffered it,

193
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:52,360
I haven't closed my eyes for 48 hours.

194
00:13:58,361 --> 00:13:59,791
I'm too tired...

195
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:04,022
and disappointed.

196
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,576
I'm too scared.

197
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,539
Let's end it like this.

198
00:14:20,537 --> 00:14:21,552
Goodbye forever.

199
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:29,193
As you wish, I'm going
to be driven to death by you guys...

200
00:14:29,273 --> 00:14:30,170
with recurring depression.

201
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,490
Smiling is too hateful.

202
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,402
As a public figure,
how dare she allow her fans...

203
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:35,382
to push internet violence
and insult an ordinary blogger?

204
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,602
Why don't you all step in
and calm the situation down?

205
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:38,866
Smiling and her lackeys.

206
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,829
It's better to let Smiling
make a public apology.

207
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:43,109
ZGDX, please deal with Smiling seriously.

208
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:44,677
I'm so confused!

209
00:14:44,757 --> 00:14:46,420
How can this be the victim's fault?

210
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,848
Just because
the perpetrator was depressed?

211
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,156
Nice moral kidnapping.

212
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:51,248
Just clicked on the video
and took a closer look at...

213
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:53,414
the depression diagnosis of
"Momo is a big devil".

214
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:54,606
And I surprisingly found...

215
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,166
it seems that the test was conducted by
the psychology department of our hospital.

216
00:14:57,246 --> 00:15:00,109
But we don't seem to have received her.

217
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:02,876
Is it possible that too many vitamins
can cause problems?

218
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:04,199
I'm scared.

219
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,049
The truth is not yet clear.

220
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:07,249
And you're already cursing Smiling.

221
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:09,678
-Smiling's lackeys.
-Go away, you accomplice.

222
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:19,121
From the moment I suffered it,

223
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:24,054
I haven't closed my eyes for 48 hours.

224
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:32,142
Now it has come to this point.

225
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,828
It's no longer a petty fight
among e-sports fans...

226
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:38,042
but a social event that has attracted
the attention of the whole society.

227
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:40,372
So we must be careful with it.

228
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:42,473
We must come up with the best solution.

229
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:46,125
Save ZGDX and the club
from more trouble.

230
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,517
Before the best solution is finalized,

231
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,953
in order to avoid public anger,

232
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:56,761
exclude Tong Yao
from all the recent activities of ZGDX.

233
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:00,631
How about this?

234
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,948
Let's let Tong Yao apologize first...

235
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,407
to relieve the bad comments
on the Internet.

236
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:08,333
Although the whole thing
is not directly related to Tong Yao,

237
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:11,568
it's more or less because of her.

238
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:12,905
Because of her?

239
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:17,948
First of all, the cause of the whole thing
isn't Tong Yao.

240
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:20,170
But because this girl
sent a razor blade to Tong Yao.

241
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,168
Second of all, the depression
report this girl provided in the video...

242
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,479
is questionable.

243
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:27,749
Her behavior and results
in the video are questionable.

244
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:29,600
When the whole thing is not clear,

245
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,711
it's impossible to let Tong Yao
come out and apologize.

246
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,201
The problem is that
the public opinion is now one-sided.

247
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:36,073
You can't tell the truth at all.

248
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:37,313
Can't you tell it?

249
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,546
Whether it's true or false, a phone call
to the police will make it clear.

250
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,869
Is this how you
protect your own club member?

251
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:44,495
If something happens,
you push us out as shield?

252
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:45,610
Is that so?

253
00:16:46,513 --> 00:16:48,004
Lu Sicheng is right.

254
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:50,996
In fact, there were fans who
contacted the local police...

255
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,041
after "Momo is a big devil"
had released the suicide video.

256
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:54,480
They said they didn't receive...

257
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,916
any case of junior high school student
committing suicide.

258
00:16:56,996 --> 00:17:01,212
So we can't be sure about
whether this is true or not.

259
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:03,739
It's not as simple as it seems.

260
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:06,321
Lu Sicheng.

261
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,919
Although Lu is the largest shareholder,

262
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:13,471
you don't own the club alone.

263
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:15,696
It doesn't matter
how you make trouble at other times.

264
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:16,712
But now,

265
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,663
I have to take into consideration
the collective interests of the club.

266
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:21,525
You can't overweigh the whole club.

267
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:24,155
The most important thing for us now
is to show our sincerity...

268
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:26,809
-to calm the public opinion.
-Calm the public opinion?

269
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:28,482
If this is what you'll do,

270
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:29,885
aren't you afraid
of letting the players down?

271
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,757
That's enough. Save anything else.

272
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,636
This is the club's decision.

273
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,187
Lu Sicheng.

274
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:38,533
What are you doing?

275
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:41,525
You executives
can let the ZGDX players down.

276
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:42,702
I can't.

277
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:44,349
Because I'm the captain.

278
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,180
Since you are not responsible,

279
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,084
I'll be completely in charge.

280
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,203
Hey, I need you to do me a favor.

281
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:26,871
In the next regular season,

282
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:29,886
we are facing our old rival YQCB.

283
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:31,881
Through the system analysis
in the last issue...

284
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:33,516
and this data comparison chart,

285
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:36,646
you can see clearly
we and the next-door team...

286
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:38,676
are close in overall capacity.

287
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:40,511
In terms of offense
and economic efficiency,

288
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:41,938
we are a little bit higher.

289
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:43,690
But in terms
of vision and resources control,

290
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,707
YQCB is a bit higher than us.

291
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:47,429
In the case of equal capacity
of both sides,

292
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:49,885
we must be prepared for a long battle.

293
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:52,869
The toughest person of YQCB is Hierophant.

294
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:54,563
He has always played aggressively.

295
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:56,546
Cheng, you have to be vigilant.

296
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:59,027
Make sure to take shikigamis
like Komatsumaru in the BP section...

297
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:00,799
who can carry
in the early and late stage of the game.

298
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:02,157
Even if it's a long battle,

299
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:03,795
you can also restrain Hierophant.

300
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,241
Hey, go ahead.

301
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:19,966
Come on, let's continue.

302
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:42,684
The number you dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

303
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,834
Have you contacted Cheng?

304
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,015
No.

305
00:19:45,274 --> 00:19:46,355
Tong Yao also called.

306
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,599
He didn't answer it.

307
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,912
That was the case yesterday.
Today is the same.

308
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:53,185
Do you think the thing that happened
to Tong Yao still affects Cheng anyway?

309
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:54,318
It can't be.

310
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:56,797
I've been with him for so many years.

311
00:19:56,877 --> 00:19:59,271
He is not
someone who would delay the training...

312
00:19:59,351 --> 00:20:00,871
and game for his own private matter.

313
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,905
If he leaves,
it's because there is a must.

314
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,069
Both Tong Yao and I have told him
today's training time.

315
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:09,432
I believe when he wants to come back,

316
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:10,829
he will be back.

317
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:14,841
But the training is coming soon.

318
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:16,618
What if he doesn't come back?

319
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:19,244
I'll take his place for a while.
I'll take Komatsumaru.

320
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:21,204
-But Ming, your hand...
-Stop it.

321
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:22,483
We're about to train.

322
00:20:22,563 --> 00:20:24,065
Don't look so sad.

323
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,112
Let's go.

324
00:20:58,461 --> 00:21:00,425
-Well.
-I'll play a game for Cheng first.

325
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:02,943
Where is Cheng?

326
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:05,243
Cheng will definitely be back
in tomorrow's game.

327
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:07,163
Don't ask about it. Come on.

328
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:08,546
Let's get ready to start.

329
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:09,805
No more questions.

330
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,594
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:20,962
I'm taking up your time.

332
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:22,921
We're waiting for you.

333
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:24,035
Have a seat.

334
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,718
Cheng.

335
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,216
Your hand.

336
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:41,117
Don't worry. It's okay.

337
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,732
Okay.

338
00:21:43,078 --> 00:21:44,049
Let's start.

339
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:45,239
Come on.

340
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,922
Let's get into the BP section.

341
00:21:57,002 --> 00:21:59,033
Cheng, you choose Komatsumaru.

342
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,332
Chubby, choose Hotarugusa.

343
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:05,593
Cat, Ibaraki Douji. K, Yasha.

344
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,441
Cat, K, you guys go around the back.

345
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:12,629
Tong Yao, press the line.

346
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:14,458
-Chubby, come with me.
-Okay.

347
00:22:27,822 --> 00:22:28,921
Cat, K, go up.

348
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:30,681
Chubby, stay with me. Tong Yao,
go back and get your blood refilled.

349
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:32,009
Cheng, look out.

350
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,695
(Defeat)

351
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:41,866
What?

352
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:44,164
What's going on?

353
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:47,232
It's okay. Let's do it again.

354
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:48,569
We can't fight now.

355
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:49,885
Let's develop first.

356
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:51,832
Fight again after organizing ourselves.

357
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:49,261
Cheng, you're up so early.

358
00:24:05,852 --> 00:24:06,921
What are you doing?

359
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:08,066
What am I doing?

360
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,886
I was going to ask you what you're doing.

361
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:11,639
You stayed up all night
last night, didn't you?

362
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,266
You were up all night ranking?

363
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:18,872
The doctor said you can't over-train.

364
00:24:18,952 --> 00:24:20,548
Do you still want your hand?

365
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:22,549
It's okay.

366
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:24,079
How about you?

367
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,780
Does your hand still hurt?

368
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:28,089
I'm fine.

369
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:29,332
You see?

370
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:31,117
It's almost healed.

371
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:35,645
How can you practice like this?

372
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:39,812
I didn't play the best of Komatsumaru
during the training game yesterday.

373
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:42,507
I just wanted to play a little longer
to get a feel for it.

374
00:24:42,587 --> 00:24:43,800
Help me finish this game.

375
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,091
I'll go up and wash my face.

376
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:59,241
ZGDX versus YQCB,

377
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:01,968
I'm looking forward to it!

378
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:03,118
How much is the ticket?

379
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,231
Is my half a month's salary enough?

380
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:06,461
-I want to bring my binoculars.
-I want tickets for the front row.

381
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:09,166
Will it be the ultimate kill of Light
or the reversal of Shadow?

382
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:10,648
I'm betting. I'm betting.

383
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:11,654
I bet on Lu Sicheng to win.

384
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:13,409
Selling the tickets of
"duel between Light and Shadow".

385
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:14,883
Have a look.

386
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:16,305
Don't rob it! Don't rob it!

387
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:18,761
Selling the tickets of
"duel between Light and Shadow".

388
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:20,127
Don't rob it! Don't rob it!

389
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:21,595
There's more here.

390
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:24,009
Give me one. Mine.

391
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,862
Don't rob it. Give me two more.

392
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,830
Don't take it! Don't take it!

393
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:30,540
I want it. I want it.

394
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,862
I'm saving it for myself.

395
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,736
Come on, guys.

396
00:26:12,816 --> 00:26:15,516
I paid for your coffee myself.

397
00:26:15,596 --> 00:26:17,511
Come on, have some to cheer up.

398
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:18,822
Would you?

399
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:21,300
Where're Cheng and Ming?

400
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,880
My brother just called Ming out,
saying he had something to talk about.

401
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,436
I think they should be in the hallway.

402
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:26,715
Won't they drink coffee?

403
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,142
I'll bring it for them.

404
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:50,513
No reason.

405
00:26:50,593 --> 00:26:52,425
It's because I don't want to
take a shikigami for a long battle.

406
00:26:52,505 --> 00:26:54,450
Youko can contain Hierophant
in the early stage.

407
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,217
If I don't let him develop quickly,

408
00:26:56,297 --> 00:26:58,498
we might be able to finish the game
as soon as possible.

409
00:26:58,797 --> 00:26:59,888
Why?

410
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:02,649
Why do you want to finish the game
as soon as possible?

411
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:04,513
I thought I told you before.

412
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:05,872
It's a tough fight.

413
00:27:05,952 --> 00:27:07,636
-It's a constant battle.
-What's wrong?

414
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:09,614
Give me an explanation.

415
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:10,863
There is none.

416
00:27:11,316 --> 00:27:12,971
Hierophant is my corresponding opponent.

417
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:15,657
ZGDX, please get ready.

418
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:17,527
You're about to get on the stage.

419
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:25,586
Rui asked me to bring the coffee.

420
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:28,099
Let's go to the stage.

421
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:31,944
Let's go.

422
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:14,961
YQCB!

423
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,760
Onmyoji Arena Pro League Live audience,

424
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,235
are you ready?

425
00:28:19,391 --> 00:28:22,631
YQCB!

426
00:28:24,347 --> 00:28:26,311
The combination of
the previous Light and Shadow...

427
00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:29,226
will finally meet
on the gaming field today.

428
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:32,791
So please bring us all
the battle of the century.

429
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:35,871
Live audience, please grab the glow stick
in your hands...

430
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:40,225
and welcome them to the stage
with your loudest shout.

431
00:28:40,305 --> 00:28:42,739
First of all, please welcome YQCB.

432
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:45,659
Please welcome Ai Jia,

433
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,392
Liang Sheng, Kim Eun-seok,

434
00:28:49,472 --> 00:28:52,014
Rong and Hierophant.

435
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:11,031
Since Hierophant officially joined
Onmyoji Arena Pro League,

436
00:29:11,111 --> 00:29:13,111
we have been looking forward to him.

437
00:29:13,192 --> 00:29:16,192
The whole league has finally
embraced today's cross-group battle.

438
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:19,168
Will this day be the victory of Light
or the reversal of Shadow?

439
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:20,998
Let's wait and see.

440
00:29:21,863 --> 00:29:24,743
Isn't it today
when Smiling is back in the game?

441
00:29:24,823 --> 00:29:26,959
Do you have to be so excited?
You're overly dramatic.

442
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,813
Even if we can see Smiling
back on the field,

443
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:32,391
don't you want to see Chessman and
Hierophant's ultimate head-to-head match?

444
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,449
I'm telling you.

445
00:29:33,745 --> 00:29:34,878
What's wrong?

446
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:37,311
Cheng, you...

447
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:39,222
Of course I want to see it.

448
00:29:39,302 --> 00:29:40,770
Actually, to be honest...

449
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,272
Don't worry, it's fine.

450
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:43,388
Besides the anticipation,

451
00:29:43,468 --> 00:29:46,416
the matchup between the two
teams' bottom lane ADC is quite a killer.

452
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:49,308
In this version where shooter
isn't as competent as before...

453
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:52,997
who doesn't seem to be able to
turn the tide of a battle,

454
00:29:53,077 --> 00:29:56,061
there are still two teams
in which ad weighs a lot...

455
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:58,907
in Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

456
00:29:58,987 --> 00:30:01,979
Let's take a look at
who the winner will be.

457
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:17,790
Please welcome Cat.

458
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:19,442
K.

459
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,282
Chubby.

460
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:23,482
Chessman.

461
00:30:23,562 --> 00:30:25,000
Smiling.

462
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:31,441
Now our two teams are both ready to go.

463
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:35,831
So next, we'll ask the members of
the two teams return to their seats...

464
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:38,241
to bring us a wonderful game.

465
00:30:59,721 --> 00:31:02,052
It's really intense here today.

466
00:31:02,132 --> 00:31:04,288
It's as if the finals have come early.

467
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:05,250
Live fans.

468
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,711
You're so enthusiastic!

469
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:14,931
Hierophant! Hierophant! Hierophant!

470
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:16,730
With so many fans,

471
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,179
Hierophant is worthy of
being the equal of Cheng.

472
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,564
Come on! We'll start in a moment.

473
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:28,803
Put on your headphones.

474
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,540
Okay, we can see that now the game
has entered the BP section.

475
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,547
Let's see Smiling from ZGDX…

476
00:31:40,627 --> 00:31:41,670
Ban Iron Mouse.

477
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,744
Who will she ban?

478
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,287
Just now in the backstage,
I asked Hierophant what to play today.

479
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:47,715
He said he would play Iron Mouse.

480
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:49,763
Could he tell you the truth?

481
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:51,066
Can you trust his word?

482
00:31:51,146 --> 00:31:52,322
He was lying to you.

483
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:56,503
Although Hierophant seems to have
been practicing that shikigami lately,

484
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:57,606
I…

485
00:31:57,686 --> 00:31:58,729
Listen to me.

486
00:31:58,809 --> 00:31:59,909
Ban Iron Mouse.

487
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:05,131
Ban Iron Mouse.

488
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:09,032
Iron Mouse?

489
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,758
Tong Yao actually banned Iron Mouse.

490
00:32:11,838 --> 00:32:13,057
-ZGDX.
-What's going on?

491
00:32:13,137 --> 00:32:14,670
-Is it because she's got…
-Hierophant seems to have...

492
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,685
such mixed feelings.

493
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:17,947
To put it simply,

494
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:19,403
two words,

495
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:21,875
you liar.

496
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:26,293
What's the situation?

497
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:28,605
Looking from their faces at this moment,

498
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:31,702
they seem to have practiced
the tricks of Iron Mouse.

499
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:35,185
Cheng, so I have to suspect
Hierophant will come and kill you.

500
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,885
War is always deceitful.

501
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:38,992
Give him Chin.

502
00:32:41,351 --> 00:32:42,417
Ban Higanbana.

503
00:32:42,975 --> 00:32:44,990
Higanbana is too competent
in this version.

504
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,235
I'll choose Susabi later.

505
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:49,115
-I'm afraid Tong Yao will contain me then.
-Okay.

506
00:32:49,195 --> 00:32:52,511
Sure enough. ZGDX has
banned Susabi and Ubume.

507
00:32:52,591 --> 00:32:56,019
YQCB has banned K's famous Mannendake...

508
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,564
and Smiling's Tamamo-no-Mae.

509
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,721
I wonder if Smiling
is to choose Ootengu again.

510
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:02,450
Cat, choose Ootengu for Tong Yao.

511
00:33:03,721 --> 00:33:04,781
Okay.

512
00:33:05,377 --> 00:33:11,987
As expected, ZGDX chose Ootengu
while YQCB, chose Chin and Yama Usagi.

513
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:18,511
Next, ZGDX chose Yasha as
jungler and Ibaraki Douji as topsolo.

514
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:22,166
YQCB chose
Menreiki and Youtou Hime instead.

515
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:23,473
Now only Chessman is left.

516
00:33:23,553 --> 00:33:24,763
-Cheng.
-To be reasonable,

517
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:27,771
facing YQCB's lineup,
Cheng should take Komatsumaru, right?

518
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:31,515
Yes, yes. Komatsumaru
is a relatively safer choice.

519
00:33:32,504 --> 00:33:33,594
What?

520
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:35,156
Youko?

521
00:33:35,236 --> 00:33:37,348
Chessman once again chose Youko?

522
00:33:37,428 --> 00:33:40,476
Oh my god, this is another
unexpected choice!

523
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:43,062
I hope this time Chessman
can still be the same as before,

524
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:46,222
getting the advantage in the early stages
of the battle and handle it quickly.

525
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,157
Here we go.

526
00:33:57,941 --> 00:33:59,981
(Battle)

527
00:34:04,151 --> 00:34:05,547
Go, go, go!

528
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,591
Hello, everyone!

529
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:12,471
This is the last match day
on the fifth week in Chinese server...

530
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,511
of Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

531
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:17,441
Today we will have
the first ZGDX versus YQCB match...

532
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:19,471
of the cross-group BO3.

533
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:23,639
Will the traditional powerhouse ZGDX
defeat YQCB's quest for victory...

534
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,271
or the dark horse YQCB
in the national tournament...

535
00:34:27,361 --> 00:34:30,048
end ZGDX's road to godhood?

536
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:32,037
Let's wait and see!

537
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:33,905
Cat, come to the top jungle.

538
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:35,047
Okay.

539
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,557
Cheng, it's not safe to have the line
too deep into the turret.

540
00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:45,782
K, come to ambush them in the bottom lane.

541
00:34:47,372 --> 00:34:48,321
Let's go.

542
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,059
Youtou Hime to come down.

543
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:51,798
Chubby, check out the vision.

544
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:53,506
Lu Sicheng is pushing the turret
very hard.

545
00:34:53,586 --> 00:34:54,876
He won't leave even after taking the line.

546
00:34:54,956 --> 00:34:57,235
He chose Youko
to compete with me in the early stage

547
00:34:57,315 --> 00:34:58,551
and suppress the development of Chin.

548
00:34:58,631 --> 00:35:00,809
Since they are playing so fiercely,
okay then.

549
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:02,358
Kim Eun-seok, ambush.

550
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:03,553
Ai Jia, stay in the middle lane.

551
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:05,737
Be careful, their jungler must be there.

552
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:07,014
K also came to the bottom lane.

553
00:35:07,094 --> 00:35:08,330
Can they make it
to ambush Hierophant this time?

554
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,609
My God, Hierophant is not
even out of the turret.

555
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:12,531
Kim Eun-seok's Youtou Hime
is also hanging around in the bottom lane.

556
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:13,783
There's no way they can take an advantage.

557
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:15,662
Let's withdraw.
They have a blood advantage.

558
00:35:15,742 --> 00:35:17,729
Wait for our midsolo to develop.
Then we'll come down together.

559
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:19,307
Neither the middle nor the bottom lane
is superior at the moment.

560
00:35:19,387 --> 00:35:20,983
I feel like ZGDX is having
a hard time in this game.

561
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:22,317
And in the middle lane now,

562
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:24,017
Ai Jia's Menreiki is also
keeping up a steady pace.

563
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:26,038
Smiling can't take any advantage at all.

564
00:35:26,306 --> 00:35:28,321
It's obvious that Ai Jia
is as steady-going as a mountain,

565
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:29,755
ready to contain our midsolo.

566
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:31,090
What steady-going as a mountain?

567
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,717
It's obvious that he's cunning.

568
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,727
-I can't support you at this moment.
-It's okay, we're safely out of there.

569
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:37,235
Don't act rashly, bottom laners.

570
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:39,288
Rong's Aobouzu
is also tough to deal with.

571
00:35:39,368 --> 00:35:42,401
Today I've been stuck to Ai Jia,
the dogskin plaster.

572
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:44,202
He's brought the sticky nature
he usually applies to Jinyang...

573
00:35:44,282 --> 00:35:45,492
to the gaming field.

574
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:46,909
I can't find a chance.

575
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:48,888
My skills are prepared.
Go back and catch them.

576
00:35:48,968 --> 00:35:50,352
Chubby's Hotarugusa still got a control.

577
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:51,340
Be careful, guys.

578
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,961
Okay, it's only been a few minutes
since the game started.

579
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,096
How many levels have you reached?

580
00:35:54,176 --> 00:35:55,436
Don't confront them in the bottom lane.

581
00:35:55,516 --> 00:35:57,004
-Cheng.
-We can fight with them.

582
00:35:57,318 --> 00:35:58,861
-Light and Shadow confront now.
-Don't rush.

583
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:00,402
Back up a little.

584
00:36:00,683 --> 00:36:01,881
(Defeat) A collection of heads.

585
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:03,191
-Can Hierophant leave?
-He's gone.

586
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:04,991
-Chubby, control Hierophant.
-Okay.

587
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:07,036
YQCB almost lost two people.

588
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:09,516
Nice, Cheng.

589
00:36:09,596 --> 00:36:11,454
Captain is great.

590
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,870
Nice counterattack.

591
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,095
Hierophant lost this time.

592
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,153
Our Cheng earned 260.

593
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:19,042
I think you should keep a low profile.

594
00:36:19,122 --> 00:36:20,204
Keep a low profile.

595
00:36:20,655 --> 00:36:21,822
It's a pity.

596
00:36:21,902 --> 00:36:23,611
Youko and Hotarugusa
are also not of full blood.

597
00:36:23,691 --> 00:36:25,484
My support won't die in vain.

598
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:30,743
What? Hierophant didn't return
to the base for blood-refilling.

599
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:32,208
He crossed the turret
to force a surprise attack.

600
00:36:32,288 --> 00:36:34,087
He killed little-blooded Youko
and Hotarugusa.

601
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:36,511
Nice, Hierophant. Awesome.

602
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:40,241
Hierophant's turret raid...

603
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:42,855
has made the score in the bottom
lane from one to zero to two to two.

604
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:44,284
They're even in gold again.

605
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:47,357
It seems that it's still unclear
who the winner of this game will be.

606
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:49,010
Turret raid?

607
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,457
Is it worth it?

608
00:36:50,537 --> 00:36:53,488
I think Hierophant couldn't help it
seeing Cheng's little blood.

609
00:36:53,568 --> 00:36:56,652
Hierophant was so tough using the flash.

610
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:59,122
If it were me, I must have conceded.

611
00:36:59,202 --> 00:37:00,841
You are such kind of person.

612
00:37:07,271 --> 00:37:09,751
We see now Chessman still in
the bottom lane pressing the line.

613
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,237
Pull back.
I think Kim Eun-seok is coming.

614
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:13,582
Let's go.

615
00:37:13,662 --> 00:37:14,942
-Oh, my God!
-Yes.

616
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:16,094
Kim Eun-seok is attacking.

617
00:37:16,174 --> 00:37:17,248
Chubby blocked it.

618
00:37:17,328 --> 00:37:18,371
They are retreating.

619
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:19,671
Can they get away?

620
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:21,109
Can they?

621
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,759
-That was close.
-I was scared to death.

622
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,650
Kim Eun-seok's
backward movement is so obscene.

623
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,389
Cheng, go back to
the base for blood-refilling.

624
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:30,653
My heart is about to burst
with you pressing the line like this.

625
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:32,733
Cheng's Youko
should be back for blood-refilling.

626
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:33,835
Here comes the line.

627
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:36,207
Lu Sicheng must be going for experience
and hit the turret in my absence.

628
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,313
Kim Eun-seok, don't go.
Keep ambushing him.

629
00:37:38,646 --> 00:37:39,681
The line is here.

630
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:40,964
Let's clear the line before we go.

631
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:42,789
No, Kim Eun-seok didn't leave.

632
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,862
After a while,
Hierophant is back in shape.

633
00:37:44,942 --> 00:37:46,154
There's a fight in the bottom lane.

634
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:47,209
Kim Eun-seok is still here.

635
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:48,764
Hierophant and Liang Sheng
both have enough blood.

636
00:37:48,844 --> 00:37:49,976
Be careful, Cheng.

637
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:52,070
Kim Eun-seok is in the bottom lane.

638
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,280
K, come to the top lane.
Let's destroy the top turret.

639
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,175
Don't be greedy. We won't have time.

640
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:57,361
Whatever, I'll go.

641
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,648
Luckily, they ran fast.

642
00:37:58,728 --> 00:37:59,915
That's right.

643
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,111
-Look at the top lane.
-K is coming up to the top lane.

644
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:03,721
Cat went up first.
He's not of full blood anymore.

645
00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:05,853
K is also arriving. Can he save Cat?

646
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:07,101
(Killingspree) Cat was killed.

647
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:08,499
Shutdown K didn't let go of Rong.

648
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:09,575
Turret raid.

649
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,028
Unfortunately, he didn't get away.

650
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:12,377
I told you to come earlier.

651
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,894
You kept staying in the bottom lane,
and ganking Hierophant.

652
00:38:14,974 --> 00:38:17,124
Will you output the damage later
if I didn't suppress him?

653
00:38:17,204 --> 00:38:19,182
This two for one is not worth it.

654
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,686
Let's be honest,
the situation of ZGDX is not good.

655
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:25,287
It's been 11 minutes
since the game started.

656
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:27,790
The gold gap
between the two teams is 1,300.

657
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,811
-YQCB is temporarily superior.
-Yes.

658
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:30,815
Did you see that?

659
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:34,521
The topsolo and ad of ZGDX
are having a hard time now.

660
00:38:34,631 --> 00:38:37,338
Hierophant is now containing
Chessman in the bottom lane,

661
00:38:37,418 --> 00:38:38,564
-not giving him a chance to fight.
-Yes.

662
00:38:38,644 --> 00:38:40,474
He can't get rid of it,
but he can't get away either.

663
00:38:40,554 --> 00:38:45,912
Now we can say that the only one who's
developing normally of ZGDX is Smiling...

664
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:47,341
playing against Ai Jia.

665
00:38:47,421 --> 00:38:49,081
Yes, we can only count on her now.

666
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:50,619
I hope she can save the day alone.

667
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:52,148
Come on, let's take it.

668
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:53,817
Hurry up!

669
00:38:57,027 --> 00:38:58,151
Cheng, they're hitting the monster.

670
00:38:58,231 --> 00:39:00,110
Let go of the monster.
Go and destroy the middle turret.

671
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,357
I'll try.

672
00:39:01,437 --> 00:39:03,159
(Killed off the monster)

673
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:05,551
Watch out!
Liang Sheng's Yama Usagi is accelerating!

674
00:39:05,631 --> 00:39:07,667
The flag of the monster is picked up.
Take Hierophant behind you.

675
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:09,551
No, Hierophant is clearing the line
too fast.

676
00:39:09,631 --> 00:39:11,482
I can't destroy the turret.
I'll go back to the turret.

677
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:13,706
Hold on to it. Destroy it.
It's not that hard.

678
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:14,815
I'm going around the back.

679
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,369
You guys must be careful
not to let them scatter you.

680
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:17,478
Ai Jia's ult isn't refreshed.

681
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:19,584
Cat, you go to suffer the turret damage,
and I will get behind.

682
00:39:19,664 --> 00:39:21,019
A team fight.

683
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:22,349
Move back! Move back!

684
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:24,008
Defeat Ai Jia was killed.

685
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:25,008
Ult refreshed in three seconds.

686
00:39:25,088 --> 00:39:27,610
The opposing jungler hasn't been exposed.
Put the ult at my feet.

687
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,883
I can release a set of skills too.

688
00:39:28,963 --> 00:39:31,471
Kim Eun-seok rushed out,
trying to get to the back row...

689
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:34,433
only to be controlled by Chubby
and killed by Smiling's set of skills.

690
00:39:34,513 --> 00:39:36,032
It's not good for YQCB.

691
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:37,631
I guess they can't defend this turret.

692
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:39,141
-Definitely they'll let go of it.
-We can't let them retreat.

693
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:40,709
-Cat, go into the turret.
-Yes, keep going.

694
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:41,861
Cat rushed over.

695
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:43,286
Look, Liang Sheng is killed.

696
00:39:43,366 --> 00:39:45,256
Now YQCB is down to Hierophant.

697
00:39:45,336 --> 00:39:47,201
(Double Kill) YQCB is aced.

698
00:39:47,281 --> 00:39:49,318
YQCB has lost a lot in this team fight.

699
00:39:49,398 --> 00:39:51,580
Both people and the turret are gone.

700
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,256
Kim Eun-seok made a mistake
in positioning.

701
00:39:54,336 --> 00:39:56,244
Zero-for-five for ZGDX.

702
00:39:56,324 --> 00:39:58,888
But I don't think it will happen again
next time.

703
00:39:58,968 --> 00:40:00,385
YQCB will learn from their mistakes.

704
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:01,951
Protect their output.

705
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:04,832
If ZGDX wants to kill the
opponent's output player again,

706
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:05,873
it won't be so easy.

707
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:09,159
Yes, I hope ZGDX
can seize this opportunity.

708
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,953
We've finally destroyed
Ai Jia's middle turret.

709
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,399
Captain, push.

710
00:40:13,524 --> 00:40:14,752
Where are you going?

711
00:40:14,832 --> 00:40:16,293
Chessman is retreating?

712
00:40:16,852 --> 00:40:17,860
Cheng.

713
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:19,908
I don't think they can hit the Orochi now.

714
00:40:19,988 --> 00:40:21,192
What is Chessman thinking?

715
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:25,462
They seem to have withdrawn.

716
00:40:26,284 --> 00:40:27,961
No way.
Chessman doesn't want this turret.

717
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:29,224
He must have gone to hit the Orochi.

718
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:30,340
Everyone, go to the snake pit
after coming back to life.

719
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,572
-What?
-Cheng.

720
00:40:31,652 --> 00:40:33,226
It's too dangerous
to hit the Orochi at this time, right?

721
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,471
There's not enough time
to fight the Orochi...

722
00:40:34,551 --> 00:40:36,537
if we don't continue
to advance at this point.

723
00:40:36,617 --> 00:40:38,609
They've already revived.
Let's get out of here!

724
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:40,192
Go. We can't finish the fight, Cheng.

725
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,254
Cheng, let's retreat!
How can we fight this?

726
00:40:42,334 --> 00:40:43,588
Cheng, they're coming.

727
00:40:43,668 --> 00:40:45,351
We can fight.
Tong Yao, go up with your ult.

728
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:46,733
I'll hold off Hierophant.

729
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:49,548
YQCB is resurrected.

730
00:40:49,628 --> 00:40:51,617
-Won't ZGDX retreat?
-Fight.

731
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:59,541
(Killingspree)

732
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:00,730
Cheng.

733
00:41:01,573 --> 00:41:03,490
Cheng missed.

734
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,259
It's a historic moment.

735
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,720
Cheng, I can't take it anymore.
What should we do?

736
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,654
-Team fight.
-My ult is prepared.

737
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,850
Up, up, up!

738
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,981
(Defeat)

739
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,649
I'm dead.

740
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,624
What a pity!

741
00:41:22,704 --> 00:41:24,532
Chessman was so close.

742
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:26,437
If Chessman had gotten
his ult on Hierophant just now,

743
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,408
it'd have been different.

744
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:31,504
This is obvious
a command error of Chessman.

745
00:41:31,584 --> 00:41:33,884
Yes, how can you let the midsolo
go up to pick up the team fight?

746
00:41:33,964 --> 00:41:35,749
Think about it,
how long can a midsolo hold?

747
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,240
Where is the tough shikigami?
How to fight it?

748
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,564
Yes.

749
00:41:38,988 --> 00:41:40,261
(Destroyed)

750
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:52,474
Yes!

751
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:53,910
Nice, nice.

752
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,949
-Let's congratulate YQCB...
-That was awesome!

753
00:41:56,029 --> 00:41:57,913
-for winning the game.
-Come on.

754
00:41:57,993 --> 00:42:00,146
Congratulations to YQCB!

755
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,189
Cat.

756
00:42:10,801 --> 00:42:12,838
Cheng, your hand.

757
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:15,744
It's okay.

758
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,075
