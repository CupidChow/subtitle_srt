1
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,551
Next we will play against ZGDX.

2
00:00:19,117 --> 00:00:20,745
I look forward to beating them up again.

3
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,152
To be honest,

4
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:27,893
of all the opponents in the semi-finals,

5
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:29,598
we are only worried about ZGDX.

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,702
ZGDX will not fall in
the same place twice.

7
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:35,845
We are the champion.

8
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:39,609
I didn't expect...

9
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:43,772
our team was lucky enough
to make it to the final four.

10
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:46,076
I think...

11
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:49,973
Smiling must have prayed for me.

12
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:51,466
Smiling.

13
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:56,179
Let's meet in the finals together.

14
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,620
=Falling into Your Smile=

15
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:07,483
=Episode 30=

16
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:19,894
Nice! Come on, Ming.

17
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,092
Come on, Chubby.

18
00:02:21,172 --> 00:02:22,310
Come on.

19
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:23,534
Cat.

20
00:02:23,614 --> 00:02:24,536
K.

21
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:26,328
-Let's go.
-Lu Yue.

22
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:29,151
Here you are, Tong Yao. Then Cheng.

23
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,683
Go for the finals!

24
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:33,396
Congratulate Tong Yao
to get into the annual finals and Cheng.

25
00:02:33,476 --> 00:02:35,401
And by the way I remind you that
this month's KPI is not completed. Rui.

26
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:36,620
What are you reading?

27
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:41,348
The day YQCB won FNC
and got the ticket to the national finals,

28
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,031
the boss of the next-door team
was standing at the door,

29
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:44,655
holding a pile of red packets.

30
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:47,056
The team members got out
one by one to receive the red packets...

31
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:48,588
which seemed to be thick.

32
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,073
-While we…
-While we didn't.

33
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:52,239
Why?

34
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,702
We too reached the finals.

35
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:55,365
Why next-door team can get red packets...

36
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:57,220
while we only receive candy
and greeting cards...

37
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,774
without even a good meal.

38
00:02:58,854 --> 00:02:59,910
I don't feel convinced.

39
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:01,700
I feel I'm being discriminated against.

40
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,362
It is rarer to strive for the first
and keep the second place...

41
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:04,408
now in the final exams,

42
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,185
given you were the second place
in the class in the midterm,

43
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:07,611
or to strive for the first
and keep the second place,

44
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,246
given you've always
been at the bottom of the class?

45
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:10,710
We made it to the national finals.

46
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,702
It means we have reached
the level of our previous performance.

47
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:14,138
So, what's to reward?

48
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,338
I'll reward you a candy.

49
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:21,932
Cheng, well, I need to talk to you.

50
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:23,134
What's wrong?

51
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,200
Lu Sicheng, you are cruel.

52
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:32,827
K, what have you bought here?

53
00:03:32,907 --> 00:03:34,665
A face mask, MIHOO.

54
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:39,048
K, what's wrong with you?

55
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:41,167
Who are you calling "a little fool"?

56
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:42,623
We just finished the game.

57
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:45,426
You two are so close that you call
each other name of endearment?

58
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:46,595
Shut up.

59
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:50,431
This is MIHOO masks I just bought.

60
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:52,125
We stay up late every night training.

61
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:53,627
My skin is extremely dry.

62
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:56,143
This mask is very good
at water-replenishing.

63
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:57,824
I shall replenish water for my skin too.

64
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,033
You've had so much.

65
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:02,128
Delicious.

66
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,347
Little fool.

67
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:04,607
Want to try it?

68
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:06,652
Does this work?

69
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:11,328
Are you calling the mask or me?

70
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:13,860
Cat's reflex arc
can circle the earth three times.

71
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,136
You shut up too.

72
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:17,811
Guys,

73
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,398
after we finish this game today,
we are going to face the final then.

74
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:24,149
But I still want to remind you.

75
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,565
YQCB is no longer the relegated team
it once was.

76
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:29,605
He defeated FNC
and got into the finals with us.

77
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:32,327
Back to the point,

78
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:34,580
from now on until the finals starts,

79
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,422
our whole base
will be closed for training.

80
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:38,841
What kind of closed training?

81
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,324
Is the club
going to completely adopt us?

82
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:43,325
As how closed it is,

83
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:46,148
we want to guard against the opposite team
as if it's a secret agent.

84
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:50,159
For example, no dinner, shopping,
chatting in private...

85
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:52,754
with the rich and beautiful lady
next door.

86
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,427
No discussion of tactics
in the name of clipping dolls

87
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,208
with the ex-boyfriend
and current opponent next door.

88
00:04:57,288 --> 00:04:59,233
Of course. Biscuit and Scallion
also have to be grounded.

89
00:04:59,313 --> 00:05:00,826
They can't interact with
the next-door mid-solo's cat.

90
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:01,832
Wait a minute.

91
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:03,975
Can you even draw a map
on the back of the cat?

92
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,881
Why don't you just
build a concrete wall,

93
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,757
the kind that's thick
and eavesdropping-proof?

94
00:05:08,837 --> 00:05:10,178
A concrete wall?

95
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:13,492
It would be better to paste it directly
on the entrance of our mid-solo.

96
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:16,016
Why?

97
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:19,338
If we paste on the entrance of our
mid-solo, how can Tong Yao come out?

98
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:21,362
Rui.

99
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:23,000
Our top-solo is somewhat retarded.

100
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,352
Why don't we consider
finding a substitute for him?

101
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:27,298
No, no, I can do it.

102
00:05:27,388 --> 00:05:29,485
My brother wouldn't let me
play mid-solo anyway.

103
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:30,867
-Seconded.
-Shut up.

104
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:32,161
Shut up.

105
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:33,148
Let's go.

106
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:35,720
Before we officially go
into the closed training,

107
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,070
I'll treat you to something good.

108
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,528
Long live Cheng.

109
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:39,821
I'm so excited about this.

110
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:41,203
-Let's go, little fool.
-Let's go.

111
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:43,200
-Let's have a nice meal.
-Don't call me that.

112
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,279
-Let's go.
-Okay.

113
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:45,402
-Hurry up.
-Go.

114
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:53,733
Come on. Have a drink.

115
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:01,720
Isn't that DQ Five?

116
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,897
What happened to them?

117
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,185
They don't have their curfew anymore?

118
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:17,107
They've been relegated.

119
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,099
While you were playing in the top 8,
they were still playing for promotion.

120
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:23,610
No one was paying attention to it.
So there was no discussion.

121
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,553
They lost their relegation match?

122
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:26,863
They got relegated,

123
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:29,421
and have to play for the seat match?

124
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:33,139
DQ Five is no longer in the 12 teams of
next season's Onmyoji Arena Pro League?

125
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:41,805
He is Civet Cat.

126
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:42,842
I know.

127
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:45,281
He is the captain and support of DQ Five.

128
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:47,109
He is an experienced player.

129
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:49,222
You guys should behave yourselves.

130
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:50,569
Don't cause any trouble.

131
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:58,259
This year,

132
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:02,263
don't mess around this year...

133
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:05,352
and play well in the national finals.

134
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:09,389
When you get
the World Championship ticket,

135
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:14,966
win honor for our Onmyoji Arena
Pro League in front of the world.

136
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:18,835
Buddies,

137
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:23,439
I can't back up you guys like last year.

138
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,076
I really like playing professionally.

139
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:33,296
I really like the feeling
of playing alongside my teammates.

140
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:36,361
Even though there are a lot of pities,

141
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:38,801
I'm still very happy.

142
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:43,673
Now I've come to the end of the road.

143
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:48,422
But I know
someone will continue to go on for me...

144
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:50,497
and go farther.

145
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:57,081
I hope you are among the lucky ones.

146
00:07:57,805 --> 00:07:58,918
Come on.

147
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:10,563
I gotta go.

148
00:08:10,643 --> 00:08:11,975
I'll go see them off.

149
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:14,066
Enjoy your drink.

150
00:08:14,146 --> 00:08:15,124
See you later.

151
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:16,544
Bye-bye.

152
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:23,812
He just said back up.

153
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:24,912
What does that mean?

154
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:28,886
Before, when our ZGDX were unexpectedly
absent from the national finals,

155
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:33,077
it was DQ.Five that took our place
in the World Finals.

156
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:34,290
Boss, settle the bill.

157
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,380
I didn't expect that
after Hsu Tae-lun left,

158
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,012
they lost their core again.

159
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,030
They didn't win a single game
in the second half of the National League,

160
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,362
being directly relegated to the seat match
with the bottom ranking in the league.

161
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:46,181
It can be said that
fans were full of from hope to despair.

162
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:50,406
How hard it was to endure the
process like boiling a frog in warm water.

163
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:03,007
Dismissal meal.

164
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:04,608
The team was disbanded just like this?

165
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:08,544
It's simply impossible for any team
that falls into the seat match...

166
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:09,849
to come back with the original lineup.

167
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,287
After all, the professional league
is a realistic industry.

168
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,060
After the team is relegated,
those players who play well...

169
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,850
will be hired by other new clubs
and continue to enter...

170
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,084
Onmyoji Arena Pro League
playing for other teams.

171
00:09:20,164 --> 00:09:23,329
Those players who don't play well
have to find their own chances.

172
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:25,097
Those teams that fall into the seat match,

173
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,800
to put it bluntly,
are just empty shells.

174
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:29,242
Yes, they are.

175
00:09:29,322 --> 00:09:31,221
And that kind of dreamlike thing
that five people worked together...

176
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:33,445
to come back to Onmyoji Arena Pro League
from the seat match...

177
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:35,123
couldn't even be seen in a novel.

178
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:38,432
So for the people of DQFive,

179
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,486
their team
announced their disbandment on the spot...

180
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,247
the moment they failed
to avoid relegation.

181
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,574
Whether they can sit down
and play together,

182
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:48,967
have dinner and chat
like the old days...

183
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,576
really depends on fate.

184
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:55,285
So, back to the point,
let's cherish the time we spend together.

185
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:02,413
That was close.

186
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:05,037
Our team
once almost had a dismissal meal.

187
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:06,050
Hey!

188
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,850
I don't want to have the dismissal meal.

189
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,450
But I can have another bowl of
your potato and beef curry rice.

190
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:13,375
-I want to eat it too.
-I want to eat it too.

191
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:14,545
I want to eat it too.

192
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,590
I want to eat it too.

193
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,354
-I want to eat it too.
-I want to eat it too.

194
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,795
And it's the kind that
hides meat at the bottom of the bowl.

195
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,349
All right.

196
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:24,067
When we finish the game with YQCB,
I will satisfy your demands.

197
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:25,727
-Now let's toast first.
-Come on.

198
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:26,879
-Come on.
-Cheers!

199
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,287
Clad in thorns and feet in scorching sand.
Never give up.

200
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:30,389
Cheers!

201
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:32,048
Cheers!

202
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,061
Despair.

203
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:54,831
It's like a chronic death
with a death notice.

204
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,581
How can I not be desperate?

205
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,368
But now,

206
00:12:00,874 --> 00:12:03,245
I can finally get a moment of peace.

207
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:07,991
It's time to take a good rest
both for us...

208
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,788
and for all of you lovely fans.

209
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:14,416
Goodbye.

210
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:16,393
DQ Five.

211
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:19,740
You had the glory.

212
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:31,202
Where you go, we go.

213
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,890
It's not scary to go to the seat match.

214
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,177
We are with you.

215
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:35,516
Civet Cat.

216
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:37,882
Will we ever see you again
in the Spring Playoffs...

217
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:40,243
with smile, holding the spring trophy?

218
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:42,950
I don't know what to do
after the disappointment.

219
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,961
I've never liked a team so much.

220
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,695
I'll probably never watch
Onmyoji Arena Pro League anymore.

221
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,399
I really feel so tired.

222
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,462
Why do I have to like e-sports?

223
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,602
In fact, sometimes
I always persuade myself...

224
00:12:53,682 --> 00:12:57,677
to like the South Korean TAT or ZGDX.

225
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,013
That's great.

226
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:01,192
They can always win the game.

227
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:03,350
How happy it is to be a fan of theirs.

228
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:05,293
I've said it a million times...

229
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:07,686
but still end up coming to watch
your games.

230
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:09,497
-Fans are really disappointed.
-We feel desperate if you lose...

231
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:12,778
and then optimistically hold the
thought that you can win again next time.

232
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,355
-It's stupid.
-What can I do?

233
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:16,710
I'm desperate too!

234
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,940
I can't break free.

235
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,053
I can't escape.

236
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,227
I didn't come when you're at the top.

237
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:23,347
I don't abandon you
when you're at the bottom.

238

239

Cheng.

241
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:04,333

242
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:06,202

Guess what I'm thinking.

What?

251
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:25,292
When I first met you,

252
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,524
it was the same situation as now.

253
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:29,686
I could only look at you
from afar at that time.

254
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:32,918
But now I can stand together with you.

255
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,184

261
00:15:00,747 --> 00:15:01,835
You should eat less.

262
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:03,368
Everybody, relax.

263
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:06,271
Now that we're in the finals,
it proves that we do have the strength.

264
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:07,857
Don't be so nervous afterwards.

265
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:10,182
Since we are here in Shanghai,
I'll give you all an afternoon off...

266
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:11,491
to have a good time.

267
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:14,184
To do what?

268
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:15,965
A day trip to Onmyoji Arena battlefield
is better than...

269
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:17,975
to this popular tourist city
recommended by internet celebrities.

270
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,858
Now that we're here, let's go have fun.

271
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:22,324
That's right. If you go back
home and people ask you,

272
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:23,661
what did you see in Shanghai?

273
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:26,636
You go like "staying in the hotel
and playing games are really cool."

274
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:27,924
How embarrassing!

275
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:29,134
That's right.

276
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:32,912
Where do you want to go later?

277
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:35,518
It's all right.
I will go wherever you go.

278
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:36,675
Shopping?

279
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:39,178
But there's nothing I want to buy.

280
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:42,143
A human cash machine is standing
next to you and you're telling me this?

281
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:44,502
Do you think I like you for your money?

282
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:46,183
Do you?

283
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:48,036
Fine, buddy. What's wrong with you?

284
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:49,402
You're so desperate to spend money for me.

285
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,660
If I like a person,
I'd love to spend money on her.

286
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,179
If I have 10 yuan,
I would spend 9.5 yuan on her...

287
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,708
and save the remaining 50 cents
to buy buns,

288
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,267
because I'm afraid she'll be hungry.

289
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:02,383
I've been your support
for two or three years...

290
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:03,608
and let you kill countless times.

291
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:04,988
I don't ask for much.

292
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:10,050
Just pay for the new DW watch
in my shopping cart.

293
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:13,247
Look, look, look. This one
shows a good taste and elegance.

294
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:15,326
-It fits my temperament, right?
-No.

295
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:17,359
Is that all you've got?

296
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:18,719
(Amao's Mom)

297
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:22,294
You're not eating?

298
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:24,164
-Then I'll eat them all.
-Eat, eat, eat.

299
00:16:24,655 --> 00:16:25,805
Don't be too full.

300
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,069
Chubby, you can really eat so much.

301
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,294
Hey, Jinyang.

302
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:35,725
We are discussing
about a day trip in Shanghai.

303
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:36,687
What's up?

304
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:39,292
Isn't it your birthday today?
How are you going to spend it?

305
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:40,641
This is the first time
that the two of us...

306
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:42,364
can still get together
even not in Shenzhen.

307
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:44,137
I think it's worth remembering.

308
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:45,645
What should I send you this year?

309
00:16:45,725 --> 00:16:47,220
A bag, shoes?

310
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,910
A necklace, jewelry?

311
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:50,512
A wedding dress?

312
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,744
Forget it.

313
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:54,092
I should let your man give you
the jewelry and wedding dress.

314
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:56,948
It's not that I'm jealous.
He has more money than I do.

315
00:16:57,028 --> 00:16:58,268
If you say
you want to celebrate your birthday,

316
00:16:58,348 --> 00:16:59,772
he can buy the Oriental Pearl Tower...

317
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,768
and change its name
into Happy Birthday to My Wife Tower.

318
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:04,200
Don't tell him it's my birthday today.

319
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,921
If he really buys something expensive,

320
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:08,107
I can't pay him back even if
he sells me in pieces by the pound.

321
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:10,628
Your getting chopped up
are not as valuable as the whole girl.

322
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:12,901
I also want to have a boyfriend...

323
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,542
who can give me
something so expensive that I feel...

324
00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:16,491
I can't afford even by selling myself.

325
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:18,348
What's wrong with you today?

326
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:20,410
Why are you always talking about
my birthday?

327
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,201
It's about your dear mother.

328
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:25,676
She just called me, telling me
that this is your first birthday alone.

329
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:27,175
She asked me to spend it with you.

330
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,086
Is she my mother or your mother?

331
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,514
Wouldn't she just tell me
about such things?

332
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:33,591
She's too embarrassed to tell you.

333
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:34,654
What?

334
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:37,932
Yang.

335
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:39,268
Auntie should tell you.

336
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:42,331
I know that now young people are
all about romance on their birthdays.

337
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:45,039
Especially Tong Yao,
she has a boyfriend now.

338
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:47,683
Her boyfriend is quite good.

339
00:17:47,763 --> 00:17:49,390
He's handsome and educated.

340
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,801
So it can work.

341
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:54,485
It's just that Auntie needs to ask you
to remind Tong Yao...

342
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:58,611
that girls should be more cautious
and pay attention to protection measures.

343
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,068
Let me translate it for you.

344
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,634
Your mother is still young.

345
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,538
She doesn't want
to have grand-children yet.

346
00:18:07,028 --> 00:18:08,399
Okay, okay.

347
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:09,648
I have to go now.

348
00:18:18,551 --> 00:18:20,300
Why are you so flushed?

349
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,448
My mom complimented you
on your good looks.

350
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:25,594
Shoot.

351
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:26,761
No way!

352
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:29,158
Chubby ate it all by himself?

353
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:30,915
He didn't even leave me
a single crab-meat dumpling?

354
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:33,057
That's
not enough for Chubby to stuff his teeth.

355
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:34,138
That's right.

356
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:36,930
But Shanghai crab-meat dumplings
are really delicious.

357
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:42,827
Are you okay?

358
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:44,064
Yes.

359
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:45,434
You're too full?

360
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,035
I'll go check it out.

361
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:15,882
Are you okay?

362
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:20,100
Cheng.

363
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:22,283
I'm not okay.

364
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:27,771
(The Eighth Hospital
of Lanshan University)

365
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:32,052
It's been so long.

366
00:19:41,343 --> 00:19:42,984
Doctor, is he okay?

367
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:44,379
Nothing serious.

368
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:45,659
Acute gastroenteritis.

369
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:46,918
He still has a fever.

370
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:48,510
But you can rest assured.

371
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,380
He's young and in good health.

372
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,700
After the infusion of fluids,
he can be discharged tomorrow.

373
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,466
-Thank you.
-That's good.

374
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,783
Chubby.

375
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:01,054
How are you doing?

376
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,644
Much better.

377
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:07,158
You guys, you guys.

378
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:08,966
You guys are just trying to screw me.

379
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:12,780
Whenever there's an important game,
you must make a mess.

380
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,328
Do you think I live too long?

381
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:16,991
I have to finish tomorrow's game
even if I'll be lying down.

382
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:18,502
Good for you.

383
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:21,093
I'm hungry.

384
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:22,582
I want to eat cookies.

385
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,103
Say it again?

386
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,315
I've already thrown up everything
I need to.

387
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:29,144
If it goes on like this,
I'll die of hunger before I get well.

388
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:31,188
In the rest of your game,
you have to finish it with Tong Yao,

389
00:20:31,268 --> 00:20:32,661
the handicapped support.

390
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,101
Aren't you afraid?

391
00:20:34,752 --> 00:20:36,391
I just want to eat cookies, okay?

392
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:38,174
It's not a crime to eat cookies.

393
00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:40,389
Who will buy me a pack of cookies?

394
00:20:42,094 --> 00:20:44,271
Tong Yao. Buy me a bag of cookies.

395
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:45,403
Hurry up.

396
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:48,454
If I won't get well,
you'll have to work as support for Cheng.

397
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:51,291
Think about how miserable you were
when you were his support.

398
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:53,957
What do you want to say?

399
00:20:54,635 --> 00:20:57,495
Why don't we buy Chubby a pack of cookies?

400
00:20:57,575 --> 00:20:59,906
He's so hungry. I feel bad.

401
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:07,376
What are you doing?

402
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:09,635
I didn't take my wallet with me.
And my cell phone is dead too.

403
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:11,540
I can't buy cookies with a credit card,
right?

404
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:15,711
Wait, he'll be right back.

405
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:16,964
How can you be laughing?

406
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:19,587
Don't be mean to me.

407
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:21,378
I'll get sore again if you do.

408
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:29,589
Hello. How much?

409
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:31,025
Hello, please wait.

410
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:47,971
(Emergency Department)

411
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:57,027
What are you going to do
for your birthday?

412
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,421
Do you want to join me?

413
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:00,548
I'm not going to make a big deal
out of it.

414
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:02,010
I'm still in the hospital.

415
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,818
How can I have a birthday?

416
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:09,633
Happy birthday.

417
00:22:09,985 --> 00:22:11,382
It's a happy one.

418
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:16,011
(Mother: Happy birthday,
my dear daughter)

419
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:17,687
Love you, mama.

420
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:36,661
Make a wish.

421
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:47,031

429
00:23:11,968 --> 00:23:13,114
How did you know?

430
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:16,059
When I took your wallet just now,
I wanted to see your ugly ID photo.

431
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:17,737
-You…
-Luckily, I ran fast.

432
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:19,703
Otherwise,
the mall would have been closed.

433
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,231
Happy birthday, e-sports Mulan.

434
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:28,624
Have you two had enough?

435
00:23:28,704 --> 00:23:30,813
We are really a little hungry.

436
00:23:30,893 --> 00:23:32,113
Can we eat the cake now?

437
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:34,393
Actually, I didn't even plan to
celebrate my birthday.

438
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:35,420
The game is around the corner.

439
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,782
It's almost the same
whether I celebrate it or not.

440
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,652
Even if we have to play the game,
you still have to celebrate your birthday.

441
00:23:38,732 --> 00:23:39,627
Yeah.

442
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:41,049
Hurry up, hurry up, make a wish.

443
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,651
Yes, come on, make a wish.

444
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,538
Smile necklace.

445
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:11,917
A necklace for this year.

446
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,418
A diamond ring for next year
with a wedding certificate.

447
00:24:16,516 --> 00:24:17,923
-Does it look good?
-Yes.

448
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:19,124
You look good in anything.

449
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:22,119
So romantic.

450
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,580
Wait, wait, wait.

451
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,146
Shouldn't you pay
more attention to me in my ward?

452
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:27,252
We can't help it.

453
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,134
The protagonists tonight are destined
to be the Double Carry players.

454
00:24:30,214 --> 00:24:33,163
By the way, I have gifts for you today.

455
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,387
Normally,
I care about you all the time...

456
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:39,146
as your housekeeper.

457
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:41,372
I can't fight for you on the field.

458
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:43,298
But I can do all the logistical work.

459
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:46,301
So, to ensure that
everything goes well next...

460
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,943
and all the bad luck
steers away from you,

461
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:54,030
I specially sent someone to get
this for you,

462
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,829
an amulet
that blesses you in terms of food,

463
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:59,340
clothing, housing and moods all-round.

464
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,900
Come on, one for each of you.

465
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,840
Make sure that you'll do a great job
in the finals.

466
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,955
Here you go.

467
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,162
Thank you.

468
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,778
Not bad.

469
00:25:09,858 --> 00:25:11,677
What's that look on your faces?

470
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:13,389
Think about it yourselves.

471
00:25:13,469 --> 00:25:16,711
All the way through this league,
you've been injured and sick.

472
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,533
About this,
if you believe in it, then it's true.

473
00:25:18,613 --> 00:25:21,101
If you don't believe it, you can use it
as a talisman, a souvenir or something.

474
00:25:21,181 --> 00:25:22,961
It doesn't cost you
a piece of flesh with you, right?

475
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:25,404
By the way, it's not that the
club doesn't have faith in you.

476
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:29,242
I've made a vow
to take back the trophy of the finals...

477
00:25:29,322 --> 00:25:30,586
and go to the World Championship.

478
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,579
Otherwise, I will resign.

479
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:33,616
He can't do that.

480
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,511
Even if he's to be a bus driver,
he has to follow us.

481
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:36,513
Right?

482
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:37,885
You're...

483
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:41,411
But to tell you the truth,

484
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:44,425
no matter what the outcome this time is,

485
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:46,106
I will always support you guys.

486
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:48,033
No matter what happens,

487
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,354
just betray me, I'll take care of it.

488
00:25:52,714 --> 00:25:54,275
All right, just give me one.

489
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:55,492
I also want to make a wish.

490
00:25:55,572 --> 00:25:58,132
I've seen those internet celebrities
say this is quite effective.

491
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,211
Does it really work?

492
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,527
What do you want to wish for?

493
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:02,668
I'll help you make it happen.

494
00:26:02,748 --> 00:26:04,799
Cheng, I have a wish too.

495
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:06,327
I also have a wish.

496
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:07,470
What's the point?

497
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:09,002
I mean, Double Carry players.

498
00:26:09,082 --> 00:26:10,695
This isn't appropriate, right?

499
00:26:10,775 --> 00:26:13,761
Although I told you to relax,
you guys don't have to do this, right?

500
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:16,273
Our primary goal now
is to win the national championship.

501
00:26:16,353 --> 00:26:17,799
Yes, you two have a long way to go.

502
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:20,034
Please be a little more sincere. Really.

503
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:22,007
I really don't want to be a bus driver.

504
00:26:23,221 --> 00:26:27,561
My wish is to beat YQCB, to win the
national championship and go to the world.

505
00:26:27,641 --> 00:26:29,096
That's right.

506
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:30,424
No more?

507
00:26:32,111 --> 00:26:34,430
To celebrate,
how about we go eat some meat?

508
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,457
-Good idea.
-You still can eat?

509
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:36,978
Chubby, why don't you behave yourself?

510
00:26:37,058 --> 00:26:39,021
What follows is
not just the national finals...

511
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:40,812
but the ultimate showdown
of Light and Shadow.

512
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:42,450
You should train hard
after you leave the hospital.

513
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,463
If you do a good job,
I'll treat you to crab noodles.

514
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:46,884
If you don't do well,
you won't even get a cup of tea.

515
00:26:47,287 --> 00:26:48,442
Good for you.

516
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:50,999
Good cop and bad cop.

517
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,438
You cooperate quite tacitly.
This is called good intention.

518
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:56,446
Ming.

519
00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:57,746
What did you wish for?

520
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:58,861
What else could it be?

521
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:00,777
It must be that we can win YQCB smoothly.

522
00:27:00,857 --> 00:27:04,221
And one more thing,
ZGDX will not disappear from the field.

523
00:27:04,301 --> 00:27:06,704
Bro, why are you bringing up
the same old story again?

524
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:09,092
Ming, you believe in this too?

525
00:27:09,172 --> 00:27:12,017
Sometimes we do need some luck.

526
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,700
You have proven yourselves to be the
best professional players in the world.

527
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,868
Next, just like what Rui said,
we still need a little bit of luck.

528
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:21,937
As long as we stay together,
all our wishes will definitely come true.

529
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,265
-Yes.
-Yes, come on.

530
00:27:24,187 --> 00:27:25,234
Come on.

531
00:27:25,314 --> 00:27:26,257
Come on.

532
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:29,818
ZGDX, go for it!

533
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:32,719
Come on!

534
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,544
Go for it!

535
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,199
This person likes to hide in here.

536
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,326
So we must be careful in the fight.

537
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:55,451
And I practiced these shikigamis
by watching the video of Tong Yao.

538
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:57,532
Hierophant is back.

539
00:28:03,741 --> 00:28:06,063
Why did Hierophant clip
so many dolls today?

540
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,853
Does it represent the
level of tension in his heart?

541
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:11,251
So many.

542
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:14,950
Will he give them
to the fans in the finals?

543
00:28:16,151 --> 00:28:17,337
Hierophant.

544
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:21,270
We've just studied
all of ZGDX's national tournaments...

545
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,312
and summarized the habits of
their Double Carry players.

546
00:28:23,392 --> 00:28:24,803
Do you want to take a look?

547
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:28,981
Hierophant.

548
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:37,882
-What's wrong with him?
-What's wrong?

549
00:28:37,962 --> 00:28:39,530
He doesn't look good since the fight.

550
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,334
Yeah, he's been sullen.

551
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,373
Did something happen to him?

552
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:47,560
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

553
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,813
Liang Sheng.

554
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,115
My palms are sweating.

555
00:28:52,624 --> 00:28:54,570
My heart is beating a little fast.

556
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:56,651
What's wrong with me?

557
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:57,937
You're nervous.

558
00:28:58,766 --> 00:28:59,993
I'm nervous?

559
00:29:00,402 --> 00:29:01,482
It's normal.

560
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:03,519
Have a Coke to calm yourself down.

561
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:10,436
I never get nervous
before I play a game.

562
00:29:11,326 --> 00:29:12,552
Think about it.

563
00:29:12,632 --> 00:29:15,130
The national finals are around the corner.

564
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,443
And it's also the final match
between you and Lu Sicheng.

565
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:21,884
I think you should be nervous.

566
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:31,449
I'm already 26 years old this year.

567
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,128
So?

568
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:36,457
So, before coming to China,

569
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:39,770
I didn't think of it
as a real battlefield.

570
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:45,462
I just wanted to make the last part
of my career comfortable.

571
00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:48,027
And then what?

572
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,878
I don't know.

573
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:54,682
Maybe I didn't expect it to be so hard.

574
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:57,481
You made me…

575
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,647
What's that saying?

576
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:03,796
You guys have broadened my horizon.

577
00:30:04,197 --> 00:30:05,311
-Sometimes.
-Broadened his horizon?

578
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:06,462
He's complimenting us.

579
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:09,812
I may have made some decisions
only to defeat Chessman.

580
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:11,994
But you'd still treat me,

581
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:14,974
you'd still trust me…

582
00:30:15,695 --> 00:30:16,633
Absolutely trust.

583
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:18,101
That's right. That's it.

584
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:19,165
That's for sure.

585
00:30:19,255 --> 00:30:21,856
-You're indeed a good player.
-That's right, buddy.

586
00:30:21,936 --> 00:30:26,756
So you guys made me think
we have a chance to go to a bigger stage.

587
00:30:26,836 --> 00:30:29,618
Even though we're only a relegation team,
we've come a long way...

588
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:31,175
to the national finals.

589
00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:32,347
Nothing is impossible.

590
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:33,707
Yes, it's for the dream.

591
00:30:33,787 --> 00:30:35,880
Buddy, I want to go with you
to the World Championship.

592
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,866
Well.

593
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:39,000
Let's take the first place in the country.

594
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,331
-Come on.
-Okay.

595
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:42,867
YQCB.

596
00:30:42,947 --> 00:30:44,774
What a bunch of losers!

597
00:30:44,854 --> 00:30:46,022
What are you guys doing? Come on.

598
00:30:46,102 --> 00:30:48,033
-Let's do it again!
-Three, two, one.

599
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:49,499
YQCB.

600
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:51,294
Stay together to dominate!

601
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,317
-Come on.
-Come on, come on!

602
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:55,761
Go!

603
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:57,831
-Go!
-Go!

604
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:02,589
Here.

605
00:31:07,191 --> 00:31:09,232
Have you thought of any other wishes?

606
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:12,377
World peace.

607
00:31:12,457 --> 00:31:13,990
Don't be so corny!

608
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:18,510
I wish we could win the championship.

609
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,823
No more?

610
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:23,334
Not just the national champion,
but also the world champion.

611
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:24,632
That's all?

612
00:31:26,528 --> 00:31:28,488
You're really not going to tell me?

613
00:31:28,568 --> 00:31:30,621
Wishes don't work if you say them.

614
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:32,228
I don't believe in it.

615
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,426
Other than myself,
who else can control my destiny?

616
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:42,161
Our future only belongs to
my heart and yours.

617
00:31:44,855 --> 00:31:46,237
What about you?

618
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:53,311
If you're asking me what I wish for,

619
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:57,961
I wish I could be by your side
for the rest of my life.

Ladies and gentlemen.

651
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:48,067
Welcome to the scene of national finals
of Onmyoji Arena Pro League in 2020.

652
00:33:48,147 --> 00:33:51,575
Today is a battle of the strongest, a
narrow encounter between Light and Shadow.

653
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,288
ZGDX and YQCB,

654
00:33:53,368 --> 00:33:55,743
these two super teams love each other
and fight with each other,

655
00:33:55,823 --> 00:33:57,732
which team will win?

656
00:33:57,812 --> 00:33:59,943
Let's wait and see!

657
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:05,412
ZGDX is a starry team,

658
00:34:05,492 --> 00:34:08,442
a team dressed with thorns
and stepped on blazing sands.

659
00:34:08,522 --> 00:34:10,531
It's a team that
]had a rough time at the top...

660
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:12,074
and finally got back to the top.

661
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:13,473
The team that climbed back to the top.

662
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:17,194
YQCB is a dark horse team that
once fell to the relegation-avoidance.

663
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:20,673
With the arrival of Hierophant,
YQCB, whose potential has been stimulated,

664
00:34:20,753 --> 00:34:24,025
has been soaring finally to
the stage of the national finals...

665
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:27,236
for the highest honor
in Onmyoji Arena Pro League.

666
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,744
All right, the live audience!

667
00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:32,491
Let's count down together
to welcome their arrival!

668
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,643
Come on.

669

Ten.

670
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,581
Nine.

00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:43,390

00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:46,829

At this moment,
