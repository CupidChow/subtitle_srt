1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,390
Want to try it?

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,772
Try what?

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,125
Me.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,203
Do you want to try it too, Cheng?

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,061
I already have someone I like.

6
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:35,145
My mind has collapsed!!!

7
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:36,157
What?

8
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,037
You're coming to Shenzhen?
What are you going to do in Shenzhen?

9
00:00:38,117 --> 00:00:39,220
Don't scare her.

10
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:43,999
Five million yuan.

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,035
(Check five million yuan)

12
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:46,444
Leave my son.

13
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,580
=Falling into Your Smile=

14
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,520
=Episode 25=.

15
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,533
That's it.

16
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,950
-You guys walk out first.
-Okay.

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,950
Okay, okay, okay. Come on, Mr. Li.

18
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:03,853
You two wait a minute.

19
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,300
Sit down.

20
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,735
There are no other people here.

21
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,406
You let me know the fact
you're in a relationship...

22
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:26,974
from the Internet.

23
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:28,621
Do you think that's appropriate?

24
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:30,128
Mom.

25
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,597
I've told you many times.
You don't have to come over.

26
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:33,963
I don't have to.

27
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,815
If I don't come over,

28
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:39,563
are you going to make all
your life decisions on your own?

29
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,105
You didn't even ask me
or your father about it.

30
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:43,408
I've been an adult for a long time.

31
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:44,650
So what?

32
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,147
You're still my son.

33
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:49,002
Besides,

34
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,151
I can't even see you
since you have a girlfriend?

35
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,132
Tong Yao.

36
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:56,808
Do you think it's appropriate for him
to do so?

37
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:06,150
Mom. I like her.

38
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,882
No one can change this.

39
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:14,214
Yeah, right.

40
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,621
It's really your own business
to decide who you like...

41
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:18,529
and who you want to be with.

42
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,580
You don't need to consult us
for suggestions.

43
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:24,844
But
I've seen this situation on the Internet.

44
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:29,926
It's bound to be a bumpy road
ahead for you two.

45
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,422
Mom, don't worry.

46
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:34,950
No matter what happens in the future,

47
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,719
I will face it together with her.

48
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,388
ZGDX Announcement.

49
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:59,959
ZGDX e-Sports Club Members
Lu Sicheng and Tong Yao,

50
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,706
are currently in a relationship.

51
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:07,293
Thank you all for your longtime attention
and support to both players and ZGDX.

52
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,654
The club adheres to the principles
of free and open management.

53
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,728
-When did they get together?
-With ensuring the team's training...

54
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:15,751
and game results as the premise,
the club won't interfere too much with...

55
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:17,226
the personal relationships
between members.

56
00:04:17,306 --> 00:04:20,454
The club staff
has sent their best wishes...

57
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:22,581
about the romance between the two members.

58
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,166
As for the alleged infringement of...

59
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:26,931
Lu Sicheng and Tong Yao's
reputation rights on the internet,

60
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,035
the club will continue
to pay attention to it...

61
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:31,382
and reserve the right to pursue the
legal responsibility of the publishers...

62
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:33,069
and those who reproduce them.

63
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:34,813
In response to some of
the allegedly verbal infringing of...

64
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:36,391
their personal safety,

65
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:39,190
the club will take all
necessary legal means...

66
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,850
to pursue the legal responsibility
of the publishers.

67
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,374
We will not tolerate.

68
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:44,482
Once again,
we thank all the media and fans...

69
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:47,354
for your concern,
tolerance and love of all time.

70
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:50,010
On behalf of Mr. Lu Sicheng
and Ms. Tong Yao,

71
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,156
we would like to express
our deepest apologies...

72
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:54,965
for the waste of social resources
caused by the private issue before.

73
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:56,224
We would also like to call on everyone...

74
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:58,447
to take advantage
of this and work together...

75
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:00,013
to build a good online environment.

76
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:07,375
Seriously,
our official blogger is really cool.

77
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,120
She almost wishes you two a hundred
years of happiness and a baby soon.

78
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,406
You two.

79
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,457
Aren't you going to quit sugar?

80
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,855
No, I'm upset.

81
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:24,161
What are you upset about?

82
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:26,700
I've done something wrong.

83
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:29,304
I'm afraid that
I was too impulsive this time.

84
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:30,904
I didn't think about the consequences.

85
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:32,603
What consequences?

86
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:34,862
About...

87
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:37,548
what you have to face.

88
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:40,467
If you are afraid...

89
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:43,041
I'll be beaten down
by all that talk on the Internet,

90
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:44,760
you don't have to.

91
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,969
I'm fine.

92
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:56,812
Actually, I was a little scared at first.

93
00:05:57,245 --> 00:05:58,780
I always felt that if we made it public,

94
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,565
there would be a lot of
opposition and questioning.

95
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:03,566
So I worried a lot.

96
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:07,543
But I was more afraid
that it would affect you.

97
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:10,501
Just like Jian Yang did before.

98
00:06:11,397 --> 00:06:13,555
You'd begin to regret us being together.

99
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:16,301
Then there comes all the lies, deception.

100
00:06:16,381 --> 00:06:17,947
And we'd finally drift apart.

101
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:21,307
But then...

102
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:23,522
Then what?

103
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:27,778
Then I realized
you and Jian Yang are different.

104
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:30,323
So none of these things will happen.

105
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:32,309
I was relieved.

106
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,067
I'm also well-prepared mentally
to meet all the coming wild storms.

107
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,308
I have no regrets,

108
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:40,982
nor am I afraid.

109
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:42,778
You are so strong.

110
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:45,242
I have to become as strong as you are.

111
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:53,220
My Shorty's grown up.

112
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:54,826
I thought you'd be so scared...

113
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:57,121
that you'd hide
under the covers and cry all night.

114
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:06,921
(17 km from the destination)

115
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:08,185
It's still so far.

116
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:09,912
Oh, my God.

117
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:11,890
I didn't expect us to see
their public display of affection...

118
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,271
even in a cab.

119
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,805
It makes us so jealous,

120
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:19,202
right, Mr. Driver?

121
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:38,179
Captain.

122
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,759
Well. Tong Yao is on live streaming.

123
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,841
You want to watch it?

124
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,712
Tong Yao is on live streaming
at this time.

125
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:46,048
She must be crazy.

126
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,213
I don't know if she's crazy.

127
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:50,524
I think you're crazy.

128
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,371
Now I just want to focus on e-sports.

129
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:15,435
I can't believe you're live streaming.

130
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:17,769
Warning, a large number of
keyboard worriers ahead.

131
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:19,268
How dare you open a live streaming?

132
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:20,679
Do you want to attract more followers...

133
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,886
since you've been getting
a lot of buzz lately?

134
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,179
-Speechless.
-Hello, Mrs. Lu.

135
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,669
I've started live streaming.

136
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:26,059
Now I'm playing ranking training.

137
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,613
How can I not take advantage of it
to make up time for my live streaming?

138
00:08:28,693 --> 00:08:30,469
Why am I shameless
just because I did a live streaming?

139
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:31,829
I used to do live streaming too.

140
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:35,014
If I don't do it today,

141
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:37,179
and at the end of the month
my live time is not enough,

142
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,512
I can only make my sleep live for you.

143
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:40,753
-Sleep with Lu Sicheng?
-Dirty. I'm calling the police.

144
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,516
Tell us about Cheng.

145
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:43,616
What about him?

146
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:46,020
Cheng is really a very good shooter.

147
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:48,912
He is now ranked in the top three
in the world.

148
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:51,842
This shooter is probably
sleeping right now.

149
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,516
After all, he took my hand
and forced me to swear...

150
00:08:54,596 --> 00:08:58,533
we'd be together in the future
in front of his parent this morning.

151
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:02,082
I'm sorry. I'm showing off again.

152
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:03,429
Sorry.

153
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:08,987
-You're provocative!
-You're showing off.

154
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:10,803
Nice job.

155
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,232
Cheng is only in the top three?

156
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:13,407
Yes, the top three.

157
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,543
I can't say number one, right?

158
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,531
After all, there's another shooter
who's about the same level as him...

159
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:18,901
living next door.

160
00:09:19,356 --> 00:09:21,316
Do you know how to get to the point?

161
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:23,022
So when will you break up?

162
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:25,170
Break up?

163
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,375
I found my boyfriend on my own merit.
Why should I break up with him?

164
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:40,706
You've fallen in love
and become weaker too.

165
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:42,641
You've rarely been killed solo
on the lane before.

166
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,841
Waiting for ZGDX to be ruined.
You're not good at playing Aoandou.

167
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:47,364
I think the same way.

168
00:09:47,444 --> 00:09:49,816
But I see that the South Korean people
are very good at playing Aoandou.

169
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:51,425
That's why I have to practice it.

170
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:53,726
Otherwise, if we become inferior
in the World Championships.

171
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:56,528
One less ban position would be wasted,
if I now practice one more shikigami.

172
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:57,796
Isn't that good?

173
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:00,672
Where's Cheng? Is Cheng up yet?

174
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:02,052
Tell him to come on air.

175
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:03,823
Our captain should be up by now.

176
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,562
Our captain, ours...

177
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:09,039
The smell of PDA,
single people abuse, unsubscribe.

178
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:14,893
Cheng's here!

179
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:16,323
Where do I rank?

180
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,963
Childish.

181
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:19,924
You are not childish.

182
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,072
The Aoandou with one kill,
six deaths, five assists.

183
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:27,749
I'll blow your head off
if you dare to take it to the game.

184
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:29,431
I'm just practicing.

185
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:30,471
Go away!

186
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:32,002
I've seen Tai use Aoandou.

187
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:33,240
It's not the way you use it.

188
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,302
Come on, let me demonstrate.

189
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:40,233
You're a shooter.

190
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:42,230
How can you teach me to play midsolo?

191
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,116
Let me try.

192
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:46,391
Don't shake me.

193
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:51,058
Now the middle lane soldiers
are in the turret. Don't go up yet.

194
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:52,500
It is because you dare not go up,

195
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,580
the opposing midsolo Marisha Ray
keeps containing you.

196
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,437
Do they know that someone else
is operating?

197
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:01,351
Be careful!

198
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:03,411
Quiet. Otherwise, I won't help you.

199
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,892
All right, you go away.

200
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:09,474
Go away, go away, go away.

201
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:10,663
No.

202
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:15,007
I'm on the live streaming.

203
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:16,183
I know.

204
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:19,549
Terrific.

205
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:20,832
Next week you're playing against Alpha.

206
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:22,816
Wait to see your true skills.

207
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:24,176
Wait for your failure.

208
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:25,550
I'm tired of saying I'm envy.

209
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,156
I'm sorry I can't help but smiling.

210
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:29,568
I hope you guys can still be this good
next week against Alpha.

211
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,358
(ZGDX vs. Alpha)

212
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:44,605
The strength of a veteran team like Alpha
is really not to be underestimated.

213
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,163
It's amazing that they made ZGDX,

214
00:11:46,243 --> 00:11:49,448
who had a good run in the National
League before lose the opening match.

215
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:50,818
In the last match,

216
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:53,578
ZGDX's Cat and K
didn't work well together.

217
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:55,259
It was like it was their
first time working together.

218
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,769
Cat was constantly ganked
in the last game...

219
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,449
while K was still
in the jungle and ignored him.

220
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:02,651
Today, ZGDX's topsolo and jungler seem
to be old enemies.

221
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:03,729
That's right.

222
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:06,077
I wonder if it's due to external factors.

223
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,211
-We've been doing well today, hold on.
-Play well.

224
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,201
We have to take it.

225
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,613
The score is now zero to one.

226
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:13,518
ZGDX still seems to be in low morale
in this game.

227
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,709
Alpha is known as testing
the true skills of capable teams.

228
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:20,564
Is ZGDX really competent or is it kept
bumping into superior games before?

229
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:23,602
There will be an intuitive answer
after this game.

230
00:12:23,682 --> 00:12:26,389
ZGDX may have been good before.

231
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:28,322
Now Double Carry players
are obsessed with love.

232
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:29,682
How can they think about playing the game?

233
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:30,895
It's true.

234
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:39,463
Over the turret.

235
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:40,809
Coming, here we go.

236
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:49,997
Look, the game has just started.
Cat has already died twice.

237
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:52,139
He made himself killed twice in a row.

238
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:53,772
-Nice.
-Good job!

239
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,307
The opponent's midsolo
and jungler keep ganking Cat.

240
00:12:57,387 --> 00:12:59,182
Chubby, let's get cracking on
developing ourselves in the lower lane.

241
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:00,179
Okay.

242
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:04,011
Their topsolo is easy to gank.

243
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:05,301
Yes, yes. Come on.

244
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:07,215
Wait for me, I'll be right there.

245
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:10,590
Looks like Alpha's Aoandou
and Ibaraki Douji...

246
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,536
are going to outflank
Cat's way back to the turret.

247
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:15,300
The duo in lower lane have also arrived.

248
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,578
K is still in the lower
half of the jungle.

249
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:17,576
He was going to go there.

250
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:19,795
But when he saw there were four opponents
and Cat had also little blood left,

251
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,431
he turned around into the jungle again.

252
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:23,929
It's over, Cat is dead again.

253
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:25,561
Four to one.

254
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:28,480
Isolated, the topsolo has collapsed.

255
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,889
Are these four people playing mahjong?
Where is my teammate?

256
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,438
K came halfway and ran away.

257
00:13:34,518 --> 00:13:37,346
If he came there at that time,
he could do nothing but get killed too.

258
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:38,345
There was no point.

259
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:39,664
Hurry up, this game is ruined.

260
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:41,611
Hold on, we may turn the table.

261
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:42,712
Cat, you develop first.

262
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:43,877
Don't fight with them.

263
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,471
You can come to my lane to take the line.

264
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:47,216
I'll go to the jungle
to see what's available.

265
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:48,472
Give him the line.

266
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:49,783
Then you take my jungle.

267
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,559
You are really the good guy.

268
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,276
What's wrong with Cheng
taking your jungle?

269
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:55,523
You haven't had enough in the jungle
since the beginning of the game?

270
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:56,746
You blame me for not ganking.

271
00:13:56,826 --> 00:13:58,762
It's useless even I came there to help you
since there were four opponents.

272
00:13:58,842 --> 00:13:59,824
When two people came,

273
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:02,101
I was in the bottom lane and you saw it.
I couldn't get through.

274
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:03,473
They even put the jungle Kirin aside.

275
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:04,717
They just wanted to screw you.

276
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:05,962
What can I do?

277
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:08,476
And your gold
has already made up from other lanes.

278
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,635
Look at the real time economy chart
after the game if you don't believe it.

279
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:11,890
Shut up.

280
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,353
Do you want to go on-hook and let
the opposite side push our middle turrets?

281
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:15,524
Pick a small team fight.

282
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,452
Coming.

283
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:17,454
Copy that.

284
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:24,043
Smiling suddenly jumped out of the grass
and hit the opponent's midsolo.

285
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:25,682
Control it, pick the fight, go.

286
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,454
-Back to the base. Retreat, midsolo.
-We'll carry.

287
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,794
So far in this game,

288
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:32,263
ZGDX's topsolo has been ganked
too many times in the early stages.

289
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:33,368
I think they're looking for
another breakthrough.

290
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:35,945
But look at K, he's still in
the lower half of the jungle.

291
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,098
Look, Cat is coming.

292
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,887
He probably wants
to take the opportunity to revenge...

293
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,198
with the presence of Chessman.

294
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:42,409
-Our midsolo.
-Coming.

295
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:43,729
Should we withdraw in the middle lane?

296
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:45,657
-Give them the first turret.
-Let's go, let's go. Give it to them.

297
00:14:45,737 --> 00:14:46,605
They're pulling back.

298
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,662
Cat, stop the shooter.

299
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:48,935
We have to push this turret.

300
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:52,579
Don't pick the fight. Protect the shooter.

301
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:57,706
At the same time,
Smiling flashes into the field,

302
00:14:57,786 --> 00:14:59,786
killing the opposite shooter with a skill.
(Defeat)

303
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,240
Retreat.

304
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,858
See,

305
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,878
K and Cat used to appear in a bundle.

306
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:10,675
But today, without K,
Cat has still played fiercely.

307
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,465
Hold on, hold on. Keep a steady pace.

308
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,440
I have skills prepared.

309
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,012
Both of them failed to save Doumeki.

310
00:15:15,092 --> 00:15:16,755
Cat was the only tough one
suffering the damage.

311
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:19,189
But just now Smiling
helped him to take revenge for once.

312
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:20,460
We have caught up in gold a bit.

313
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,931
Let's each lead our own lane and develop.

314
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:24,165
-We'll team up over the Orochi later.
-Okay.

315
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:25,439
Watch out, they're all leading the lines.

316
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,607
-Save the turrets.
-Clear the lines.

317
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:27,572
Protect the turret.

318
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:28,711
Did you notice, Qiu?

319
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,259
If we say that the team fight just now...

320
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:32,124
was caused by K stealing the turret
in the bottom lane,

321
00:15:32,204 --> 00:15:33,624
now that they are developing separately,

322
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:35,716
K and Cat are still going their own way
as good friends.

323
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:36,785
It's true.

324
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:38,526
ZGDX's Double Carry players
seem to be in love...

325
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,381
while the topsolo and jungler
are in a bad mood today.

326
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:41,578
Cat, you hold off Karasu Tengu.

327
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:42,537
We'll hit the Orochi.

328
00:15:42,617 --> 00:15:43,538
Okay.

329
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:45,372
Sure enough, ZGDX's four players...

330
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:46,601
have arrived at the river
in the middle lane.

331
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:49,586
If Cat can successfully
hold off the opponent's Karasu Tengu,

332
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,866
they'll definitely get the Orochi.

333
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:51,822
That's right.

334
00:15:51,902 --> 00:15:53,783
Wait for me!
Wait for me to join the team fight.

335
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:58,899
Karasu Tengu
got rid of Cat's entanglement...

336
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:00,574
and has gone to the middle lane
to support them with a shift.

337
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:01,977
Gathering!

338
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:03,964
Why is Cat still in the bottom turret?

339
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:05,692
But Karasu Tengu came here
after refilling its blood.

340
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:07,132
Is ZGDX going to play four against five?

341
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:08,135
In one breath.

342
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:09,389
Attention, they're coming!

343
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:14,111
Cat, come and pick up the team fight!

344
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:15,872
K, find a right position and wait for Cat.

345
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:17,368
Cat is still in the bottom lane.

346
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:19,487
ZGDX has begun hitting on Orochi.

347
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:20,428
Five people of Alpha are coming.

348
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:21,472
Fight, fight.

349
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:22,554
We can win.

350
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:26,018
Facing a four to five situation,
ZGDX's lineup has been broken up.

351
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:27,395
-Kill it.
-Good, good.

352
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:28,516
Be careful with the jungler.

353
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:30,838
Although Chessman's current position
is relatively safe now,

354
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:33,041
his teammates can't take it anymore.

355
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:34,103
Chubby was killed.

356
00:16:34,183 --> 00:16:35,387
Alpha's support came too fast.

357
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:37,394
I can't take it as a support.

358
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:38,985
And it is still in the bottom lane alone.

359
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,827
Karasu Tengu blew up the three people
of ZGDX with a jump splash.

360
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:42,344
Now the Double Carry players
have been killed.

361
00:16:42,424 --> 00:16:43,774
They're definitely going to lose Orochi.

362
00:16:43,854 --> 00:16:44,879
Cat is still leading the line.

363
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,440
Unstoppable K can only hide in the
grass, watching Orochi being taken.

364
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,413
Take Orochi as soon as possible.

365
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:48,582
Be careful of the opposite
Kosodenote and Yuri Lowenthal.

366
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:49,652
Yuri Lowenthal may use Shift.

367
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:52,984
Alpha is already going to
start hitting Orochi.

368
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:55,957
K can't do anything
but ambush near the grass.

369
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:57,938
K went in and reclaimed Orochi.

370
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,035
-Can he make it?
-K was killed.

371
00:17:00,115 --> 00:17:01,244
He was killed in a flash.

372
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:03,124
What are you doing?

373
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:04,549
Can't even hold off Karasu Tengu.

374
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:06,025
You can't see what equipment I have?

375
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:07,320
You can't blame me
for the losing of Orochi.

376
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,312
You're to blame.

377
00:17:08,392 --> 00:17:10,153
Karasu Tengu can use Shift, why can't you?

378
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:12,094
I had little blood left.
Did I have to get myself killed?

379
00:17:12,174 --> 00:17:13,545
You two stop arguing first.

380
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,392
Go on, guard the turrets.

381
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:17,888
-Watch out for the base.
-Look over here.

382
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:19,773
Cat is leading the line
to the base turret.

383
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:21,242
Destroyed
But Alpha is also quite nimble.

384
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:22,408
Go back to the base
to guard the base turret.

385
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:23,449
Back to the base turret!

386
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:25,389
Back to defense. (Successfully sealed)

387
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:26,898
Yuri Lowenthal failed to
steal the turret with the line.

388
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:28,659
He had to turn around and go home.

389
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:33,082
ZGDX's topsolo got killed
so many times in the early stage.

390
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:34,240
Look at the data chart.

391
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,645
He only assisted twice.

392
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:37,137
And he lags far behind in gold.

393
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:38,705
They also lost Orochi at this time.

394
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,515
If ZGDX doesn't change its tactics,
it's going to be hard for them to play.

395
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:42,535
Alpha is definitely going to...

396
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:43,655
take advantage of the situation
to destroy their base turret.

397
00:17:43,735 --> 00:17:45,187
After a few team fights today,

398
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:47,589
I feel that ZGDX is already a bit loose.

399
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:49,914
-The players may have collapsed.
-Yes.

400
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:53,075
If Alpha forces to fight at this time,
it'll be highly possible that they win.

401
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,471
It's coming, it's coming.

402
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,949
K wanted to go around the back
to gank Alpha's back row.

403
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:01,235
But he was controlled.

404
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:02,767
Cat is in.

405
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:05,197
What's the point of coming in now?
K is already dead.

406
00:18:05,277 --> 00:18:06,621
Cat has become a solo fighter.

407
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:07,882
Defense turret requires support
He came in after K was dead.

408
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,385
Double Kill This is too late.

409
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:10,615
Let's go.

410
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:11,732
Alpha is coming up here!

411
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:13,270
They're about to push it
all the way to the base.

412
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,555
Support needed for our junction
Can Smiling and the others still hold it?

413
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,311
-Come on, control him.
-Hold on, hold on!

414
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:18,106
No front row, no front row!

415
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:19,700
Clear the soldier line.

416
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,786
Has been completely exposed to
the opponent's damage.

417
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,630
-Clear the soldier line!
-I'll take it, I'll take it.

418
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,650
It's because of infighting
between the good friends K and Cat.

419
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,547
There is no cooperation at all.

420
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:29,464
Chessman and Smiling refilled their blood.

421
00:18:29,544 --> 00:18:31,898
But Cat has sacrificed.
There is no front row.

422
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,771
Alpha's Doumeki has been hitting base.

423
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,735
So far in this game,

424
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,479
it's already very difficult for ZGDX
to play for losing the top turrets.

425
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,961
Alpha, Alpha is on!

426
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,257
Alpha is hitting the base like crazy.

427
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:45,544
The base was destroyed.

428
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,346
With the sound of the base explosion,

429
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:55,894
ZGDX receives
their first defeat in the national league.

430
00:18:55,974 --> 00:18:59,072
Congratulations to Alpha
for winning the game!

431
00:18:59,152 --> 00:19:00,136
Congratulations to Alpha!

432
00:19:00,216 --> 00:19:05,428
So after this game, I've thought of
some criticism ZGDX has been received.

433
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:09,045
Do you mean that ZGDX would
suffer a decline in fighting ability...

434
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:14,323
and be trapped in adversity with the
Double Carry players in a relationship?

435
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:16,468
What's wrong?

436
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:20,463
Thinking of the phrase "Great failure".

437
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:27,608
You're back?

438
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:33,456
We were not in good morale.

439
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:36,551
It's normal to lose
to an old team like Alpha. It's okay.

440
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:37,492
Keep up the spirit.

441
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:38,689
Yeah.

442
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:41,849
Next week's match against FNC
will be a tough one.

443
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:43,296
Let's learn from our mistakes.

444
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:45,794
And YQCB are not
to be underestimated either.

445
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,671
The team next door is really capable now.

446
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:50,925
Since Hierophant joined the team,
the whole team's style has changed.

447
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:52,405
It's like a catalyst.

448
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:56,284
Even their captain's support has become
the previous support god of seat match.

449
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:58,314
Fierce and aggressive.

450
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,865
If they take advantage of the opportunity,

451
00:20:00,945 --> 00:20:02,918
the opponent can scarcely turn around.

452
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,538
If we don't want to lose the next game,

453
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:08,236
it depends on whether our jungler
cares about the topsolo.

454
00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:11,412
That also depends on whether our topsolo
will play around...

455
00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:12,802
when gold is fallen behind.

456
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:21,799
With such a mentality,
we may lose the game again.

457
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:45,218
Oh, my God!

458
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:47,061
K's eyes are so scary.

459
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:48,326
I'm scared.

460
00:20:48,634 --> 00:20:49,648
Scared of what?

461
00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:55,673
It's screwed.

462
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:58,618
Our topsolo and jungler
are having a breakup.

463
00:20:58,698 --> 00:20:59,722
What?

464
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:02,211
Cat and K.

465
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:04,276
They are having a childish tantrum.

466
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:07,356
Someone needs to take the willow and
beat them up to make them well-behaved.

467
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,883
Actually, I advocate education of love.

468
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:13,718
Really?

469
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:45,879
K just changed
the everlasting name of his live studio.

470
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:49,174
It's used to be "Losing points
double-queued with Princess Cat".

471
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,819
No way!

472
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:54,858
Is the relationship breakdown drama
over yet?

473
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,337
The new princess is about to take office.

474
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:59,453
Choose me, choose me.

475
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:02,087
Is this guy not at the base?

476
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:06,575
These fans are too good at taking
the public opinion to the wrong way.

477
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:08,599
Are you going to kill your K?

478
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:09,670
Are you?

479
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:12,688
You just want it to be worse, right?

480
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:14,475
And you even laugh like this?

481
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:18,765
The on-lookers are eager to
fan the flames.

482
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,314
I'm tired. I'm offline.

483
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:37,033
They can't be serious this time, can they?

484
00:22:49,058 --> 00:22:50,821
Are you ready to go to bed?

485
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:52,457
I'll talk to you on the phone later.

486
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:54,487
What?

487
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,939
I say...

488
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:02,480
What can I do for you?

489
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:06,024
I came to talk to you about K and Cat.

490
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:08,732
They don't look so good after leaving...

491
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:11,095
the gaming field.

492
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,592
Go on.

493
00:23:13,137 --> 00:23:15,782
K doesn't even double-queue
with Cat anymore.

494
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:18,448
And it's already 11:00.

495
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,069
Cat is missing too.

496
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,247
It's 11:00.

497
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:24,017
Do you want to sleep at my place tonight?

498
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,465
Lu Sicheng,
I'm talking something serious with you.

499
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:31,480
They were talking about Cat
in the live streaming.

500
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,571
K just shut down the live streaming
and left.

501
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:34,853
He looked pretty mad.

502
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:39,745
So?

503
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:41,761
Tomorrow,
there is a training match with CK.

504
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:44,047
How can they play tomorrow like this?

505
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:45,850
You are the captain, don't you care?

506
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,047
You're thinking too much.

507
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:48,889
Being ganked in the game
is already irritating.

508
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,123
They are not children.

509
00:23:50,203 --> 00:23:51,633
They'll be fine after a while.

510
00:23:51,713 --> 00:23:53,490
Remember what you said today.

511
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,724
What did I say?

512
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:58,017
If we lose the training game tomorrow
because of them,

513
00:23:58,097 --> 00:23:59,361
don't nag about it.

514
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:00,469
I...

515
00:24:03,783 --> 00:24:05,952
Then you go tell K and Cat later...

516
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:07,951
that if they lose
tomorrow's training match,

517
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,846
they may be banned from the game.

518
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,121
Tell them I said it.

519
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,765
What's the point
of threatening people with a ban?

520
00:24:13,845 --> 00:24:17,314
Either you don't care
or you use this way?

521
00:24:17,394 --> 00:24:18,663
Go deal with it yourself.

522
00:24:18,743 --> 00:24:21,072
I won't tell them this.

523
00:24:21,152 --> 00:24:22,538
What do you want me to say?

524
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:25,386
To teach with love.

525
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:26,494
They are not you.

526
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:29,034
You haven't given me love either.

527
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,133
If it's love
when you stand at my back...

528
00:24:33,213 --> 00:24:35,124
while I'm playing in the ranking,

529
00:24:35,204 --> 00:24:37,195
saying I'm not doing it right,

530
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,735
and I'm like a handicapped person
with weird equipment,

531
00:24:38,815 --> 00:24:42,535
I have to wonder do you even know
the correct meaning of the word "love"?

532
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:45,359
Why should I know
the correct meaning of the word "love"?

533
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:47,258
I don't need to do these as a captain.

534
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,602
I'll go say it myself.

535
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,168
Cat.

536
00:25:39,614 --> 00:25:41,040
Go to sleep in your room.

537
00:25:43,353 --> 00:25:44,825
I want to sleep here.

538
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:46,209
It's not worth it.

539
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:47,580
Can't you guys just talk?

540
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,858
I have nothing to talk about with him.

541
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:53,405
I'm really worried.

542
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,361
Explain.

543
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:20,422
Me? Explain what?

544
00:26:20,502 --> 00:26:23,111
I was contained on the top lane.
I couldn't go anywhere.

545
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:26,227
Besides, I made up for the loss of gold
on other lanes.

546
00:26:26,307 --> 00:26:28,202
Look at the real time gold distribution
chart if you don't believe me.

547
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:29,991
At 20 minutes into the game,

548
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:31,654
the rate of participation
in the team fight was only 11.7 percent...

549
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:33,658
as a topsolo.

550
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:36,614
The damage you did to the enemy shikigamis
was just 12,000,

551
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:38,929
only 2,000 more than the support did.

552
00:26:39,735 --> 00:26:41,739
From 12 minutes and 18 seconds onwards,

553
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:43,936
there were seven major
and minor team fights,

554
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:45,147
in which you only came once.

555
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:48,990
That's when K was not there
and also our only victory.

556
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:52,784
By the data of your
zero kills, six deaths and two assists,

557
00:26:52,864 --> 00:26:55,315
you were like sleepwalking the whole game.

558
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:57,504
Except for the team participation rate
and kill statistics,

559
00:26:57,584 --> 00:27:01,268
there are no data records
about the team fights...

560
00:27:01,348 --> 00:27:03,182
and who was there and
who wasn't when Cat was present.

561
00:27:03,262 --> 00:27:05,661
This is all marked by Lu Sicheng's brain.

562
00:27:05,741 --> 00:27:07,511
What a wondrous brain.

563
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:10,752
As expected of a Scorpio,
he's so vindictive.

564
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:13,134
It's not that
I couldn't hold off the team fights.

565
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,664
It's that I wasn't right equipped.

566
00:27:14,744 --> 00:27:16,007
I was economically
far behind the opposite side.

567
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:17,771
My skills were indifferent to them.

568
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:19,603
During the team fight over the Orochi,

569
00:27:19,683 --> 00:27:22,776
K blindly went to the face
of the opposite midsolo and jungler.

570
00:27:22,856 --> 00:27:24,268
If you came there first with Shift,

571
00:27:24,348 --> 00:27:26,166
you'd have arrived at the same time
with the opposite topsolo.

572
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:28,327
You also would have had enough time
to delay the other side...

573
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:31,849
and wait until K's refreshed
skills killed the midsolo instead.

574
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:33,052
But what was the result?

575
00:27:33,132 --> 00:27:34,277
You didn't come.

576
00:27:34,357 --> 00:27:38,822
And K, why didn't you support Cat in time
at the critical moment as a jungler?

577
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:40,133
What were you thinking?

578
00:27:40,213 --> 00:27:42,425
It was like three or four people
on the other side lived in the top lane.

579
00:27:42,505 --> 00:27:43,600
I could only be killed there.

580
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,956
Wasn't Tong Yao there for you?
Would she watch you die?

581
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:53,357
It doesn't matter
if we win or lose a game.

582
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:54,535
I can accept it.

583
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:57,797
We lost to CK in the Spring Finals.

584
00:27:57,877 --> 00:27:58,961
Did we say anything?

585
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,623
But if you don't want to play the game,

586
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:03,291
or if you play the game
with an infighting mentality,

587
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:04,862
I think you can drop it.

588
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:10,392
What are you doing?

589
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:12,690
Don't get angry. Talk properly.

590
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,234
Think about it yourselves.

591
00:29:04,293 --> 00:29:06,243
Just protect them like this.

592
00:29:06,334 --> 00:29:08,548
What kind of crazy alias
did you get for me?

593
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:12,588
Lu Yue changed it.

594
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,279
It doesn't seem to be wrong.

595
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:16,816
It's not wrong?

596
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:20,343
This name was changed to remind
your countless pursuers...

597
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:21,745
not to act rashly.

598
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:24,823
You're the only one.

599
00:29:27,918 --> 00:29:34,078
(I want to bond with you)

600
00:29:35,718 --> 00:29:37,181
All right?

601
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:38,896
You're being unreasonable.

602
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:40,935
How is it?

603
00:29:41,015 --> 00:29:42,582
How about this name?

604
00:29:42,662 --> 00:29:44,091
There is the second half.

605
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:46,194
Untie the clothes.

606
00:29:46,274 --> 00:29:47,670
Enter the bridal chamber.

607
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,755
Bastard!

608
00:29:52,727 --> 00:29:54,281
I came to talk to you
about the serious thing.

609
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:55,724
You interrupted me first.

610
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:58,212
I told you not to protect
those two kids in the team.

611
00:29:58,292 --> 00:30:00,347
If you don't hold their heads down
and make them admit their mistakes,

612
00:30:00,427 --> 00:30:01,889
they will continue to argue.

613
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:05,546
I was just analyzing it with you
about the education of love.

614
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:07,762
I was afraid that you'd say
those words to ban them...

615
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:09,518
and stimulate their rebellion.

616
00:30:09,598 --> 00:30:12,650
I told you to treat teammates with love.

617
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,280
You have to teach with love.

618
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:16,621
If they'll still be like this
in the next game,

619
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:18,048
are you really going to ignore it?

620
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:19,114
Don't worry.

621
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,795
They'll be fine next time.

622
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:21,925
How do you know?

623
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:23,300
Because I'm the captain.

624
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,409
As long as I can, they can.

625
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:27,497
Give them one night
to regulate themselves.

626
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:31,036
And if there's any more of this shit
in the game after this,

627
00:30:31,116 --> 00:30:34,628
you'll see
what your provoked captain is like.

628
00:30:36,765 --> 00:30:37,981
Dictator.

629
00:30:38,061 --> 00:30:39,244
No.

630
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:41,112
Take the mess you're in charge.

631
00:30:41,192 --> 00:30:42,327
Or you'll be scolded too.

632
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,354
I didn't take over any mess.

633
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:46,518
Captain,
when you were analyzing with them,

634
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:48,991
I saw your handsome face close,

635
00:30:49,071 --> 00:30:51,023
thinking, "My man is so handsome."

636
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:52,367
I really want to kiss you.

637
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:53,702
It's too late.

638
00:30:53,782 --> 00:30:55,566
Come on, I'll cut the back row.

639
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,950
Give them a mirror to look at.

640
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,032
They'll probably have
a deep understanding...

641
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:27,963
of guilty conscience from now on.

642
00:31:38,284 --> 00:31:40,617
K, are you single-queued?

643
00:31:41,745 --> 00:31:42,654
Are you hungry?

644
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,703
Should I let Cat get you something to eat?

645
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,247
Cat, K said he wanted to
double-queue with you.

646
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:05,309
Really?

647
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:07,105
Really. Hurry up!

648
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:08,283
Go!

649
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:15,904
Stupid topsolo.

650
00:32:15,985 --> 00:32:18,920
Chose an output-typed shikigami
with less output than the support's.

651
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,483
He's not at all...

652
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,140
Cat wants to double-queue with you.

653
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,356
Let him.

654
00:32:30,438 --> 00:32:32,341
(Data)

655
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:33,508
(Lord of Kyoto)

656
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:40,476
Double-queue?

657
00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:03,120
K.

658
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,587
You have to go help Cat.

659
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,195
It looks like a set-up.

660
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,266
Come on, come on.

661
00:33:08,346 --> 00:33:09,644
I'm going to help Cat in the top lane.

662
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:11,471
If I don't help Cat, who will help Cat?

663
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:13,335
I don't want to be blamed later.

664
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,336
Blame you, I don't dare to blame you.

665
00:33:19,057 --> 00:33:19,984
Cat.

666
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,253
K is here.

667
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,222
Quick, go help him take the damage.

668
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,140
Okay, I got it.

669
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,471
Help him take it. Go.

670
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:28,111
Go! Cat cuts back!

671
00:33:30,247 --> 00:33:32,302
Isn't that the end of this fight?

672
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:34,122
This is good.

673
00:33:34,202 --> 00:33:35,830
The game is over, isn't it?

674
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,065
You two are a perfect combination,
a perfect match.

675
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:40,692
That's enough.

676
00:33:40,772 --> 00:33:42,489
I'm not playing anymore. I'm hungry.

677
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:44,232
I haven't eaten anything all day.

678
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:47,135
I'll treat you
to your favorite roast pork.

679
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:48,358
Let's go then.

680
00:33:48,438 --> 00:33:51,566
We can buy some of
the delicious duck neck by the way.

681
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:52,597
Okay, let's go.

682
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:54,485
Let's go, Tong Yao, are you going?

683
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:57,034
I'm not. You two go.

684
00:33:57,114 --> 00:33:58,858
-Okay, we're leaving.
-Let's go.

685
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,506
What a fool.

686
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,214
Do you want to be beaten up?

687
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,167
I can do it too.

688
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:09,367
Don't you move!

689
00:34:13,837 --> 00:34:14,915
Silly pig.

690
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:16,646
The education of love is completed.

691
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:17,821
Please check on it.

692
00:34:20,471 --> 00:34:22,437
You are all cursing
the midsolo and topsolo.

693
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:25,336
Does ZGDX's Shooter
really get rid of all curse?

694
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,056
Now even Chessman is not spared.

695
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:31,118
Amazing! You guys are crazy!

696
00:34:31,198 --> 00:34:32,440
The blame is clearly divided.

697
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,580
You're not that fat support, are you?

698
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,629
Your team's midsolo is not a princess...

699
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,844
but Tong Daji,
the scourge of the country and the people.

700
00:34:38,924 --> 00:34:39,911
If you keep messing around like this,

701
00:34:39,991 --> 00:34:41,289
ZGDX will be screwed.

702
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:42,689
You've reached your hand too far.

703
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:48,283
I don't want to say
too many unpleasant words.

704
00:34:48,363 --> 00:34:50,151
You're the one who's hindering
ZGDX's path to the championship.

705
00:34:50,231 --> 00:34:51,357
Please don't add to the problem.

706
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:52,743
What are you watching?

707
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,530
Nothing.

708
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,956
It's just those posts on the internet
that are scolding us.

709
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:01,930
Why did you come in
without knocking on the door again?

710
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:03,796
What's wrong with you?

711
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:06,205
I've been kidnapped.

712
00:35:08,032 --> 00:35:09,685
Morality and conscience.

713
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,759
Didn't we agree to grow
and get stronger together?

714
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,752
Why are you so venerable now?

715
00:35:17,337 --> 00:35:19,068
I'm not venerable.

716
00:35:19,636 --> 00:35:23,326
I was just thinking
we lost the match with Alpha,

717
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:26,630
so it's normal there are those
cursing posts on the Internet.

718
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:29,759
But I'm more worried about the next game.

719
00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:31,893
If we lose,

720
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,562
I will really become the scourge
they say.

721
00:35:37,248 --> 00:35:38,493
Bullshit.

722
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:41,312
Cheng.

723
00:35:42,383 --> 00:35:45,813
Won't you feel aggrieved and regretful?

724
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:50,738
No, I won't.

725
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:53,153
I've never regretted anything.

726
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,181
You're just thinking too much.

727
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:57,021
If we had won all the finalists,

728
00:35:57,101 --> 00:35:59,127
that's what would make people
feel uneasy, right?

729
00:35:59,764 --> 00:36:01,376
But I don't want to lose.

730
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,083
I don't want to lose
even if it's a finalist.

731
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:06,355
and the following opponents
of YQCB and FNC...

732
00:36:06,435 --> 00:36:07,593
are both very capable.

733
00:36:07,673 --> 00:36:08,666
That's right.

734
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:10,493
That's why we have to adjust our mindset.

735
00:36:10,573 --> 00:36:12,459
A little bit of inattentiveness
and low morale...

736
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:14,632
can be the reasons why
we may lose the game.

737
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:16,625
But it's not going to be you.

738
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:21,884
And losing now is better than
losing in the elimination rounds...

739
00:36:21,964 --> 00:36:23,521
and the national finals, right?

740
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:26,240
Because it's really the time
when we can't afford to lose.

741
00:36:27,914 --> 00:36:29,129
Cheng.

742
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:31,407
Don't you think I've been working
so hard for the team?

743
00:36:37,092 --> 00:36:38,641
Shouldn't you give me a treat?

744
00:36:58,204 --> 00:37:00,576
We have a game tomorrow, you rascal.

745
00:37:00,656 --> 00:37:01,734
I know.

746
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,030
Don't worry.

747
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,212
We won't lose.

748
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:29,462
Okay, okay, okay.

749
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:30,703
Okay, I know.

750
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:31,647
What do you mean by that?

751
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,666
-I just took a few killings from you.
-Literally.

752
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:34,786
Guys,

753
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:36,604
as the saying goes,
one disaster after another...

754
00:37:36,684 --> 00:37:39,468
Recently, there are many bad
comments on the Internet about our team.

755
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:43,269
So the club arranged for our captain
to participate in a live gaming interview,

756
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:44,990
to save the reputation of our team.

757
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,222
Live interview?

758
00:37:46,302 --> 00:37:47,573
Cheng must participate.

759
00:37:47,653 --> 00:37:48,602
It's performance-based.

760
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,281
I'm not going.

761
00:37:52,658 --> 00:37:53,950
You can't not go to this one.

762
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,489
The sponsor of this show
is a partner of our club.

763
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:00,466
Cheng, you must cooperate with this.

764
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:03,026
Otherwise, I'm afraid Mrs. Wang
will come to talk to you again.

765
00:38:06,944 --> 00:38:08,038
Attention everyone.

766
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:10,425
Now is a critical time
to guide public opinion.

767
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:13,574
You must remain calm and wise
when you see bad comments on the Internet.

768
00:38:13,654 --> 00:38:14,643
Wise?

769
00:38:14,723 --> 00:38:16,152
Who are you talking about?

770
00:38:16,232 --> 00:38:18,162
Don't get too excited.

771
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:19,452
Remember.

772
00:38:19,532 --> 00:38:20,665
Love and peace.

773
00:38:27,735 --> 00:38:29,217
Cheng, can we start now?

774
00:38:29,713 --> 00:38:31,826
Cheng, thank you for
taking the time out of your schedule...

775
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:33,938
during the game-preparation period
to give us an interview.

776
00:38:34,018 --> 00:38:36,436
I'm also a fan of ZGDX.

777
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:39,632
So today we have chosen
several issues...

778
00:38:39,712 --> 00:38:41,122
that fans are heatedly discussing online.

779
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:42,686
We'd like to hear your opinion.

780
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:43,640
Please go ahead.

781
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,188
Has the recent loss against Alpha
had a big impact on the team?

782
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:50,731
Some people say
that Cat and K's relationship broke up.

783
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:54,740
Some people even shout the slogan
that ZGDX will soon embrace its end.

784
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,948
What do you think about this?

785
00:38:58,312 --> 00:39:01,709
There was a problem in the coordination
between Cat and K...

786
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:03,309
in the match with Alpha.

787
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:04,719
But it was just one game.

788
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:06,825
As a captain,

789
00:39:06,905 --> 00:39:10,046
my focus is on how to fix
what we did wrong...

790
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:12,510
instead of focusing on the
meaningless cursing on the internet.

791
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:16,276
Can you talk more about
the root cause of this loss?

792
00:39:16,884 --> 00:39:17,955
The root cause?

793
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:21,349
Because many fans have mentioned
although it seems to be...

794
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,770
the mistake of Cat and K,

795
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:29,413
ZGDX has had a harmonious relationship
since Ming joined in.

796
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,581
There has never been such an incident.

797
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,116
So this time does the root cause
of the team's defeat...

798
00:39:34,196 --> 00:39:37,713
have something to do
with the love affair within the team?

799
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:42,474
Would the members of the team
be affected...

800
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:44,594
because of the love affair
between you and Tong Yao?

801
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:46,304
First of all,

802
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,056
although Tong Yao is my teammate,

803
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,215
our relationship is our private matter.

804
00:39:50,295 --> 00:39:51,980
It has nothing to do
with the team competition.

805
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,011
Second of all,

806
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,571
for those who question that our team
has conflicts...

807
00:39:55,651 --> 00:39:58,267
because I'm in love with Tong Yao,
I have only one answer.

808
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:02,117
If the series of guess that
ZGDX is coming to an end...

809
00:40:02,197 --> 00:40:04,674
is all out of your own speculation,

810
00:40:04,754 --> 00:40:06,797
turn off our gaming video now,

811
00:40:06,877 --> 00:40:08,912
return our gaming tickets
tear off our autographs,

812
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:10,170
and burn our pictures.

813
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,002
If you have any, of course,
and unfollow me on Weibo.

814
00:40:13,468 --> 00:40:14,825
Cheng, aren't you afraid of hurting...

815
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:18,006
the hearts of your fans who have
always supported you like this?

816
00:40:18,086 --> 00:40:21,790
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
for your support and love in the past.

817
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,535
But I'm not sorry to see you go.

818
00:40:23,615 --> 00:40:24,893
You don't have to tell me
by private message.

819
00:40:24,973 --> 00:40:27,160
I won't read it.
Even if I do, I won't regret it.

820
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,860
Goodbye.

821
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,474
Cheng, don't you think you should
apologize to your fans for this?

822
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:36,988
What's the reason for my apology?

823
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,231
If ZGDX lost the ticket
to World Championships this year...

824
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:44,757
because of the two Carry players,
I would apologize.

825
00:40:44,837 --> 00:40:46,253
But today I won't,

826
00:40:47,004 --> 00:40:48,681
because ZGDX is still here.

827
00:40:49,195 --> 00:40:51,010
We just lost one game.

828
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,851
If we become the building you see as
falling down because of this one loss,

829
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:56,430
I have to ask you,

830
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,170
is this what you call supporting ZGDX?

831
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,265
I'm disappointed.

832
00:41:00,345 --> 00:41:01,434
I'm also very sad.

833
00:41:01,514 --> 00:41:03,340
I even have to apologize to myself.

834
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,437
How do I get to have a group of you fans
who echo the views of others?

835
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:09,578
And those keyboard warriors
misleading public opinion on the internet,

836
00:41:09,658 --> 00:41:11,156
I ask you to retract your personal attacks
on me,

837
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:13,800
ZGDX and Tong Yao.

838
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,485
You should also remember one thing.

839
00:41:15,565 --> 00:41:17,321
The internet is not a lawless place.

840
00:41:17,401 --> 00:41:19,133
If you feel so free
to let out your malice,

841
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:22,682
you may have to pay for it in the future
with a more serious price than you think.

842
00:41:22,762 --> 00:41:23,827
Let me say one last thing.

843
00:41:24,324 --> 00:41:25,658
Don't think I'm perfect.

844
00:41:25,738 --> 00:41:28,749
I'm not... I'm not... I can't handle it.

845
00:41:30,965 --> 00:41:33,345
E-sports and our midsolo...

846
00:41:34,045 --> 00:41:35,775
are equally important in my heart.

847
00:41:36,388 --> 00:41:37,829
Not one of them is dispensable.

848
00:41:45,138 --> 00:41:48,337
E-sports and our midsolo
are equally important in my heart.

849
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,270
-Fans can unfollow us if not satisfied.
-He doesn't care about us at all.

850
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,775
-I'm speechless.
-I regret that

851
00:41:51,855 --> 00:41:52,895
I liked Chessman for the past few years.

852
00:41:52,975 --> 00:41:54,041
Do you think we dare not?

853
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:55,719
I'm the equal sign in Cheng's heart.

854
00:41:55,799 --> 00:41:57,175
I apologize to all of you for him.

855
00:41:57,255 --> 00:41:58,357
My youth is gone.

856
00:41:58,437 --> 00:42:00,811
Equally important?
In the future, will it...

857
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:02,066
be less important?

858
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:04,586
E-sports is less important
than Tong Daiji.

859
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:06,026
Unfollow him and become his hater.

860
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,553
I'm going to send a razor blade.

861
00:42:09,936 --> 00:42:11,092
It's not possible.

862
00:42:12,185 --> 00:42:14,835
These keyboard warriors
can only chatter on the Internet.

863
00:42:14,915 --> 00:42:16,918
Can they really send
razor blades to you in reality?

864
00:42:16,998 --> 00:42:18,344
It'll be fine in a few days.

865
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,658
What an ominous prediction.

866
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:32,335
What on earth is going on?

867
00:42:32,415 --> 00:42:35,886
Why has the public opinion of ZGDX
become so negative?

868
00:42:36,662 --> 00:42:37,665
Yeah, right.

869
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:39,652
First, the Double Carry
players' love affair became public.

870
00:42:39,732 --> 00:42:42,463
We weren't even given a chance
to prepare for the public opinion.

871
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:45,315
Do you know how many fans
returned our orders...

872
00:42:45,395 --> 00:42:47,173
because the players they liked
were in love?

873
00:42:47,253 --> 00:42:48,479
This is nonsense!

874
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,568
Yes, it is.

875
00:42:49,648 --> 00:42:51,831
As the captain of ZGDX,

876
00:42:52,143 --> 00:42:54,886
not only does Lu Sicheng have no
responsibility for the team's reputation,

877
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:58,098
but also have no respect at all
for our sponsors.

878
00:42:58,178 --> 00:43:00,698
Why are things so out of control now?

879
00:43:01,678 --> 00:43:04,692
The last time I asked you
to issue a statement...

880
00:43:04,772 --> 00:43:08,163
that the players' personal matters
would be separated from the games.

881
00:43:08,243 --> 00:43:09,476
But now what?

882
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:12,155
Personal matters
are affecting business matters.

883
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:13,486
Who is responsible?

884
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:14,813
Who can be responsible?

885
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,728
Yao.

886
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:21,203
What is the situation now?

887
00:43:21,283 --> 00:43:23,964
Why are those who scold you
on the Internet so harsh?

888
00:43:24,331 --> 00:43:27,527
When have you ever
been so aggravated since childhood?

889
00:43:27,857 --> 00:43:28,877
Are you okay?

890
00:43:28,957 --> 00:43:30,984
Mom, I'm fine.

891
00:43:31,064 --> 00:43:32,447
I won't lose a piece of flesh...

892
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,272
just because those people
on the internet are scolding me.

893
00:43:34,352 --> 00:43:35,580
Don't worry.

894
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,889
I'm going to train first.
I have a game tomorrow.

895
00:43:44,598 --> 00:43:48,838
(Mother)

896
00:43:55,339 --> 00:43:56,637
I've warned you before.

897
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,742
The path you've chosen will be difficult.

898
00:43:58,822 --> 00:43:59,822
I know.

899
00:44:00,126 --> 00:44:02,363
I know the attitude of the club.

900
00:44:02,443 --> 00:44:04,072
If the team is no longer viable,

901
00:44:04,152 --> 00:44:06,043
you can go home
and inherit the family business.

902
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:08,070
You're still joking with me at this point.

903
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:10,989
No one is joking with you here.

904
00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:12,587
Please don't think about it anymore.

905
00:44:13,307 --> 00:44:15,870
I'll walk all the way on this path.

906
00:44:20,256 --> 00:44:21,481
Chessman.

907
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:24,404
Can you really do it without turning back?
