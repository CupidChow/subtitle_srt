1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:02,448
I'm horrible in kissing scenes.

2
00:00:02,458 --> 00:00:06,819
My first time I did so many takes
the girl laughed at me.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,034
Is that so?

4
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:12,737
My ex told me I was bad.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,792
I must be a horrible kisser.

6
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:19,339
- Your ex?
- Mm.

7
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:22,230
I feel embarrassed talking about this.

8
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:30,706
Uh... By "my ex,"

9
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:35,120
you meant a female lover in the past?

10
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,870
Mm. That's right.

11
00:00:42,054 --> 00:00:45,182
It feels weird asking you
who's younger than me.

12
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:47,374
But if you have a trick, please share.

13
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:49,807
So...

14
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:55,219
would you like to try?

15
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:57,138
Eh?

16
00:00:57,379 --> 00:00:59,080
Rehearsing the kissing scene, I mean.

17
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:16,511
Uh.

18
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:19,468
Don't tell me
you're Momoshiro right now.

19
00:01:19,977 --> 00:01:20,977
Eh?

20
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:23,710
Because Momoshiro
would say something like that.

21
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:29,072
That's correct!

22
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,251
Did I startle you?

23
00:01:31,518 --> 00:01:33,530
Mm, a little.

24
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:37,464
Uh, I have to wake up early tomorrow.
I'm gonna take a shower.

25
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:39,893
Oh, be my guest.

26
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:42,811
Damn it.

27
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:47,632
I was trying to kiss Hajime Aoyanagi.

28
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:52,926
My ex told me I was bad.

29
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:58,620
Hajime Aoyanagi had a girlfriend.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,792
Of course. It's not strange
for him to have an ex

31
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:05,889
since he's 25.

32
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:12,846
But...

33
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,725
Am I in shock he had a girlfriend?

34
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:23,562
This kind of thought
doesn't belong to a stan.

35
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:29,365
I have fallen in love.

36
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:34,475
(Alan Abe plays Yuijiro Akafuji)

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,467
(Nichika Akutsu plays Hajime Aoyanagi)

38
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:39,558
(Based on "I Became the Main Role of a BL Drama"
by Machi Suzuri)

39
00:02:39,612 --> 00:02:41,370
(Opening credits)

40
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:44,623
(I Became the Main Role of a BL Drama)
(Episode 2)

41
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:48,628
Mitsutani is cute.

42
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:55,764
I think I'm gonna call him
by his first name.

43
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:59,389
Back off. That guy is mine.

44
00:03:00,023 --> 00:03:02,100
Who determines that?

45
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:07,053
Fate.

46
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:13,459
Fate determines that.

47
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:19,464
Haruhi gets off early today.

48
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:22,529
- I'll ask him out for drinks.
- Don't joke around.

49
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:26,209
Would you like to try?

50
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:27,449
Eh?

51
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:29,123
Rehearsing the kissing scene, I mean.

52
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:34,475
What exactly was that kiss rehearsal?

53
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,014
Was that a joke?

54
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:38,340
No.

55
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:42,873
Because Akafuji looked serious.

56
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:47,873
But what was it if he wasn't joking?

57
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:53,902
Was it because he wanted
to make this drama good?

58
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:59,894
- Your eyebrows were about to entangle.
- Oh, Miss Tendo.

59
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:05,541
You can vent your worries
because I play your sister this time.

60
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:08,708
And I'm your confidant in this drama.

61
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:12,003
- So...
- Mm.

62
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:17,711
- It's about an actor I know.
- Mm.

63
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:22,203
- There's a kissing scene on a show.
- Mm.

64
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:26,226
And it seemed like this actor's co-star

65
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,187
asked the actor to rehearse
the kiss at the co-star's place.

66
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,922
There are line rehearsals,
but I'd never heard of kiss rehearsals.

67
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:37,086
So I assume other people do it.

68
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:40,211
Using a rehearsal as
an excuse is sexual harassment.

69
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,844
Oh? I don't think so.

70
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:48,063
That's abuse of power. It's despicable.
It creeps me out just hearing it.

71
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:50,680
- It creeps you out?
- Doesn't it?

72
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:54,961
No...

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,920
Apparently not.

74
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,344
Is that so?

75
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:04,723
Yes.

76
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,214
But it's possible that

77
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:12,355
the co-star has feelings for the actor.

78
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:15,073
Eh?

79
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,569
Has feelings for the actor?

80
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:20,822
Akafuji has feelings for me?

81
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,735
While talking to Miss Tendo,
Hajime Aoyanagi's subtle smile

82
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:38,008
is 30 percent of his expression.
No, it's more than 50 percent.

83
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,371
If I remember correctly,
a celebrity magazine from five years ago

84
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:49,142
said he liked older partners.

85
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:53,896
What is this anxiety?

86
00:05:56,614 --> 00:05:57,951
Jealousy?

87
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:01,084
Or is this jealousy?

88
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:05,381
Akafuji! Can we talk?

89
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,406
Yes!

90
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:10,705
Aoyanagi!

91
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:13,770
- Can we talk?
- Yes!

92
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:17,587
Oh, go around that way.

93
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:21,474
I'm Hajime Aoyanagi.
I play Mitsutani Haruhi.

94
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:24,638
I'm Yuijiro Akafuji.
I play Momoshiro Akifumi.

95
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:28,271
"I Love My Childhood Friend"
is about to go on air.

96
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:30,654
- Please stay tuned.
- Please stay tuned.

97
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:34,874
- Mm, okay. Thanks.
- Thank you.

98
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:36,593
- Upload it.
- Yes.

99
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:40,712
Uh, I think if you're
putting it on social media,

100
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:44,782
it will go viral if we add
aspects from the drama.

101
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,829
- Like what?
- Like...

102
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,758
Stay in character
and do a hug from behind.

103
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:53,922
- I see. That's not bad.
- Really?

104
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,805
My feelings dictate my suggestion,
but am I being too self-indulgent?

105
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:04,391
- Mr. Hajime, is that okay?
- Oh. Mm, of course.

106
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:06,678
That's a relief.

107
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:12,141
Awesome. He dared present his own idea.

108
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:17,438
Akafuji takes this drama very seriously.

109
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,821
So, are you guys ready?

110
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:21,071
- Yes.
- Yes.

111
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:24,019
The last time I was hugged from behind

112
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:27,218
was by my on-screen mother
when I was a child star.

113
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:33,624
If I hug him from behind, I won't
have to look at Hajime Aoyanagi's face.

114
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:36,749
- So, may I?
- Yes.

115
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:43,585
I've always wanted to do this.

116
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:49,637
Don't leave my side.

117
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:58,117
I want to make you mine alone.

118
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,788
Eh? Why...?

119
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:03,818
How was that?

120
00:08:04,878 --> 00:08:09,699
Shit. I might have hugged him too hard.

121
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:13,195
Good.

122
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,830
Great!

123
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:18,291
- That was awesome. Post it!
- Yes!

124
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:21,419
- So good.
- Thank you very much.

125
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:29,671
(Every Saturday at 11 PM)
I want to make you mine alone.

126
00:08:33,187 --> 00:08:35,187
(Akayu? Awesome.)
(He's so Mitsutani.)

127
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:38,695
(Can't wait to meet Akayu's Momoshiro.)
(The live-action version might be a hit.)

128
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,230
(I wanna see the drama now.)
(I wanna be hugged from behind.)

129
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:44,281
All comments are positive.

130
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:47,539
What a relief.

131
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,319
Why...

132
00:08:55,183 --> 00:08:57,605
was my heart beating so fast?

133
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,418
Finally we met.

134
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:07,298
I got into the show biz because
I wanted to meet you, Mr. Kiromiya.

135
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:12,044
When I found out you were filming here,
I figured my dream would come true.

136
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:19,519
Kiromiya! The producers want you!

137
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:27,619
Mr. Aoyanagi.

138
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,888
Sorry, I saw you were in trouble.

139
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,829
Oh! If I was meddling, I'm really sorry.

140
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:40,349
I...

141
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:44,481
I...

142
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:51,295
I was scared to death!

143
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:55,024
Eh? You're not good with girls?

144
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,725
In high school,

145
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:02,815
I was stalked and harassed.

146
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:10,236
From then on, I've been scared of girls
who make blatant advances.

147
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:17,776
My selling point is arrogance.
I'm so pathetic.

148
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:21,414
You're not pathetic.

149
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,880
In our field, images dictate everything.

150
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:32,659
Even though we're grateful, we suffer.

151
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:41,017
Yuijiro is very different
from his image.

152
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:46,152
Mm, I guess.
I thought he'd be more composed.

153
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:51,837
And when he's with his cat,
he drops all pretense.

154
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:54,572
Eh? Akafuji has a cat?

155
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:56,115
Eh? You didn't know?

156
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:58,567
- No.
- Really?

157
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:01,454
He probably left it
in his manager's care for now.

158
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,873
Look at this photo.

159
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:15,218
Haven't you guys talked at all?
You're living together.

160
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:19,895
No. But we talk shop sometimes.

161
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,892
Yeah?

162
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:31,877
(With my co-star, Hajime.
#ILoveMyFriend Don't miss it!)

163
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:34,487
He calls him Hajime?

164
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,033
Without any honorifics?

165
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,915
Mr. Yukari, what does this mean?

166
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:52,658
He seems closer to Mr. Kiromiya
than to you who lives with him.

167
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,838
You...

168
00:11:57,912 --> 00:12:01,722
didn't have to spell it out like that.

169
00:12:11,987 --> 00:12:17,196
When I really think about it,
I only talk to Akafuji about work.

170
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:25,682
(Yuijiro Akafuji)

171
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,932
If I'm gonna look him up,
I might as well ask Kiromiya.

172
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,256
But that seems strange.

173
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,659
- Oh? Good morning.
- Eh? Didn't you have work?

174
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:45,136
I'm off today so I went for a run.

175
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:48,349
- Run?
- It's my routine.

176
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:50,683
Routine?

177
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:54,823
Morning runs are quite refreshing.

178
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,321
- Here's the thing, Akafuji.
- Yes?

179
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,053
What do you usually do on your days off?

180
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:08,664
On my next drama, I play a boxer.

181
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:16,505
On my next commercial,
I have to do archery.

182
00:13:26,737 --> 00:13:27,850
Wow.

183
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,719
Wanna try, Mr. Hajime?

184
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:32,116
Eh?

185
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:41,239
Stretch your arm slowly.

186
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:51,904
On my next film,
I have to do indoor rock climbing.

187
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:53,776
Is that so?

188
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,546
All the way up there?

189
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,237
Awesome.

190
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:14,323
Even on his days off, he does
so many things to build his characters.

191
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:16,190
I have to train hard

192
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:19,986
because my manager is tough.

193
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:25,491
We ended up talking
about only work today.

194
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:31,191
Mr. Hajime?

195
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:33,992
You'd never done rock climbing?

196
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:35,738
No.

197
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:38,375
Talking about shared interests is fun.

198
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,720
Plus we relate to our characters more.

199
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:43,615
Thanks.

200
00:14:43,628 --> 00:14:45,344
But this is not that.

201
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,639
The first time
my fingers hurt really bad too.

202
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,859
But why am I this curious about him?

203
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:59,984
For some reason, I'm upset that
Kiromiya knows him better than I do.

204
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:02,451
Huh?

205
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:04,131
Upset?

206
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:12,330
Mr. Hajime?

207
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:14,820
Huh?

208
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,240
Are you okay? Are you tired?

209
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:25,551
- Here's the thing.
- Yes?

210
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:29,023
The kissing scene's next week, right?

211
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,953
Eh?

212
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:33,668
Oh.

213
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:35,853
That's right.

214
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:41,484
I told you I wasn't good
in kissing scenes.

215
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:47,406
So I want to rehearse.

216
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:52,766
Eh?

217
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:54,955
Can we?

218
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,548
Well...

219
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,007
If this is about me saying
I wanted to rehearse,

220
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,717
you don't have to force yourself.

221
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:18,062
We can confirm on set.

222
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:21,665
No, I'm not forcing myself.

223
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:25,778
I want to rehearse, too.

224
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,613
So...

225
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,451
shall we?

226
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:50,187
Mm.

227
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:14,785
I'm sorry.

228
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,496
It's my family.

229
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,665
We'll do it later.

230
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:26,463
Mm-hm.

231
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,788
Mm-hm. I'm fine.

232
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,704
Mm. I'm great.

233
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:34,305
Oh, say hi to Grandma for me. Mm.

234
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:36,766
Yes. Yes.

235
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:43,116
Was I...

236
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:47,318
trying to kiss Hajime Aoyanagi?

237
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:50,576
Kiss Hajime Aoyanagi.

238
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:53,701
Kiss Hajime Aoyanagi.

239
00:17:53,711 --> 00:17:55,993
Kiss Hajime Aoyanagi.

240
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,948
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

241
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,045
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss. I like. I like.

242
00:18:06,214 --> 00:18:07,367
Awesome!

243
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:14,291
I like. I like. I like. I like. I like.

244
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,901
I like Hajime Aoyanagi.

245
00:18:17,353 --> 00:18:19,316
I like. I like.

246
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:22,240
I like?

247
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:25,078
Hot! So hot!

248
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:37,159
(Genki TV)

249
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:41,247
"I Love My Friend"
will air in five days!

250
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:46,590
- Please stay tuned.
- Please stay tuned.

251
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,790
- Okay! Thank you very much!
- Okay.

252
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,760
- Oh, sorry.
- It's okay.

253
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:56,888
Yuijiro?

254
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,137
Eh?

255
00:19:00,957 --> 00:19:03,853
Here's come my chance
to use his first name!

256
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:06,314
I noticed Kiromiya call you like that.

257
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:10,866
No. Should I call you Yuijiro?

258
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:13,571
I prefer calling you Akafuji.

259
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,621
Eh?

260
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:19,076
He's gonna go back to use my last name?

261
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,162
Sure.

262
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:29,565
Those two seem closer. What a relief!

263
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,048
You think so?

264
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:37,553
Huh?! You're into Hajime?!

265
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,056
Keep your voice down.

266
00:19:41,993 --> 00:19:43,068
Mm.

267
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:47,288
But I have to talk through
my character to communicate with him.

268
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:51,185
- Hold on.
- Plus he talked to Miss Tendo during a break.

269
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:54,236
So I think he might like older women.

270
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:55,613
Stop right now!

271
00:19:56,343 --> 00:19:57,865
I don't follow.

272
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:01,649
Why are you consulting me
on the matter of the heart?

273
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:05,321
I don't have a choice.
You're the only one I can talk to.

274
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,334
I guess you don't have friends.

275
00:20:10,624 --> 00:20:13,756
I just thought you wouldn't tease me.

276
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:21,493
Plus you seem very close
to Hajime Aoyanagi lately.

277
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:23,579
That's normal.

278
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,549
You also called him by his first name
without honorifics.

279
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,854
- That's normal.
- It's not.

280
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:33,734
But why? Did you like him
since he was a child star?

281
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,740
About that...

282
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,039
It's a secret.

283
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:49,149
You wanted advice but won't tell me?

284
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,255
How should I tell him my feelings?

285
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,426
There's no use if you're into him.

286
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:02,262
But don't go too far.

287
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,139
Go too far?

288
00:21:05,192 --> 00:21:07,311
I mean even though you live together,

289
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:10,354
don't get any ideas.

290
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:14,858
Like forcing a kiss.

291
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:19,850
Or anything more than that.

292
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:29,289
Because living together is a part
of the show's promotional plan.

293
00:21:30,394 --> 00:21:33,502
If things go wrong,
the show will get shelved.

294
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,962
Get shelved?

295
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:40,679
Let's make this drama good.

296
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:50,112
"I Love My Friend"
will air in five days!

297
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:52,438
They posted the video.

298
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,648
(- Please stay tuned.)
(- Please stay tuned.)

299
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:58,841
(Akayu's awesome.)
(He's fully Momoshiro now.)

300
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:02,512
(I love Akafuji's Momoshiro.)
(Wait, they're both perfect.)

301
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:13,294
(I wanna watch Mitsutani,
not Hajime Aoyanagi.)

302
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,769
(He's just Hajime Aoyanagi.)

303
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:19,128
(Must this guy play Mitsutani?
But Momoshiro is okay.)

304
00:22:19,153 --> 00:22:22,409
(He doesn't seem right
for Akayu at all.)

305
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:25,716
(They went with the Orange Juice Boy?)

306
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:40,169
Get shelved. Get shelved.
Get shelved. Get shelved.

307
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:46,283
Get shelved. Get shelved.
Get shelved. Get shelved. Get shelved.

308
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,164
But why? Did you like him
since he was a child star?

309
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:56,919
I'm back.

310
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,923
- You're back, Akafuji?
- Yes.

311
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:03,926
I'm a little tired.
I'm gonna take a shower.

312
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:08,867
I am cooking, and Hajime Aoyanagi is about to take a bath.

313
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:11,633
We look so much like newlyweds~

314
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:13,367
Uh, don't think about it...

315
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:14,936
Uh, Mr. Hajime?

316
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:16,219
Huh?

317
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:18,982
I'm gonna sleep on the couch tonight.

318
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:20,979
Why?

319
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:26,281
I can gauge the distance
between our characters now.

320
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:30,828
If I'm around him more than this,
I'm gonna go too far.

321
00:23:31,372 --> 00:23:32,580
It's too risky.

322
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,627
Characters.

323
00:23:34,765 --> 00:23:37,094
(I wanna watch Mitsutani,
not Hajime Aoyanagi.)

324
00:23:40,565 --> 00:23:41,565
Mr. Hajime?

325
00:23:41,576 --> 00:23:44,424
You're good, always thinking
about your character.

326
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,969
I have to take it more seriously too.

327
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:49,805
Eh?

328
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,677
Sorry.

329
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,559
I'm gonna go to bed.

330
00:24:08,855 --> 00:24:11,942
- Who's Hajime Aoyanagi?
- Who's Hajime Aoyanagi?

331
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,817
- The Orange Juice Boy.
- Oh.

332
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:16,864
- He grew up homely.
- He's no good.

333
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,696
- He's got no aura.
- That's hilarious.

334
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:28,208
- Did you negotiate his fee?
- I had no choice. There's less work.

335
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,332
Hajime Aoyanagi's era is over.

336
00:24:32,357 --> 00:24:34,963
We want the Orange Juice Boy,
not Hajime Aoyanagi.

337
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:39,364
- Quit auditioning.
- It's too late. Too late.

338
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,395
Don't come here again.

339
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:23,895
"Good morning.
Please eat if you don't mind."

340
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:32,699
I'm gonna eat.

341
00:25:43,888 --> 00:25:44,983
It's delicious.

342
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:49,748
No.

343
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:52,521
I can't get carried away.

344
00:25:57,837 --> 00:26:01,155
- Mr. Hajime, I'm back.
- You're back?

345
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,355
I'm gonna take a shower.

346
00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:08,568
- Akafuji?
- Yes?

347
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:13,163
- Thank you for breakfast.
- It's nothing. I'll cook it more...

348
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:16,467
Huh?

349
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:20,733
Could it be...

350
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,628
I must focus more on my character.

351
00:26:29,374 --> 00:26:32,863
- Yes, I get it now. I'll look it up.
- Yes.

352
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:35,846
- Mr. Hajime, you must be tired.
- You too.

353
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:41,476
Because no one wants someone like me.

354
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:49,651
This is it. He's avoiding me.

355
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:56,199
Or did he figure out
that I was into him?

356
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,921
You were staring too hard.

357
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,595
What's up with you and Hajime?

358
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,973
I almost made a mistake
and turned into Icarus.

359
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:05,227
Huh? Icarus?

360
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:10,217
Maybe I should give in.

361
00:28:10,227 --> 00:28:11,983
What happened?

362
00:28:12,831 --> 00:28:13,903
Nothing.

363
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:17,335
I just...

364
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,650
don't want to cause
someone I like trouble.

365
00:28:32,155 --> 00:28:33,880
(Aoyanagi )

366
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:40,533
That's it... that's it!

367
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:47,470
- Thank you for today.
- Thank you for today.

368
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:52,232
Hajime, are you free tomorrow?

369
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:56,903
- I'm free. No filming.
- Then why don't we go out on the town?

370
00:28:57,314 --> 00:29:01,220
- Eh? Mm, sure.
- Mm.

371
00:29:01,245 --> 00:29:03,642
- Mr. Kiromiya, you're up.
- Yes.

372
00:29:03,782 --> 00:29:07,626
- I'll text you the location.
- Mm.

373
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,917
- You snapped your fingers.
- I was happy.

374
00:29:10,928 --> 00:29:12,711
Can you teach me do that?

375
00:29:13,107 --> 00:29:16,251
Wow. So good. Wow.

376
00:29:22,037 --> 00:29:28,118
I told you earlier that
Hajime has very low self-esteem, right?

377
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:31,730
- Yes.
- But that's due to his nature too.

378
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:34,524
What made him that way?

379
00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:39,933
His parents divorced
when he was in junior high school,

380
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,449
and the custody battle was ugly.

381
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:45,577
Mostly over the money.

382
00:29:46,856 --> 00:29:52,883
Hajime was a sensitive kid and became
so anxious he couldn't act for a while.

383
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:57,727
Plus he was a teenager.

384
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:02,024
And the public didn't want him
as a child star anymore.

385
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:04,992
So he started to lose confidence.

386
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:08,039
He used to be a famous child star.
Must have been tough.

387
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:09,080
Mm.

388
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,040
But this project has good crew and cast.

389
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:19,284
So I wanted it to help
restore his confidence.

390
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,618
I see.

391
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:27,494
That's why I've been
a little worried about him lately.

392
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:33,584
By the looks of it,

393
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:40,227
he might have gone to the dark side.

394
00:30:40,466 --> 00:30:43,118
Or he had an issue with my Akafuji.

395
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:47,441
Mm. I don't know.
We have to wait and see.

396
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:55,760
- To be honest...
- Yes?

397
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,989
we act like personal managers.

398
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:06,074
We are.

399
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:11,746
Not right now.

400
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:19,671
Don't stare at me like that.
I'm gonna cry.

401
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:21,709
I'm sorry for making angry eyes.

402
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:24,834
But you were the one
starting talking shop.

403
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:29,052
Oh, you're right. I forgot.

404
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,010
Sorry.

405
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:32,822
Here.

406
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,158
Cheers.

407
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,155
He's late.

408
00:31:58,202 --> 00:32:00,920
(Kiromiya)
Sorry, I can't make it today.

409
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,215
That's all?

410
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,638
I thought it was odd too

411
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:14,684
that Kiromiya of a famous idol group

412
00:32:15,793 --> 00:32:19,272
wanted to go out on the town
with a homely has-been like me.

413
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:23,518
But I was...

414
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:27,656
secretly happy.

415
00:32:33,324 --> 00:32:34,954
I'm spiraling.

416
00:32:36,525 --> 00:32:38,625
My thoughts are turning dark.

417
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:43,652
Mr. Hajime?

418
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:50,429
Akafuji?

419
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:52,889
Why?

420
00:33:03,258 --> 00:33:04,484
Are you crying?

421
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:25,739
Thanks.

422
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:28,943
It's nothing.

423
00:33:29,401 --> 00:33:30,760
Why are you here?

424
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:35,107
I'm here to meet Kiromiya.

425
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:38,685
Sorry. Give me a sec.

426
00:33:41,614 --> 00:33:44,061
(Kiromiya)
Don't let this opportunity slip away.

427
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:46,651
You can do it, Yuijiro.

428
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:48,945
That guy...

429
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:52,106
What's wrong?

430
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:04,746
Mr. Hajime?

431
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:09,674
If you don't mind,

432
00:34:11,746 --> 00:34:13,595
can we go on a date?

433
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:16,681
A date?

434
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:18,822
Uh...

435
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,355
Mitsutani and Momoshiro
go on dates, don't they?

436
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:25,834
I see.

437
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,569
Actually, that's true.

438
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:33,364
So, shall we?

439
00:34:41,797 --> 00:34:43,828
- What should we order?
- Desserts.

440
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:46,016
- Let's race.
- The loser has to pay.

441
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,500
Wait for me!

442
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:50,590
- Call when you're ready to order.
- Yes.

443
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,635
We went in here as soon as we saw it.

444
00:34:54,735 --> 00:34:58,281
But should two actors go on a date
in a family restaurant?

445
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:00,301
It's like...

446
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:03,102
It's like we're students.

447
00:35:04,097 --> 00:35:06,689
You can say that again.

448
00:35:09,031 --> 00:35:12,946
Wow, what should we order?
Eh? What's this?

449
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:17,158
They have panko fried calamari.
It looks delicious.

450
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,162
The potatoes look yummy too.

451
00:35:22,813 --> 00:35:24,531
It's huge.

452
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:29,045
Don't tell me you like
family restaurants, Mr. Hajime.

453
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:36,406
Actually I've never been
to family restaurants.

454
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:39,595
Eh? What about when you were in school?

455
00:35:40,948 --> 00:35:44,453
It's embarrassing,
but I didn't have friends my age.

456
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:48,212
So I never went to
these restaurants after school.

457
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:50,984
Is that so?

458
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:55,749
That's probably why I'm excited.

459
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:02,454
So shall we stop by a game center
on our way back?

460
00:36:03,155 --> 00:36:05,963
Let's have fun like
when we were students..

461
00:36:07,449 --> 00:36:08,476
Can we do that?

462
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:10,669
Of course we can.

463
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:13,397
- Let's go to the beverage bar.
- Beverage bar?

464
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:16,532
- Do you know what a beverage bar is?
- Not much.

465
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:19,008
- Then let's go.
- Thanks.

466
00:36:19,368 --> 00:36:20,430
I'm done.

467
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,726
This is a beverage bar.

468
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:28,171
- Wow. Melon soda?
- Mm.

469
00:36:29,164 --> 00:36:32,145
Juices too. I'm getting nervous.

470
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,312
You can mix them.
I recommend these two flavors.

471
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:36,931
Get that flavor a little more.

472
00:36:53,282 --> 00:36:55,593
- Oh. Take it.
- Damn it.

473
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:58,918
Though I've never gone out on a date...

474
00:37:24,114 --> 00:37:26,974
going to places
someone I like wants to go

475
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:29,874
and having fun with that person...

476
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:34,729
- Cat ears are cute.
- Then go with cat ears.

477
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:36,848
Ready.

478
00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:41,389
That's it?

479
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:47,530
Doing just that has brought me
this much happiness.

480
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:54,291
Wait. That's awesome.
It can make our eyes big too.

481
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,210
But the ones
without editing look premium.

482
00:37:58,124 --> 00:38:01,091
- Let's go all out with the editing.
- Mm.

483
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:02,731
Then make them the biggest.

484
00:38:02,756 --> 00:38:05,618
This is so fun. We can make it pink too.

485
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,841
- Pretty.
- You have light skin, Mr. Hajime.

486
00:38:09,866 --> 00:38:12,238
- No, I don't.
- You really do.

487
00:38:12,258 --> 00:38:13,524
You have light skin too.

488
00:38:14,036 --> 00:38:16,118
I love big eyes like these.

489
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:17,491
- You like the big photos?
- Mm.

490
00:38:17,535 --> 00:38:19,921
- Can I have them all?
- Of course.

491
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:25,374
I'm so relieved...

492
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:28,864
that you're in higher spirits.

493
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:36,583
Today...

494
00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:39,528
why did you cry?

495
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:45,449
Many things ran through my mind.

496
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:48,577
Many things?

497
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:55,231
Like no one sees me.

498
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,965
When I was a child star,

499
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:06,013
people called me the "Orange Juice Boy"
more often than "Hajime Aoyanagi."

500
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,894
As an actor, being called
by my character's name

501
00:39:13,895 --> 00:39:16,189
is considered lucky.

502
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:20,291
But sometimes it makes me sad

503
00:39:28,295 --> 00:39:29,952
that no one sees me...

504
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:37,001
as Hajime Aoyanagi.

505
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:43,215
My parents included.

506
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:05,905
I see you.

507
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:09,935
Eh?

508
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:19,460
I'm looking at you.

509
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:23,881
Of course you're already
an amazing actor.

510
00:40:28,132 --> 00:40:29,195
But...

511
00:40:29,942 --> 00:40:31,523
after living together,

512
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:34,963
I've found a lot more
of your positive traits.

513
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:37,738
For example,

514
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:42,244
you always ask my opinion
before we do something.

515
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:48,077
In bed, you try to sleep on the edge
of the bed so I sleep more comfortably.

516
00:40:50,511 --> 00:40:54,175
Your kindness has made me very happy.

517
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:58,818
That's why I like...

518
00:41:14,086 --> 00:41:15,727
Thanks, Akafuji.

519
00:41:18,073 --> 00:41:19,395
Mr. Hajime.

520
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:22,941
I feel better now.

521
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,206
Mr. Hajime?

522
00:41:39,954 --> 00:41:41,038
Hm?

523
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,796
That park...

524
00:41:46,994 --> 00:41:52,220
was the last place I wanted to
be able to go on a date with you.

525
00:41:53,505 --> 00:41:55,737
Eh? Why's that?

526
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,478
Well...

527
00:42:25,635 --> 00:42:27,046
Mr. Hajime,

528
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:31,091
do you consider kissing...

529
00:42:32,862 --> 00:42:34,553
at the end of a date?

530
00:42:37,453 --> 00:42:38,479
Eh?

531
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:40,351
Uh...

532
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,940
I mean...

533
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,690
If it were Mitsutani and Momoshiro,

534
00:42:48,406 --> 00:42:49,780
I think they...

535
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,821
would kiss.

536
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,867
I...

537
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,584
have the same thought.

538
00:43:20,326 --> 00:43:22,992
I'm sorry, Akafuji.

539
00:43:25,146 --> 00:43:26,939
I lied.

540
00:43:31,265 --> 00:43:36,039
During our date, I didn't think
about our characters at all.

541
00:44:05,151 --> 00:44:06,270
Well...

542
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:10,858
we'll shoot this scene soon.

543
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:15,409
Can I rehearse more?

544
00:44:19,328 --> 00:44:20,328
Mm.

545
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,039
Really?

546
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:44,003
(Genki TV)

547
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:46,269
- No kissing scene?
- No kissing scene?

548
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:54,159
We thought it was necessary
for the climax at the end,

549
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:59,505
but them not kissing seems to go in line
with the characters more.

550
00:45:00,662 --> 00:45:01,700
Yes.

551
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,537
Okay?

552
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:09,946
Are you two okay with that?

553
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,144
- Yes, I am.
- Yes, I am.

554
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:27,268
No need to continue rehearsing.

555
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,396
Mm, I guess so.

556
00:45:32,189 --> 00:45:33,440
Mr. Hajime?

557
00:45:35,076 --> 00:45:36,891
Let's make this drama good.

558
00:45:39,024 --> 00:45:40,024
Mm.

559
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:46,500
- The set is ready. Let's start.
- Yes.

560
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:49,469
- We'll shoot for real.
- Please prepare.

561
00:45:49,494 --> 00:45:51,813
- Check everything.
- Yes.

562
00:45:51,813 --> 00:45:55,719
- Please.
- Can you wipe my sweat?

563
00:45:55,744 --> 00:45:59,156
- Very handsome.
- Thank you.

564
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:02,360
- Yukari-chan?
- Don't call me that on set.

565
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:05,947
Should we cancel
the living together thing?

566
00:46:05,957 --> 00:46:06,958
Huh?

567
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:13,453
We'll shoot for real. Roll the camera.

568
00:46:13,478 --> 00:46:15,482
Okay. Slate.

569
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:18,027
This is for real.

570
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:20,420
Ready.

571
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:22,823
Go.

572
00:47:48,169 --> 00:47:51,684
(Next episode)
Once we wrapped, this life will end.

573
00:47:51,811 --> 00:47:56,137
To be able to love or like something
this much is wonderful.

574
00:47:56,264 --> 00:47:58,460
They hug.

575
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:00,200
You said we'd make this drama good.

576
00:48:00,264 --> 00:48:02,548
I stopped lying to myself.
