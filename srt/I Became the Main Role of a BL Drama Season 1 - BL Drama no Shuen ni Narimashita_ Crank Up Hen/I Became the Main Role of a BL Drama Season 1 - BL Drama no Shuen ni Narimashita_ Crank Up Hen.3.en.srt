(Genki TV)

2
00:00:00,523 --> 00:00:02,773
- No kissing scene?
- No kissing scene?

3
00:00:02,798 --> 00:00:06,782
We thought it was necessary
for the climax at the end,

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:11,908
but them not kissing seems to go in line
with the characters more.

5
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:14,113
Yes.

6
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:20,345
Isn't it a good thing,
not doing the kissing scene anymore?

7
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,705
Because it would be a problem
if you faint during the scene.

8
00:00:25,173 --> 00:00:26,361
Now I'm relieved.

9
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:31,444
Yeah. That's true.

10
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:39,006
Hajime,

11
00:00:39,574 --> 00:00:41,475
don't tell me you're disappointed.

12
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:43,037
Eh?

13
00:00:43,553 --> 00:00:45,912
That they cut the kissing scene.

14
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:48,717
Why would I be disappointed?

15
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:03,839
What does Mr. Hajime think
about them cutting the kissing scene?

16
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:14,625
What does Akafuji think
about them cutting the kissing scene?

17
00:01:23,827 --> 00:01:25,609
I really want to know.

18
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:28,640
But will he think it's weird if I ask?

19
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:35,052
Take the risk and ask him.

20
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,911
Sorry for making you wait.

21
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:41,317
This is Akafuji's special curry.

22
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:44,614
Wow, it looks so good.
Curry is my favorite food.

23
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:47,332
Is that so?

24
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,363
I'm glad you like it.

25
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,300
Curry being Hajime Aoyanagi's favorite food

26
00:01:56,325 --> 00:02:00,113
is common knowledge
among Hajime Aoyanagi stans.

27
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:01,790
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,861
- Please.
- Let's eat.

29
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:11,310
So good.

30
00:02:13,388 --> 00:02:16,940
"So good." I got a compliment!

31
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,623
"So good" from Hajime Aoyanagi...

32
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:24,826
I want to listen to that
for the rest of my life.

33
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:30,654
Why doesn't a human body
have the sound recording function?

34
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:33,154
My heart hurts thinking about it.

35
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,669
Mr. Hajime?

36
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:37,693
Hm?

37
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:42,582
Next time,

38
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:46,776
I want to try making spiced curry.

39
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,714
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

40
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:51,105
Spiced curry? Must be difficult.

41
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:54,464
It's actually easier than you think.

42
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:55,882
Yeah?

43
00:02:57,624 --> 00:03:01,535
I want to ask about the kissing scene.

44
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:04,473
There seems to be
the golden ratio for spiced curry.

45
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:05,895
- Mm.
- If I find that recipe,

46
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,488
it's gonna be super easy.

47
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:09,629
Hm.

48
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:13,488
We're discussing non-work related things
more animatedly than before.

49
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,317
I'm scared to bring it up and kill the mood.

50
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,697
- The key is...
- Mm.

51
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:21,338
- using coriander and cumin
- Mm.

52
00:03:21,557 --> 00:03:24,182
- and adding cayenne pepper for the heat.
- Mm.

53
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:27,713
Why do I keep talking about spices?

54
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:30,088
If we add cinnamon and cardamom too,

55
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:34,738
it will taste even closer
to the original curry.

56
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,790
Stop talking about spices already!

57
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:48,735
Mr. Hajime?

58
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,250
- Hm?
- You have rice here.

59
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:53,747
Uh...

60
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,343
This side.

61
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,475
- I got it.
- Thanks.

62
00:04:07,396 --> 00:04:09,125
If it's Momoshiro...

63
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,475
"Sometimes you can be cute."

64
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:17,790
He would say that.

65
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,562
As for Mitsutani...

66
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,293
"Quiet. Not your business."

67
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:26,353
He would say that.

68
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:29,295
"Don't be this cute..."

69
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:31,751
"in front of other people."

70
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,155
"Stop saying 'cute.'
It's annoying, asshole."

71
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,348
Why am I always like this?

72
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:03,213
Once we wrapped, this life will end.

73
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:51,875
In the end,

74
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:56,719
I was afraid to tell him
important things during our date too.

75
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:04,427
Including the fact that I...

76
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:09,453
and Mr. Hajime met here seven years ago.

77
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,005
(Alan Abe plays Yuijiro Akafuji)

78
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,919
(Nichika Akutsu plays Hajime Aoyanagi)

by Machi Suzuri)

(I Became the Main Role of a BL Drama)
(Episode 3)

82
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:28,954
I like you.

83
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:31,302
Please date me.

84
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,079
(Seven years earlier)
In the first year of high school,

85
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,255
a female classmate I'd never talked to
unexpectedly confessed her love to me.

86
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,715
I didn't have the reason to refuse.

87
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,051
Sure.

88
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,051
- Really?
- Mm.

89
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:51,068
- Let's exchange numbers then.
- Mm.

90
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:56,877
What's this?

91
00:06:56,955 --> 00:06:59,026
(No Way My Sister Is a Witch)
Hm?

92
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:00,172
Sorry.

93
00:07:00,382 --> 00:07:02,346
Your taste is unacceptable.

94
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:03,518
Let's break up.

95
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:11,174
I got dumped three seconds
after she confessed her love.

96
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:13,456
(No Way My Sister Is a Witch)

97
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,994
Being rejected for what I loved

98
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:24,769
was sadder than being dumped.

99
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:28,417
So I hit rock bottom.

100
00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:31,580
But...

101
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:37,596
- Awesome. That's hilarious.
- He's a true stan.

102
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:39,748
What was he thinking?

103
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,580
I healed my heart by accepting my true self.

104
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:10,403
Argh! Hey, that's mine!

105
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:16,019
Real-life Orange Juice Boy.

106
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:19,574
That was all I felt when we first met.

107
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:23,750
- Thank you very much.
- Sure.

108
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:27,724
- Uh, wait.
- Yes?

109
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,035
Don't tell me you're an anime expert.

110
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:36,058
So what if I am?

111
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:38,441
Uh...

112
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,160
I have a favor to ask.

113
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,335
Even the quiet ones,
if it's something they love,

114
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,336
geeks will talk your ears off.

115
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:50,947
If you show that difference,
it might feel more real.

116
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,254
I see.

117
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:55,624
- Thanks.
- Sure.

118
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:58,670
My next role is an anime lover.

119
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,444
But I'm having a hard time
capturing his image.

120
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,423
Won't playing a geek turn people off?

121
00:09:12,004 --> 00:09:13,004
Eh?

122
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:14,876
Oh, uh...

123
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:16,399
I mean...

124
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,140
How do I say this?

125
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,726
It's not cool.

126
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:25,460
And people call you lame.

127
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:30,631
Or... unacceptable.

128
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,415
Something like that.

129
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:35,326
- You think so?
- Of course I do.

130
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:39,115
But I like it.

131
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:41,177
Eh?

132
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:42,713
Why?

133
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:44,683
Duh.

134
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:49,111
To be able to love or like something
that much is wonderful.

135
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:55,168
That's why I can't wait to play this role.

136
00:09:59,313 --> 00:10:00,716
Ever since that day,

137
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:03,950
Hajime Aoyanagi has become my main.

138
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,191
But I didn't think...

139
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:10,348
I'd end up...

140
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,723
falling in love with him.

141
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:24,090
You must be tired after your run.
I'm gonna go to bed.

142
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:27,566
Sleeping on the sofa is bad for you.
Please use the bed tonight.

143
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:05,254
I like you.

144
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:09,502
I like you so much...

145
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,821
I don't know what to do.

146
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:32,914
Although I have the courage
to say this only when he's asleep...

147
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:42,375
I feel so relieved now that I said it.

148
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,984
- Hello.
- Hello.

149
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:31,763
Hm?

150
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:34,380
Miss Tendo.

151
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,637
What's the matter?

152
00:13:37,726 --> 00:13:40,212
Uh, well, I'm just...

153
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:45,177
Don't tell me it's about
"that actor you know" again.

154
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,512
Oh? I guessed correctly.

155
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:53,887
Why don't you tell me?

156
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,931
Please come this way.

157
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,442
Well, actually...

158
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:05,040
"that actor I know"

159
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:11,309
apparently received a love confession from
the co-star who'd suggested the kiss rehearsal.

160
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:16,650
But once the actor thought the co-star
might have just been too into the role,

161
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:19,815
once the actor
thought of all the possibilities...

162
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:23,486
The actor couldn't close his eyes?

163
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:25,616
Yes. He didn't sleep a wink.

164
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,452
- I think that woman probably...
- Oh, it's not a woman...

165
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:33,523
It's not.

166
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:36,788
Uh...

167
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:40,085
But...

168
00:14:40,907 --> 00:14:42,115
That's irrelevant.

169
00:14:43,442 --> 00:14:44,442
Eh?

170
00:14:47,815 --> 00:14:49,690
The feeling of falling in love.

171
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,854
It's the same for men and women.

172
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:14,036
Yes?

173
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:16,874
Uh, is this Mr. Kijima's number?

174
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:18,723
It is.

175
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,555
It's Akafuji.

176
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:25,787
I'm sorry. I asked for your number
from Mr. Yukari, my manager.

177
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:32,512
I actually have something to run by you.

178
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:36,339
You're just in time.

179
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:38,034
Eh?

180
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:44,455
I was just thinking
I should talk to you as well.

181
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,369
I'm back.

182
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:52,736
Oh, you're back.

183
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:54,963
Eh? Where are you going?

184
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:56,408
Actually,

185
00:15:56,433 --> 00:16:00,627
I have to go out of town for work
from tonight to the day after tomorrow.

186
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:04,801
To the day after tomorrow?

187
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,226
Mr. Hajime?

188
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:10,535
Oh, is that so?

189
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,258
- Do your best.
- I will.

190
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:16,485
So I'm gonna go.

191
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:18,376
Good luck.

192
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:25,431
Tomorrow...

193
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,868
is my birthday.

194
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,588
Alone again.

195
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,166
This director is always pressuring us.

196
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:10,501
Hajime, let's go.

197
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,941
Mommy,

198
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:16,244
I want to have some cake.

199
00:17:16,523 --> 00:17:19,961
Eating cake at a time like this
will ruin your skin.

200
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:22,908
But today is...

201
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:26,307
Stop acting like a spoiled brat.

202
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:32,892
Too late now.

203
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,203
You're not a kid anymore.

204
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,271
Hm?

205
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:54,979
Mr. Kijima?

206
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:58,013
Eh?

207
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:00,604
You said I got a day off.

208
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:07,986
I told him I'd take
a day off for my birthday.

209
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:10,132
Mr. Kijima can be mean.

210
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:14,648
But it beats being alone.

211
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:28,556
I'm back.

212
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:34,198
Mr. Hajime, happy birthday!

213
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:41,571
Eh?

214
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:47,917
Oh, what about your work?

215
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:52,122
I wanted it to be a surprise, so I lied.

216
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,993
Eh?

217
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:00,401
Cake!

218
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:03,420
(Happy Birthday, Mr. Hajime)

219
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:12,151
But today is my birthday.

220
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:15,819
So what?

221
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,356
Don't talk like you a regular kid.

222
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:29,914
Mr. Hajime?

223
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:37,163
Thank you for being born into this world.

224
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,770
Mr. Hajime?

225
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:54,666
Thanks. I'm so happy.

226
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:57,668
That's a relief.

227
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:02,744
- I'll take that.
- Here.

228
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,967
Please.

229
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:07,353
Let's start.

230
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,684
I made everything myself.

231
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:15,716
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

232
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:32,616
Everyone, please watch "I Love My Friend."

233
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,741
Okay, cut. Very good.

234
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:44,448
- Is that really usable?
- Of course.

235
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,581
You kept making him do that?

236
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:51,326
Well, Akafuji is such a good kid.

237
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,691
I actually want to
celebrate Mr. Hajime's birthday.

238
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,817
Can you call him for a meet
and kill some time?

239
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,744
Of course he is.

240
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,858
I scouted him myself.

241
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:06,691
Nevertheless,

242
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:10,152
we should still cancel
their living arrangement.

243
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:14,289
If this keeps up, they won't be
Mitsutani and Momoshiro.

244
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,879
I feel it'll hurt them both in the end.

245
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:23,022
You might be right about that.

246
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:28,619
- Next scene, please.
- Next scene.

247
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:30,229
- Move the cameras.
- Camera 2 team.

248
00:22:30,254 --> 00:22:31,830
Set up the cameras!

249
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:33,998
- Let's move to that room.
- Yes.

250
00:22:34,155 --> 00:22:37,104
Any idea what you're gonna say
on the radio show the day after tomorrow?

251
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:38,188
I have no idea.

252
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:39,701
But it doesn't need preparing.

253
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:41,385
Just prepare for it.

254
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:42,362
Yes.

255
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:48,129
Please come, both of you.

256
00:22:48,154 --> 00:22:49,301
Yes, please guide us.

257
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,961
This way, please.

258
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:52,064
Oh, yes.

259
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:55,312
Ready. Action.

260
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:57,902
Stop it.

261
00:22:58,358 --> 00:22:59,120
Let go.

262
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:01,100
I said let go!

263
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:08,578
Look at me closely.

264
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,516
You like me, don't you?

265
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:41,956
You like me.

266
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,144
Don't you?

267
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:48,811
I...

268
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:50,362
I...

269
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:55,144
- Cut.
- Cut!

270
00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:56,505
- Cut!
- Sorry.

271
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,273
- Slate, please.
- Slate, please.

272
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,191
- I'm sorry.
- Give him the script.

273
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:05,006
- Where is it?
- It's okay.

274
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,787
Oh, "I like you, asshole."
"I like you, asshole." "I like you, asshole."

275
00:24:08,812 --> 00:24:09,890
Sorry. Thank you.

276
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,663
- Again.
- Okay.

277
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:12,991
- "I like you, asshole."
- Ready?

278
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,252
Ready.

279
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,380
Action.

280
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:21,383
You like me, don't you?

281
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,028
You like me, don't you?

282
00:24:38,763 --> 00:24:39,857
- I...
- Cut.

283
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:41,094
- Cut!
- Again!

284
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,474
- I'm sorry!
- Slate, please.

285
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:43,499
I'm sorry!

286
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,317
It's weird that
Mr. Aoyanagi keeps messing up.

287
00:24:51,342 --> 00:24:54,396
I know. He almost never does.

288
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:56,004
He must be tired.

289
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:17,704
That was my first time
doing that many takes.

290
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,363
(I wanna watch Mitsutani,
not Hajime Aoyanagi.)

291
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:23,069
No, I have to do better.

292
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:25,072
Mr. Hajime!

293
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,488
Apple pie. I bought some.

294
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,490
Have something sweet.

295
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,928
You'll feel better.

296
00:25:48,526 --> 00:25:49,526
Sorry.

297
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:51,903
I'm full.

298
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:55,953
Is that so?

299
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:57,755
Sorry.

300
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,041
Don't be.

301
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,318
Aoyanagi looks dejected.

302
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,557
Don't know what's wrong.

303
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:20,951
He won't meet my eyes.

304
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:23,320
Did I do something wrong?

305
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,153
Annoying.

306
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:34,020
He's so cold.

307
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,421
Good morning. Please guide me.

308
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,872
Akafuji!

309
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:43,968
Good morning.

310
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:45,676
Good morning.

311
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,343
Hajime must have found out you liked him.

312
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,079
I like you so much I don't know what to do.

313
00:27:05,863 --> 00:27:07,439
Don't tell me...

314
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:08,961
he was awake!

315
00:27:09,914 --> 00:27:10,914
Akafuji?

316
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,290
Good morning.

317
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:16,231
Here's the thing.

318
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,331
Is Hajime okay?

319
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:19,838
Eh?

320
00:27:22,154 --> 00:27:25,674
He looked strange
during filming yesterday.

321
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:27,914
You two live together, right?

322
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:29,216
Do you have any idea?

323
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,417
Uh...

324
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,959
Yes, we live together.

325
00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:37,422
The kissing scene rehearsals.

326
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,489
Hm?

327
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:41,159
Did you ask him to rehearse?

328
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,455
- Can we talk?
- Yes.

329
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:55,666
The co-star who suggested
rehearsing the kiss was really you.

330
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,264
You must be shocked...

331
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,463
that I like Mr. Hajime.

332
00:28:04,874 --> 00:28:05,874
No.

333
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:07,506
That's not it.

334
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:13,227
You used the characters to get close to him.

335
00:28:13,252 --> 00:28:14,920
That's why things end up like this.

336
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,175
Of course Hajime is confused.

337
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:22,847
But...

338
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:26,472
If I told him how I felt,
he'd have been uncomfortable.

339
00:28:27,603 --> 00:28:28,603
You think so?

340
00:28:31,602 --> 00:28:33,243
But he might be happy

341
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,912
if you tell him the truth.

342
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Mm.

343
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,166
Right?

344
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Right.

345
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:54,236
I can't drink anymore.

346
00:28:55,638 --> 00:28:56,690
Take it.

347
00:28:56,729 --> 00:28:58,268
- Finish it.
- Mm.

- Not at all.
- We're not.

Never.

Mm, I understand completely.

- How's it going?

368
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:47,467
Have you heard

369
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:50,330
that Mr. Akafuji and Miss Tendo
were photographed by a tabloid?

370
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,446
- Really?
- Unbelievable.

371
00:29:52,915 --> 00:29:56,143
That's bad. But they do seem close.

372
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:59,177
- I've got good vibes from them.
- True.

373
00:29:59,202 --> 00:30:01,287
Hajime?

374
00:30:01,312 --> 00:30:02,312
Yes.

375
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:07,133
It might be time for you two
to stop living together.

376
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:08,787
- Please come.
- Sure.

377
00:30:08,812 --> 00:30:09,828
Eh?

378
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:12,550
Well, you and Akafuji are close enough now.

379
00:30:12,575 --> 00:30:15,419
And you've already captured
your character's emotions.

380
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,234
So, sleep on it.

381
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,276
My favorite vase.

382
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,229
Are you okay?
You didn't cut yourself, right?

383
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:05,265
I'll clean it up.

384
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,796
I can do it myself.

385
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,590
Akafuji?

386
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:24,579
Yes?

387
00:31:26,394 --> 00:31:27,904
Are you dating Miss Tendo?

388
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,389
I'm sorry

389
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:32,746
that it...

390
00:31:33,616 --> 00:31:35,296
became a problem.

391
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:43,042
- But I'll take care of it before it gets out...
- You said we'd make this drama good.

392
00:31:45,924 --> 00:31:49,127
I want to tell him
it's a misunderstanding.

393
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,361
That's just me I guess.

394
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:56,031
But that...

395
00:31:57,295 --> 00:31:58,601
would have been an excuse.

396
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,298
Let's stop living together.

397
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:09,313
We can gauge the distance
between our characters now.

398
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:11,556
It's no longer necessary.

399
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:21,373
You're right.

400
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,108
I understand.

401
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,989
Damn it.

402
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,614
I want to superglue our hands together.

403
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:43,676
I won't do it.

404
00:32:46,118 --> 00:32:47,118
But...

405
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,009
But what?

406
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:54,412
I'll hold your hand until you're satisfied.

407
00:32:57,003 --> 00:32:58,084
You said it.

408
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,714
Prepare yourself.

409
00:33:04,714 --> 00:33:06,068
- Cut!
- Cut!

410
00:33:06,093 --> 00:33:07,891
- Cut!
- Okay!

411
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:11,276
- Okay!
- The scene is wrapped.

412
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:13,635
- Next scene, please!
- Next scene!

413
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:44,588
Let's eat.

414
00:33:54,296 --> 00:33:56,406
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

415
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:05,942
Yes?

416
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,155
Hajime, good morning.

417
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:14,667
Good morning.

418
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,511
The first episode airs today.

419
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:19,655
Yes.

420
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:21,988
I'm on the edge of my seat.

421
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:27,938
And you film just until noon today. How nice.

422
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,540
That's true.

423
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,445
Here's the thing.

424
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,770
You misunderstood.

425
00:34:44,403 --> 00:34:45,862
About me and Akafuji.

426
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:51,339
And we were photographed during our breaks.

427
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,158
Eh?

428
00:34:55,822 --> 00:34:56,928
Is that so?

429
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,070
Are you relieved?

430
00:35:05,378 --> 00:35:06,378
It's time...

431
00:35:07,162 --> 00:35:10,603
to prioritize your true feelings.

432
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:13,426
Eh?

433
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,199
Bye.

434
00:35:32,526 --> 00:35:35,094
(BL comedy drama #ILoveMyFriend
"I Love My Childhood Friend")

435
00:35:35,105 --> 00:35:36,749
(Finally EP 1 airs today!)

436
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:01,758
Akafuji is always serious.

437
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:04,339
Hajime Aoyanagi is awesome.

438
00:36:04,574 --> 00:36:06,904
You were so natural being Mitsutani.

439
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:08,349
We can do it right now.

440
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,925
I went for a run.

441
00:36:10,186 --> 00:36:12,178
What do you usually do on your days off?

442
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,417
Lower it to your mouth.

443
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:16,710
So I want to rehearse.

444
00:36:16,735 --> 00:36:18,095
I want to rehearse, too.

445
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:19,871
Mr. Hajime,

446
00:36:19,896 --> 00:36:21,409
Let's make this drama good.

447
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,810
Even so,

448
00:36:27,564 --> 00:36:28,564
I'm still...

449
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:31,035
You said we'd make this drama good.

450
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,837
That's just me I guess.

451
00:36:41,402 --> 00:36:42,830
I was just jealous.

452
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,786
(Akafuji)

453
00:37:05,232 --> 00:37:10,773
The number you have dialed may be
out of coverage area or have been turned off...

454
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:25,671
Hey, what's up, Hajime?

455
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,620
Oh, how are you, Mr. Kijima?

456
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,823
Mm, I'm fine.

457
00:37:29,252 --> 00:37:30,398
Well...

458
00:37:30,593 --> 00:37:33,302
I'd like to get Mr. Yukari's phone number.

459
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,253
Why?

460
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,222
Uh...

461
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:43,012
I want Akafuji's home address.

462
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,463
Akafuji's home?

463
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:49,031
Please.

464
00:37:51,581 --> 00:37:52,581
All right.

465
00:37:52,694 --> 00:37:54,556
We're together now. Talk to him.

466
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:56,338
Eh?

467
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:57,905
Together?

468
00:37:58,267 --> 00:38:00,585
- Eh? Wait a sec.
- It's okay.

469
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,407
Just take the phone.

470
00:38:03,476 --> 00:38:04,476
It's in Nishimachi.

471
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,238
Yes, his condo is there.

472
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:09,154
I'll text you the address.

473
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:12,518
Yes. Goodbye.

474
00:38:15,843 --> 00:38:16,843
Hajime...

475
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,630
understands himself now.

476
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,038
Should we give him Akafuji's address?

477
00:38:26,218 --> 00:38:31,313
If it puts a smile
on Hajime's face, I'm happy.

478
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:41,390
By the way, from this angle
you look really wonderful.

479
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,255
Hey, don't!

480
00:38:46,815 --> 00:38:48,742
Don't strangle me. I give up.

481
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,559
Akafuji!

482
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:39,197
(Hajime Aoyanagi)

483
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:45,693
Thinking back,

484
00:39:46,411 --> 00:39:50,421
I miss those days and nights
with Hajime Aoyanagi.

485
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:02,160
They have become my number one flashback

486
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,568
before I meet my maker.

487
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:22,515
Who's here at this hour?

488
00:40:46,897 --> 00:40:48,068
Hm?

489
00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:52,872
Am I missing Hajime Aoyanagi so much

490
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,503
that I hallucinate him?

491
00:40:56,828 --> 00:40:58,481
That's no good.

492
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:01,767
This love craze is getting out of hand.

493
00:41:10,082 --> 00:41:11,082
Hm?

494
00:41:12,256 --> 00:41:16,253
This hallucination looks so real.

495
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:17,853
Uh...

496
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,310
Akafuji.

497
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,619
A talking hallucination?

498
00:41:26,226 --> 00:41:27,226
Eh?

499
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:31,761
Don't tell me

500
00:41:31,786 --> 00:41:33,414
you're my fan.

501
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:37,050
I'm neither a fan or a stan.

502
00:41:37,649 --> 00:41:39,823
He's someone I'm secretly in love with.

503
00:41:42,454 --> 00:41:43,454
Wait.

504
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:44,935
Hm?

505
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,222
Hmm?

506
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,479
Eh?

507
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:01,247
The real...

508
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,229
Hajime Aoyanagi?

509
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,390
Real?

510
00:42:08,218 --> 00:42:10,522
Oh, sorry for coming unannounced.

511
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:12,905
Uh...

512
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16,782
I needed to talk to you
about something in person.

513
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,328
Oh, Akafuji! Wait!

514
00:42:30,988 --> 00:42:32,216
Akafuji!

515
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:38,073
Akafuji!

516
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,630
Akafuji!

517
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:51,267
Wait! Akafuji!

518
00:42:56,413 --> 00:42:57,413
Wait!

519
00:42:59,552 --> 00:43:00,815
Akafuji!

520
00:43:02,091 --> 00:43:04,161
Akafuji, wait!

521
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,586
Ow.

522
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,347
Mr. Hajime, are you okay?

523
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,131
Seven years ago,

524
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:02,971
do you remember

525
00:44:03,598 --> 00:44:06,254
running into a high-school geek here?

526
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:08,778
Oh.

527
00:44:09,184 --> 00:44:10,184
Mm.

528
00:44:18,797 --> 00:44:19,797
That kid...

529
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:23,653
was me!

530
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,480
Eh?

531
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:30,858
Oh!

532
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:41,959
At the time,

533
00:44:43,217 --> 00:44:48,269
I thought other people's words had hurt me.

534
00:44:50,352 --> 00:44:52,279
So I acted tough,

535
00:44:53,217 --> 00:44:56,159
thinking despite being rejected
by people around me,

536
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,451
as long as I stayed myself

537
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:02,261
and accepted my own interests,
that was enough.

538
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:06,940
Thinking back now,
I'm embarrassed by my naivety.

539
00:45:13,133 --> 00:45:15,289
That's why I was so happy

540
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,445
that you...

541
00:45:19,354 --> 00:45:20,700
said to me...

542
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:22,842
"I like it."

543
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:30,895
Ever since that day,

544
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:38,890
I sought out all past works
of Hajime Aoyanagi.

545
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:44,490
I watched all your dramas
and the variety shows you went on.

546
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:47,171
I became...

547
00:45:50,036 --> 00:45:52,026
a Hajime Aoyanagi stan.

548
00:45:58,093 --> 00:45:59,093
But...

549
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,980
not anymore.

550
00:46:13,206 --> 00:46:14,748
I like you, Mr. Hajime.

551
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:19,336
As Yuijiro Akafuji.

552
00:46:23,261 --> 00:46:24,261
Until now,

553
00:46:25,435 --> 00:46:27,183
I had to use my character...

554
00:46:28,303 --> 00:46:30,389
to convey my feelings.

555
00:46:33,644 --> 00:46:35,884
But I've stopped lying to myself.

556
00:46:43,144 --> 00:46:44,144
Thanks.

557
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,142
I'm sorry...

558
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,408
for going on about myself.

559
00:46:59,212 --> 00:47:00,212
Anyway,

560
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:03,324
what did you want to talk about?

561
00:47:12,518 --> 00:47:13,518
Did you know...

562
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:16,788
when I was with you,

563
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,095
instead of feeling down,

564
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,879
I became optimistic?

565
00:47:25,503 --> 00:47:26,866
The next thing I knew,

566
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,713
I'd started to smile more.

567
00:47:33,955 --> 00:47:35,996
I always wondered...

568
00:47:36,734 --> 00:47:38,225
why that was.

569
00:47:45,347 --> 00:47:46,405
To summarize,

570
00:47:51,111 --> 00:47:52,111
I also...

571
00:47:54,265 --> 00:47:55,911
understand myself now...

572
00:47:58,091 --> 00:48:00,052
that I like you.

573
00:48:02,821 --> 00:48:05,222
Not as Mitsutani,

574
00:48:06,748 --> 00:48:08,009
but as me.

575
00:48:20,783 --> 00:48:21,929
Akafuji.

576
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:25,679
Mr. Hajime.

577
00:48:29,665 --> 00:48:31,017
I like you.

578
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:34,507
I always have.

579
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:36,825
And from now on,

580
00:48:37,502 --> 00:48:38,502
I will...

581
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:41,416
forever...

582
00:48:43,204 --> 00:48:44,589
and ever...

583
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:47,312
love you.

584
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:50,719
Mm.

585
00:48:52,005 --> 00:48:53,005
Me too.

586
00:49:16,215 --> 00:49:17,447
Today I want to...

587
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:20,508
watch our drama with you.

588
00:49:23,015 --> 00:49:24,015
Mm.

589
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,077
(Thank you for watching EP 1!)

590
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:01,630
(Their chemistry is unstoppable!
Please support us!)

591
00:50:06,686 --> 00:50:09,134
(Mitsutani must be played by only Aoyanagi.)

592
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:11,451
(I will always root for
Momoshiro and Mitsutani.)

593
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:14,655
(Akayu is awesome!
Hajime Aoyanagi is great too!)

594
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:16,478
(No longer the Orange Juice Boy.)

595
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,157
(Too cute!)

596
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:19,609
(Handsome.)

597
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,450
(Honestly, the acting is good.)

598
00:50:38,394 --> 00:50:41,189
- Oh, they're both here.
- Good morning.

599
00:50:41,214 --> 00:50:42,687
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

600
00:50:42,698 --> 00:50:45,165
Congratulations on the first episode!

601
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:52,534
Actually, we wanted to
run something by you two.

602
00:50:53,101 --> 00:50:54,677
The last scene.

603
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:00,283
We decided we wanted to put
the kissing scene back in like in the manga.

604
00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:02,619
What do you guys think?

605
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,072
Yes. That sounds good.

606
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:08,262
I agree.

607
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:12,541
- That's a relief!
- What a relief!

608
00:51:12,979 --> 00:51:14,925
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

609
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:16,748
Let's go all out for the last scene.

610
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:17,946
- Yes.
- Yes.

611
00:51:18,961 --> 00:51:21,566
- Let's go all out!
- Yes!

612
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,210
- Please do your best.
- Please do your best.

613
00:51:34,889 --> 00:51:36,018
Akafuji?

614
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:37,539
Yes?

615
00:51:38,414 --> 00:51:40,718
Let's make the best drama.

616
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:42,165
Yes.

617
00:51:42,346 --> 00:51:43,492
You two,

618
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:46,643
please do your best!

619
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:48,544
- Yes.
- Sparkling, sparkling.

620
00:51:48,867 --> 00:51:50,833
Please come to the scene.

621
00:51:50,965 --> 00:51:52,893
Yes, please guide us.

622
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,471
- They're ready.
- Do your best.

623
00:51:55,496 --> 00:51:57,249
Okay, we're shooting for real!

624
00:51:57,389 --> 00:51:58,518
Roll the camera!

625
00:51:58,543 --> 00:51:59,543
Slate, please.

626
00:51:59,677 --> 00:52:01,033
Scene 23, take 1.

627
00:52:01,338 --> 00:52:02,910
- For real!
- For real!

628
00:52:03,915 --> 00:52:05,539
Ready!

629
00:52:06,398 --> 00:52:07,398
Action.

630
00:53:54,518 --> 00:53:57,877
(This drama is fictional.)
