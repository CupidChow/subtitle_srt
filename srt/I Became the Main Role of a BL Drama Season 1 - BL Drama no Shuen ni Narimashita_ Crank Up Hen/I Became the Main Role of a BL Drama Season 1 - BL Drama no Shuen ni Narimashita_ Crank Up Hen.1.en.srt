1
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:19,530
The story turns out like this because...

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,236
(Three months earlier)

3
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:25,791
I got a leading role in a BL drama?

4
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,335
Yes. This is the literature.

5
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:32,792
(I Love My Childhood Friend)

6
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:38,983
You will be co-starring with Akafuji.

7
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:42,447
You mean the Yuijiro Akafuji?

8
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,950
- Ah! Akafuji!
- Turn around!

9
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,138
See you. I've gotta go.

10
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:51,325
- I love you!
- Akayu!

11
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,365
- Thank you very much.
- Rock, paper, scissors!

12
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,927
- We'll play rock, paper, scissors once.
- Okay.

13
00:00:56,952 --> 00:00:58,397
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

14
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:00,552
(Rising star, 1.77 million followers)

15
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:02,263
(Yuijiro Akafuji, aged 23)

16
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:03,490
Yes!

17
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:06,052
Number one rising star.

18
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,764
Akayu.

19
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:10,358
I don't think I can do it.

20
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:12,115
What's wrong?

21
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:13,952
Here.

22
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:20,583
It's true I became famous from
an orange juice commercial 15 years ago.

23
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,774
♪ Orange juice is
my favorite thing in the world ♪

24
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:31,889
♪ I have fun and drink orange juice ♪

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,611
♪ Dai Dai Orange Juice ♪

26
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:41,371
But now I'm just a nobody
who gets paired with him.

27
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:44,629
(Unpopular actor, not on social media)

28
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:46,457
(Hajime Aoyanagi, aged 25)

29
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:52,364
Aww, Hajime.
You're always so pessimistic.

30
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:58,692
- Come on. Look on the bright side for a change.
- Sure.

31
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,990
Bye. I'm going.

32
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:15,267
But is someone like me right
for the leading role of a BL drama?

33
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:21,014
(Alan Abe plays Yuijiro Akafuji)

34
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:23,371
(Nichika Akutsu plays Hajime Aoyanagi)

35
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:26,824
(Based on "I Became the Star of a BL Drama"
by Machi Suzuri)

36
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:27,862
(Opening credits)

37
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,916
(I Became the Star of a BL Drama)

38
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:37,809
(Genki TV)

39
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:43,244
("I Love My Childhood Friend" Drama)

40
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:45,074
(Cast Meeting Room)

41
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:48,231
- Not yet?
- No.

42
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,922
Not bad at all. Thank you very much.

43
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:54,740
(Yuijiro Akafuji) (Hajime Aoyanagi)

44
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,898
Mr. Akafuji is here.

45
00:02:57,918 --> 00:02:59,878
I'm sorry for being late.

46
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,808
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

47
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:06,519
His aura is so bright.

48
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:13,715
Awesome. A star's aura is so formidable.

49
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:17,415
Good morning.

50
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:29,802
The themes of this drama are
reunion and living together.

51
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:38,397
Mitsutani and Momoshiro
are childhood neighbors.

52
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,647
Their relationship
is similar to cousins.

53
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:45,194
- Yes.
- Sorry.

54
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:46,525
But...

55
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,439
Both of you, stand up.

56
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:50,767
- Stand up. Get up.
- Yes.

57
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:55,868
In high school, Momoshiro gets taller
than Mitsutani, changing their dynamic.

58
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:01,931
Afterward they have a falling out
over something trivial.

59
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:05,978
But fate draws them back together.

60
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:10,879
Mitsutani's job takes him
back to Momoshiro.

61
00:04:10,904 --> 00:04:14,668
And Momoshiro's certain
that he loves Mitsutani.

62
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:19,044
Plus something happens,
forcing them to live in the same house.

63
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:25,492
Mitsutani doesn't know how to react
to Momoshiro's blatant advances,

64
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:29,046
but he starts to be honest
with his own feelings.

65
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:39,747
The story is so entangled and touching

66
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:42,865
it's both satisfying and a tearjerker.

67
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:49,058
Ah, and the latest issue is so wonderful

68
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:54,747
I want to live in
that entanglement forever.

69
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:03,346
I will drown the audience
in the BL goodness.

70
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:06,424
Both of you, please do your best.

71
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:10,372
- Please guide us.
- Please guide us.

72
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:12,989
- Awesome.
- Wonderful.

73
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:15,067
Our producers

74
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,130
painted a very clear picture.

75
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:21,099
- What a wonderful presentation.
- Well.

76
00:05:21,124 --> 00:05:23,844
- That was amazing.
- Despite its uniqueness,

77
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:29,068
the job by experienced and passionate
producers should turn out well.

78
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:32,169
Plus we've got
an up-and-coming director.

79
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,216
That's right.

80
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,029
I love the word "touching."

81
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:38,536
The atmosphere of the set is also good.

82
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,394
No.

83
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:45,961
It's based on a manga,
so there might be a blowback.

84
00:05:45,993 --> 00:05:49,323
No, no, no.
This is not the time to worry.

85
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,746
I must do my best.

86
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:56,414
Good morning.

87
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:59,916
Good morning. You guys must be so tired.

88
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:03,901
- Aoyanagi.
- Miss Tendo, long time no see.

89
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:07,580
It's been a while. I heard
there was a cast meeting so I came by.

90
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,333
I'm glad we'll work together again.
Please guide me.

91
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:14,524
Likewise. But I didn't think
we'd reunite on a BL drama.

92
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:15,563
That's true.

93
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:19,914
Eh? Long time no see!

94
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:23,532
That's right. I have to
introduce myself to Akafuji.

95
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,071
We have to go to another meeting.

96
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:29,408
- Oh? Please do your best.
- Yes. Thank you very much.

97
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,463
- Akafuji?
- Mr. Yukari?

98
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,402
Eh?

99
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,800
- We have another engagement, right?
- We still have time.

100
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:42,046
- We'll be stuck in traffic if we don't hurry.
- It's okay.

101
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:44,827
- Uh...
- Oh, I want to stop by a 7/11.

102
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,890
I'll go ahead, Mr. Yukari.

103
00:06:51,513 --> 00:06:53,877
See you on the filming day.
Thank you very much.

104
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:55,925
- Thank you very much.
- See you.

105
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:01,513
Wait.

106
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:03,869
Don't tell me...

107
00:07:04,187 --> 00:07:07,202
he's avoiding me.

108
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:44,952
Haruhi, you've never been
good at refusing people.

109
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,833
Please don't use my first name.

110
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:52,329
We work for the same company,
Mr. Momoshiro.

111
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,408
- Cut!
- Cut!

112
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,931
- Slate, please.
- Check the footage.

113
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:05,378
- It started great.
- But I think it's...

114
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:10,240
The patting on the head is hard.

115
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:13,405
I wish Mr. Aoyanagi
held eye contact a little longer.

116
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:14,510
Yes.

117
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:18,776
I think you two were a little stiff.

118
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:20,417
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

119
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:22,337
Where were we in the scene?

120
00:08:22,362 --> 00:08:27,477
Let's take a break now.
Please be back in 15 minutes.

121
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,490
Be back in 15 minutes!

122
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:32,056
I have to be the one building trust.

123
00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:35,424
All right.

124
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:43,529
Akafuji, I'd like to rehearse
that scene again.

125
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,992
Stay out of my sight, please.

126
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:47,432
Eh?

127
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:52,540
How should we fix it?
What do you think, Miss Yayoi?

128
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:54,329
It's ready.

129
00:08:56,397 --> 00:08:59,823
I had a bad feeling when we first met.

130
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:01,604
That must be it.

131
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:06,880
Akafuji despises me.

132
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:14,646
But when he was that blatant,
it was a shock to my system.

133
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:28,476
What will happen
if they try living together?

134
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,402
Eh?

135
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:35,694
Make them live together
like Mitsutani and Momoshiro.

136
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:38,963
And eat together.

137
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,979
Might as well make them
sleep in the same bed too.

138
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:44,003
Eh?

139
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:50,081
It will definitely improve
their on-screen chemistry!

140
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:56,738
- Miss Yayoi?
- Eh?

141
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,420
Oh, goodness. I got carried away again.

142
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:03,445
How embarrassing.

143
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:05,886
Living together like our characters

144
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:08,610
could be good PR for the show as well.

145
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,759
Eh? What? I was joking around.

146
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:13,532
My imagination got away from me.

147
00:10:13,557 --> 00:10:14,557
But I...!

148
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:18,035
want to do it!

149
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:19,215
Living together.

150
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,828
- Eh?
- Eh?

151
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:23,567
Eh?

152
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,270
Are you serious?

153
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:30,280
Yes. This is my first
leading role in years.

154
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:33,772
- Are you sure?
- I wanted this drama to be good.

155
00:10:34,864 --> 00:10:39,715
- That was I thought, so I said it out loud.
- Will you really do it?

156
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:45,391
(Aoyanagi)

157
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:46,485
Please.

158
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:52,610
You can put your stuff over there.

159
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,749
This is the living room.

160
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:02,317
Awkward.

161
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:06,775
The bedroom is small
and on the second floor.

162
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:14,807
This is so awkward.

163
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:18,190
Oh, use the kitchen however you'd like.

164
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:29,443
So awkward.

165
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:34,416
It's so awkward I don't know how to act.

166
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,885
Oh, do you usually cook, Akafuji?

167
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:43,365
Sometimes.

168
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:50,429
Argh! So awkward.

169
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:53,491
Is that so?

170
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:57,745
Okay, I'll show you the bathroom next.

171
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:02,453
Feel free to use the bed.

172
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,781
Do you have any questions?

173
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:08,676
No.

174
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:15,665
I don't want to imagine
how this is gonna turn out.

175
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:21,486
Eh?

176
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:24,052
Eh? Is he staring at me?

177
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:29,772
- Well...
- Yes?

178
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:33,191
I have to go back to work.

179
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:37,394
Oh, is that so? Then see you
at the shoot in the evening.

180
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:47,567
Do your best. Good luck!

181
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:54,039
Argh.

182
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,196
So awkward.

183
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Argh!

184
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:06,362
So awkward.

185
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:14,591
Too cute. Too cute.

186
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:19,487
You're too cute, Hajime Aoyanagi!

187
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:23,625
Meeting Hajime Aoyanagi in person,

188
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:28,180
it was so heart-wrenching.

189
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:31,571
His power is so damaging.

190
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:34,383
He doesn't have to hate me that much.

191
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:38,352
One minute he looks away
like seeing me blinds him.

192
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:40,750
The next minute he stares daggers at me.

193
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:43,623
Today our eyes met for 2.7 seconds.

194
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:49,625
During that time,

195
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:55,516
I was certain my heart stopped beating.

196
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:59,172
He probably doesn't want to act
with a homely dork like me.

197
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:02,041
- Wait a sec.
- Yes?

198
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:04,612
You're a fan of Mr. Aoyanagi?

199
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:08,455
Not at all.

200
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:11,452
- I thought so.
- Not a fan, but a stan!

201
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:15,409
I made an acrylic cutout of him.
Wanna see?

202
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:21,999
That's why you were acting
so strange around him.

203
00:14:22,257 --> 00:14:27,866
It wasn't like you to intimidate
fellow actors your age.

204
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:29,514
I found it. This is it.

205
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,241
Hajime Aoyanagi from "Tokyo Dhampir."

206
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:38,827
I chose his project I saw
for the first time in a theater.

207
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:41,654
- I'm begging you. Stop here.
- Eh?

208
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:47,526
Don't get carried away from
being near him and get weird ideas.

209
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:50,032
I said I wanted to live with him.

210
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,784
But how's it gonna be
if this is what I get on the first day?

211
00:14:56,732 --> 00:14:59,354
My goodness gracious.

212
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:04,164
Getting depressed already? Here.

213
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:12,222
Don't jump to conclusions.
You two might end up getting along.

214
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,003
- That's impossible.
- That's impossible.

215
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:17,724
For me,

216
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:21,591
Hajime Aoyanagi is truly divine.

217
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:25,362
He's like the sun

218
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,580
while I'm like Icarus.

219
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:35,878
If I had wings and went near him,
I would have fallen into darkness.

220
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:43,165
Hot! So hot! Hot.

221
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:49,487
Whatever you do,
don't let him know you're his stan.

222
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:53,461
Because if he hates you,
everything will be over.

223
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:57,898
Yes.

224
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:02,800
But you don't have
friends your age, Hajime.

225
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:06,573
Use this opportunity to make one. Here.

226
00:16:11,774 --> 00:16:13,922
All right, Hajime.

227
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,227
Let's be positive!

228
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,602
Let's be positive!

229
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:24,081
Let's be positive.

230
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,855
Positive.

231
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:32,584
(Genki TV)

232
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:40,098
- Will it end late?
- I don't think so.

233
00:16:40,136 --> 00:16:42,215
- I see.
- Yes.

234
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,263
Oh. Both leading men are here.

235
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,477
Hello.

236
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:51,922
- Hello.
- Hello.

237
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,645
Please do your best.

238
00:16:56,756 --> 00:17:01,075
That's why. Akafuji is Hajime's fan.

239
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:04,401
To be precise, he's a stan.

240
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,679
Is that so? A stan?

241
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:11,656
I'm worried one day
he'll slip in the middle of the shoot.

242
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:15,137
Eh?

243
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,670
Why are you making that face?

244
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:18,886
Eh?

245
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:21,820
I know your mind's in the gutter.

246
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:27,052
Not at all. I was just thinking
you in a worry mode is refreshing.

247
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,363
He might not look it,
but Akafuji takes things seriously.

248
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:37,650
He won't cause you guys trouble.
You can rest assured.

249
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:43,000
If he's in your charge,
he must be trustworthy.

250
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:48,593
But honestly,
this might be a good opportunity.

251
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:49,672
Good opportunity?

252
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:55,359
Well, my Hajime has
very low self-esteem.

253
00:17:55,384 --> 00:17:56,445
Is that so?

254
00:17:56,477 --> 00:18:01,797
Having a passionate person like Akafuji
pushing him would do him good.

255
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:02,893
I see.

256
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:07,601
So let's wait and see.

257
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:12,438
Even an asshole like you
can be thoughtful.

258
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:16,613
Eh? Asshole? You're so mean.

259
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:23,363
- Yes.
- I've been worried about that.

260
00:18:23,738 --> 00:18:26,485
Mr. Ryoka Kuromiya is here!

261
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,517
Hello! Hello!

262
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:37,640
That's Ryoka Kuromiya.

263
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:45,088
A deserving member of EAST6,
a very popular idol group.

264
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:48,427
(Member of EAST6, selling point: arrogance)
And he comes with feathers.

265
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:49,951
(Ryoka Kuromiya, aged 20)

266
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:54,277
(His solo from the MV of
"One Corner of the World")

267
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:07,876
- Hello. Thank you.
- Hello.

268
00:19:10,353 --> 00:19:12,370
Let's clean up.

269
00:19:13,004 --> 00:19:17,198
Eh? Wait. Is he walking toward me?

270
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:21,277
If I remember correctly,
Kuromiya's selling point is arrogance.

271
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,777
What do I do? I'm afraid to talk to him.

272
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:28,335
- What's up?
- What's up?

273
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:33,005
- My dialogue is very long today.
- Eh? Is that so?

274
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,391
There are about three lines.

275
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,352
I've never counted the lines,
so I don't...

276
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,041
For real? You're
really are a child star.

277
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:48,051
Not at all.

278
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:51,690
Wait. He's easier
to talk to than I thought.

279
00:19:57,748 --> 00:20:02,641
- Oh! Yuijiro, what's up?
- What's up?

280
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,285
When a rising star
standing next to a top idol...

281
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:33,535
the feathers look five times more sparkling.

282
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:39,291
It's so blindingly bright!

283
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:43,351
- Let's clean up, guys.
- Thank you for throwing the feathers.

284
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:48,017
- You two don't have to help.
- We're very honored.

285
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:59,467
- So what were you guys discussing?
- What's that?

286
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:06,775
You were talking to
Hajime Aoyanagi earlier.

287
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,681
Why are you calling his name so curtly?

288
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,965
Nothing. I just thought
it looked like a fun conversation.

289
00:21:16,202 --> 00:21:19,312
I told him I got three lines today.

290
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:21,483
- Lines?
- My dialogue.

291
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,538
Don't count it in lines.

292
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:29,682
That's hilarious.
He said the same thing.

293
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:35,180
Are you serious?!

294
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:39,539
Is it that shocking?

295
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:46,374
My brain and
Hajime Aoyanagi's brain are in sync!

296
00:21:47,443 --> 00:21:48,625
Kuromiya?

297
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:03,057
- Thanks a lot.
- Eh? Why are you thanking me?

298
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:17,839
What are you doing? We're at work.

299
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,942
Well, I'm your trainer.

300
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:30,128
And what are you training me?

301
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:35,084
I want us to be
close as we once were.

302
00:22:36,435 --> 00:22:37,930
Why are you saying this now?

303
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:44,188
- That works. That works.
- That works.

304
00:22:44,602 --> 00:22:48,078
- Next scene.
- Prepare the next scene.

305
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:51,313
- You must be tired.
- How are you guys?

306
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:56,488
- You two were really good just now.
- Thank you very much.

307
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,020
Looking at you now...

308
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:04,017
the Mitsutani role

309
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:08,701
is really right for Aoyanagi.

310
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:09,729
I'm glad.

311
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,952
Do you agree, Akafuji?

312
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:19,648
Akafuji must feel uncomfortable
getting asked that.

313
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:23,576
Yes. He's very cute.
So cute I want to take home.

314
00:23:25,717 --> 00:23:28,557
Take home?

315
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:33,432
Shit. I freaking slipped.

316
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:38,600
- Uh, I just meant...
- That's awesome, Akafuji.

317
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,627
Eh?

318
00:23:39,637 --> 00:23:42,173
You've become Momoshiro
with his advances.

319
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:44,300
Uh, yes.

320
00:23:45,182 --> 00:23:49,000
I think being in character
at all times is important.

321
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:51,406
I see.

322
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,667
- That was close.
- How will Mitsutani respond? Huh?

323
00:23:57,675 --> 00:23:59,777
Oh, you're right.

324
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:10,787
Stop talking.

325
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:13,654
I'm not "cute."

326
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:17,943
I'm "cool."

327
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:21,665
Sorry.

328
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:32,976
Ah! Your response is so Mitsutani,
the former delinquent. Wonderful!

329
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,723
- Thank you very much.
- Can I...

330
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:43,330
- Can I record what you just said?
- Eh?

331
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,713
To build on my character.

332
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,351
Fantastic.

333
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:52,953
Sure.

334
00:24:53,068 --> 00:24:57,273
- Everyone! Please be quiet.
- You got it!

335
00:25:01,388 --> 00:25:02,490
Please.

336
00:25:05,894 --> 00:25:07,017
Stop talking.

337
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:09,483
I'm not cute.

338
00:25:10,394 --> 00:25:11,760
I'm cool.

339
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,901
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

340
00:25:18,114 --> 00:25:20,480
- Wait.
- Camera three. Camera three.

341
00:25:20,498 --> 00:25:23,887
If you don't mind,
can you say one more line?

342
00:25:25,932 --> 00:25:27,636
Sure.

343
00:25:27,714 --> 00:25:29,098
(Hajime Aoyanagi)

344
00:25:29,184 --> 00:25:32,559
(I don't like you not even a little.)

345
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:38,026
(Stop talking. I'm not cute. I'm cool.)

346
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:42,231
(I don't like you not even a little.)

347
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:48,219
(Stop talking. I'm not cute. I'm cool.)

348
00:25:48,302 --> 00:25:53,535
- Uh...
- Looks like everyone's going out after.

349
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,597
- (I'm not cute. I'm cool.)
- Going out with Hajime Aoyanagi?

350
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:01,699
- (I don't like you not even a little.)
- Huh?!

351
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:10,255
- Cheers!
- It's my only choice.

352
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,021
- Lower your voice. Calm down.
- Try to understand.

353
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:19,854
- Let's drink.
- You calm down, too.

354
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:27,019
This looks delicious too.
Want to order anything else?

355
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:33,417
- Won't you order some more?
- Are you doing okay?

356
00:26:33,464 --> 00:26:38,444
Argh! How should I break the ice?

357
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:41,448
(Hajime Aoyanagi, Special Interview)

358
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,166
That's right.

359
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:47,971
Think of it as a long interview.

360
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:52,522
I'll be the reporter. I'll be the reporter.
I will be the reporter!

361
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:57,476
Uh, are you gonna order drinks?

362
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:59,022
Eh?

363
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:02,445
Maybe order some soft drinks.

364
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:05,648
How did you know
I don't like hard liquor?

365
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,500
You haven't drunk alcohol during toasts.

366
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,020
I can't tell him an article in
a celebrity magazine from three years ago

367
00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:17,232
says Hajime Aoyanagi
doesn't like hard liquor.

368
00:27:18,981 --> 00:27:23,247
He really is a star.
He's very observant.

369
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:28,365
Here. What would you like to drink?

370
00:27:29,205 --> 00:27:31,265
Uh...

371
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:36,733
At a time like this,
most people would suggest orange juice.

372
00:27:38,584 --> 00:27:42,378
(Apple juice)
What about apple juice?

373
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:45,015
Why?

374
00:27:45,484 --> 00:27:50,874
Uh, I've kept seeing
that promotional sign.

375
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:57,036
Shit. I'm gonna be caught
that I've been watching him.

376
00:27:57,061 --> 00:28:02,315
I see. He's truly observant.

377
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:06,537
- Did I guess wrong?
- No.

378
00:28:07,948 --> 00:28:12,483
I remind people of that orange juice
commercial from my childhood

379
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:15,389
so people usually order me orange juice.

380
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:18,026
♪ Dai Dai Orange Juice ♪

381
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:22,106
When I actually want to
order something else,

382
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:23,923
but I don't dare tell them.

383
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:30,956
Shit. What am I saying to a superstar?

384
00:28:30,981 --> 00:28:35,047
Excuse me. Could I get
one apple juice and two lemon sours?

385
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:36,072
Yes.

386
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:38,641
- I understand.
- Eh?

387
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:41,649
I was in a cider commercial once.

388
00:28:41,674 --> 00:28:46,278
When I go out with actor friends,
they would order me cider to tease me.

389
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:51,415
I like cider, but I don't want
to drink it all the time.

390
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,511
But I feel guilty toward the sponsor,
so I'd end up drinking it.

391
00:28:57,371 --> 00:29:00,921
Even you have the same idea as I do.

392
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:05,804
- Of course I do.
- Is that so?

393
00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:08,148
That's quite reassuring.

394
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:13,714
- Excuse me. Your orders.
- Thank you.

395
00:29:23,957 --> 00:29:27,101
- Akafuji?
- Yes?

396
00:29:32,864 --> 00:29:36,945
- Let's make this drama good.
- Yes.

397
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,703
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

398
00:29:51,075 --> 00:29:55,332
I have to think like Mitsutani
all day like you do your character.

399
00:29:56,505 --> 00:30:00,352
Argh. Why did you say that?

400
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:04,942
Ah, what a precious interview.

401
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:08,796
Lord Buddha, God Almighty,
thank you very much.

402
00:30:08,863 --> 00:30:12,207
I don't want anything more.

403
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:22,482
Sorry, Akafuji. I can't anymore.

404
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:32,118
Oh, jeez, Hajime.

405
00:30:34,892 --> 00:30:39,305
But I can rest assured
since you live together.

406
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:41,872
Eh?

407
00:30:41,897 --> 00:30:48,415
Please put my precious
Hajime to bed, okay?

408
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:50,668
Oh, my God.

409
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,585
Yes.

410
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:58,357
What is this? A Mission: Impossible?

411
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:07,078
- Thank you very much. We're here.
- Mm.

412
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,984
Argh, his warmth!

413
00:31:20,427 --> 00:31:23,682
I'm Tom Cruise from
"Mission: Impossible."

414
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:25,929
Yujiro Hanma from "Baki the Grappler."

415
00:31:25,954 --> 00:31:28,414
And Giant...

416
00:31:30,544 --> 00:31:33,219
from the feature film!

417
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:10,298
That's a relief.
My heart's still beating.

418
00:32:11,615 --> 00:32:17,474
Him sleeping on my shoulder. His warmth
and breathing sound while he was asleep.

419
00:32:17,747 --> 00:32:21,323
It went beyond 3D and 4D

420
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:25,327
to Hajime Aoyanagi in 4DX!

421
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:30,815
When I close my eyes, I see
my great-grandmother in the hereafter

422
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,516
(Yuijiro Akafuji's great-grandmother)
waving at me.

423
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:35,633
Huh?

424
00:32:38,175 --> 00:32:41,801
- Are you okay?
- Oh.

425
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:42,801
Eh?

426
00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:47,490
Looks like you
accidentally consumed alcohol.

427
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:51,767
Oh? Is that so? I'm sorry.

428
00:32:51,828 --> 00:32:55,771
- I'm gonna borrow your couch.
- You'll get sored sleeping there.

429
00:32:55,796 --> 00:32:58,268
- Let's share the bed.
- I can't sleep with you.

430
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:01,218
- Oh?
- Please excuse me.

431
00:33:01,232 --> 00:33:04,122
You don't want to
sleep with me that much?

432
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:08,654
Eh? It's not that I don't want to.

433
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:11,876
If you hate me, just say it.

434
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:22,335
Me hating you, Hajime Aoyanagi?

435
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:27,530
You told me to stay out of your sight.

436
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:35,117
Eh? That was because
Hajime Aoyanagi was so blindingly bright.

437
00:33:40,111 --> 00:33:41,841
Please forgive me!

438
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:47,192
I don't hate you! I was just
so nervous I accidentally offended you!

439
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:50,493
Nervous?

440
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:55,372
Eh? You feel nervous
around a homely actor like me?

441
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,946
What did you just say?

442
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:02,325
Hajime Aoyanagi is super cool.

443
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:05,683
You were cool
when you were a child star.

444
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:10,195
And now your acting has improved.

445
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:15,019
Like at the shoot today,
you were so natural being Mitsutani.

446
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:23,749
I could never copy that kind of acting.

447
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:33,816
If you don't believe me,
I'll show it to you.

448
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:37,254
- Like scene 25 we filmed today.
- Uh, thanks.

449
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:42,820
That's okay. I understand now
that you don't hate me.

450
00:34:44,103 --> 00:34:47,176
I'm kissing the hands of...

451
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,141
Hajime Aoyanagi.

452
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:54,064
Eh?

453
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:57,184
Akafuji?

454
00:34:59,232 --> 00:35:01,169
He probably fell asleep.

455
00:35:32,388 --> 00:35:36,841
I kissed Hajime Aoyanagi's palm.

456
00:35:37,058 --> 00:35:40,396
How could I not faint?

457
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:43,364
Then you're screwed.

458
00:35:43,364 --> 00:35:46,657
- Huh?
- The final script of the next episode?

459
00:35:48,024 --> 00:35:51,599
There's a kissing scene.

460
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:53,688
(They get closer and kiss.)

461
00:35:53,786 --> 00:35:54,786
Huh?

462
00:36:00,132 --> 00:36:01,132
Am I...

463
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:04,149
gonna die?

464
00:36:06,178 --> 00:36:10,803
If you don't wanna die,
get familiar with Mr. Aoyanagi.

465
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,171
Yes.

466
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:23,973
(They get closer and kiss.)

467
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:24,998
Eh?

468
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:31,207
Hey! Wait! I said wait!

469
00:36:32,184 --> 00:36:35,328
I hate people like you the most!

470
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:46,282
Yes! Okay!

471
00:36:46,695 --> 00:36:48,387
Yes!

472
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:51,617
I held eye contact
more than five seconds!

473
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:52,754
Next scene!

474
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,623
- Can we talk?
- Yes.

475
00:36:57,678 --> 00:37:01,914
What do you think if I twirl
my hair like this when I'm bashful?

476
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:04,150
That's very Mitsutani.

477
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:07,265
That's a relief.
I'll run it by the director.

478
00:37:07,304 --> 00:37:13,457
I'm not fainting
even when he's within a foot.

479
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:16,797
I'm so good! I'm the best!

480
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:18,711
- By the way, Akafuji.
- Yes?

481
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:21,386
After we ate,
let's rehearse the next episode.

482
00:37:23,304 --> 00:37:25,160
No need to wait.

483
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:28,538
Let's do it now.

484
00:37:28,753 --> 00:37:30,940
Thanks.

485
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:40,940
I didn't think he meant
the scene where I press him on the bed.

486
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:43,459
- Are you up to it?
- Yes.

487
00:37:44,124 --> 00:37:47,092
I wanted to check
the pacing of this scene.

488
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:50,876
It's Mitsutani's first confession,
so I thought it was important.

489
00:37:51,424 --> 00:37:53,139
You're right.

490
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,810
Mr. Hajime, what if I
turn into a bad person?

491
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:01,091
So, start with your dialogue.

492
00:38:03,435 --> 00:38:04,435
Yes.

493
00:38:06,753 --> 00:38:11,190
I like you, Mitsutani.

494
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:17,830
Tell me you don't do this
with other co-stars.

495
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:22,777
Get off me. Why are you making
a love confession right now?

496
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:30,902
Why are you messing
with my head like this?!

497
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:35,834
You're messing with my head
all the time, Mr. Hajime!

498
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:41,049
If you like me too, then tell me.

499
00:38:42,748 --> 00:38:43,748
I...

500
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:49,076
don't want to like you
more than I already do.

501
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:00,608
I'm afraid my feelings
won't be reciprocated.

502
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,999
I'm afraid, too.

503
00:39:15,446 --> 00:39:16,683
Akafuji?

504
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:18,934
Yes?

505
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:21,722
The next line is yours.

506
00:39:22,972 --> 00:39:24,633
I'm sorry.

507
00:39:25,411 --> 00:39:27,899
Don't be. It's a serious scene.

508
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:30,242
You must have felt shy
and forgot your line.

509
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:31,329
Yes.

510
00:39:35,564 --> 00:39:38,397
It's not just you. It's not just you.

511
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:46,737
It's not just you.
It's not just you. It's not just you.

512
00:39:53,761 --> 00:40:01,339
How do I train myself to get familiar
with Hajime Aoyanagi?

513
00:40:10,304 --> 00:40:12,960
The kissing scene?

514
00:40:21,406 --> 00:40:25,664
- Hajime Aoyanagi?
- Yeah, it's worrying.

515
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:29,355
Mr. Yayoi's bold.
I wouldn't be able to do it.

516
00:40:29,414 --> 00:40:32,974
Yeah, even though
his appearance is right for the role,

517
00:40:33,008 --> 00:40:35,078
we don't know if he'll draw the viewers.

518
00:40:35,156 --> 00:40:38,691
They must rely on Akayu.

519
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:45,185
- It's up to Akayu.
- Yes, even though we shouldn't say it.

520
00:40:49,897 --> 00:40:54,956
(Must they adapt it into a live action?)
(It's up to the cast.)

521
00:40:55,014 --> 00:40:59,956
(So worried.) (So afraid.)
(The live-action version scares me the most.)

522
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:08,022
The cast will be announced tomorrow.

523
00:41:08,804 --> 00:41:14,546
What if #WeDon'tWantHajimeAoyanagi
starts trending? What then?

524
00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:20,859
No. There's no point
in worrying about it.

525
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:34,218
(They get closer and kiss.)

526
00:41:38,398 --> 00:41:40,664
A kissing scene?

527
00:41:45,867 --> 00:41:50,066
- I'm back, Mr. Hajime.
- You're back?

528
00:41:54,391 --> 00:41:56,434
What's wrong?

529
00:41:58,105 --> 00:41:59,383
The kissing scene.

530
00:42:01,931 --> 00:42:03,543
The kissing scene.

531
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:07,251
I'm horrible in kissing scenes.

532
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:11,630
My first time I did so many takes
the girl laughed at me.

533
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,306
Is that so?

534
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:17,269
My ex told me I was bad.

535
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:20,595
I must be a horrible kisser.

536
00:42:21,376 --> 00:42:24,222
- Your ex?
- Mm.

537
00:42:25,649 --> 00:42:26,634
His ex?

538
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:29,404
I feel embarrassed talking about this.

539
00:42:29,404 --> 00:42:30,476
His ex?

540
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:33,431
His ex?

541
00:42:34,404 --> 00:42:35,664
Uh...

542
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,089
By "my ex,"

543
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:42,214
you meant a female lover in the past?

544
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:45,964
Mm. That's right.

545
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,380
His ex.

546
00:42:48,939 --> 00:42:51,763
It feels weird asking you
who's younger than me.

547
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:54,594
But if you have a trick, please share.

548
00:42:56,379 --> 00:42:57,379
His ex.

549
00:42:58,066 --> 00:42:59,268
Akafuji?

550
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:02,886
His ex.

551
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:05,622
His ex.

552
00:43:08,356 --> 00:43:09,356
So...

553
00:43:14,143 --> 00:43:15,430
would you like to try?

554
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,317
Eh?

555
00:43:18,204 --> 00:43:19,904
Rehearsing the kissing scene, I mean.

556
00:45:03,195 --> 00:45:06,225
(Next episode)
Why is my heart beating so fast?

557
00:45:06,622 --> 00:45:08,788
Kissing Hajime Aoyanagi.

558
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:09,909
Awesome!

559
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,840
It can't be helped that you like him.

560
00:45:11,886 --> 00:45:13,278
Just don't go too far.

561
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:17,581
I'm sorry, Akafuji. I lied.
