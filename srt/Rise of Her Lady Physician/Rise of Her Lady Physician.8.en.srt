00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,980
=Rise of Her Lady Physician=

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,340
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=My Body Is of No Use to the Morgue=

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,400
It tastes so bitter.

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,840
Looks like it's the one
where I added Coptis.

6
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,800
With such bitter medicine,

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,080
why didn't Her Highness make a scene?

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
What's going on?

9
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,660
(Imperial Kitchen)

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,720
(It's midnight.)

11
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,360
(What is she doing in the kitchen?)

12
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,040
(She didn't get punished after
delivering medicine to Her Highness.)

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,440
(Is it)

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,120
(because of the box in her hand?)

15
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,640
Your Highness.

16
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,560
Everyone, leave.

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
- Aye.
- Aye.

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,920
Attendant Rong,

19
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,520
what did you bring today?

20
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,000
It's bitter!

21
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,280
Miss Lan.

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,720
Please.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,870
Your Highness,

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,080
please take some medicine.

25
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,350
If this goes on,

26
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,200
your illness will become worse!

27
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,480
I won't drink it!

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,960
Pour it out right now!

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,280
Stop talking,

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
or I'll give you strokes

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,760
and kick you out of the palace!

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,680
Your Highness, mercy!

33
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,230
I'll pour it out.

34
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,080
Your Highness.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,880
Wow!

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,920
These things suit my taste the most.

37
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,160
Miss, wait a minute.

38
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,720
What's wrong?

39
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,960
Attendant Rong sent me here.

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,440
She can't come in person today,

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
so she asked me to wait here for you.

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,760
Attendant Rong knows that you love

43
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,160
the pastries from Laifeng Tower,

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,960
so she asked someone to bring it back
from outside the palace

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,360
to express her gratitude.

46
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,000
What do you mean?

47
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,240
Please don't worry.

48
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,400
Attendant Rong asked me
to wait here for you,

49
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,520
which means she's told me everything.

50
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,120
How could she tell others?

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,520
If people find out,

52
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,000
we'll both be executed!

53
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,400
(Rong Zelan,)

54
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,480
(I knew you had secrets.)

55
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,880
We've all had a hard time

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,720
dealing with Her Highness.

57
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,480
Thanks to you, we've managed

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,840
to resolve this matter.

59
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,640
Please take the pastries.

60
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,000
You need to tell Attendant Rong

61
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,560
we can't keep hiding the fact

62
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,880
that we've allowed Her Highness

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,400
to eat candles and paper

64
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
instead of taking medicine.

65
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,320
This is just expedient.

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,280
Ask her to quickly think of another way.

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,240
Okay.

68
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
I'll definitely tell her.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,840
Thank you.

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,520
(Rong Zelan,)

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,640
(you had this coming,)

72
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,400
(so don't blame me.)

73
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,920
Minister Wu!

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
Something's wrong!

75
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,400
I found that Rong Zelan

76
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,920
didn't administer medicine
to Her Highness

77
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,760
but poured out all of it

78
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,480
and even secretly allowed her
to eat those objects.

79
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,440
For everyone's safety and well-being,

80
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,040
please stop her, Minister Wu!

81
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,480
This is way out of line!

82
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,680
How dare she mess with Consort Li?

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,760
Lord Wu, this is serious.

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,960
We must deal with it now.

85
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,120
Your Majesty,

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,200
Your Grace.

87
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,240
Attendant Rong,

88
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,160
you've performed well these days.

89
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,440
Thank you, Your Grace.

90
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,480
It is my duty to prepare medicine

91
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,880
and heal Her Highness.

92
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,280
Come on, Jinyi.

93
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Your Grace, wait.

94
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,800
Mother,

95
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,440
it is too bitter.

96
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,080
I don't want to drink it.

97
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,720
Rong Zelan,

98
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,760
why is Jinyi unwilling to
drink it again?

99
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,160
Your Majesty, Your Grace,

100
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,120
well...

101
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,080
Your Majesty, Your Grace,

102
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
Minister Wu has

103
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,920
something to report.

104
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,080
Let him in.

105
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,600
Aye.

106
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,640
Your Majesty,

107
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
Your Grace.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,840
Minister Wu,

109
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,280
why did you come here

110
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,920
in such a hurry?

111
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,360
Your Majesty,

112
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,080
I'm here for Her Highness's illness.

113
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,040
These days, she's gotten better

114
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,720
after taking medicine.

115
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,120
Thank you.

116
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,560
Feng Yin,

117
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,840
tell His Majesty and Her Grace

118
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,640
what you discovered.

119
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,200
Greetings,

120
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,160
Your Majesty,

121
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,200
Your Grace.

122
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,560
Your Majesty,

123
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,960
Attendant Rong has been deceiving you.

124
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Her Highness hasn't
truly taken her medicine.

125
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,160
Is this true?

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,440
Your Majesty, perhaps

127
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,480
Attendant Rong feared
she'd be punished because Her Highness

128
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,720
wouldn't take medicine,

129
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,080
so she ordered the maid
to pour out the medicine

130
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,560
and even prepared
objects such as candles and paper

131
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,880
for Her Highness to eat every day.

132
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,680
Lan.

133
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,640
Your Majesty, mercy!

134
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,320
Attendant Rong did tell me
to pour the medicine into the flowerpot

135
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,200
and brought candles and paper every day
for Her Highness to eat.

136
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
I didn't stop it.

137
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,040
I deserve death!

138
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,800
Rong Zelan,

139
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,920
how dare you harm the princess?

140
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,600
Your Majesty,

141
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,600
please hear me out.

142
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,560
I did pour out the medicine,

143
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,920
but I meant no harm to Her Highness.

144
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,040
You lowly servant!

145
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,400
How dare you deceive me?

146
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,760
Minister Wu, quickly check the princess.

147
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,560
If anything happens to her,

148
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,240
none of you can get away with it!

149
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,700
Guards,

150
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,560
drag this audacious, lowly servant out

151
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,200
and beat her to death!

152
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,920
Your Majesty, please allow me to explain!

153
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,040
Wait!

154
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,920
Your Majesty,

155
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,840
perhaps that's not the entire truth.

156
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,280
Why not let her finish?

157
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,870
Attendant Rong,

158
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,040
how do you prove you meant

159
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,240
no harm to Her Highness?

160
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,200
Your Majesty, Your Grace,

161
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,960
Her Highness's pulse is steady.

162
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,000
She's indeed getting better.

163
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,270
How strange.

164
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,560
Rong Zelan,

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,840
what exactly did you give Her Highness?

166
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,080
Rong Zelan,

167
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,720
did you perform sorceries in the palace?

168
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Your Majesty,

169
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,720
Your Grace,

170
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,280
I only gave Her Highness

171
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,680
these small pastries.

172
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,100
(Imperial Kitchen)

173
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,400
My Lord,

174
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,720
could you please help me

175
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,680
prepare some pastries every day

176
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,240
according to this recipe?

177
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,440
It's inappropriate.

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,840
Please help me.

179
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,520
Alright then.

180
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,100
Why is it you again?

181
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,320
I won't take the medicine!

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Get out of here!

183
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,480
I don't want to see you!

184
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Your Highness, I brought something fun.

185
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,560
If you don't like it,

186
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,880
I'll leave right away.

187
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,200
Really?

188
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,080
Then take it out and show me.

189
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,760
Your Highness, do you want to see
a small trick?

190
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,760
Three,

191
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,960
two,

192
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,000
one.

193
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,360
Wow!

194
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,800
My favorite candles and paper!

195
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
So delicious!

196
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,240
How did you turn the medicine
into candles and paper?

197
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Please tell me.

198
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,160
It's a secret.

199
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,800
You must keep the secret.

200
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
Otherwise, it won't work anymore.

201
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,110
Okay.

202
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,080
Lan, do not tell anyone.

203
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,440
Aye.

204
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,000
So good.

205
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,880
Your Majesty.

206
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,480
This is a candle-shaped candy,

207
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,320
and the paper

208
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
is not real either

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,760
but glutinous rice paper.

210
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,400
(How's that possible?)

211
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,000
Lord Wu,

212
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,440
you can check it.

213
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,740
Your Majesty,

214
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,360
it is indeed edible,

215
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,280
non-toxic,

216
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,360
and seemingly

217
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,320
of medicinal benefits.

218
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,160
Your Majesty,

219
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,000
Your Grace,

220
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,000
I noticed that Her Highness's
face was sallow,

221
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,240
her body emaciated,

222
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,200
and she ate unusual things.

223
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,880
This is a deficiency disorder

224
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,320
due to an innate weakness.

225
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,440
Ordinary medicine
tends to be strong and harsh

226
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,000
and might hurt her spleen and stomach.

227
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,000
Moreover, she refused to take medicine.

228
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,760
Therefore, I decided

229
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,480
to use food therapy instead,

230
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,760
making pastries
with the nourishing medicine.

231
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,480
Then I asked the eunuch in the kitchen

232
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,120
to make them into candles and paper.

233
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,680
I used food instead

234
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,200
to balance her inner energy.

235
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,840
Your Majesty,

236
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,520
she's just a medical attendant,

237
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,640
yet she tampered with
the prescribed decoction

238
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,640
and offered common street food
to the noble princess.

239
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,640
The Imperial Medicinal Canon mandates

240
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,080
that all medicines and food

241
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,440
must be tested for toxicity.

242
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,200
She disregarded the regulations,

243
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,280
delivered food to Her Highness
without the inspection of the bureau,

244
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,680
and deceived His Majesty!

245
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,120
We have strict rules.

246
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
If we make an exception,

247
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,360
I fear evildoers may poison meals

248
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,160
and endanger the royal bloodline.

249
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,880
Your Majesty,

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,200
the Imperial Medical Bureau
is in charge of the medical affairs.

251
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,560
No severe punishment for this defiance,

252
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,400
no established rules in the palace.

253
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,200
Please punish her severely!

254
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,480
Strip her medical registry

255
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
and cast her out

256
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,760
to uphold the regulations!

257
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,400
Your Majesty,

258
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,920
I may have violated the regulations,

259
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,880
but I healed Her Highness.

260
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,680
I beg for your mercy.

261
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,720
Please don't expel me.

262
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,400
Your Majesty,

263
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,360
although she violated the rules,

264
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,880
she managed to cure Her Highness's
long illness with food therapy,

265
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,280
showcasing her benevolence.

266
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,200
Lord Feng is worried about

267
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,400
the foundation of the state.

268
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,560
However, treatment requires adaptability.

269
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,280
If we only cling to

270
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,480
rigid protocols when facing

271
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,440
puzzling maladies,

272
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,720
our imperial lineage might be in danger.

273
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,080
Your Majesty, I boldly ask you

274
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,240
to pardon her minor fault

275
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,200
in light of her merits.

276
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,880
Thus, all imperial physicians
will exert their utmost effort

277
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,200
and use innovative approaches.

278
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,120
It'll be a blessing for the royal family.

279
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,000
Then what do you think

280
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,640
I should do about her?

281
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,520
Demote her and send her

282
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,600
to the Ji'an Office

283
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,560
to not only uphold the regulations

284
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,960
but also preserve
the compassion of a healer.

285
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,760
If she truly reforms her ways and

286
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,720
performs exceptional deeds,

287
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,200
she may also be promoted.

288
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,840
Let it be done, then.

289
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,880
Thanks for your mercy, Your Majesty!

290
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,360
Lord Song, thank you
for defending me today.

291
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,040
It's a debt I can never repay.

292
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,840
If you need me
for anything in the future,

293
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,320
please ask freely.

294
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,440
I ask nothing of you

295
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,160
but simply want to help you.

296
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,160
If you don't believe me,

297
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,040
just take it as

298
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,840
a favor in return for keeping

299
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,080
my secret.

300
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,990
Rest assured, My Lord.

301
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,600
As long as your affairs
do not cross my interests,

302
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,560
I'll definitely keep your secret.

303
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,000
Do you mean...

304
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,240
if I get in your way,

305
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
you'll turn against me?

306
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,920
Aren't you afraid that

307
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,280
I might drag you down to die with me?

308
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,080
If you wanted to,

309
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,720
you wouldn't have helped me today.

310
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,080
Forget it.

311
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,800
Hope you don't

312
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,080
die in the Ji'an Office.

313
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,480
I wonder if I can

314
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,400
see you again
in the Imperial Medical Bureau.

315
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,800
Don't worry, Lord Song.

316
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,240
The Ji'an Office
is essentially a morgue.

317
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
My body is of no use to it.

318
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,560
I will come back alive.
