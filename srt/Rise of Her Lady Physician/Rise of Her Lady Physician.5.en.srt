00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=Not a Troublemaker, but Never a Coward!=

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,160
When did we

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,560
recruit a female officer?

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,480
Tell me,

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
who are you?

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,000
Why did you disguise yourself

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,160
and sneak into the Men's Bathhouse?

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,160
I...

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,120
I'm exhausted.

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,200
Need to take a good bath.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,240
Yes.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,400
Hide inside.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,160
You must be new
to the Imperial Medical Bureau.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,230
I haven't seen you before.

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,100
That's right.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,720
Have you had dinner?

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,840
Of course.

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,880
It's already past

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,000
dinner time.

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,480
Brother,

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,920
why are you taking a bath
with your clothes on?

24
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,280
I can wash my clothes.

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,920
It's convenient.

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,880
Do you want to try?

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,640
That won't be necessary.

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,760
Forget it.

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,960
That's interesting.

30
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,800
Who are you?

31
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,940
(Emperor of Great Liang)

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,440
Greetings

33
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,250
(Song Lingxiao, Heir of Marquis Xuanping)
to

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,400
Your Majesty.

35
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,680
Get up.

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,200
Everyone, step back.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,240
Aye.

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,560
Come on, get up.

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,760
It's been years.

40
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,480
Let me take a good look at you, Nephew.

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,280
You've really grown up.

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,280
By the way,

43
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,600
is your mother doing well in Jiangnan?

44
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,200
Thanks for your concern.

45
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,280
She is doing well.

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,470
Before I set out,

47
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,440
she told me

48
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,000
to convey her greetings to you.

49
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,480
May you enjoy good health.

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,720
I am doing well.

51
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,000
Lingxiao,

52
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,920
as stated in the letter,

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,960
in recent years,
many of my children have died young.

54
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,120
I've been investigating it,

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,760
only to find it somehow

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,480
related to the Imperial Medical Bureau.

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,800
My mother and my queen
live in the inner palace,

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,120
with their every move under close watch.

59
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,920
If they were to investigate this,

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,720
it'd surely alert the enemy.

61
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,160
I've been thinking about it.

62
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,360
You are the most suitable person
for this matter.

63
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,440
Although you do not know medicine,

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
you are exceptionally smart.

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,840
If you infiltrate the bureau in disguise,

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,000
you'll surely uncover some clues.

67
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,320
Please rest assured.

68
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,280
I will spare no effort

69
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,720
to uncover the truth.

70
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
Remember,

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,280
you must be extremely cautious.

72
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
If you find anything,

73
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,320
you may report to me at any time.

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640
Do not let your guard down.

75
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,020
(Imperial Medical Bureau)

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,920
Hurry up and make the beds.

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,000
Do you know how to make a bed?

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
Hurry up!

79
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,000
Open the door.

80
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,440
What are you doing?

81
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,920
What are you doing?

82
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Open the door.

83
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,120
Oh, Attendant Rong,

84
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,480
the door seems to be broken.

85
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,240
Just find somewhere outside
to sleep tonight.

86
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,440
Yes.

87
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,600
This door just won't open.

88
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,440
I'll find someone to fix it tomorrow.

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,320
Now it's really broken.

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Screw you.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,840
Get off me!

92
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,880
It hurts! What are you doing?

93
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,360
- Attendant Rong!
- Get off me!

94
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,600
We live under the same roof.

95
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,360
Please don't go too far.

96
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,880
Feng Yin, have you got
nothing to do with this?

97
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,320
- Stop playing innocent!
- Stop!

98
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,440
Come out!

99
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,520
What are you going to do?

100
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,770
Get off me!

101
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,600
Get off me!

102
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,720
What are you going to do?

103
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,200
Rong Zelan!

104
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,000
Stop it right now!

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,880
All of you, shut up!

106
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,270
One more word,

107
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,400
and I'll throw her down!

108
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,600
Don't you dare!

109
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,640
If I die,

110
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,480
my family will not let you off!

111
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,800
Do you think I'm scared?

112
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,560
No one can save you.

113
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,520
Attendant Rong,

114
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,920
don't cross the line.

115
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,440
If she dies,

116
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,040
your family will be implicated.

117
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,560
I would love to see

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,840
that happen.

119
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,970
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
I'm so sorry!

121
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,640
Attendant Rong, please

122
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,560
spare me!

123
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,720
I won't do it again!

124
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,080
You provoked me.

125
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,640
Do you think I'll let you off so easily?

126
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,400
Attendant Rong, I'm sorry!

127
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,200
Please spare me!

128
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,240
I'm really sorry!

129
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll never do it again!

130
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,080
Please spare me!

131
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,760
I'm begging you!

132
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,400
I'm begging you!

133
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,520
I'm stubborn by nature

134
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,720
and as fierce as fire.

135
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,360
I'm not a troublemaker,

136
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,960
but never a coward.

137
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,360
I came here to study medicine.

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,240
I'm not going to waste my time on you.

139
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,680
Today, I will make myself clear.

140
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,640
From now on, let's stay out of
each other's way.

141
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,840
If anyone dares to provoke me again,

142
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,600
they will end up like her.

143
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,760
(Rong Zelan,)

144
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,440
(how dare you be so arrogant?)

145
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,400
(Do you think I have no way
to deal with you?)

146
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,440
(Imperial Medical Bureau)
Today, Lord Feng will assign us tasks.

147
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,520
I hope to get a good post.

148
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,480
Let me introduce him.

149
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,520
This is Song Lingxiao, a new

150
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,640
medical officer.

151
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,480
Greetings, Lord Song.

152
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,380
Today,

153
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,600
I will assign you

154
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,400
your routine tasks.

155
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,760
Keep in mind

156
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,560
that we bear great responsibilities.

157
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,560
You must not slack off.

158
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,160
Aye.

159
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,480
Feng Yin,

160
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,080
go to the Imperial Pharmacy

161
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,560
to assist second-class attendants

162
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,640
in managing and organizing
medicinal materials.

163
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,360
Yes.

164
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,160
Attendant Feng,

165
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,200
I really envy you.

166
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,520
Though a newcomer,

167
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,640
you can go to the Imperial Pharmacy
to oversee valuable herbs.

168
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,680
You'll certainly achieve great things.

169
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,480
Attendant Feng, when you succeed,

170
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,640
don't forget about us.

171
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,160
Chen Hongyu,

172
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,120
Rong Zelan,

173
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,200
Su Ye,

174
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,120
and Liu Qinghe,

175
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,800
you're responsible for
cleaning the courtyard.

176
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,320
(If it's only cleaning the courtyard,)

177
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,520
(when will I be promoted to
second-class attendant?)

178
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,920
Minister Feng,

179
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,720
I'm also skilled at identifying herbs.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,320
Is there a chance for me
to work at the Imperial Pharmacy?

181
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,910
Some people

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,040
just don't know their place,

183
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,840
even thinking about being
on equal footing with Attendant Feng.

184
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,280
What a joke.

185
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,200
Rong Zelan,

186
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,080
have you no manners?

187
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,160
You'll do whatever I tell you to do!

188
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,280
This is not somewhere
you can pick and choose.

189
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,280
Minister, you're right.

190
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,480
However, I still have a doubt.

191
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,440
Could you please enlighten me?

192
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,560
Say it.

193
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
As the old saying goes,
fine birds choose trees,

194
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,720
and great healers choose positions.

195
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,440
Does the bureau select talents

196
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,240
by virtue and ability?

197
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,880
Yes. So what?

198
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,310
Attendant Feng made a misjudgment

199
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,360
about the Cistanche.

200
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,040
Fortunately, I corrected it in time

201
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
and avoided misuse of herbs.

202
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,040
Minister, could you please

203
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,760
judge clearly about my ability?

204
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,680
As the vice minister,

205
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,400
Lord Feng has his principles.

206
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,720
Rong Zelan,

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,840
are you

208
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,720
questioning Lord Feng?

209
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,680
I wouldn't dare.

210
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,320
I'm abiding by the rules
and rectifying the canon of medicine

211
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
by discerning the false
and preserving the true.

212
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,840
If I were to remain silent
about a misjudgment,

213
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,960
it'd place you in an unjust position.

214
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,840
Minister Feng is an imperial official.

215
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,160
He certainly abides by the law and codes.

216
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,480
I really admire you

217
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,840
for your ability to identify herbs.

218
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,480
There's always something
one can learn from others.

219
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,920
If we both work at the Imperial Pharmacy,

220
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,920
we'll learn from each other,

221
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,720
and it'll demonstrate
Minister Feng's wisdom in using people.

222
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040
I can wait until
the three-month term is over,

223
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,120
after which the ministers may personally

224
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,480
examine us and let the best one stay.

225
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay.

226
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,320
In that case,

227
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,520
you two will both identify herbs
in the Imperial Pharmacy.

228
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,720
If anything goes wrong,

229
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,200
you'll both be severely punished!

230
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,360
Yes.

231
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,600
Thank you, Minister Feng.

232
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,160
Thank you, Attendant Feng.

233
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,120
I'm looking forward to

234
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,360
working with you.

235
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,840
(Enjoy your good days while you can,)

236
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
(because soon,)

237
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,720
(I will make sure you have no place)

238
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,720
(in the Imperial Medical Bureau anymore.)

239
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,480
I didn't expect to find
Manure-prepared Licorice

240
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,440
in the latrine.

241
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,120
What a surprise.

242
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,160
You're not only good at hitting people

243
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
but also sharp-tongued.

244
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
You even made

245
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,320
Lord Feng speechless.

246
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,880
Sorry that I underestimated you.

247
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,120
Lord Song, I'm so flattered.

248
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,960
What is this?

249
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,400
Why does it stink so much?

250
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,320
Take it away!

251
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,720
This is Manure-prepared Licorice.

252
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,520
Place Licorice in bamboo tubes
and bury them in the latrine.

253
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,400
The smell is rather unpleasant,

254
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,400
but it's perfect
for cooling and detoxifying.

255
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,840
As a medical officer,
how could you not know?

256
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,600
That is really weird.

257
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,080
Hmph.

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,280
Manure-prepared Licorice,

259
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,800
I certainly know.

260
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,800
I was just testing you.

261
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,800
After all, you once sneaked into
the Men's Bathhouse

262
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,920
in disguise.

263
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,360
Who knows if you're up to something?

264
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,680
Lord Song, you are overthinking.

265
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,160
I'm a new medical attendant
in the palace.

266
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,080
I got in after multiple rounds of
reviews and examinations,

267
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,920
with a clear background.

268
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,040
However, My Lord,

269
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,880
as a medical officer,

270
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,920
you can do martial arts,

271
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
and your medical skills

272
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,040
are still unclear.

273
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,760
The reason you entered
the Imperial Medical Bureau

274
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,520
really puzzles me.

275
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,400
Attendant Rong, here's

276
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,720
a piece of advice.

277
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,360
Too much curiosity

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,240
might get you into trouble.

279
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,880
You only need to know one thing.

280
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,840
I mean no harm to the bureau.

281
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,120
Yes, My Lord.

282
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,320
Attendant Rong,

283
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
I can sense

284
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,320
a dangerous aura on you.

285
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,960
You'd better

286
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,240
hide yourself well.

287
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
If I catch you one day,

288
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,480
your life will be at risk.

289
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,880
Same advice for you.

290
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,400
After all, I'm not some
meek lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

291
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,440
That's good to know.
