00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,980
=Rise of Her Lady Physician=

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,340
=Episode 26=

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=You Heartless, Venomous Demon!=

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,160
The anesthesia is done.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,680
We shall begin.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,720
The laparotomy knife.

7
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,720
The rib is broken.

8
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,040
It pierced the spleen
and caused bleeding.

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,160
Give me the needle to suture the wound.

10
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,560
What's wrong?

11
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,600
Are you okay?

12
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,640
Come on.

13
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,880
Don't panic.

14
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,140
Zelan,

15
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,000
speed is essential.

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,850
Handle emergencies with decisiveness,

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,720
yet based on careful consideration.

18
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,440
Must not act rashly

19
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,800
to show off one's skill.

20
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,600
How is my son?

21
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,440
His Highness

22
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,080
is dead.

23
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
He died of the deadly poison.

24
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,920
If Her Grace had informed earlier
what poison it was,

25
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,200
he might've had a chance to live.

26
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,240
It's all my fault!

27
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,520
My son died because of me!

28
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,640
Your Grace.

29
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,680
Ten years ago,

30
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,440
how did you frame my mother?

31
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,040
It was you!

32
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,680
Speak!

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,280
How did you know
the poison was Soul-breaking Herb?

34
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,760
And

35
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,320
what's the truth

36
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
about Liu Fuling's matter?

37
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,040
You must make it clear today,

38
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,760
or I won't go easy on you!

39
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,960
Your Majesty, we've discovered why

40
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,960
they fell from horses.

41
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,930
Speak.

42
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,820
We found that

43
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,880
someone added Nine-leaf Vine

44
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,800
into the horse's fodder.

45
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,000
It can make horses go mad.

46
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,480
The First Prince's horse

47
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,760
lost control and went mad,

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,080
which frightened
the Second Prince's horse.

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,360
He failed to control the mad horse

50
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,380
and fell from the horse.

51
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Later, the First Prince's mad horse

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,960
trampled upon the Second Prince.

53
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,200
How could this happen?

54
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,960
I killed my son!

55
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,400
Wretch!

56
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,080
You ordered someone

57
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,280
to drug the fodder, didn't you?

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,440
This is a heinous crime!

59
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,120
You harmed the innocent

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,200
and even attempted to murder my son!

61
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,760
Even a monster wouldn't do that!

62
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,880
I didn't!

63
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,700
I never intended to harm my own son!

64
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,280
Then how could he be poisoned?

65
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
It's all my fault.

66
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,160
I've committed so many evil deeds

67
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,160
that the retribution
has fallen upon my son.

68
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,440
I only

69
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,680
ordered someone to poison
the First Prince's pastries.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,040
I wanted him to be poisoned
and fall from his horse.

71
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,920
I didn't expect
that my son would be poisoned

72
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,240
and fall from the horse!

73
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,080
You...

74
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,730
You're a devil!

75
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,720
Your Majesty.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,880
Based on my investigation,

77
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,340
ten years ago,

78
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,400
when Consort Rou was pregnant,

79
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,600
she was poisoned many times.

80
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,760
Previously in the palace,

81
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,080
many offspring died young

82
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,560
because of Consort Ning
and Feng Mingyuan.

83
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,680
Moreover,

84
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,560
ten years ago, Rong Zelan's mother

85
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,120
discovered

86
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,200
that Consort Ning poisoned Consort Rou,

87
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,400
so she was murdered.

88
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,480
This is the evidence.

89
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,800
Please take a look.

90
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
Your Majesty.

91
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,300
(Ten years ago, someone poisoned
Consort Rou when she was pregnant.)

92
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,940
(Evidence)

93
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,180
(Consort Ning accused Liu Fuling
of harming Her Majesty.)

94
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,560
Now with

95
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,360
the solid evidence,

96
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,520
are you still going to deny it?

97
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,960
There's no point

98
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,520
in hiding it anymore.

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,160
My son is already gone.

100
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
I will tell you

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,320
everything.

102
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,080
Ten years ago,

103
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
Consort Rou got pregnant.

104
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,320
How could I allow her
to give birth to a prince

105
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,120
and threaten my son's future?

106
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,000
I carefully plotted

107
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,240
to take action against her.

108
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,880
But that wretched Liu Fuling

109
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,080
actually discovered it.

110
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
How could I let her ruin my plan?

111
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,480
So, I could only

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,880
shut her mouth forever.

113
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,820
(Ten Years Ago)

114
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,480
Your Majesty!

115
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,320
Your Majesty, are you okay?

116
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,360
What's wrong?

117
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,590
S-Summon the physician!

118
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,160
Your Majesty!

119
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,760
I went to the bureau,

120
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,640
but the physicians on duty
are either missing

121
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
or completely wasted.

122
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,600
What should we do?

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
Hurry to Minister Wu's mansion
outside the palace

124
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,160
and bring him here!

125
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,560
- There's no time.
- Aye.

126
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,840
It's asthma.

127
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,480
(Fortunately, I always
carry some medicine with me.)

128
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,600
Here.

129
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,040
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

130
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,280
Your Majesty!

131
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,840
Her pulse is weak.

132
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,680
Her life is at stake!

133
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,940
Liu Fuling,

134
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,270
what exactly did you do
to Her Majesty?

135
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,600
Lord Feng, I used a method
for treating asthma

136
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,510
to relieve her pain.

137
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,420
How dare you argue?

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,840
His Majesty has arrived!

139
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,040
What happened to her?

140
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,320
Your Majesty, Liu Fuling used medicine
without permission,

141
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,520
and Her Majesty is in a coma

142
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,360
and could die!

143
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,920
This is murder!

144
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,160
Yes, Your Majesty!

145
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,800
Her Majesty was fine,

146
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
but after taking the medicine,

147
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,240
she suddenly fell into a coma!

148
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,810
Guards,

149
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,160
take the murderer down!

150
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,320
Aye!

151
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,440
Your Majesty!

152
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,800
I'm innocent!

153
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,960
Drag her out!

154
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,480
- Fuling!
- Go!

155
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,920
- Fuling!
- Your Majesty!

156
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,040
Your Majesty!

157
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,000
I...

158
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,900
- Your Majesty!
- I'm innocent!

159
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,880
Your Majesty!

160
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,680
Your Majesty!

161
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,680
I'm innocent!

162
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,910
Your Majesty!

163
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,320
Fuling did not harm Her Majesty.

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,400
Please spare her!

165
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,000
Your Majesty!

166
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,020
- Darling, are you okay?
- Hurry!

167
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,280
Help her!

168
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,640
Your Grace!

169
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,600
I poisoned Consort Rou many times,

170
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,240
but Liu Fuling saw them through.

171
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,920
I was planning to take action

172
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,280
after getting rid of Liu Fuling.

173
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,200
Unexpectedly,

174
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,560
Consort Rou had a premature delivery
due to fetal distress,

175
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,920
and it was a daughter!

176
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,920
She couldn't threaten my status,

177
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,040
so I spared her life.

178
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,000
You heartless, venomous demon!

179
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,520
You should rot in hell!
