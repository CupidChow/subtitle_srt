=Why Let Me Drink Something So Disgusting?=

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,080
(Without sense of taste,)

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,880
(how could you name the herbs?)

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,320
This is Lonicera and Forsythia,

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,920
made of

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,760
Honeysuckle Flower,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,520
Forsythia Fruit, Mint Herb,

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,480
Schizonepeta Herb,

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,520
Fermented Soybean,

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,680
Burdock Seed,

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,480
Platycodon Root, Licorice Root,

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,440
Lophatherum Herb,

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,520
and Phragmites Rhizome.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,440
She named all those ingredients.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,440
Zelan is impressive.

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,360
Exactly.

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,280
Impressive.

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,120
So impressive.

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,040
Exactly.

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,280
Why is she not answering?

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,240
- Why hesitate?
- Exactly.

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,880
It's beyond her ability.

25
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,800
That's right.

26
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,120
She's not a match for Zeyan.

27
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,960
Yes.

28
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,600
(You don't know the answer.)

29
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,280
(Turns out that was just luck.)

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,360
The second and third bowls of medicine

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,640
are both Lonicera and Forsythia

32
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,120
with the same ingredients.

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,240
How's that possible?

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,760
How could they be the same?

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,720
Rong Zelan,

36
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,000
they have different colors.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
How could they
all be Lonicera and Forsythia?

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,160
If you can't answer, just admit it.

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,280
Don't make things up
and embarrass yourself.

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,560
If you don't believe it,

41
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,120
taste them yourself.

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,080
The three bowls of medicine

43
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,520
taste different.

44
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,960
One with sweetness,

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,040
one with bitterness,

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,200
and one with spiciness.

47
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,280
How could they be the same formula?

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,120
Sister, it seems you need more practice.

49
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,600
Otherwise,

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,600
you'll humiliate not only yourself

51
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,440
but also the Rong family.

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,080
Miss,

53
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,520
what's your name?

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,000
My Lord,

55
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,560
my name is Zelan.

56
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,840
Tell me,

57
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,480
why did you say
they were the same medicine

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
with different tastes

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,400
and colors?

60
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,470
My Lord,

61
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,760
they taste different

62
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,080
because an ingredient
is from different regions.

63
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,240
The first one used
honeysuckle flowers from Pingyi

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,320
with a fresh taste.

65
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,200
The second one used flowers from Fengqiu

66
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,280
that taste a bit bitter.

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,120
As for the third one,

68
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,200
they're from Julu

69
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,400
and taste spicy.

70
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,560
- How did she know?
- No way!

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
How's that possible?

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,080
How could she tell the difference?

73
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,920
I don't believe it.

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,840
Me neither.

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,940
- No way.
- How could she tell?

76
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,880
Maybe it's true.

77
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,680
Really?

78
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,720
Young as she is,

79
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,640
she's really knowledgeable.

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,720
She can even tell the different origins

81
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,400
of the same ingredient.

82
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,080
In this competition,

83
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,560
Miss Zelan

84
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,040
won.

85
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,390
Great!

86
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,310
Great!

87
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,920
Great!

88
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,800
Great!

89
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,880
I'm truly impressed.

90
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,000
No way! You must've cheated!

91
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,440
Rong Zeyan, are you being a sore loser

92
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,640
and trying to slander me?

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
You certainly cheated!

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,080
I've always outperformed you.

95
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,880
How could you
suddenly become so capable?

96
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,040
Dad!

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,760
Dad, Mom,

98
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,160
Zelan must've cheated!

99
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,000
She doesn't even know the Hundred Herbs.

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,600
How could she suddenly perform so well?

101
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,160
Thank you, Sister.

102
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,560
I'm always this good.

103
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,520
You accuse me of cheating.

104
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,800
Do you have proof?

105
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,090
I don't care!

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,080
You cheated!

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,440
(This jinx has lost her taste,)

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,240
(yet she named all the ingredients.)

109
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,160
(What trick did she play?)

110
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,760
Zelan,

111
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,160
since there is doubt,

112
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,560
why don't you

113
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,560
have a rematch

114
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,680
with Zeyan?

115
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,480
I've won the competition.

116
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,360
Why a rematch?

117
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,560
Minister Wu,

118
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,320
now that the candidate has doubts,

119
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
why don't we do a rematch?

120
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,680
This is about the future
of your children,

121
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,800
so you should be

122
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,920
the ones to decide.

123
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,080
That's right.

124
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,520
Lord Wu is right.

125
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
Then let's have a rematch.

126
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,040
Okay, we'll have a rematch.

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,040
If I win again,

128
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,960
I'll be the medical attendant,

129
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,600
and no one

130
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,760
can doubt me again.

131
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,320
Okay.

132
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,120
It's a deal.

133
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,120
Make some preparations.

134
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,560
The next test

135
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,520
is about...

136
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,360
Aye.

137
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,320
Go.

138
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,920
(Zhang Yueyao,)

139
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,200
(I wonder what tricks you'll play.)

140
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,120
Young Lord,

141
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
come on.

142
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,160
You need to help me...

143
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,240
Okay?

144
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,520
No problem.

145
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,120
Such a good boy.

146
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,840
Zeyan, Zelan,

147
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,440
come and name the ingredients

148
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,720
of the two bowls of herbal medicine.

149
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,920
Wait.

150
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,600
You chose first last time.

151
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
For fairness,

152
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,800
I should choose first.

153
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,960
Okay.

154
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,560
You go first.

155
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,880
I'll definitely

156
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,720
crush you this time.

157
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,120
I choose the bowl in front of her.

158
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,080
My Lady, I've arranged everything.

159
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,640
Which one has been tampered with?

160
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,870
Of course,

161
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,320
it's the one in front of Rong Zelan.

162
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,520
Don't drink it!

163
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
What's this?

164
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,560
Idiot,

165
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,120
I just pissed in that bowl!

166
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,440
What?

167
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,600
Who told him to piss in the bowl?

168
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,560
Miss Zeyan just drank urine!

169
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,200
You knew it was urine.

170
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,120
Why didn't you stop me

171
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,990
but let me drink

172
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,600
something so disgusting?

173
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
I just wanted to prove

174
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,440
that Rong Zelan has no sense of taste.

175
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,000
You could've proved it

176
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
another way.

177
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,560
Why would you do this?

178
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,200
Miss Zelan has no sense of taste!

179
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,080
What's going on?

180
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,210
How do you know

181
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,080
I lost my sense of taste?

182
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,720
You knew I lost my sense of taste,

183
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
so you set up

184
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,200
this tasting contest,

185
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,600
right?

186
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,160
They're way out of line.

187
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,080
This is so unfair to Miss Zelan.

188
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,680
They've gone too far!

189
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,680
Ten years ago, someone poisoned me.

190
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,520
I nearly lost my sense of taste.

191
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,680
Poison?

192
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,040
Fortunately, I found out in time

193
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,000
and saved myself.

194
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,160
All these years,
I've been collecting evidence

195
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,600
to reveal the poisoner.

196
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,280
Today, this person finally slipped up.

197
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,840
Families,

198
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
My Lord, and Elders,

199
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,320
please uphold justice for me.

200
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,200
I can't believe it.

201
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,200
This is outrageous!

202
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,040
How could they do this?

203
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,400
- This is evil!
- Poor girl!

204
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,120
Who would be so vicious?

205
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,960
Who's the poisoner?

206
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,800
I'll help you!

207
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,000
The culprit must be arrested!

208
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,320
It's her,

209
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,720
Zhang Yueyao.

210
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,840
It's her.

211
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,120
How's that possible?

212
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
How could you suspect me?

213
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,520
All these years,

214
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,960
I've been good to you, Zelan.

215
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,640
I've treated you

216
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,040
like my daughter.

217
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,480
How could you slander me?

218
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,560
It's been so hard for me as a stepmother!

219
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,120
My Lord, I'm innocent!

220
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,360
I'm innocent!

221
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,280
My Lord,

222
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,880
I'm innocent!

223
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,280
Rong Zelan,

224
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,480
you've gone too far this time.

225
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,800
Your mother has always been
a kind person.

226
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,120
How could she do something so evil?

227
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,840
Tao,

228
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
come over.

229
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,840
(Tao)
Greetings, Head, Elder.

230
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,600
Tao,

231
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,440
(Ten Years Ago)
I heard your mother is ill

232
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,640
and urgently needs money.

233
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,960
Do me a favor,

234
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,160
and you'll have
as much silver as you want.

235
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,080
I'm willing

236
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
to do anything.

237
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,760
Prepare the medicine
based on the prescription

238
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,960
and mix it into Rong Zelan's daily meals.

239
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,800
Once she loses her sense of taste,

240
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,960
you'll get

241
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,440
all the silver.

242
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,080
My Lady,

243
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,160
I'll definitely complete the mission.

244
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,280
Ten years ago,

245
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,600
I was a first-tier maid
serving Lady Yueyao.

246
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,080
Back then,

247
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
she ordered me

248
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,200
to poison Miss Zelan's daily meals,

249
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,080
trying to ruin her sense of taste.

250
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
Slander!

251
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,360
This is slander!

252
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,040
You're talking nonsense!

253
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,200
How can you prove

254
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,240
that I gave the order?

255
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
My Lady,

256
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,440
are you trying to deny

257
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,960
the nasty things you did?

258
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,240
This is the prescription you wrote.

259
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,360
(Radix Aconiti Agrestis, Rhizoma Drynariae)
After I poisoned the meals,

260
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,040
you ordered me to burn the prescription.

261
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,440
As insurance,

262
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,280
I secretly kept it.

263
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,640
I was soon discovered

264
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,560
feeding Miss Zelan spoiled food

265
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,400
and sold to others,

266
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,960
so the prescription was preserved.

267
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,030
My Lord,

268
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,560
don't believe this filthy maid!

269
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,560
I once scolded her
for a mistake she made,

270
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,930
so she has been

271
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
holding grudges
and plotting to frame me!

272
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,300
My Lord!

273
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,840
This is your handwriting!

274
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,680
No!

275
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,760
I didn't do it!

276
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,880
Please trust me!

277
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,760
How could I ever harm your daughter?

278
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,840
My Lord!

279
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I'm innocent!

280
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,240
This is such a big scandal.

281
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,040
What a disgrace!

282
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
We've got the evidence and the witness.

283
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,640
Are you still trying to deny it?

284
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,000
Crying,

285
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,880
you're always crying!

286
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,040
What's the use?

287
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,320
If people

288
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,560
know about this,

289
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,080
our family's reputation will be ruined!

290
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,240
Rong Chengde,

291
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,960
you have to be responsible for this.

292
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,480
Otherwise, I'll remove your position!

293
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,360
Someone!

294
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,400
Take Zhang Yueyao down

295
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,680
and give her 20 strokes!

296
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,080
She's no longer in charge and shall be

297
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,040
grounded for a month!

298
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,320
My Lord!

299
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,360
I'm innocent!

300
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,920
My Lord, I'm innocent!

301
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,760
My Lord, how could you do this to me?

302
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,630
I'm innocent!

303
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
I'm really innocent!

304
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,240
Mom, stop yelling!

305
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,160
You need to face the consequences.

306
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,000
This is shameful.

307
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,880
How are my brother and I

308
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,200
supposed to hold our heads up?

309
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,640
You ungrateful girl.

310
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,630
Didn't I do everything

311
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,160
for your future?

312
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,640
How could you blame me?

313
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,600
Dad, look at her!

314
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,160
It's all your fault, you jinx!

315
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,640
I should've beaten you to death!

316
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,000
Now you've turned

317
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,960
everything

318
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,400
upside down!

319
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,440
What's that got to do with me?

320
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,520
You had it coming.

321
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,600
You...

322
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,980
(Rong Mansion)

323
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,860
Chengde,

324
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,920
you can go back.

325
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,280
Lord Wu,

326
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm so sorry

327
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,920
for the trouble.

328
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,880
It's all because

329
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,240
you want your children to succeed.

330
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,760
Zelan is really talented.

331
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,080
Given how she recognized the herbs,

332
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,280
she's probably

333
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,880
better than us.

334
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,640
We must not waste her talent.

335
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,930
Lord Wu,

336
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840
don't worry.

337
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,920
I'll send her to
the Imperial Medical Bureau

338
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,080
as a medical attendant
on behalf of our family

339
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,480
so she can learn from you

340
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,720
and gain experience.

341
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,960
Zelan,

342
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,160
the physician's robe carries

343
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
the weight of life and death.

344
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,880
Once you're ready,

345
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,840
we'll be glad to have you as one of us.

346
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,040
Lord Wu,

347
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,840
I've been determined to become
a physician since childhood.

348
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,640
My biggest dream

349
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,640
is to save lives
and relieve people's pain.

350
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,720
I've been ready for a long time,

351
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,040
and I will be worthy of
my patients' trust.

352
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,000
Zelan,

353
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,040
I'll be waiting for you.

354
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,840
Deal.

355
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,420
(Tablet of the Beloved Mother, Lady Liu)

356
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,600
Mom,

357
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,280
I have good news to tell you.

358
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,360
I'm going to be a medical attendant.

359
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,500
(Tablet of the Beloved Mother, Lady Liu)
These years,

360
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,840
I've endured all the hardships

361
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,440
just for this moment.

362
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,080
- Zhang Yueyao was afraid
- Miss Zelan,

363
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,000
- I'd overshadow Rong Zeyan.
- your favorite pastries.

364
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,640
For the future of her daughter,

365
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,600
she even poisoned me.

366
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,760
It's good!

367
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,400
To survive,

368
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
I pretended to swallow

369
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,320
the poisoned food sent by her maid.

370
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,600
After Tao left,

371
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,320
I forced myself to vomit

372
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,920
and saved my sense of taste.

373
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,920
After Tao completed the mission,

374
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,680
find an opportunity

375
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
to finish her.

376
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,480
Only dead bodies don't speak.

377
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,120
When I found out
she wanted to shut Tao's mouth for good,

378
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,520
- I realized I had to protect Tao
- Try this.

379
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,320
so that I could turn the tables one day.

380
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,920
So, I ate the spoiled pastries

381
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,440
right where my aunt would pass by

382
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,600
- and got Tao sold to another family
- Guards!

383
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,680
- before Zhang Yueyao could kill her.
- Sold her!

384
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,520
After Tao was sold,

385
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,520
I spent a long time searching for her

386
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,640
and bought her freedom

387
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,720
so that one day,

388
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,880
I could testify against Zhang Yueyao.

389
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,860
(Tablet of the Beloved Mother, Lady Liu)

390
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,560
Mom,

391
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,840
now you're watching me from heaven.

392
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,080
You'll see

393
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,760
how I will prove your innocence
and clear your name

394
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,680
after going to the palace.

395
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,600
For those

396
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,480
who stood by and watched you die,

397
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,440
I will make every one of them
pay the price!
