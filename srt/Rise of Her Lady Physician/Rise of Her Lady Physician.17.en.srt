00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,980
=Rise of Her Lady Physician=

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,340
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,940
=I Can Expel You from the Palace=

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,440
I'll boldly ask some questions.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,400
Have you been coughing, sneezing,

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,600
or finding it

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,280
hard to control urination when hearing

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,480
the sound of running water,

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,960
even with things falling out
from the genitals

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,840
and difficulty in urination sometimes?

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,080
How dare you?

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,680
You...

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,160
How dare you pry into my privacy?

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,760
Your Majesty, please calm down.

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,840
I'm asking these questions

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,280
because I suspect
that the illness is uterine prolapse.

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,120
Your Majesty, you're not the only one
who suffers from this.

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Many women suffer from it too.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,500
It often occurs
after a woman gives birth to children

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,800
without proper care and nourishment.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,960
Your Majesty, you're a noble lady,

22
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,940
and everything you use
is of the finest quality.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,880
However, you've worked hard for the state

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,840
and neglected the care of your own body.

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,360
That is why you got this illness.

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,200
Are you telling

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,520
the truth?

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,680
Of course.

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,160
This is a common ailment among women.

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,760
I'm

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,960
a proud woman

32
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,040
who's maintained dignity all my life.

33
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,040
But now I'm troubled by
urinary incontinence.

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,480
It is truly embarrassing.

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,200
That is why I don't want others to know.

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,760
Please rest assured.

37
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,320
As long as you rest well

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,160
and receive treatment,

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,880
you will fully recover.

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,560
However, I need to come close
to take your pulse

41
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,040
so that I can confirm
if it's really uterine prolapse.

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,760
Come forward.

43
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,320
Your Majesty.

44
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,560
It's indeed uterine prolapse.

45
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,440
The cause is now clear.

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,080
I will tell Minister Wu the details,

47
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,680
and he'll surely be able to
cure your illness.

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Allow me to take my leave.

49
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,160
Wait.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,680
Although it's a common condition
among women,

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,680
there is a distinction
between men and women.

52
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,520
For such a matter of privacy,

53
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,880
I really can't let a male physician

54
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,160
to inquire and treat me.

55
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,680
Your Majesty,

56
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,840
I'm just a medical attendant.

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,240
I shouldn't have done this,

58
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,480
but I cannot bear to see you
suffer such torment.

59
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,560
I have a suggestion.

60
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,520
I wonder if you can accept it.

61
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,600
What is it?

62
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Quickly tell me.

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,040
Your illness requires warm nourishment.

64
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,200
Apply moxibustion therapy
to warm the uterus,

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,320
combine it with the Five-Animal Frolics
to balance Qi,

66
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,680
and supplement with gelatin
and angelica soup for dietary therapy,

67
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,430
and it may be cured.

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,520
Your Majesty, if you trust me,

69
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm willing to give it a try.

70
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,200
I heard

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,960
you once cured

72
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,360
the princess's pica disorder

73
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,400
and resolved
the smallpox crisis in the palace.

74
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,160
Do you really

75
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,840
have confidence this time?

76
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,720
I will try my best.

77
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
Then I'll

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,040
trust you this time.

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,960
Your Majesty,

80
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,840
I've decided

81
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,640
to fully entrust my treatment

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,230
and recuperation

83
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,680
to Rong Zelan.

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,320
Mother,

85
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,560
are you sure?

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,560
Your Majesty, please think twice!

87
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,520
You are of noble and precious status.

88
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,320
How could a medical attendant treat you?

89
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,520
It's inappropriate.

90
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,960
Your Majesty, please allow us
to take the pulse

91
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,480
and provide treatment.

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,240
Who are you to

93
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,080
comment on my illness?

94
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,810
Your Majesty,

95
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,680
Empress Dowager,

96
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,240
Rong Zelan is just a medical attendant
who only knows superficial medicine.

97
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,320
How could she treat
Her Majesty's illness?

98
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,520
Absolutely not.

99
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,160
Absolutely not.

100
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,080
Your Majesty,

101
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,720
this is indeed inappropriate.

102
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,880
If Rong Zelan has to do this,

103
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,200
I'm

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,320
willing to assist alongside.

105
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,600
All of you, shut up!

106
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,720
I've

107
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,360
made up my mind.

108
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,240
From now on,

109
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,880
I'll only use Rong Zelan.

110
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Rong Zelan,

111
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,920
now Her Majesty's health
is entrusted to you.

112
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,920
If anything happens,

113
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,320
can you be responsible?

114
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,840
Rong Zelan,

115
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,040
she is my

116
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,000
beloved mother.

117
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,740
If anything happens to her

118
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,000
under your care,

119
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,480
you must understand

120
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,920
that all your family's lives
wouldn't be enough to make up for it.

121
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,600
If you

122
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,120
cure my mother,

123
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,720
I will reward you

124
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,880
with whatever you want.

125
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm willing to swear on my life.

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,920
Your Majesty, please allow me to

127
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,360
stay in the bureau

128
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,800
if I cure Her Majesty.

129
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,760
Granted.

130
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

131
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,240
Your Grace.

132
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,040
I've heard,

133
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,440
you have great expertise in medicine.

134
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,800
So, I want you to

135
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
make a calming incense for me.

136
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,040
This is the Ice-Marrow Spice tribute
from the western regions

137
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,800
bestowed by His Majesty.

138
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,200
You may select suitable ingredients

139
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,560
and make

140
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,800
a calming incense for me.

141
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,720
Your Grace.

142
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,560
Although I'm a first-class
medical attendant,

143
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,120
I can only assist in diagnosis

144
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,440
and can't prepare medicine.

145
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,360
It is handled by imperial physicians.

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
Your Grace,
please find another physician.

147
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,240
How dare you?

148
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,880
Rong Zelan,

149
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,560
I'm asking with good intentions,

150
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,440
yet you keep making excuses.

151
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,240
Have you been

152
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,840
holding a grudge against me

153
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,640
for casting you out earlier?

154
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,000
I wouldn't dare.

155
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,360
An attendant is forbidden

156
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,200
from preparing medicine.

157
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
I'll be expelled from the palace.

158
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,240
Your Grace, please understand.

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,920
If nothing else,

160
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,800
I shall take my leave.

161
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,680
Stop!

162
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,320
Rong Zelan,

163
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,960
this is an order.

164
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,600
If you refuse,

165
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,160
it'll be an offense
against your superior.

166
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
I can still expel you from the palace.

167
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,320
If that's the case,

168
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,960
I will give it a try.

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,640
Your Grace, please don't tell others.

170
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,960
- You...
- You clumsy maid!

171
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,920
How dare you

172
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,640
damage the Ice-Marrow Spice?

173
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,680
Do you realize your crime?

174
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,720
I'm so sorry!

175
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,000
Your Grace, have mercy!

176
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,360
Your Grace, since you have things to do,

177
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,000
I shall take my leave.

178
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,240
Zelan!

179
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,460
Lord Wu.

180
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,330
Has Her Majesty

181
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,840
gotten better these days?

182
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,230
My Lord,

183
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,800
Her Majesty is obviously getting better.

184
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,600
If we keep nursing her

185
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,960
with the current prescription,

186
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,560
she will recover very soon.

187
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,560
That's good.

188
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,200
Thank you

189
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,440
for your hard work.

190
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,120
It is my duty.

191
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,360
(Her Majesty is starting
to like Rong Zelan.)

192
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,800
(If she reports Feng Yin's
spreading of the plague,)

193
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,920
(our family will be doomed.)

194
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,000
(Su Ye has been eliminated,)

195
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,000
(and you're the next.)

196
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,720
(Whoever knows this must die.)

197
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,080
Your Majesty,

198
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,320
the banquet is coming.

199
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,800
These are the accessories
sent by the Palace Secretariat.

200
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,960
Take a look.

201
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,360
Girl.

202
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,840
Come here

203
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,080
and take a look for me.

204
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,960
What should I wear

205
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,960
for the palace banquet?

206
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,880
These jewels

207
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,560
are dazzling to the eyes.

208
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,800
Your Majesty, your Moonlit Brocade Dress

209
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,160
matches best with this
Gold Hair Ornament.

210
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
The butterfly tassel

211
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,140
makes you even more distinguished.

212
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,890
Young people do have better tastes.

213
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,320
Then I'll pick this one.

214
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,280
Thank you

215
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,000
for your hard work.

216
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,480
I can finally sleep well now.

217
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,720
Bring that

218
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,320
jade hairpin over.

219
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,840
Let her try it on.

220
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,480
Please don't.

221
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,080
I'm only fulfilling my duty.

222
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,200
Don't reject me,

223
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,680
or I'll be angry.

224
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,920
Thanks, Your Majesty.

225
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,800
You are so clever.

226
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm afraid you didn't enter the palace

227
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,640
just to practice medicine, right?
